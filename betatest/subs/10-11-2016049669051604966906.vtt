3
00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.956
- Hi. thank you.
- Hi. that's all right.

4
00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.224
If you could get changed.

5
00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:19.591
and then I'll see
you for handover.

6
00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.326
All right. cool. see ya.

7
00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.295
See you downstairs.

8
00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:23.328
Thank you.

9
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:29.035
I never
really liked going to school.

10
00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:33.906
but one thing I
enjoyed was physics.

11
00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:38.845
Newton's first law

12
00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:41.479
states an object
will remain at rest

13
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.050
or in uniform motion
in a straight line.

14
00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.986
unless acted upon by
an external force.

15
00:05:10.202 --> 00:05:11.003
Hey. Katerina.

16
00:05:11.037 --> 00:05:12.238
Hi.

17
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.438
Thanks for coming.

18
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:15.007
How are you doing?

19
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:16.175
Yeah. all right.

20
00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:17.944
- Feeling okay?
- Yeah.

21
00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:19.011
Settling in all right?

22
00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:20.646
Yeah.

23
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.349
Good. so maybe I
want to speak to you

24
00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:25.985
about one of the patients in
particular that we've got.

25
00:05:26.018 --> 00:05:29.855
Natasha Wong. she's got
lung cancer with brain mets.

26
00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.992
Over the last 12 hours
she's been quite breathless.

27
00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:35.294
She's had a fair amount of pain.

28
00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:37.997
and I think we just need
to manage her expectations

29
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.933
with regards to why she's here.

30
00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:44.370
and the fact that death is
probably quite imminent.

31
00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:47.605
She also would really
like to go home.

32
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.843
so I think we'd have to
ask the Medical Board

33
00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:52.577
if that was advisable.

34
00:05:53.713 --> 00:05:55.580
At the moment. it
doesn't look like it.

35
00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:59.418
So. she's probably our
priority patient at the moment.

36
00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:03.555
The others are in
12. 13. and 14.

37
00:06:03.588 --> 00:06:05.623
and then Natasha is in 18.

38
00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:07.026
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

39
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.663
- That should be good.
- Brilliant. brilliant.

40
00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:11.664
See you outside.

41
00:06:11.697 --> 00:06:13.132
See you around.

42
00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:38.324
Morning.

43
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:40.026
Hi.

44
00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:42.661
How are you?

45
00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:44.730
All right. Lisa said
I'm with you all day.

46
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.033
That's nice!

47
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.102
Did Lisa tell you that
Ted is coming today.

48
00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:53.005
He's coming about 12 o'clock.

49
00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.206
Yeah. she mentioned it.

50
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.409
'Cause we have the
meeting with Dr. Haner.

51
00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:57.943
Oh. do you?

52
00:06:57.977 --> 00:07:01.414
We wanted to talk about
potentially me going home

53
00:07:01.447 --> 00:07:02.882
in the next few days.

54
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.121
It's so weird. I've
been feeling...

55
00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:10.523
Well. it's weird
and it's not weird.

56
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:14.592
I've been feeling so
much better recently and

57
00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:17.396
miracles happen.

58
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.932
So. I've decided
I'm just gonna focus

59
00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:23.568
on what I want. and be positive.

60
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.442
I feel like being here...

61
00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:44.589
It's really hard
to stay positive.

62
00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:49.995
It's okay.

63
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:51.130
I want children.

64
00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:53.766
I've got so much ahead of me.

65
00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:57.602
and I just feel here
it's holding me back.

66
00:07:57.636 --> 00:08:01.240
and making me feel
like I can't have that.

67
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.408
It's like I'm fighting.

68
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.713
I just feel like if
I get out of here.

69
00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:10.850
I'll be able to focus
on being positive.

70
00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:13.519
and look into adoption.

71
00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:16.122
I know I can't have my own
children but maybe I can adopt.

72
00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:17.256
- You know?
- Yeah.

73
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.062
Yeah. so I'm
hoping that Dr. Haner

74
00:08:24.597 --> 00:08:26.065
will

75
00:08:26.098 --> 00:08:26.932
help us

76
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:31.470
to go on that journey.

77
00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:32.338
Okay.

78
00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:37.109
Natasha. first of all I gotta
say I love your attitude.

79
00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:40.246
It's so important
to stay positive.

80
00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:43.249
to do all of these
exercises that you're doing.

81
00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:44.483
Honestly. it's so great.

82
00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:47.386
About going home. obviously

83
00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:49.622
it does have to go
through the Medical Board.

84
00:08:51.056 --> 00:08:54.960
'cause there is a possibility
that you might not go home.

85
00:08:54.994 --> 00:08:57.363
at least not right now. anyway.

86
00:08:57.396 --> 00:08:58.898
So. do you want us to look into

87
00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:02.234
what can we do to give you
the best quality of life...

88
00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:03.936
Do you want
children. Katerina?

89
00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:07.706
Kids?

90
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.574
Yeah.

91
00:09:11.277 --> 00:09:12.878
Yes.

92
00:09:12.912 --> 00:09:15.481
What would you
like. a boy or a girl?

93
00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:17.616
If I could choose

94
00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:19.952
it sounds so horrible but I
think a boy would be easier.

95
00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:22.755
Oh my God. me too!

96
00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:24.223
They're more fun.

97
00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:27.059
and we both. Ted
and I want two boys.

98
00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:28.060
Two. God!

99
00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:31.830
And I think going home
to prepare for all that.

100
00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:34.266
rather than being in here.

101
00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:36.502
feeling like I'm gonna die.

102
00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.039
I did notice when I walked in

103
00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:42.274
that you've got a new
painting right here.

104
00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:46.312
That's actually a
painting from a picture.

105
00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:49.181
I took a picture
in South Africa.

106
00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:50.416
What?

107
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:51.685
You have to go.
it's incredible.

108
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:54.386
The people are so
nice and you know.

109
00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:58.324
I really want to go.

110
00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:00.993
I'm gonna go in to the doctor.

111
00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:02.428
and ask what he gave
you this morning

112
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.295
just to see

113
00:10:05.231 --> 00:10:07.634
see what you having
in you already.

114
00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:09.335
And then maybe talk to him

115
00:10:09.368 --> 00:10:11.103
about getting you just
a little something

116
00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:13.339
to get you through to lunch.
if that's okay with you.

117
00:10:13.372 --> 00:10:14.907
Okay.

118
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.342
Do you need anything else?

119
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.912
Maybe. some more biscuits.

120
00:10:21.213 --> 00:10:23.282
It's that kind of
day. we need sugar.

121
00:10:25.517 --> 00:10:26.418
Yeah.

122
00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:27.620
Okay. I'll see you later then.

123
00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:28.988
Okay. thank you. Katerina.

124
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:29.855
Thank you.

125
00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:26.312
Hi.

126
00:11:26.345 --> 00:11:27.212
Hi.

127
00:11:27.246 --> 00:11:28.047
How are you doing?

128
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.981
All right.

129
00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:30.382
You're from Norway. right?

130
00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:31.483
Yes. I am. hi.
Katerina Nielson.

131
00:11:31.517 --> 00:11:33.252
Hi. I'm Miguel.

132
00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.353
Nice to meet you.

133
00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:36.656
I'm the IPU leader.

134
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.923
Hi. nice to meet you.

135
00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:40.292
Listen. I'm excellent
with all the work I do.

136
00:11:40.326 --> 00:11:41.460
It's best you come to me.

137
00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.262
if you need any
advice with drugs. or

138
00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:46.565
where to go after work.

139
00:11:46.598 --> 00:11:48.500
That's good to
know. and it's good

140
00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:50.602
that you know what
you are good at.

141
00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:52.137
Yeah. actually I do.

142
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.172
Thank you very much.

143
00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:55.742
You're welcome. Miguel.

144
00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:57.242
Yeah. Miguel from Spain

145
00:11:57.276 --> 00:11:59.278
where Rafael Nadal is from. pow!

146
00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:00.814
That's cool.

147
00:12:00.846 --> 00:12:04.083
Listen. I finish work at
the same time as you today.

148
00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:05.918
If you need a
partner for the bus.

149
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:07.152
I have a spare Oyster card.

150
00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:09.555
and the local
power. they know me.

151
00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:11.957
That sounds so
amazing. but I think

152
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.793
actually I'm gonna walk today.

153
00:12:13.827 --> 00:12:14.761
Yeah.

154
00:12:14.794 --> 00:12:16.328
It's all right.

155
00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:17.764
But. thank you.
though. thank you.

156
00:12:17.797 --> 00:12:18.597
No problem.

157
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:20.065
You're welcome.

158
00:12:20.099 --> 00:12:21.266
See you around.

159
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.469
Bye.

160
00:12:23.502 --> 00:12:24.336
You again.

161
00:12:25.772 --> 00:12:27.005
Hey. Nick. how
you are you doing?

162
00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:29.141
When are you going to shave?

163
00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:31.678
When it goes out of fashion.

164
00:12:58.504 --> 00:12:59.304
Come in.

165
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:02.876
Hi.

166
00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:03.710
Hello.

167
00:13:04.778 --> 00:13:05.678
What are you doing?

168
00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:07.881
Just cleaning up in here.

169
00:13:07.913 --> 00:13:09.281
Where's Natasha?

170
00:13:09.314 --> 00:13:10.215
She's died.

171
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:13.185
Oh.

172
00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:14.052
Okay.

173
00:13:18.624 --> 00:13:21.593
But she just seemed
so fine two days ago.

174
00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:23.429
It sometimes happens.

175
00:13:23.462 --> 00:13:25.330
Okay. okay.

176
00:13:25.364 --> 00:13:26.265
Okay.

177
00:13:26.298 --> 00:13:27.132
Are you okay?

178
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.636
Yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

179
00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:32.371
Do you need to take five?

180
00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:36.241
Yeah. I'll just step
out. just grab some air.

181
00:13:36.275 --> 00:13:37.109
Okay.

182
00:14:17.382 --> 00:14:18.183
Hey.

183
00:14:19.652 --> 00:14:20.519
Hi.

184
00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:21.688
How are you doing?

185
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:25.157
Okay.

186
00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:28.494
First ones are
never easy. you know?

187
00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:37.069
No. no. they're not.

188
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.039
You'll get used to it.

189
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:43.475
Will I?

190
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:44.343
Yeah.

191
00:14:45.712 --> 00:14:46.880
You're allowed to feel.

192
00:14:49.114 --> 00:14:50.115
It's totally normal.

193
00:14:52.084 --> 00:14:52.986
If you didn't feel like that.

194
00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.286
you'd be in the wrong job.

195
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:01.126
Yeah. that's true.

196
00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:04.329
She was young. wasn't she?

197
00:15:06.098 --> 00:15:06.933
Yeah.

198
00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:11.236
Way too young.

199
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.705
It's a lesson for us.

200
00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:17.609
Get out there and
live your life.

201
00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:20.980
You just never know.

202
00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:28.387
I'm Nick. by the way.

203
00:15:29.288 --> 00:15:30.857
Hi.

204
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.491
I'm Katerina.

205
00:15:32.524 --> 00:15:33.458
Nice to meet you.

206
00:15:33.492 --> 00:15:35.394
Nice to meet you. too.

207
00:15:35.427 --> 00:15:36.461
Outside of a lift.

208
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:39.464
Take your time.

209
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.334
See you.

210
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.358
The second he spoke.

211
00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:10.063
I remember having
slightly more interest

212
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.965
than I usually would
with a stranger.

213
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.154
My journal.

214
00:16:37.322 --> 00:16:39.591
where I go when I need
to escape a little bit.

215
00:19:12.477 --> 00:19:15.280
And like a sixth sense.

216
00:19:16.182 --> 00:19:17.582
something awoke in my brain.

217
00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:19.152
I'll bring it
back to you later.

218
00:19:19.185 --> 00:19:20.019
- Okay.
- Thank you.

219
00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:27.994
Hi.

220
00:19:28.027 --> 00:19:29.394
Hey.

221
00:19:29.427 --> 00:19:30.495
What are you doing?

222
00:19:31.363 --> 00:19:32.932
I'm just taking a quick break.

223
00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:35.567
How are you feeling today?

224
00:19:38.137 --> 00:19:39.304
I feel a lot better.

225
00:19:39.337 --> 00:19:41.606
I was worried about you.

226
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:42.642
Thank you.

227
00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:47.479
I was meaning to say

228
00:19:47.512 --> 00:19:48.714
that I've got a spare helmet.

229
00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:51.217
if you want to a have a
spin on the motorbike.

230
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.985
get some fresh air.
clear the mind.

231
00:19:55.254 --> 00:19:56.088
Okay.

232
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.992
I do actually have
an Oyster card.

233
00:20:00.026 --> 00:20:01.359
Oh. the Oyster card.

234
00:20:01.393 --> 00:20:04.529
I realise that's really
important in this place.

235
00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:05.665
Let's take a ride.

236
00:20:05.698 --> 00:20:07.465
Extremely important.

237
00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.069
If you change your mind.
sort of want some fresh air.

238
00:20:12.672 --> 00:20:13.505
Yeah. okay.

239
00:20:14.907 --> 00:20:17.310
Have you changed your mind?

240
00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:19.145
Okay.

241
00:20:20.412 --> 00:20:21.914
What time do you finish?

242
00:20:21.948 --> 00:20:23.115
Same as you.

243
00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:25.350
I'll

244
00:20:27.586 --> 00:20:28.688
see you then.

245
00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:30.488
See you.

246
00:20:31.791 --> 00:20:32.992
Bye.

247
00:21:01.287 --> 00:21:03.155
I
swear I wasn't looking for it.

248
00:21:04.957 --> 00:21:06.225
Was I?

249
00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:36.656
Thank you.

250
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:38.124
You're welcome.

251
00:21:39.058 --> 00:21:40.393
Here.

252
00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:41.794
Why don't you just keep it?

253
00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:44.263
Okay.

254
00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:53.039
I guess I'll see you
tomorrow at work then.

255
00:21:56.742 --> 00:21:58.978
Do you want to come
in and have some water?

256
00:21:59.011 --> 00:22:00.478
Some water?

257
00:22:00.512 --> 00:22:04.884
Yeah.

258
00:22:04.917 --> 00:22:05.651
Sure.

259
00:22:16.395 --> 00:22:17.196
Cheers.

260
00:22:17.229 --> 00:22:18.064
Cheers.

261
00:22:25.037 --> 00:22:27.073
So what about
you. mystery nurse?

262
00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:29.976
What's your story?

263
00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:30.810
My story?

264
00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:31.677
Yeah.

265
00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:34.413
What do you mean?

266
00:22:34.447 --> 00:22:37.549
Do you have any special
someones in your life.

267
00:22:37.582 --> 00:22:39.819
or a wife. girlfriend?

268
00:22:39.852 --> 00:22:41.320
I was with
someone for a while.

269
00:22:41.354 --> 00:22:43.356
but it didn't work
out. so you know.

270
00:22:44.724 --> 00:22:46.192
Okay.

271
00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:47.226
Married. or?

272
00:22:48.227 --> 00:22:49.729
You ask a lot of questions.

273
00:22:53.466 --> 00:22:54.266
How old are you?

274
00:22:56.202 --> 00:22:57.003
I'm 25.

275
00:22:58.471 --> 00:22:59.438
Okay. I'm gonna leave.

276
00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:00.906
Why?

277
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.141
Why. how old are you?

278
00:23:02.174 --> 00:23:03.175
I'm older than you.

279
00:23:06.078 --> 00:23:06.912
By how much?

280
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.351
You're dangerous. you are.

281
00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:20.659
No. I'm not dangerous.

282
00:23:24.997 --> 00:23:26.265
This could get awkward.

283
00:23:31.804 --> 00:23:33.739
It's already awkward.

284
00:23:40.146 --> 00:23:41.013
Why. what?

285
00:23:41.047 --> 00:23:42.348
What are you doing?

286
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:43.482
Nothing. apparently.

287
00:23:46.218 --> 00:23:47.019
I really should go.

288
00:23:47.053 --> 00:23:48.687
Come and stay. please.

289
00:24:09.475 --> 00:24:10.543
Okay. I should go.

290
00:24:10.575 --> 00:24:11.477
Why?

291
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.411
Because we work together.

292
00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:13.345
and this is not a good idea.

293
00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:14.880
What are you so worried about?

294
00:24:18.884 --> 00:24:22.321
Come on. Nick. it's
just you and me here.

295
00:24:26.525 --> 00:24:28.661
Come on. what's wrong?

296
00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:29.528
It's okay.

297
00:24:31.897 --> 00:24:32.731
It's okay.

298
00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:36.535
It's okay.

299
00:24:39.604 --> 00:24:40.673
I gotta go.

300
00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:45.044
I'm gonna see you at work.

301
00:24:47.046 --> 00:24:47.880
Okay.

302
00:24:53.752 --> 00:24:55.488
Are you going?

303
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:57.289
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

304
00:24:59.825 --> 00:25:00.659
Okay.

305
00:25:06.365 --> 00:25:07.933
Okay.

306
00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:08.801
Bye.

307
00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:35.261
KATERINA
VOICEOVER: It's funny

308
00:25:35.294 --> 00:25:36.795
but I knew he would come back.

309
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:21.040
What are you doing?

310
00:26:21.073 --> 00:26:22.041
I don't know.

311
00:27:09.656 --> 00:27:10.489
Hey.

312
00:27:10.522 --> 00:27:11.357
Hey.

313
00:27:13.693 --> 00:27:14.793
I didn't want to wake you.

314
00:27:14.827 --> 00:27:16.128
- I was just...
- Oh no. it's fine.

315
00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:16.996
It's fine.

316
00:27:18.797 --> 00:27:21.233
Thanks for letting me stay.

317
00:27:23.202 --> 00:27:24.370
My pleasure.

318
00:27:29.208 --> 00:27:31.678
I don't think we should
say anything at work.

319
00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:33.647
Okay.

320
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:37.149
You know. one-night stands...

321
00:27:37.182 --> 00:27:37.983
Okay. I get it.

322
00:27:38.017 --> 00:27:39.218
Aren't you leaving?

323
00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:40.219
Yeah. I'm gonna leave.

324
00:27:40.252 --> 00:27:41.086
Okay.

325
00:27:43.757 --> 00:27:44.590
Bye.

326
00:27:46.992 --> 00:27:47.793
Okay.

327
00:27:47.826 --> 00:27:48.827
Okay. bye.

328
00:28:23.062 --> 00:28:24.330
I'm gonna go.

329
00:28:41.681 --> 00:28:43.683
I'm a friend of Katerina.

330
00:28:43.717 --> 00:28:44.550
We just...

331
00:28:45.752 --> 00:28:46.919
You're her flatmate?

332
00:28:46.952 --> 00:28:50.055
Yeah.
this is my apartment.

333
00:28:51.825 --> 00:28:54.193
Nice to meet you.

334
00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:55.027
I should leave.

335
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.395
Cool.

336
00:28:56.428 --> 00:28:57.229
Bye. then.

337
00:28:57.262 --> 00:28:58.097
- Bye.
- Bye.

338
00:30:01.994 --> 00:30:04.196
I think
it was the Italian in him.

339
00:30:04.229 --> 00:30:09.067
He would just show up at
the door without notice.

340
00:30:17.744 --> 00:30:19.746
Want to go for a ride?

341
00:30:23.449 --> 00:30:24.283
Okay.

342
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:35.027
His motorbike was

343
00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.328
very moulded into one.

344
00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:43.235
It was on the back that I
discovered the power of energy.

345
00:30:56.615 --> 00:30:57.616
When were in sync.

346
00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.551
we leaned left and right

347
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.123
as if joined by some invisible
force in a quantum level.

348
00:31:09.863 --> 00:31:11.530
I hated
rollercoasters as a child.

349
00:31:11.563 --> 00:31:13.800
but I was on the most
exciting ride ever.

350
00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:18.103
Without being to strap in.

351
00:33:14.252 --> 00:33:17.824
Did you always
want to be a nurse?

352
00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:22.527
I always knew I
wanted to help people.

353
00:33:24.262 --> 00:33:25.798
Maybe travel the world.

354
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.373
You're too normal for your
own good. you know that?

355
00:33:34.406 --> 00:33:35.942
Why. what did you want to be?

356
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:42.849
I used to dream about being
a pilot when I was a kid.

357
00:33:42.882 --> 00:33:44.349
- Pilot?
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:33:46.786 --> 00:33:48.553
Then what happened?

359
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.692
I got my bike instead.

360
00:33:53.726 --> 00:33:55.160
You settled for a
motorbike. now did you?

361
00:33:55.193 --> 00:33:56.696
I'm not sure I settled.

362
00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:59.431
I feel like I did
something less fun.

363
00:33:59.464 --> 00:34:01.433
Well. it's a very pretty bike.

364
00:34:05.138 --> 00:34:06.839
It would be handy
if you were a pilot.

365
00:34:06.873 --> 00:34:08.473
You could fly me to Africa.

366
00:34:08.507 --> 00:34:09.341
Hmm.

367
00:34:10.877 --> 00:34:12.745
I've got a day off on Sunday.

368
00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:14.881
I can go and get
my pilot's licence.

369
00:34:15.715 --> 00:34:16.515
Hey!

370
00:34:16.548 --> 00:34:17.349
Let's do it.

371
00:34:17.382 --> 00:34:18.483
Yeah.

372
00:34:18.517 --> 00:34:20.687
Or we can go on the motorbike.

373
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.454
We elope all the way to Africa.

374
00:34:22.487 --> 00:34:23.856
Oh. Elope. no!

375
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:25.725
Okay.

376
00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:27.960
All right.

377
00:34:31.463 --> 00:34:32.899
You wanna travel. huh?

378
00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:36.069
Yeah. I do. one day.

379
00:34:38.771 --> 00:34:39.772
I am sure we will.

380
00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:42.441
I'm sure you will.

381
00:34:56.022 --> 00:34:57.556
- Stay here.
- No. no.

382
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:58.390
I need a drink.

383
00:34:58.423 --> 00:34:59.491
No. you don't.

384
00:34:59.524 --> 00:35:00.625
Goodness. it's 7 a.m.

385
00:35:01.794 --> 00:35:02.695
What was that?

386
00:35:02.729 --> 00:35:04.163
I said I miss you already.

387
00:35:04.197 --> 00:35:05.665
Say that again.

388
00:35:07.734 --> 00:35:10.335
Wow. you speak Norwegian.

389
00:35:11.503 --> 00:35:12.772
Okay. please stay.
stay. stay. stay.

390
00:35:14.941 --> 00:35:17.210
Where are you always going?

391
00:35:22.949 --> 00:35:24.449
My days at work turned

392
00:35:24.483 --> 00:35:27.220
into anticipation of fun or
where I will bump into him.

393
00:35:28.453 --> 00:35:30.790
I like that he
won't tell anyone.

394
00:35:30.823 --> 00:35:34.559
It makes this thing.
this game. more fun.

395
00:35:59.252 --> 00:36:02.088
He had a sensitivity

396
00:36:02.121 --> 00:36:03.856
that was easy to connect to.

397
00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.263
- Again?
- Yeah. again.

398
00:36:10.295 --> 00:36:11.396
Come with me.

399
00:36:12.865 --> 00:36:13.666
This one's trouble.

400
00:36:13.699 --> 00:36:14.533
Hi.

401
00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:16.869
She's leaving.

402
00:36:39.558 --> 00:36:41.828
Until
I started asking questions.

403
00:36:45.631 --> 00:36:49.969
Things seemed more important
to him. more serious.

404
00:36:52.004 --> 00:36:53.405
Not something I was used to.

405
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:12.325
This is where I come
to think sometimes.

406
00:37:13.491 --> 00:37:15.628
It's a good place to get
some peace and quiet.

407
00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:19.966
It's nice.

408
00:37:22.802 --> 00:37:23.703
Where do you go?

409
00:37:25.671 --> 00:37:27.273
I don't really
have the need to go out

410
00:37:27.306 --> 00:37:28.540
and think too much.

411
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.945
It's my
Empire State Building.

412
00:37:34.146 --> 00:37:34.981
Okay.

413
00:37:38.084 --> 00:37:41.419
I think I prefer this
over a skyscraper.

414
00:37:47.392 --> 00:37:50.029
You think a lot. don't you?

415
00:37:50.062 --> 00:37:52.131
You spend a lot of
time inside your head.

416
00:37:57.569 --> 00:37:58.838
I try not to.

417
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.187
You know that love

418
00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:17.422
when you can't stop
thinking about somebody?

419
00:38:17.455 --> 00:38:19.191
When you're not with them.
you just want to find them.

420
00:38:21.493 --> 00:38:23.461
When you're with them.
time stands still.

421
00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:27.565
That kind of love.

422
00:38:36.474 --> 00:38:37.944
This is special.

423
00:38:37.977 --> 00:38:40.313
Katerina. this is
really special.

424
00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:42.748
You make me feel alive.

425
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.052
I haven't felt like
this in a long time.

426
00:38:50.555 --> 00:38:52.658
I can feel my soul

427
00:38:52.692 --> 00:38:53.893
and it's because of you.

428
00:39:04.502 --> 00:39:05.638
Take the day off work.

429
00:39:07.206 --> 00:39:08.473
- No.
- Take the day of work.

430
00:39:08.506 --> 00:39:10.776
No. no. I can't. no. no.

431
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.345
No. no. no.

432
00:39:12.378 --> 00:39:13.946
No. I have to go.

433
00:39:15.247 --> 00:39:17.917
When are we going to
do something together?

434
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:18.751
Sure.

435
00:39:18.784 --> 00:39:19.617
Tomorrow?

436
00:39:20.953 --> 00:39:22.388
I'm gonna go away tomorrow.

437
00:39:24.857 --> 00:39:26.225
With me or are you
going on your own?

438
00:39:26.258 --> 00:39:28.394
Just got to do something
but I'll be back.

439
00:39:30.763 --> 00:39:31.563
Okay.

440
00:39:33.332 --> 00:39:34.233
My phone.

441
00:39:42.008 --> 00:39:44.777
Newton's second law states

442
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:47.246
that the acceleration
of an object

443
00:39:47.279 --> 00:39:49.949
is dependent upon two variables.

444
00:39:53.786 --> 00:39:55.520
The net force acting
upon the object

445
00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:03.195
and the mass of
the object itself.

446
00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:14.740
Nice to see you.

447
00:40:19.045 --> 00:40:19.945
Likewise.

448
00:40:41.801 --> 00:40:43.335
I had a feeling you would call.

449
00:40:50.209 --> 00:40:51.177
How have you been?

450
00:40:53.813 --> 00:40:54.612
Good.

451
00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:58.684
You look good.

452
00:40:58.717 --> 00:40:59.752
I feel really good.

453
00:41:03.189 --> 00:41:05.191
That's the longest
time I've been away.

454
00:41:08.461 --> 00:41:09.295
Yeah.

455
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.164
Do you miss me?

456
00:41:18.804 --> 00:41:21.941
I've got something
to tell you.

457
00:41:21.974 --> 00:41:22.875
You can tell me.

458
00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:28.514
I've met somebody
that I really like.

459
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.754
What's her name?

460
00:41:39.258 --> 00:41:40.092
Katerina.

461
00:41:46.765 --> 00:41:48.934
Is that why you're here?

462
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.743
Do you want my
opinion about her?

463
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.481
Happy for you.

464
00:42:09.288 --> 00:42:10.122
Does she know?

465
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:18.330
You have to tell her. though.

466
00:42:18.364 --> 00:42:19.965
you know that. right?

467
00:42:28.908 --> 00:42:31.210
I feel like I have to
tell you something. too.

468
00:42:34.013 --> 00:42:35.181
Okay.

469
00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.927
I'm pregnant.

470
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:04.343
Are you happy with him?

471
00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:05.444
Yes.

472
00:43:13.052 --> 00:43:14.053
It's a girl.

473
00:43:27.099 --> 00:43:29.602
What are you gonna call her?

474
00:43:32.404 --> 00:43:35.007
I wanted to ask you if
you were okay if I would

475
00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:37.443
call her Mia.

476
00:43:44.183 --> 00:43:45.017
Yeah.

477
00:43:51.023 --> 00:43:54.426
That's the only name
I can think about.

478
00:44:00.332 --> 00:44:01.166
She came back.

479
00:44:17.182 --> 00:44:19.785
I am so happy for you.

480
00:44:20.853 --> 00:44:21.854
Thank you.

481
00:44:25.591 --> 00:44:27.293
He might
find it hard at first.

482
00:44:27.326 --> 00:44:28.127
I know.

483
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.528
I know.

484
00:44:29.561 --> 00:44:30.396
I know.

485
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:43.842
I never thought we'd get here.

486
00:44:46.646 --> 00:44:48.080
two separate lives now.

487
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:53.085
You know. I...

488
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.291
I know what happened that
makes you really scared.

489
00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:03.797
I hadn't seen you
like that before.

490
00:45:07.066 --> 00:45:09.568
I couldn't imagine what
it would have been like to

491
00:45:11.437 --> 00:45:14.808
raise a child with
you being that way.

492
00:45:19.378 --> 00:45:20.479
I know you're fine but

493
00:45:22.881 --> 00:45:24.316
you have to tell her. though.

494
00:45:26.885 --> 00:45:29.388
I'll tell her when
the time is right. okay?

495
00:45:29.421 --> 00:45:31.290
Nothing's happened
in eight years.

496
00:45:38.931 --> 00:45:40.700
She's really young?

497
00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:43.936
She's younger. yeah.

498
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:47.005
Is that easier?

499
00:45:53.178 --> 00:45:54.012
Maybe.

500
00:46:00.152 --> 00:46:01.253
I really like her.

501
00:46:08.927 --> 00:46:10.864
Are you still seeing
your specialist?

502
00:46:19.238 --> 00:46:22.474
Are you not taking
anything right now?

503
00:46:22.508 --> 00:46:24.042
I'm fine.

504
00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:25.277
I'm worried about you.

505
00:46:26.445 --> 00:46:28.313
It's always gonna
be there. you know.

506
00:46:43.362 --> 00:46:44.596
I need to go.

507
00:49:37.302 --> 00:49:38.738
Oh no. don't.

508
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:40.138
Don't say it.

509
00:49:40.172 --> 00:49:41.406
I missed you.

510
00:49:56.521 --> 00:49:57.356
Hey.

511
00:49:59.124 --> 00:50:00.093
what's that?

512
00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:01.027
I found it on the bridge.

513
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.361
I think it might suit you.

514
00:50:02.394 --> 00:50:03.930
You really didn't.

515
00:50:03.963 --> 00:50:06.365
If I tell you the
truth. you gonna take it?

516
00:50:06.398 --> 00:50:07.566
I'm not gonna take it.

517
00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:09.636
Here. take it
back. take it back.

518
00:50:09.669 --> 00:50:11.370
I don't want it.

519
00:50:11.403 --> 00:50:13.740
It's really nice. take it.

520
00:50:15.742 --> 00:50:18.745
You sure you can afford it?

521
00:50:18.778 --> 00:50:20.847
Yes. so please take it.

522
00:50:26.953 --> 00:50:27.954
Thank you.

523
00:50:37.764 --> 00:50:38.998
How was work?

524
00:50:39.899 --> 00:50:42.735
Long.

525
00:50:59.418 --> 00:51:00.653
How are you doing down there?

526
00:51:00.687 --> 00:51:02.088
Sorry.

527
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:04.456
Sorry. it's just Camilla.

528
00:51:04.489 --> 00:51:05.892
What's going on?

529
00:51:06.993 --> 00:51:09.528
Oh. we just started
planning Africa.

530
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.363
She's like texting me
every five minutes.

531
00:51:11.396 --> 00:51:13.565
She is buying tickets
and that kind of thing.

532
00:51:13.598 --> 00:51:16.769
I think you're gonna
have a lovely time.

533
00:51:16.803 --> 00:51:19.471
I mean. you could come
with. if you want to.

534
00:51:19.504 --> 00:51:21.741
I mean. Camilla would love
it. she really likes you.

535
00:51:23.542 --> 00:51:24.476
Really likes me.

536
00:51:25.778 --> 00:51:28.081
Well. she
doesn't dislike you.

537
00:51:28.114 --> 00:51:29.314
She doesn't know you.

538
00:51:29.347 --> 00:51:30.750
I can't. just I go
other things going on.

539
00:51:30.783 --> 00:51:32.217
- I'm not sure...
- What other things?

540
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.319
You have your job.
what other things?

541
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:38.925
Come on. you never
tell me anything.

542
00:51:40.325 --> 00:51:41.861
All I know is that you
worked there for 10 years.

543
00:51:41.894 --> 00:51:43.629
and that you like
playing football.

544
00:51:47.734 --> 00:51:50.535
You ever thought
about getting married?

545
00:51:56.175 --> 00:51:57.476
Maybe one day.

546
00:52:03.783 --> 00:52:05.550
I'm wondering if
this conversation

547
00:52:05.584 --> 00:52:07.252
is a little bit premature.

548
00:52:07.285 --> 00:52:08.221
Okay.

549
00:52:08.253 --> 00:52:09.521
Wondering if you are
a little bit drunk.

550
00:52:09.554 --> 00:52:10.890
- Can we get some water. please?
- Excuse me.

551
00:52:10.923 --> 00:52:11.758
This is my night off.

552
00:52:11.791 --> 00:52:12.792
Thank you very much.

553
00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:16.328
Excuse me. that is
my wine glass. mister.

554
00:52:16.361 --> 00:52:18.197
We get a new bottle.

555
00:52:20.332 --> 00:52:23.268
Just for a minute.
let's fantasise.

556
00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:24.670
I just tripped

557
00:52:26.105 --> 00:52:29.374
down the aisle. you're
running away. going.

558
00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:30.810
I'm going to Africa.

559
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:32.011
You're such a mess.

560
00:52:33.311 --> 00:52:35.313
Yes. I'm drunk.

561
00:52:35.347 --> 00:52:36.581
I can tell.

562
00:52:36.615 --> 00:52:38.184
And then tomorrow
I'm gonna regret it.

563
00:52:39.652 --> 00:52:41.821
but right now
everything's perfect.

564
00:52:42.755 --> 00:52:43.588
Okay.

565
00:52:45.658 --> 00:52:47.425
Don't tell anybody.

566
00:52:48.393 --> 00:52:50.930
Come meet me in the bathroom.

567
00:52:50.963 --> 00:52:52.297
You're insane.

568
00:52:54.599 --> 00:52:55.835
A little bit.

569
00:52:57.703 --> 00:52:59.005
Dream of Africa.

570
00:53:05.178 --> 00:53:05.978
Okay.

571
00:53:17.723 --> 00:53:19.558
He carries a mystery.

572
00:53:22.195 --> 00:53:23.062
an evasiveness.

573
00:53:26.866 --> 00:53:29.769
I ask about his past
and there he stops.

574
00:53:33.973 --> 00:53:35.407
And he take a moment as if

575
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.311
he's deciding whether he should
tell me something or not.

576
00:53:49.487 --> 00:53:50.622
What are you writing?

577
00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:52.725
Nothing.

578
00:53:52.758 --> 00:53:53.960
I just saw my name.

579
00:53:53.993 --> 00:53:55.228
- Saw my name.
- Sh!

580
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:56.329
No. you didn't see your name.

581
00:53:56.361 --> 00:53:57.562
I saw Nick.

582
00:53:57.596 --> 00:53:59.431
Yeah. and Nick
in Norwegian means

583
00:54:01.399 --> 00:54:02.969
none of your business
in Norwegian.

584
00:54:03.002 --> 00:54:04.337
Go away. go away!

585
00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:06.072
This is mine. go to bed.

586
00:54:06.105 --> 00:54:08.140
I'm allowed to have secrets.

587
00:54:08.174 --> 00:54:09.008
Do you hate me?

588
00:54:10.076 --> 00:54:11.744
Yeah. that's
exactly what I write:

589
00:54:11.777 --> 00:54:12.577
I hate Nick Caluzzi.

590
00:54:12.611 --> 00:54:14.013
God. I wish he'd
get out of my bed.

591
00:54:14.046 --> 00:54:15.380
You see. I knew it.

592
00:54:15.413 --> 00:54:16.215
Gosh!

593
00:54:16.249 --> 00:54:17.350
I knew it.

594
00:54:17.415 --> 00:54:18.284
Leave me alone. I'm writing.

595
00:54:18.317 --> 00:54:20.319
What the hell are you writing?

596
00:54:20.353 --> 00:54:21.187
Go away.

597
00:54:23.356 --> 00:54:25.590
It's not fair. I'm
gonna write in Italian.

598
00:54:25.624 --> 00:54:26.959
You go and do that.

599
00:54:26.993 --> 00:54:29.228
Buy your own journal. then.

600
00:54:34.634 --> 00:54:36.736
No. no. no. go to bed.

601
00:54:36.769 --> 00:54:38.004
I am busy!

602
00:54:39.338 --> 00:54:40.339
I'm gonna write in Italian.

603
00:54:40.373 --> 00:54:43.009
Can't do that.

604
00:54:47.412 --> 00:54:49.081
Okay. what does that mean?

605
00:54:49.115 --> 00:54:50.950
I'm not telling you.

606
00:54:52.752 --> 00:54:53.585
It's a secret.

607
00:54:54.921 --> 00:54:57.023
Oh. we keep it in
secrets. now. are we?

608
00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:21.080
Today it all changed.

609
00:55:28.788 --> 00:55:31.123
I can't even write about it.

610
00:55:38.864 --> 00:55:40.700
I thought I was in control.

611
00:55:45.705 --> 00:55:47.039
And now I'm not.

612
00:57:42.488 --> 00:57:43.923
Is there anything I can do?

613
00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:48.894
Yeah.

614
00:57:54.366 --> 00:57:56.102
You can hold my hand.

615
00:58:40.513 --> 00:58:42.481
I had to protect myself.

616
00:58:47.286 --> 00:58:50.022
The truth is I
was scared inside.

617
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:54.593
And when that happens...

618
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:59.398
I've learned to bite
before I get bitten.

619
00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.442
What's going on?

620
00:59:44.343 --> 00:59:46.111
Nothing.

621
00:59:46.979 --> 00:59:48.547
It doesn't seem like nothing.

622
00:59:50.449 --> 00:59:51.617
Yeah. I'm fine.

623
00:59:52.818 --> 00:59:53.986
Are you sure?

624
00:59:56.422 --> 00:59:57.323
Yeah. it's fine.

625
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:00.292
But I have to go home tonight.

626
01:00:01.961 --> 01:00:03.896
I thought you said
you wanted to stay and

627
01:00:05.197 --> 01:00:06.532
watch a movie or something.

628
01:00:08.067 --> 01:00:09.969
Yeah. yeah. I was

629
01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:13.906
but Camilla just texted me and
she needs to talk to me. so.

630
01:00:16.742 --> 01:00:19.044
What does she
want to talk about?

631
01:00:19.078 --> 01:00:22.248
Why. do you have
to know everything?

632
01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:27.186
Sorry. sorry. it's fine. okay.

633
01:00:27.219 --> 01:00:28.487
I just need to go home.

634
01:00:29.689 --> 01:00:31.390
She doesn't like
me much. does she?

635
01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:35.761
Can you please
not be so paranoid.

636
01:00:35.794 --> 01:00:36.795
She likes you fine.

637
01:00:42.368 --> 01:00:44.570
You're making fuss out
of nothing right now.

638
01:00:44.603 --> 01:00:46.038
I just have to go home. okay?

639
01:00:49.743 --> 01:00:51.143
I don't think I am.

640
01:00:51.176 --> 01:00:52.378
Okay. now I just feel like

641
01:00:52.411 --> 01:00:53.345
you're causing an
argument over nothing.

642
01:00:53.379 --> 01:00:54.546
I'm not even sure if it's me

643
01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.514
that's causing an argument.

644
01:00:55.547 --> 01:00:56.650
Yes. you are.

645
01:00:56.683 --> 01:00:58.117
I'm telling you I have to
go home and you're getting

646
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:59.151
all angry at me.

647
01:01:00.386 --> 01:01:02.154
I just have to go home and
talk to my flatmate. okay?

648
01:01:02.187 --> 01:01:03.188
It's fine.

649
01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:06.592
Katerina.

650
01:01:13.299 --> 01:01:14.133
Yeah?

651
01:01:16.502 --> 01:01:17.903
I don't know what
the hell is going on.

652
01:01:17.936 --> 01:01:20.740
but I'm here if you wanna
talk about it. okay?

653
01:01:20.774 --> 01:01:22.441
Yeah. I know that.

654
01:01:25.244 --> 01:01:27.246
Look. it's fine. okay?

655
01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:30.082
We don't have to spend every
second of the day together.

656
01:01:33.152 --> 01:01:34.654
Let me just go home
and deal with this

657
01:01:34.688 --> 01:01:35.988
and then we'll talk later.

658
01:01:38.524 --> 01:01:39.558
Okay.

659
01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:40.426
Okay.

660
01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:42.594
Okay. I'll see you.

661
01:02:47.626 --> 01:02:48.560
Hi!

662
01:02:48.594 --> 01:02:49.763
- Hi.
- Hi. can I sit here?

663
01:02:49.796 --> 01:02:50.963
Yeah.
you can take a seat.

664
01:02:50.996 --> 01:02:52.131
Thank you.

665
01:02:52.164 --> 01:02:54.400
My bad. I'm
thinking about life.

666
01:02:54.433 --> 01:02:55.702
That's okay.

667
01:02:55.735 --> 01:02:57.804
Hi. I don't we've
probably met yet.

668
01:02:57.837 --> 01:03:01.173
I'm not sure. but I saw
you just around. because I...

669
01:03:01.206 --> 01:03:03.008
It's crazy 'cause I've
been here for like a month.

670
01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:04.109
I'm Katerina. anyway.

671
01:03:04.143 --> 01:03:05.678
Nice to meet you. I'm Luca.

672
01:03:05.712 --> 01:03:07.312
Well. that's a lovely name.

673
01:03:07.346 --> 01:03:08.313
Is that Italian?

674
01:03:08.347 --> 01:03:09.615
Yes. I'm from Italy.

675
01:03:09.649 --> 01:03:10.683
Oh. are you?

676
01:03:10.717 --> 01:03:11.851
Oh my God. it's amazing.

677
01:03:11.885 --> 01:03:13.051
I really want to to Italy.

678
01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:14.953
Actually. not from
Italy. I'm from Venice.

679
01:03:14.987 --> 01:03:16.823
Oh Venice. I'm so jealous!

680
01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:18.725
I always say Venice.

681
01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:23.095
That's so cool.

682
01:03:23.128 --> 01:03:25.865
You started last
month. did you say?

683
01:03:25.899 --> 01:03:28.400
Yeah. I'm fairly new still.

684
01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:29.769
All right. so.

685
01:03:31.871 --> 01:03:33.105
Okay.

686
01:04:49.983 --> 01:04:53.585
The observer effect.

687
01:04:54.988 --> 01:04:57.489
I changed reality just by the
very act of looking at it.

688
01:05:11.971 --> 01:05:14.707
I hardly worry
about mom anymore.

689
01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:16.943
Only when I talk to my sister

690
01:05:16.976 --> 01:05:18.678
do I remember what
I left behind.

691
01:05:22.682 --> 01:05:24.249
I had to leave.

692
01:05:26.986 --> 01:05:28.922
I
had no choice. I know that.

693
01:05:35.028 --> 01:05:36.428
I can only hope that...

694
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:37.964
By leaving I'm setting

695
01:05:37.997 --> 01:05:39.498
a good example for my sister.

696
01:05:41.199 --> 01:05:42.601
I
hope that she sees that

697
01:05:42.635 --> 01:05:44.804
if I can do it. so can she.

698
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:06.491
At
this point. I do suspect

699
01:06:06.525 --> 01:06:08.560
it's only her boyfriend
holding her back.

700
01:06:10.596 --> 01:06:12.364
She
won't move away from him.

701
01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:24.509
Now. you see

702
01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:25.377
a man

703
01:06:27.412 --> 01:06:28.447
holding you back.

704
01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:16.996
You okay?

705
01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:18.031
Yeah. you?

706
01:07:48.161 --> 01:07:49.394
Why are you trying
to get a reaction

707
01:07:49.428 --> 01:07:50.930
out of me at work?

708
01:07:55.567 --> 01:07:58.071
What do you mean. I haven't.

709
01:08:01.373 --> 01:08:03.375
I haven't done anything.

710
01:08:06.145 --> 01:08:08.547
You're just being oversensitive.

711
01:08:14.586 --> 01:08:15.420
What?

712
01:08:19.092 --> 01:08:20.592
Are you seeing someone else?

713
01:08:22.494 --> 01:08:23.595
No.

714
01:08:23.628 --> 01:08:24.463
Nick.

715
01:08:24.496 --> 01:08:25.765
No. I have not been
with someone else.

716
01:08:25.798 --> 01:08:27.532
but what the hell?

717
01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:28.701
What is wrong with you?

718
01:08:35.842 --> 01:08:36.809
But even if I had.

719
01:08:38.211 --> 01:08:40.445
it isn't like we ever said
that we were together.

720
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:51.991
Yeah. say something.

721
01:09:03.535 --> 01:09:04.369
I miss you.

722
01:09:10.243 --> 01:09:12.078
Don't do that to
me. don't do that.

723
01:09:15.248 --> 01:09:17.984
This was just meant to be
like a temporary thing. Nick.

724
01:09:19.152 --> 01:09:21.988
Now. it feels like
you're changing.

725
01:09:30.562 --> 01:09:31.764
I can't do this anymore.

726
01:09:31.798 --> 01:09:33.933
I can't do this
anymore with you.

727
01:09:35.268 --> 01:09:36.102
I'm not.

728
01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:39.138
Okay.

729
01:09:39.172 --> 01:09:39.972
Okay.

730
01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:40.907
Okay. good.

731
01:12:34.612 --> 01:12:37.016
This place is great. yeah?

732
01:12:37.049 --> 01:12:38.150
Can we have that drink?

733
01:12:38.184 --> 01:12:39.418
Can we get that drink. please?

734
01:12:39.452 --> 01:12:41.120
- Yeah.
- Just the lime soda.

735
01:12:41.153 --> 01:12:42.288
- Yeah.
- Cheers. man.

736
01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:43.322
Thank you.

737
01:12:48.327 --> 01:12:51.964
Is Camilla joining
us anytime soon. or?

738
01:12:51.998 --> 01:12:53.766
Oh. she didn't text you?

739
01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:54.633
No.

740
01:12:56.635 --> 01:12:58.304
Well. apparently
there's an emergency

741
01:12:58.337 --> 01:13:00.873
at your guys' hospital.

742
01:13:00.906 --> 01:13:03.042
I don't know. maybe.
she'll be here later.

743
01:13:03.075 --> 01:13:04.043
Shall we?

744
01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:07.980
I definitely feel like
we've been set up.

745
01:13:09.015 --> 01:13:09.849
- Camilla.
- Camilla.

746
01:13:11.283 --> 01:13:12.184
She wouldn't do that.

747
01:13:12.218 --> 01:13:13.686
- would she?
- No.

748
01:13:13.719 --> 01:13:15.755
She's great. though.
I really like her.

749
01:13:15.788 --> 01:13:16.621
Yeah.

750
01:13:19.992 --> 01:13:22.627
So. how long have
you been in London?

751
01:13:22.661 --> 01:13:24.463
I've been in
London for six years.

752
01:13:25.431 --> 01:13:26.399
That's a long time.

753
01:13:26.432 --> 01:13:27.767
- Yeah. and you?
- You like it?

754
01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.503
I'm just here doing
my fellowship.

755
01:13:30.535 --> 01:13:33.739
I'm specialising in
becoming a neurosurgeon.

756
01:13:34.707 --> 01:13:35.975
And you. where are you from?

757
01:13:36.008 --> 01:13:37.676
I'm from Norway. actually.

758
01:13:39.945 --> 01:13:42.314
- And you?
- I'm from South Africa.

759
01:13:42.348 --> 01:13:45.317
You couldn't tell the accent.

760
01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:46.252
From Africa?

761
01:13:46.285 --> 01:13:47.753
Yeah. I'm from Cape Town

762
01:13:47.787 --> 01:13:49.922
which is like right at the
bottom-southwest corner.

763
01:13:51.223 --> 01:13:54.559
It's quite a cosmopolitan
European city.

764
01:13:54.592 --> 01:13:56.796
not really like real Africa.

765
01:13:56.829 --> 01:13:58.197
If you wanna
experience real Africa.

766
01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.099
you need to kind of
go a little bit north.

767
01:14:02.935 --> 01:14:07.440
So. Camilla said that you
work in palliative care.

768
01:14:07.473 --> 01:14:09.942
Yeah. I'm a nurse.
same as Camilla.

769
01:14:09.975 --> 01:14:10.810
Okay.

770
01:14:13.012 --> 01:14:14.713
Which makes me a
surgeon. I guess?

771
01:14:16.215 --> 01:14:17.049
Being a surgeon

772
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:19.218
can be tough.

773
01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:20.386
I mean. just getting
there is tough.

774
01:14:20.419 --> 01:14:22.488
He was perfect.

775
01:14:22.521 --> 01:14:24.156
handsome. a surgeon.

776
01:14:25.291 --> 01:14:26.525
Everything you could
ask for. really.

777
01:14:26.559 --> 01:14:27.760
Two years of
internship afterward.

778
01:14:27.793 --> 01:14:29.462
But he wasn't Nick.

779
01:14:29.495 --> 01:14:31.030
Specialise.

780
01:14:31.063 --> 01:14:32.698
So. I came to the UK.

781
01:14:35.167 --> 01:14:38.337
Are you okay. 'cause you
seem very distracted.

782
01:14:41.407 --> 01:14:42.308
It's just that
I realise actually

783
01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:44.176
I have somewhere else to be.

784
01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.444
Are you sure?

785
01:14:46.712 --> 01:14:47.880
Hey. can I help you?

786
01:14:47.913 --> 01:14:49.281
I mean. is there
something you need...

787
01:14:49.315 --> 01:14:50.983
- No. no. I'm fine.
- Or do you need a lift?

788
01:14:51.016 --> 01:14:53.919
I'm fine. sorry. I'm fine.

789
01:14:53.953 --> 01:14:55.020
Thank you.

790
01:14:55.054 --> 01:14:56.422
Don't worry about
it. I will sort it out.

791
01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:57.423
Thank you.

792
01:14:57.456 --> 01:14:58.824
Maybe. we could
do this again sometime.

793
01:14:58.858 --> 01:15:01.060
- Yeah. maybe. maybe.
- All right.

794
01:15:04.563 --> 01:15:05.664
What the hell?

795
01:15:09.068 --> 01:15:13.172
Hey. man. can I get another
one of these. please?

796
01:17:13.993 --> 01:17:15.662
I miss you already.

797
01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:32.111
- Camilla.
- Oh Jesus!

798
01:17:32.144 --> 01:17:34.714
You scared the hell out of me.

799
01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:35.781
I'm looking for Katerina.

800
01:17:35.814 --> 01:17:37.549
Do you know where she is?

801
01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:38.752
She's fine.

802
01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:42.021
She's just gone
away for a few days.

803
01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:51.263
Can you tell her to call
me when you speak to her?

804
01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.097
Sure.

805
01:17:53.098 --> 01:17:53.932
Yeah.

806
01:17:55.635 --> 01:17:56.636
Thank you.

807
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:59.004
You know.

808
01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.642
it's just not that deep.

809
01:18:04.476 --> 01:18:05.745
Is that right?

810
01:18:08.748 --> 01:18:09.581
Yeah.

811
01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:54.093
Hi Nick.

812
01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:55.527
I ain't seen you in a while.

813
01:18:56.462 --> 01:18:57.797
I'll have vodka tonic.

814
01:18:57.831 --> 01:18:59.565
Double. single?

815
01:18:59.598 --> 01:19:00.866
Give me a double.

816
01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:02.635
Okay. mate.

817
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:05.839
It's
not working for me.

818
01:19:07.306 --> 01:19:11.009
How long
have you been feeling this?

819
01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:12.945
Is that
a serious question?

820
01:19:12.978 --> 01:19:15.080
You
haven't brought this up.

821
01:19:16.716 --> 01:19:19.418
What was that the other day?

822
01:19:19.451 --> 01:19:20.854
Huh?

823
01:19:20.886 --> 01:19:22.588
You let your mom
speak to me like that?

824
01:19:22.621 --> 01:19:23.522
I couldn't shout at her...

825
01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:25.023
You said nothing!

826
01:19:25.057 --> 01:19:26.225
It was all
her friends were there.

827
01:19:26.258 --> 01:19:27.660
All the family were there.

828
01:19:27.694 --> 01:19:30.095
Do you know how
that made me feel?

829
01:19:30.129 --> 01:19:32.699
You care more about what
they think than I think.

830
01:19:32.732 --> 01:19:33.932
Don't worry about her.

831
01:19:33.966 --> 01:19:37.002
Like. you always fixate
on what she's saying.

832
01:19:37.035 --> 01:19:38.671
You're like a seven-year-old

833
01:19:38.705 --> 01:19:40.205
when you're around her.

834
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:41.573
It's ridiculous!

835
01:19:42.975 --> 01:19:45.277
Do you know what
your problem is?

836
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:47.112
- You're weak.
- I'm not weak. just...

837
01:19:47.146 --> 01:19:48.514
Are you all right?

838
01:19:50.416 --> 01:19:51.316
Yeah. I'm fine.

839
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:52.618
It's never the right time.

840
01:19:54.286 --> 01:19:56.555
Have you even told her
that I don't want children.

841
01:19:57.956 --> 01:19:59.793
Look. I just
don't think it matters

842
01:19:59.826 --> 01:20:01.293
so much about what
she want wants

843
01:20:01.326 --> 01:20:03.495
rather than what we
want for each other.

844
01:20:03.529 --> 01:20:05.330
Your family
don't approve of me.

845
01:20:05.364 --> 01:20:08.400
They do. how
many times have I said it?

846
01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:10.536
The thing is you
don't come by yourself.

847
01:20:11.905 --> 01:20:15.207
You come with an army of
freaking Iranians behind you.

848
01:20:18.177 --> 01:20:19.813
I find it pathetic.

849
01:20:19.846 --> 01:20:20.979
I understand the problem.

850
01:20:21.013 --> 01:20:22.214
Do you know what the problem is?

851
01:20:22.247 --> 01:20:24.016
Do you want me to tell
you what the problem is?

852
01:20:24.049 --> 01:20:25.217
Oh. give him a break.

853
01:20:27.586 --> 01:20:28.487
I beg your pardon?

854
01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.189
I said give him a break!

855
01:20:30.222 --> 01:20:31.123
Nick. mate.

856
01:20:31.156 --> 01:20:32.057
Stay out of this. mate.

857
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:34.193
Not today. mate. not today.

858
01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:39.465
You guys all right.
sorry about that. yeah?

859
01:20:39.498 --> 01:20:40.733
Well. you haven't stopped her

860
01:20:40.767 --> 01:20:41.935
ever since the second
I walked in the door.

861
01:20:41.967 --> 01:20:44.169
Oh my God. are
you still speaking?

862
01:20:44.203 --> 01:20:45.337
Rein your neck in.

863
01:20:45.370 --> 01:20:46.873
we're having a
private conversation.

864
01:20:46.906 --> 01:20:48.474
There's nothing private
about your conversation.

865
01:20:48.507 --> 01:20:49.742
Just stay down. don't
worry. he's drunk.

866
01:20:49.776 --> 01:20:50.944
I'm not drunk.

867
01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:52.211
Don't let him speak
to me like that!

868
01:20:52.244 --> 01:20:53.579
Everyone can hear what
you're talking about.

869
01:20:53.612 --> 01:20:55.414
Oh my God. he's a nutcase.

870
01:20:55.447 --> 01:20:56.448
I'm on your side. pal.

871
01:20:56.482 --> 01:20:57.449
Who are you. anyway?

872
01:20:57.483 --> 01:20:59.051
Just go away. you got
nothing to do with this.

873
01:20:59.084 --> 01:21:01.587
This is not your issue here.

874
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.554
I'm trying to have

875
01:21:02.588 --> 01:21:03.723
love. it's okay.

876
01:21:03.756 --> 01:21:04.691
No one asked to speak.

877
01:21:04.724 --> 01:21:06.058
Just stay down. I
know. just stay down.

878
01:21:06.091 --> 01:21:07.025
Just stay down.

879
01:21:07.059 --> 01:21:08.160
It has nothing to do with you.

880
01:21:08.193 --> 01:21:09.294
- I'm on your side.
- I know.

881
01:21:09.328 --> 01:21:10.763
Don't let him
speak to me like that.

882
01:21:10.797 --> 01:21:12.030
- Here we go again.
- This is my problem.

883
01:21:12.064 --> 01:21:13.298
There you are shouting
at everybody again.

884
01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:14.868
You are off
of your fucking head!

885
01:21:14.901 --> 01:21:16.268
Don't fucking call her that.

886
01:21:16.301 --> 01:21:17.302
I fucking had it!

887
01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:21.941
My God!

888
01:21:21.975 --> 01:21:24.109
Just calm down.
just stay down.

889
01:21:24.142 --> 01:21:25.110
Call the police!

890
01:21:25.143 --> 01:21:26.245
Calm down!

891
01:21:26.278 --> 01:21:29.649
Just stay down. let's calm down.

892
01:21:33.085 --> 01:21:34.219
Pull him off. pull him off!

893
01:21:34.253 --> 01:21:35.788
Easy. easy. easy!

894
01:21:35.822 --> 01:21:37.022
You're all the same!

895
01:21:37.055 --> 01:21:38.624
You're all the same!

896
01:21:38.658 --> 01:21:41.593
Don't do that to me. though!

897
01:21:41.627 --> 01:21:43.128
Calm down. calm
down. calm down.

898
01:21:43.161 --> 01:21:44.229
Let's have a walk. yeah.

899
01:21:44.263 --> 01:21:46.633
It's getting in his head.

900
01:21:46.666 --> 01:21:47.667
You're all the same.

901
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.101
Nick. get out!

902
01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.038
Hey. man. have a seat.

903
01:21:53.071 --> 01:21:54.908
I'll get you a drink.

904
01:21:54.941 --> 01:21:56.375
He's a fucking nutcase

905
01:21:56.408 --> 01:21:58.277
and a fucking liability.
that's what he is!

906
01:22:43.756 --> 01:22:44.891
Everyone at work is wondering

907
01:22:44.924 --> 01:22:45.925
what happened to...

908
01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:48.995
I won't call him.

909
01:22:50.697 --> 01:22:51.530
I can't

910
01:22:53.532 --> 01:22:55.500
because that might
be what he wants.

911
01:23:04.944 --> 01:23:07.112
Hi. everyone.
thank you for coming.

912
01:23:07.145 --> 01:23:08.748
I'm sorry I had to call
this emergency meeting.

913
01:23:08.781 --> 01:23:11.350
I know it's the night shift and

914
01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:13.052
they're not our favourites.

915
01:23:13.086 --> 01:23:17.056
Nick Caluzzi. one of our senior
nurses. he's gone missing.

916
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:20.860
Well. he hasn't turned
up to work for five days.

917
01:23:20.893 --> 01:23:23.228
so if you do know
any information.

918
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:25.832
or anything about Nick
or his last whereabouts.

919
01:23:25.865 --> 01:23:28.400
then that would be brilliant
if you could let me know.

920
01:23:29.401 --> 01:23:30.268
We just want him safe.

921
01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:31.236
We just want him found.

922
01:23:31.269 --> 01:23:32.639
If you could look at the board

923
01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:34.073
to see where his shifts are.

924
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.342
and otherwise we'll get
some agency nurses in.

925
01:23:37.376 --> 01:23:38.577
Of course. sure.

926
01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:39.646
Brilliant. thank
you very much.

927
01:23:39.679 --> 01:23:40.813
Thank you. everyone.

928
01:23:40.847 --> 01:23:42.614
Thank you.

929
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.207
Oh God. I hope he

930
01:24:09.241 --> 01:24:11.144
hasn't had an accident.

931
01:24:22.155 --> 01:24:23.890
Where have you gone?

932
01:26:09.028 --> 01:26:11.563
The
definition of entanglement

933
01:26:11.596 --> 01:26:13.800
is to be involved in a
complicated situation

934
01:26:15.168 --> 01:26:18.171
and which is difficult
to disengage.

935
01:28:51.657 --> 01:28:53.926
My
rule was to keep my distance.

936
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:59.732
I never thought that
would backfire on me.

937
01:29:01.267 --> 01:29:03.302
You know I heard
that they found Nick.

938
01:29:03.336 --> 01:29:05.771
that nurse guy. but they
won't tell us where he is.

939
01:29:05.805 --> 01:29:07.505
They're probably
not allowed to.

940
01:29:08.975 --> 01:29:10.142
I don't think he's
coming back to work.

941
01:29:10.176 --> 01:29:11.877
I don't think he's allowed.

942
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:14.246
I think something
happened. maybe.

943
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.915
I heard something.

944
01:29:15.948 --> 01:29:17.216
He's like a really weird guy.

945
01:29:17.249 --> 01:29:18.784
I don't think he
spoke to anyone.

946
01:29:18.818 --> 01:29:19.986
Kept to himself.

947
01:29:21.454 --> 01:29:23.055
I never
really met him.

948
01:29:23.089 --> 01:29:24.890
And I worked with
him a few times.

949
01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:27.960
Yeah. really weird.

950
01:29:30.863 --> 01:29:32.999
As soon
as I heard there was word.

951
01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:35.468
I knew exactly where to go.

952
01:29:36.568 --> 01:29:37.403
Miguel.

953
01:29:38.337 --> 01:29:39.405
- Hi.
- Hey.

954
01:29:39.438 --> 01:29:41.273
Hi Katerina. what's up?

955
01:29:41.307 --> 01:29:42.908
Do you have a second to talk?

956
01:29:42.942 --> 01:29:43.776
Yeah.

957
01:29:45.077 --> 01:29:45.911
What's wrong?

958
01:29:47.246 --> 01:29:50.716
I heard you know
where Nick Caluzzi is.

959
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:51.583
What?

960
01:29:52.718 --> 01:29:54.920
I heard you know
where Nick Caluzzi is.

961
01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:56.554
Can you tell me?

962
01:29:56.588 --> 01:29:58.858
You know I can't tell
you that information.

963
01:30:00.226 --> 01:30:01.494
Why did you want to know?

964
01:30:04.497 --> 01:30:07.266
Because me and Nick have
been seeing each other.

965
01:30:07.299 --> 01:30:08.801
and it ended badly. and he
thinks I cheated on him.

966
01:30:08.834 --> 01:30:10.836
and I have to make it right.

967
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:14.173
I knew something was going on.

968
01:30:14.206 --> 01:30:16.008
Please. I need to
know where he is.

969
01:30:19.412 --> 01:30:22.681
Listen. I'm gonna go for
a cigarette in a moment. and

970
01:30:24.216 --> 01:30:25.985
the door to my office is open.

971
01:30:26.018 --> 01:30:28.888
You can look in
the filing cabinet.

972
01:30:30.956 --> 01:30:32.058
Okay?

973
01:30:32.091 --> 01:30:33.826
Thank you.

974
01:30:33.859 --> 01:30:34.960
No worries.

975
01:30:55.181 --> 01:30:58.350
As
Newton's third law says.

976
01:30:58.384 --> 01:31:02.288
for every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction.

977
01:31:50.769 --> 01:31:51.537
Need help?

978
01:31:53.305 --> 01:31:54.673
Yeah.

979
01:31:54.707 --> 01:31:56.775
I'm here to see Nick Caluzzi.

980
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:59.245
Are you a relative?

981
01:31:59.278 --> 01:32:02.181
No. I'm a friend.
Katerina Nielson.

982
01:32:02.214 --> 01:32:03.582
You wanna come and sign in?

983
01:32:03.616 --> 01:32:04.483
Yeah.

984
01:32:04.517 --> 01:32:05.251
Come in.

985
01:32:23.602 --> 01:32:24.770
Here you go.

986
01:32:26.772 --> 01:32:28.440
Thanks.

987
01:32:30.776 --> 01:32:32.511
You okay?

988
01:32:33.746 --> 01:32:34.847
Yeah. yeah.

989
01:32:40.352 --> 01:32:41.520
I'm just a bit nervous.

990
01:32:43.789 --> 01:32:45.090
The last time I saw him it

991
01:32:46.592 --> 01:32:47.760
didn't end very well.

992
01:32:50.496 --> 01:32:52.398
I'm just not sure if I'm
doing the right thing

993
01:32:52.431 --> 01:32:53.432
by coming today.

994
01:32:56.835 --> 01:32:59.104
You can come back
another time. if you want.

995
01:33:00.839 --> 01:33:02.474
I have to see him.

996
01:33:04.977 --> 01:33:05.744
I get it.

997
01:33:07.012 --> 01:33:09.415
It can be really hard
on the relatives.

998
01:33:09.448 --> 01:33:12.151
They often think it's
something they've done.

999
01:33:12.184 --> 01:33:15.120
It's the illness.
don't forget that.

1000
01:33:17.056 --> 01:33:18.824
Within a week of
taking his medication.

1001
01:33:18.857 --> 01:33:20.793
he was much better.

1002
01:33:20.826 --> 01:33:21.760
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1003
01:33:22.895 --> 01:33:24.163
I don't think he
should even be here.

1004
01:33:24.196 --> 01:33:26.432
but he has to wait for
an official discharge.

1005
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.635
Oh.

1006
01:33:32.504 --> 01:33:33.505
How was he admitted?

1007
01:33:34.573 --> 01:33:35.841
I can't tell you that.

1008
01:33:35.874 --> 01:33:37.243
Patient confidentiality.

1009
01:33:38.645 --> 01:33:39.478
Of course.

1010
01:33:44.883 --> 01:33:46.352
Does he know that I'm coming?

1011
01:33:55.127 --> 01:33:55.961
Okay.

1012
01:33:59.331 --> 01:34:00.165
You ready?

1013
01:34:01.867 --> 01:34:03.202
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1014
01:34:03.235 --> 01:34:05.604
Come on. I'll take you to him.

1015
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:32.998
You all right?

1016
01:34:49.281 --> 01:34:52.284
Just give me a shout
if you need me.

1017
01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:40.399
How you been?

1018
01:35:51.276 --> 01:35:52.177
I'm fine.

1019
01:36:04.724 --> 01:36:06.191
What the hell happened. Nick?

1020
01:36:11.029 --> 01:36:14.600
I ask myself the same
question every day.

1021
01:36:17.837 --> 01:36:22.074
Why didn't you tell me
that you ended up in here?

1022
01:36:23.575 --> 01:36:26.679
Why would I do that?

1023
01:36:26.713 --> 01:36:29.548
Because you just disappeared.

1024
01:36:29.581 --> 01:36:31.016
Everyone at work was
really worried about you.

1025
01:36:31.049 --> 01:36:33.085
Yeah. well. I'm sure
they caught their shifts.

1026
01:36:33.118 --> 01:36:33.952
Stop it.

1027
01:36:41.861 --> 01:36:42.961
I'm still so angry.

1028
01:36:45.899 --> 01:36:47.332
I can't shift in.

1029
01:36:51.603 --> 01:36:53.005
I don't understand.

1030
01:36:54.173 --> 01:36:55.007
You let me down.

1031
01:37:06.886 --> 01:37:09.354
They said that I triggered
an episode of bipolar.

1032
01:37:13.992 --> 01:37:15.762
I thought I'd got
over it a few year ago

1033
01:37:15.795 --> 01:37:17.864
so I stopped taking
my medication.

1034
01:37:22.635 --> 01:37:25.304
And then this emotional reaction

1035
01:37:26.706 --> 01:37:28.207
apparently triggered it again.

1036
01:37:33.178 --> 01:37:36.181
Do I actually have
to get into this?

1037
01:37:39.184 --> 01:37:40.820
But you look fine to me.

1038
01:37:42.755 --> 01:37:43.589
You shouldn't have come.

1039
01:37:43.622 --> 01:37:45.057
I'm trying to get
you out of my mind.

1040
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:46.325
I had to see where you were.

1041
01:37:46.358 --> 01:37:47.993
I don't want you
to see me like this.

1042
01:37:52.297 --> 01:37:53.733
But you'll be fine.

1043
01:37:53.766 --> 01:37:57.102
You just need to get out
of here and you'll be fine.

1044
01:38:00.305 --> 01:38:01.139
Maybe.

1045
01:38:07.312 --> 01:38:10.884
Why didn't you tell me about
this thing that you have?

1046
01:38:10.917 --> 01:38:11.851
I didn't know.

1047
01:38:22.094 --> 01:38:23.262
Embarrassed.

1048
01:38:26.231 --> 01:38:27.332
I was scared.

1049
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:34.674
I was scared I was
gonna lose you.

1050
01:38:37.877 --> 01:38:40.145
Everyone has secrets. Nick.

1051
01:38:42.548 --> 01:38:45.150
If I told you mine.
you'd probably run away.

1052
01:38:55.127 --> 01:38:55.962
Try me.

1053
01:39:00.332 --> 01:39:01.433
Another time. maybe.

1054
01:39:04.837 --> 01:39:09.776
Don't start that again.

1055
01:39:10.609 --> 01:39:11.878
You play games.

1056
01:39:16.181 --> 01:39:18.685
No. it's not a game anymore.

1057
01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.696
It's probably for
the best. anyway.

1058
01:39:29.729 --> 01:39:32.464
It's not like I could have
introduced you to my family.

1059
01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:39.806
Too old?

1060
01:39:40.673 --> 01:39:41.506
Too crazy.

1061
01:39:43.009 --> 01:39:44.276
I mean. you have
a certificate now

1062
01:39:44.309 --> 01:39:45.611
and everything. don't you?

1063
01:39:46.946 --> 01:39:49.114
I finally got a
certificate in something.

1064
01:39:51.183 --> 01:39:52.018
I'm joking.

1065
01:39:53.786 --> 01:39:55.855
It's the motorbike
thing they don't like.

1066
01:40:06.966 --> 01:40:11.203
I'm gonna go in case you
trigger another episode.

1067
01:40:13.338 --> 01:40:14.172
Okay.

1068
01:40:16.843 --> 01:40:18.077
I'm gonna go.

1069
01:40:20.747 --> 01:40:22.314
It's what you keep saying.

1070
01:40:22.347 --> 01:40:24.017
I'm definitely gonna go.

1071
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:25.084
You're gonna go now. yeah.

1072
01:40:25.118 --> 01:40:26.218
I should go.

1073
01:40:26.251 --> 01:40:27.754
You're gonna go.

1074
01:40:38.397 --> 01:40:40.465
I'm gonna go this time.

1075
01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:51.410
Okay.

1076
01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:06.558
I'm glad you came.

1077
01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:10.195
Yeah. me. too.

1078
01:41:56.608 --> 01:41:58.111
I
think he believed in love

1079
01:41:58.144 --> 01:41:59.045
until he met me.

1080
01:42:36.548 --> 01:42:38.985
I promise you.

1081
01:42:39.018 --> 01:42:40.920
I'll make it up to you.

1082
01:43:05.544 --> 01:43:08.346
Werner Heisenberg
said. "It's a world

1083
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:11.951
"of potentialities
or possibilities

1084
01:43:11.984 --> 01:43:14.553
"rather than one of
things or facts."

1085
01:43:17.757 --> 01:43:18.891
The paradox

1086
01:43:20.927 --> 01:43:23.562
is only a conflict
between reality

1087
01:43:23.595 --> 01:43:25.998
and your feeling of what
reality ought to be.

1088
01:43:41.346 --> 01:43:42.514
And in the end

1089
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:47.086
I believe that all
paths lead home.
