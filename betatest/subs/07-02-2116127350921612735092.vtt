00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.034
Year of 1398. 7 years since
it was established.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.329
foreign intrusion and the issue
of proclaiming the crown prince

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.540
threw Joseon Dynasty into disorder.

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.446
You dirty mutt!

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:17.406
EMPIRE OF LUST

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.658
YEAR OF 1398
7TH YEAR UNDER KING TAEJO'S REIGN

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:24.163
At this time of rebirth when
we should be abolishing old customs.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.542
the founding contributors cannot
continue to possess private armies

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:32.755
while also being granted
protection by the nation--

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.593
doing so will certainly disperse
and weaken the nation’s power.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:42.431
Therefore. your majesty.
to reunite military strength.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.392
we should vest all private armies
in the great army

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:49.188
and have the battle formation drill
proceed without delay.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.523
If tens of thousands of soldiers
start training suddenly.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.652
it would raise suspicion
in the Great Ming.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.698
We cannot afford that.

00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:02.618
So does your lordship
the first vice-premier put

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.037
the Great Ming's mood
ahead of our own interest?

00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:06.246
Would you rather

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.625
this country suffer war?

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.294
Watch your mouth!
How dare you!

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:13.629
You all be quiet!

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.131
We just founded the new kingdom.

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:19.218
And already we can’t seem to
agree on anything!

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.512
Your majesty.

00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:23.722
The supreme commander.
Jo Young-gyu.

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:27.226
and commander of Right Army.
Kim Min-jae. request an audience.

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:28.602
Granted.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.488
Your humble subject.
Jo Young-gyu.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.658
completed the mission of
subjugating the northern savages.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:46.412
Welcome back!
You must've suffered many hardships.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.831
Commander of the right army. Kim Min-jae
pays reverence to your majesty.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:52.292
I was informed about your
distinguished service at this battle.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.630
Seeing you brings me great joy
as you remind me of myself

00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:57.881
as a young man.

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.722
- Lord First Vice-Premier.
- Your majesty.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.432
Do arrange a celebration

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:10.394
for the two commanders
who brought us great victory.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.187
As you command. your majesty.

00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:24.616
First call is 20 silver coins.
20 coins anyone?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.410
- Twenty!
- We have 20!

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.703
21 anyone?

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.122
- 21!
- Good. 21 from the gentleman.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:34.209
Anyone calling 22?
22 silver coins!

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.888
Look who is here!

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:51.518
Isn't this Commander Kim who
won the deadly battle in the north?

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:53.395
How have you been. your highness?

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.898
Can't be better
all thanks to you!

00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:59.777
The youngest born of my stepmother
became the crown prince.

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.279
Yes. I know.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:04.782
Are you here because of that?

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:07.576
I don't understand...

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.704
I am asking if you're here
because you're worried

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.666
that I. Lee Bang-won might be sad
about not becoming crown prince.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.170
I heard your father-in-law
played a great part in it.

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.464
How could it be?

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.717
It is solely his majesty’s decision
to crown a prince.

00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:25.803
I sincerely envy your father-in-law.

00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:28.889
He shouldn't have any worry

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.642
with such a strong man like you
by his side.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.686
Anyway. let's talk more

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.897
at the feast later.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:46.615
See you soon.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.712
Thief! Catch him!

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:05.801
Ouch!

00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:07.803
Please don't!

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.810
Are you trying to cripple a child
for stealing an ornament?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.688
He's just a starving child.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.776
For you. this is only the means
to feed yourself for a few days.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.905
but for me. it is the only gift
from my estranged mother.

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.411
So take this instead
and buy food with it.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.330
And don’t do anything like this again.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:36.748
Do you understand?

00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:43.380
Everyone has something they hold dear.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:57.728
I apologize for the commotion.my lord.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.314
Please forgive my disrespect.

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:09.907
Let's go.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.494
You met Prince Jung-an.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:16.705
Yes.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.210
He pretends to be a toothless tiger

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:23.712
but he cannot fool me.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.883
He's just hiding his claws.
I'm sure.

00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:33.388
You also know how he can be.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.226
From now. you’d do well not to

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.811
consider him a friend as before.

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:41.313
Do you understand?

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:44.274
Yes. sir.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:48.612
You will be assigned to be
the commander of the great army

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.697
so you'd better get prepared.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:53.283
But sir...

00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:57.579
Haven’t I expressed my intent
to retire after this battle?

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.582
The state of affairs
doesn't allow you that luxury.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.127
The youngest son of the second queen
became the crown prince.

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.797
The reform of the military system
is facing opposition. too.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.594
We need to use the outside enemy
to ease the complaints within.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.389
We will attack the east
of Liaohe River.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.893
All you have to do is

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.895
follow orders.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.151
So.

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.486
How is your health?

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.655
Thanks to the medicine you sent.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.198
I am much better now.

00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:34.658
That is good to hear.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.495
Get well soon so that you
may give birth to this family’s heir.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.206
Please don't. Father.

00:09:41.707 --> 00:09:43.583
I came here today

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:46.753
because I wanted to personally
deliver something to my son-in-law.

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:49.464
- Bring it in.
- Yes. your majesty.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:55.679
You may open it.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.774
Isn't this?

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.444
Do you remember it.
Lord Sambong?

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.195
It's a scent bag.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:16.199
It's too precious
to give to my grandson.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.828
It is tradition for the father-in-law
to give this to his son-in-law.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.913
You should carry it with you always.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.713
Inscrutable are
the king's favor. your majesty.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.008
Actually. that scent bag is
also a subtle message

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:36.511
urging the son-in-law
to produce an heir.

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.680
Just so you know!

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:45.479
Wait. you shouldn't be here.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.689
You must not be late.
the celebration is for you!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.400
You'd better get going.

00:10:57.783 --> 00:10:59.576
- Then I shall leave first.
- Sure.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.792
Let me propose a toast.

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:16.134
This drink might help you
be more productive tonight.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.523
Oh. is that so?

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.691
Yes. my lord.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.610
Oh. you're finally here!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.696
How come the star of the night

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.407
is so late?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.826
My apologies. your highness.
There were some family affairs.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.787
Powerful families surely
have lots of affairs to handle!

00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:47.290
Lord Sambong also couldn't make it.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.583
Well. well...

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.794
Like father-in-law.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.879
like son-in-law.

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.507
How can they not be
so preoccupied.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.137
when they desperately try to
steal everyone else's thunders?

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.347
You know though.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:05.225
your lordship has only yourself

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.269
and your laziness to blame!

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.187
Don't you think?

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:16.778
Drink!

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.375
This is Gahee.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.129
She prepared a dance
popular in Ming Dynasty

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.591
for tonight’s feast.

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:21.820
Dance has its own
artistry and manners.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:24.322
Your lordship should be
aware of such things.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.782
How dare you wench!

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.703
Today shall be the death of you!

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:31.621
Please forgive her.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.707
She hasn't even turned up
her hair yet.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.709
So please. have mercy.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.212
What?
She's still a virgin?

00:14:40.297 --> 00:14:41.298
Good then!

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.679
Then I'll be her first man.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.390
I'd rather die right here

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.475
than to let it be so.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.311
Rather die?

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:58.690
I'll teach you manners tonight!

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.290
Please stop.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:19.210
Do you think me your subordinate.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:24.507
now that you’ve won a few battles
and found favor with his majesty?

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.888
Please stop.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.601
I see. You want to be her man too?

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:37.896
Alright.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.815
We’ll let our swords decide

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.403
who her man should be.
Draw your sword!

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:53.495
It is true that I'm the least
favorite son of his majesty

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.414
but how could you make such a scene

00:15:58.208 --> 00:15:59.834
in front of a royal prince?

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:02.879
Your highness.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:07.300
How about having her decide
who her man should be?

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.887
That’s a very good idea!

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.807
I had such high hopes for tonight...

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.601
but not only am I ignored
because of that girl.

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.687
you mean to make me see blood!
No way!

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:23.775
One of your lordships
must accept the girl's choice!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.613
Aha! I think that clears it up.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.491
Why don’t we make a toast

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.618
altogether

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.704
to celebrate those two?

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.791
Hurray!

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.585
Hurray!

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.682
Why did you do that?

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.393
Because you were bleeding.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.151
Well... at least
it is all past us now.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:07.777
You should rest.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.700
I'll be in trouble

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.785
if you leave me like this.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:18.496
What do you mean?

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:20.874
Even here at courtesans' house.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.419
a girl who gets deserted
on her first night

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.796
is said to be unlucky
and no man comes for her.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.381
Stop.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:16.513
It should be enough to show
that you were not deserted.

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:24.395
I've heard that
you are tough and violent.

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:28.608
But it seems they were wrong.

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.777
People say that you kill mercilessly.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.280
as if taking a life is
easier than lifting a spoon.

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.574
I just follow the king's order.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.703
How can a man have no reservations
about taking others’ lives?

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.414
Stop this nonsense.

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:44.707
and take some rest.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.187
Mom!

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.605
Mom!

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.274
Mom!

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.688
Do you want true revenge?

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.498
You really mean to
give me that ornament

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.709
- if I take out the kitten?
- Sure.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.505
My hand's are too big to do it myself.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:59.550
You will hear the meow.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.304
You go in alone.
I'll wait outside.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.703
Shush!

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.792
Don't move!

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.174
- You wench!
- Please help!

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.803
How dare you?

00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:31.809
Look at him.

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:37.190
The girl he raped the other time
turned out to be a civilian girl.

00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:39.692
And she reported him to
the district office.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:44.822
You should’ve been careful to target
only the lowest class girls!

00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:47.784
How are we supposed to tell them apart
just by appearance?

00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:52.413
We thought she was a slave
because she was dressed like one.

00:22:52.497 --> 00:22:53.498
Damn it.

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:58.503
Shouldn't we be allowed some fun
in the kingdom our fathers founded?

00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.296
Why is it so complicated?

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:01.714
Well. that happened...

00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:05.676
so let’s stop this
and go back to the red-light district.

00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:08.805
That’s fine with us.

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:13.226
but what about the king's son-in-law.
who has the full attention of

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:16.395
- his majesty?
- Damn it.

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.815
I never even wanted
to be the king's son-in-law.

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:20.441
What can you do?

00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:22.527
It’s your destiny.
with such powerful men

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.403
as your grandfather and father.

00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:26.280
Speaking of whom...

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:30.284
- have you heard the rumor?
- What rumor?

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:32.620
Well. a rumor has spread that

00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:37.875
his father popped
a courtesan’s cherry last night.

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:42.713
Are you serious?
I knew it.

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:46.384
He pretends to be so
serious and dignified...

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:54.684
but inside.
he’s the same as all other men.

00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:01.858
You know how I founded this country.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.693
Yes. your majesty.

00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:15.788
Your majesty.

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:23.254
I present you that sword

00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:24.422
because I want you to be

00:24:24.797 --> 00:24:27.884
tied to me
closer than even blood allows.

00:24:28.676 --> 00:24:32.305
I need you
more than anybody else

00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:34.348
for me and my crown prince.

00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:38.728
Hence. I abolish

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.772
the old military system
from the previous dynasty

00:24:41.856 --> 00:24:43.983
and have it restructured as
one great army

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.319
controlling three services.

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:49.280
Wield this sword for me
by my side.

00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:51.824
And protect the crown price with it.

00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:54.660
This is my first request
and royal command.

00:24:54.911 --> 00:24:58.664
And I now name Kim Min-jae.
commander of the right army.

00:24:58.748 --> 00:25:01.709
as the supreme commander
of the new great army.

00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:05.588
I shall obey the command.
your majesty.

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.894
How could he do this to me?

00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:21.854
To appoint me as the
Minister of Culture and Education

00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:24.106
when I’ve spent all my life
in the battle field!

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.776
This is more than just a demotion!

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.695
Great. Good.

00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:33.491
Lord Sambong and
Commander Kim Min-jae

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:36.285
will have the country
under their thumbs!

00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:38.704
That is not quite right.

00:25:39.497 --> 00:25:40.831
Kim Min-jae is...

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.875
only Lord Sambong's dog.

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.714
What I mean to say is...

00:25:48.798 --> 00:25:51.425
there’s no one who has
contributed more greatly to

00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:54.762
this kingdom’s establishment
than your highness.

00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:57.515
It makes me so upset
to see others but yourself

00:25:57.598 --> 00:26:00.893
control important state affairs
like proclaiming the crown prince.

00:26:02.812 --> 00:26:05.314
That's right.
You need to read the moves.

00:26:05.398 --> 00:26:07.400
- Just like that!
- My lord!

00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:12.488
I like being like this.
I mean it.

00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:14.615
But your highness!

00:26:17.285 --> 00:26:21.580
I need to get her service tonight
no matter what.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.375
Let her in whenever she's ready.

00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:27.878
But she has already served a man

00:26:28.504 --> 00:26:30.715
- and only sells her artistry.
- Hey!

00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:34.593
I told you to bring her in.
No matter what.

00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:37.179
Understood.

00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:10.713
Sir.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.298
Look there!

00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:16.677
What are you doing?
Come down quick!

00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:24.560
Even the lowest of lives
have rules to follow.

00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:28.814
and even a courtesan like I
have a heart to keep and protect.

00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:32.234
If you keep insisting on my service.

00:27:32.693 --> 00:27:35.279
I will jump off. right here.

00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:40.242
You think others will care

00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:43.704
or call you a virtuous woman
for dying like this?

00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:45.581
You'll be remembered

00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:49.460
as a mad girl who killed
herself for nothing.

00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:53.714
I’d rather be remembered
as a mad girl who killed herself

00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:55.800
than to sell my smiles

00:27:56.801 --> 00:27:58.511
in the arms of men like you!

00:27:58.594 --> 00:27:59.428
What?

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:03.808
Gahee!

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:05.309
Why are you doing this?

00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:08.396
Please don't.

00:28:08.813 --> 00:28:10.815
You can't do that.

00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:16.487
Gahee!

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:18.531
My lord!

00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:20.699
Please don't. sir!

00:28:20.783 --> 00:28:21.784
Sir!

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.777
Who can guarantee that

00:28:57.278 --> 00:28:59.155
something like this
won’t happen again?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.782
Ever since she became your woman.

00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:04.577
she rejected all requests

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:07.037
from all men

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:10.374
and carried this handkerchief
in her bosom every day.

00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:13.794
I plan to send her away

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.672
as soon as she recovers.

00:29:18.674 --> 00:29:20.384
How?

00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:25.806
Well. you are not planning to
take her into your custody.

00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:30.144
She. like all other girls here.

00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:32.271
can only survive

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.733
when the bees come for her honey.

00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:38.319
Scentless flowers
have no place here.

00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:43.282
I’m afraid I must tell her
to go find her own way.

00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:40.714
Are you so pure and innocent

00:30:40.798 --> 00:30:42.758
that you would trust a man?

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:46.804
How dare you. lowly thing.
try to drag the Lord down?

00:30:48.806 --> 00:30:51.350
In the end. this is what you needed.

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.395
Leave now and
do not ever come back

00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:56.564
unless you want to destroy
the Lord's future.

00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:09.785
I thought of what would be
the best for you. my Lord.

00:31:11.704 --> 00:31:15.374
You bestowed upon me so much kindness.

00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:17.501
The messenger from Chuihyang-roo.

00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:20.796
that I have become fond of you.

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:27.720
But I am afraid that I might
hold you back from great things...

00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:31.890
So. I send you my heart in this letter
before I take my leave.

00:31:32.683 --> 00:31:33.601
Please.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.477
be well.

00:31:37.688 --> 00:31:39.815
Lady Gahee!

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:48.490
Sir.

00:34:30.444 --> 00:34:34.531
I was wondering about you...
You're as beautiful as they say.

00:34:34.615 --> 00:34:36.116
You’re too generous. your highness.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.495
Make yourself at home
and be my friend.

00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:44.291
It’s not much.
but I prepared a gift for you.

00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:50.172
It’s ‘Retired Life’
by Wei Ying-wu.

00:34:50.506 --> 00:34:52.508
I heard that you are fond of poems.

00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:55.177
And thought you might enjoy it.
despite my humble skills.

00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:57.638
I don’t often tell people.

00:34:58.305 --> 00:35:00.224
but I write a little myself.

00:35:01.183 --> 00:35:02.810
What do you write?

00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:06.188
Just the small stories
of our world.

00:35:06.897 --> 00:35:08.774
Please take a look sometimes.

00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:11.193
Yes. your highness.

00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:13.362
His lordship.
King's son-in-law is here.

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:21.203
- So she is my father’s...
- Yes. sir.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.878
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Gahee.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.688
What were you two talking about?
You seemed really close.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.481
Please take a look.

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.112
The Noble and
the humble are different

00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:59.283
Yet both are of value--
for each fulfill their roles in life.

00:36:05.706 --> 00:36:07.708
Then. I will be taking my leave.

00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:20.888
What do you think?
Isn’t it impressive?

00:36:21.305 --> 00:36:22.598
Yes. it is.

00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.144
Very impressive. indeed.

00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:46.622
Instead of keeping a low profile
and minding your surroundings.

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.332
You bring a girl into your house!

00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:50.459
Did you forget that
we're the King's in-laws?

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:53.503
Such imprudent behavior
when you are to be helping

00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:55.672
the Crown Prince conquer the north!

00:36:56.798 --> 00:37:00.302
What would your life have
been like had I not taken you in?

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:03.180
No better than that of
wild beasts. I bet.

00:37:03.263 --> 00:37:06.183
mingling with those filthy barbarians.

00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:08.602
I even made you my son-in-law
knowing that

00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.729
your mother was
of barbarian heritage!

00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:14.775
Do you really think Jin could’ve been
the king’s son-in-law

00:37:16.485 --> 00:37:19.279
if I hadn’t accepted your offer?

00:37:21.698 --> 00:37:25.911
Are you threatening to reveal
that Jin is not your real son?

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:32.709
Are you trying to humiliate me
using my daughter's flaw?

00:37:33.377 --> 00:37:36.463
I would never have started all this
in the first place

00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:39.174
had I the slightest intention
of breaking my promise to you.

00:37:58.777 --> 00:38:00.862
What is the meaning of this?

00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:02.906
Please leave.

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:08.870
I never imagined that

00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:11.915
you could be my father’s concubine.

00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:17.796
I..I thought you were dead.

00:38:18.755 --> 00:38:20.632
I almost was...
but I survived.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:23.552
You know how wretched lives

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.347
live and die so arbitrarily.

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.730
Why did you disappear
so suddenly then?

00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:35.689
Do you know...

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.112
how desperately I
looked for you?

00:38:42.696 --> 00:38:45.198
Were you really so desperate?

00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:47.701
Of course.

00:38:50.203 --> 00:38:51.788
I’m so happy

00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:54.124
to have you by my side again.

00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:55.709
Although a concubine.

00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:58.503
I am your father’s woman now.

00:38:58.587 --> 00:39:00.630
Do you intend to commit immorality?

00:39:00.714 --> 00:39:02.299
Please leave.

00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:07.512
Lady. her highness
wishes to see you.

00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:28.784
Are you done reading?

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.328
How was it?

00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:32.537
Interesting.

00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:36.625
The story of the lord in exile
and the courtesan who loves him...

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.419
It's sad yet beautiful
at the same time.

00:39:41.213 --> 00:39:42.339
Good to hear.

00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:44.508
Anything else you want to add?

00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:47.677
- It reminded me of...
- Are you inside?

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:50.305
I'm sorry.

00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:58.396
I hope I didn't interrupt
your conversation.

00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:01.399
Not at all.
Please come in.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.696
Please. go on.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.117
When I was at courtesans' house.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.286
I heard a similar story like yours
from a silk peddler.

00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:15.413
- You did?
- Yes.

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:18.792
But that story was different...

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:21.795
How different?
Tell me.

00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:24.881
On his way home from exile.

00:40:25.382 --> 00:40:29.386
the noble man hurts the courtesan.
who he fears may hinder his success.

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.721
and returns alone.

00:40:31.805 --> 00:40:33.390
Poor thing.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.893
Is that the end?
Just like that?

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:39.604
But that courtesan survives

00:40:40.689 --> 00:40:42.691
And exacts revenge on the noble man.

00:40:43.692 --> 00:40:46.611
Really? How?

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.196
Well...

00:40:49.406 --> 00:40:51.324
I haven't heard that part yet.

00:40:51.408 --> 00:40:53.326
He promised to tell me
on his next visit.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.830
It’s just a story.
but I mourn for the girl.

00:40:56.913 --> 00:40:58.707
I doubt it’s true.

00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.626
- For a man to be so evil...
- You’re right.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.795
I’m sure it’s a made-up story.

00:41:04.379 --> 00:41:06.214
But be sure to tell me the ending

00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:08.091
when you hear it from
the peddler next time.

00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:09.801
I will. your highness.

00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:14.389
The dead girl came back to life.

00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:17.809
- Are you kidding me?
- Wait!

00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:19.811
So you're saying

00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:23.398
the girl you killed
for a cover up

00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:27.277
returned. alive.
as your father’s concubine.

00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:29.487
I thought something was off

00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.573
when you started
obsessing over one girl.

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:32.866
So unlike you.

00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:40.582
Damn it!

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.377
I shouldn’t have let myself be
blinded by her beauty.

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:49.299
I would be deadly scared
if I were you now.

00:41:50.258 --> 00:41:52.677
Shouldn't you inform
your mother about this?

00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:56.014
No. no.

00:41:56.598 --> 00:41:58.391
I’ll shut her up for good.

00:43:49.502 --> 00:43:50.712
Don’t come out!
It is dangerous!

00:44:21.576 --> 00:44:24.704
Who ordered you to do this?

00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:30.293
- Sir!
- Lady!

00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:33.380
Gahee!

00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:36.132
Gahee!

00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:44.808
- Call the doctor!
- Yes. sir.

00:44:47.811 --> 00:44:48.728
Lady...

00:44:48.812 --> 00:44:49.771
Lady.

00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:01.491
Assassins at the princess's residence!

00:45:01.783 --> 00:45:05.370
Who would dare send assassins
to the prime commander's house?

00:45:05.662 --> 00:45:08.331
We do need to find out who did this

00:45:08.415 --> 00:45:11.501
and make them to pay for their sins.

00:45:11.793 --> 00:45:15.713
But at the same time.
we can't ignore the fact that

00:45:15.797 --> 00:45:18.800
the servants of the prime commander
possessed swords

00:45:19.384 --> 00:45:22.429
when their master leads to abolish
all private armies of the noble.

00:45:22.512 --> 00:45:25.515
Are you calling the servants
private soldiers

00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:27.600
for raising swords
in protection of their master?

00:45:27.684 --> 00:45:31.479
Discovering who threatened the lives
of the prime commander and his family

00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:35.066
Is the first priority. your majesty.

00:45:35.608 --> 00:45:39.529
How are we to open an investigation
and find the culprit

00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:42.282
when all the assassins are dead?

00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:45.702
And servants with swords can't be
anything but private soldiers.

00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:48.830
It would be the right thing
for the prime commander

00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:51.708
to show initiative and vest
his servants to the great army.

00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:55.211
I have but myself to blame for this.

00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:58.715
I’ll send all the servants
related to this incident

00:45:59.507 --> 00:46:01.968
to the great army.
to prevent further issues.

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:03.887
I forbid

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.847
further discussion on this matter.

00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:09.267
I will strictly reprimand anyone
who mentions this incident again.

00:46:09.893 --> 00:46:11.478
So be it!

00:46:44.511 --> 00:46:46.721
Isn’t he the prime commander himself?

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:49.516
What led you to such humble settings?

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:52.769
I came to hunt together
as it's been a while.

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:55.688
I’d be more than happy to!
You're always welcome here.

00:46:56.689 --> 00:46:57.607
Let it begin!

00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:06.551
Your skills are as superb as ever.

00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:08.428
I was just lucky.

00:48:08.678 --> 00:48:10.430
Everyone here is very
nimble on their feet.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.683
They learn to be as fast
as the wild animals they chase.

00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:16.477
since they do nothing
but hunt everyday.

00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:18.396
Was it you

00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:21.399
who sent me the guests.
your highness?

00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:25.320
I’m sorry to hear
that you suspect so.

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.698
Why do you train and harbor
private soldiers like this?

00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.241
You misunderstand me...

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.827
I’m just enjoying myself.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.705
hunting animals
with these boys.

00:48:35.788 --> 00:48:38.416
Then please send them
to the great army.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.712
Why are you trying to set up

00:48:43.212 --> 00:48:45.590
a large scale military training
at a time like this?

00:48:45.882 --> 00:48:50.178
To unite all the military power
of the nation as one army.

00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:55.808
Are you trying to attack
the east of Liaohe River.

00:48:55.892 --> 00:48:59.520
or are you coveting the throne
for the young crown prince?

00:48:59.604 --> 00:49:01.731
You speak unwisely.

00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:02.815
Well...

00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:05.151
you might not understand

00:49:05.485 --> 00:49:07.779
the real reason for this training.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.241
As you are just
a henchman of Lord Sambong.

00:49:12.492 --> 00:49:15.620
Private soldiers are
dividing the nation's power...

00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:17.205
Min-jae.

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.793
Look here. Kim Min-jae.

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:28.257
I want to hear your thoughts.
not Lord Sambong’s.

00:49:28.675 --> 00:49:30.760
Is this man sitting in front of me

00:49:31.594 --> 00:49:33.304
Kim Min-jae

00:49:33.388 --> 00:49:35.515
or Lord Sambong. Jung Do-jeon?

00:49:39.185 --> 00:49:42.522
Are you satisfied with playing
Sambong’s right hand man?

00:49:42.814 --> 00:49:45.441
I don't belong to anyone.

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:49.320
I just serve the king

00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:51.572
and protect the people
with my sword.

00:49:55.493 --> 00:49:57.620
I hope you are speaking the truth.

00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:04.877
Are you that happy?

00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:08.506
Yes. I am. sir.

00:50:09.298 --> 00:50:12.677
I didn’t expect other lords
to assist me that much.

00:50:14.804 --> 00:50:16.097
Lord Ha said...

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:16.723
Yes?

00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:18.808
How could we
investigate the dead

00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:21.477
and who would we blame?

00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:26.607
I wonder though...

00:50:26.691 --> 00:50:29.110
who would get rid of

00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:31.195
the dog's bowl
when the dog dies?

00:50:31.279 --> 00:50:33.281
Of course the owner should...

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:36.409
Did you really think
it would be as simple

00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:38.202
as killing a hound

00:50:38.286 --> 00:50:41.122
by setting some mutts on it. my lord?

00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:58.347
If they had killed that girl then.

00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:02.226
do you think you can sit there

00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:04.604
and have this drink

00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:07.190
with me?

00:51:07.815 --> 00:51:11.778
It's quite amusing that
your lordship's security depends

00:51:12.612 --> 00:51:13.905
upon this mad girl’s life.

00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:24.874
Inscrutable are the workings of Fate.

00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:27.627
This incident will

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.837
make things easier for us.

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:34.217
Do you know who
Kim Min-jae’s mother was?

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.345
She was a Jurchen geisha.

00:51:38.346 --> 00:51:42.141
A man naturally longs for
his mother's love.

00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:46.729
Sir. it seems that we are not alone.

00:51:47.647 --> 00:51:48.815
I know.

00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:13.631
Your highness surely takes after
his majesty. a god of archery!

00:52:13.714 --> 00:52:18.219
I think it’s about time
for the peony to bloom.

00:52:30.606 --> 00:52:33.025
Lady. a message arrived

00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:35.820
saying the silk peddler
is at the linen shop.

00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:41.409
- Wait here.
- Yes. ma'am.

00:52:55.715 --> 00:52:57.216
Are you there?

00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:03.222
Anyone here?

00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:18.237
What brought you here?

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.752
We should finish...

00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:36.422
what we couldn't finish last time.

00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:49.226
Do you mean something

00:53:50.353 --> 00:53:51.812
like this?

00:53:53.648 --> 00:53:54.732
Yes.

00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:58.736
Now we are talking.

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.613
Are you aware that

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.325
such immoral acts
are punishable by death?

00:54:05.326 --> 00:54:06.619
Of course.

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:08.746
The one who committed the sin

00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:13.125
and the counter-part.
both get beheaded.

00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.212
That’s why

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:20.424
you and I should conspire

00:54:20.508 --> 00:54:24.845
to survive together.

00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:40.653
There’s no way out for you this time.

00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:42.446
No one will come in.

00:54:43.656 --> 00:54:45.116
Forget the peddler.

00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:48.411
It was a false message
I made up to lure you out.

00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.420
Peddler? What peddler?

00:54:58.879 --> 00:55:02.341
Did you really believe that story?

00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:08.347
What do you...

00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:10.141
I just made it up

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:14.729
to entertain the poor princess.

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:18.733
We need an excuse

00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:22.737
to have fun. don't you think?

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.740
Yes. you're right.
Absolutely right.

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:29.118
But before you take
what you want

00:55:30.244 --> 00:55:34.540
you need to give me
something in return.

00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:39.211
I will give you...

00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:41.338
whatever you want.

00:55:44.717 --> 00:55:48.220
Give me this
as a token of your affection.

00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:50.639
But that is...

00:55:51.432 --> 00:55:52.808
given by his majesty. the King.

00:55:57.313 --> 00:55:59.732
It’s a token to show
that we both risked our lives.

00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:04.820
It has to be as valuable as this.

00:56:08.908 --> 00:56:10.409
Right...

00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:19.418
Whatever you say.

00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:07.216
Oh. my...

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.343
What are you doing?

00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:12.138
I’m sorry. sir.

00:57:12.513 --> 00:57:14.140
It is my fault...

00:57:15.224 --> 00:57:16.142
Did you laugh?

00:57:17.476 --> 00:57:18.394
Pardon?

00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:20.813
No. your grace.

00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:25.109
You laughed at me?

00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:28.612
Laugh?

00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:31.532
How dare you?

00:57:31.824 --> 00:57:33.117
What are you doing?

00:57:38.622 --> 00:57:39.540
This bastard...

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:41.625
he put dirt on my shoe
and laughed.

00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:45.421
It is my fault. sir.

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:49.133
You heard him?
It is his fault.

00:57:49.592 --> 00:57:52.052
This old man looked after you
like you were his own

00:57:52.136 --> 00:57:53.721
since you were born.

00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:55.431
Follow me.

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:00.644
Fa..father.

00:58:09.737 --> 00:58:10.821
Come to the next market.

00:58:11.614 --> 00:58:13.741
Uncle! Look at this.

00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.159
I got these at dawn

00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:18.120
and it's still fresh!
What do you think?

00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:37.139
Get up.

00:58:41.644 --> 00:58:42.728
Try to block me.

00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:52.821
Get up! Now!

00:58:54.323 --> 00:58:56.742
Father. it's all my fault!

00:58:56.825 --> 00:58:58.661
Princess. move aside.
I am disciplining my son.

00:58:58.744 --> 00:59:02.122
Please reprimand me
and my lack of virtue

00:59:02.206 --> 00:59:03.624
for not serving my husband properly.

00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:05.542
This has nothing to do with you.
princess.

00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:07.628
What is this fuss all about?

00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:13.842
Sir.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.304
He is the king's son-in-law
before he is your son.

00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:21.225
It's really embarrassing to do this
in front of all the servants!

00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:23.644
Your overprotection allows him
to abuse his subjects

00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:25.437
and mingle with vulgar people

00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:27.523
when he cannot even properly
draw a sword!

00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:31.360
I never wanted to be
the king’s son-in-law!

00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:32.611
What do you want from me?

00:59:35.239 --> 00:59:36.115
My lord!

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.042
Do you treat him so
because he is not your real son?

00:59:47.126 --> 00:59:48.711
Do you really think that way?

00:59:49.128 --> 00:59:50.129
If not.

00:59:50.629 --> 00:59:53.757
there is no reason for you
to overreact like this.

00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:57.636
I have never considered Jin
as anything but my son.

00:59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.764
The problem lies in you
and your presumptions.

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:03.225
I didn’t say anything
because I know my own mistakes.

01:00:03.726 --> 01:00:06.228
but it is quite hilarious
to hear that from a man

01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:08.230
who is enthralled by a concubine.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.274
I can put up with all else

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.735
but I will not tolerate
your abuse of my son.

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:18.115
I hope you don’t forget who it was

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.535
that allowed you to come this far.

01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:27.541
I ask...

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.337
for whose benefit was it truly for?

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.313
It's Gahee. your highness.

01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:51.315
May I come in?

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:53.817
Please come.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:05.662
I was worried about you.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:09.208
Don't just suffer patiently.
Please. tell me your thoughts.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:11.543
No. it's okay.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.713
What can I possibly say?

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.846
So please.
I hope you can forget about today too.

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.140
I will.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.810
But since you are here.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.145
we shall chat all night.

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:34.316
- Have you met the peddler?
- Yes.

01:01:34.817 --> 01:01:37.111
I heard the ending.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.614
So what happened to that courtesan?

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:47.246
The noble man’s mother
heard of the incident

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.123
and hired a man...

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.709
Please let me in!

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:56.630
The poor girl’s mother
who tried to appeal the injustice

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.215
was hurt.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.134
Mother!

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:02.719
Mo...mother!

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:08.809
The bearer mistook

01:02:09.435 --> 01:02:10.811
the mother

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.147
as the courtesan.

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.835
But how could that happen?

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.339
Maybe it was Heaven's will.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.342
Her mother died for her.

01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:45.846
How would your highness

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:49.349
end this story if it were yours?

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:52.436
Well...

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.481
I cannot think of anything

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.108
as it is too sad and heartbreaking.

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:05.616
Failed again.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:09.119
I really want to be good
at archery like you. brother!

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:15.292
Your skills should improve rapidly

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.503
if you take after his majesty.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:21.131
Here comes his majesty. the King.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:22.299
Father!

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:37.105
I told you not to come to the palace
unless summoned.

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:38.774
Why is that?

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:44.488
You made me bloody my hands
when the situation called for it.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.449
But now that it's over.
I guess you don't need a son

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:50.536
with blood on his hands.

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:51.537
How dare you!

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.710
Please restrain your anger.
your majesty.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.422
You frightened

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.133
our precious crown prince.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:20.524
Min-jae.

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:23.318
Look here. Kim Min-jae.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:27.781
Are you satisfied with playing
Sambong’s right hand man?

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.700
I hope you don’t forget who it was

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.160
that allowed you to come this far.

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:50.220
You look pensive.

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:55.309
What is bothering you?

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:57.811
No.

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:01.815
I was just thinking about the past.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:04.735
By the way.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:08.280
it's been quite a while
since you moved in with me.

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:11.908
Did you inform
your mother about this?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.204
Well...

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:18.123
If you have lost contact.

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:20.834
I can find her for you.

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:25.547
It would not take long
if I send out a few people.

01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:31.511
You cannot find her.

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:38.310
Did you spread her ashes
in that river?

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:40.646
Yes.

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:53.325
Lord. please don't...

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.133
You should have told me sooner!

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.428
I couldn’t speak of her

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.890
as it broke my heart.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:20.519
I am sorry.

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:25.440
No.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:30.487
I promise now...
I’ll protect you.

01:06:32.114 --> 01:06:34.241
Against any threat.

01:06:36.118 --> 01:06:38.286
I'll definitely keep you safe.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:10.444
- Lady..
- Stop!

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:14.114
What are you doing?
Burn everything!

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:19.327
Please calm down. sir.

01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:25.125
It’s dangerous. my lord!

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:53.737
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.823 --> 01:08:00.744
But thankfully
it’s just burnt on the edge.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.415
I'm sorry for your mother.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.720
Why did you do that?

01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:21.139
It’s your mother’s relics!

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.142
What am I to do...

01:08:25.811 --> 01:08:28.146
if you continue being this way?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.446
It is already enough
that I can do this for you.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.408
I’m only sorry that

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:42.619
I can’t give you more.

01:09:58.528 --> 01:09:59.738
I had a dream.

01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:03.491
What kind of dream?

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.786
People were gathered and
dancing together.

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:11.458
There seemed to be no need
for drawing one’s sword.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.252
no need for hurting others.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:20.842
Everyone just mingled together
as equals. enjoying themselves.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:28.224
You and I were there

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:31.227
hand in hand
smiling at each other.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:40.320
And I felt the warmth
of your hand.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.531
It is a good dream.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.416
Gahee...

01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:57.837
I can feel your grief.

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:02.550
I just want to live with you

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:05.345
as we did in that dream.

01:11:18.233 --> 01:11:19.734
I won’t let go of this hand

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:23.113
no matter what.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.744
Can you promise the same?

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:34.124
Yes. my lord.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:01.192
It’s been a while since
we sat down together.

01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:04.320
Yes. indeed.

01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:08.533
So what made you

01:12:08.616 --> 01:12:11.327
come visit this old man?

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:14.122
I asked a question
to the prime commander

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:17.542
when he visited me last.
but couldn’t hear the answer.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:20.879
So. today I am here
to hear it from you.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.719
What is the real reason
for the formation training?

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.429
To build the great Joseon Dynasty

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:33.224
by attacking the east of Liaohe River.

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:35.810
I think I've heard this story before.

01:12:36.478 --> 01:12:37.812
What do you mean?

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.106
The story of a troop
who left for Liaohe River

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.484
but returned to launch a surprise
attack against the capital.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:46.362
You’ve gone too far.
Are you implying that

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.823
I have some other goal in mind?

01:12:49.324 --> 01:12:50.325
No.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:13:00.376
This way or that way we go.
does it make a difference

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.963
if we could live happily
for a century to come?

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:08.468
You know what happened the last time
I recited this poem to someone?

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:14.808
Recently a group has been
training private soldiers

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.518
using hunting and polo
as excuses.

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:19.187
I believe that we must

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.522
punish them severely

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.483
and right military discipline

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.568
to re-establish order in
in our nation.

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:29.405
Outlawing hunting and polo
for military appropriation

01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:32.283
would demoralize
meritorious retainers

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:34.327
and turn them into enemies.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.746
Do you mean that
you can do whatever you want

01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:39.374
if you contributed to building
the new kingdom?

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:44.462
I forbid hunting and polo as of today.

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:47.632
Confiscate all weapons and horses
used for them.

01:13:51.136 --> 01:13:54.347
I’m here to deliver
his majesty’s order.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:57.475
He ordered all horses
but those required for transportation

01:13:57.559 --> 01:13:59.144
to belong to the great army

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:02.147
and also forbid
hunting and polo.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.233
What did you just say?

01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:08.695
Forbid what?

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.822
Hunting and polo.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:16.327
Forbid hunting and polo.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.247
What made his majesty

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:22.208
so very weak?

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:33.678
Can I decide
which horse to keep?

01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:35.221
Yes. sir.

01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:37.432
Thank you.

01:16:01.516 --> 01:16:02.809
Look. Min-jae.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:11.651
I only have the one horse left

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:14.529
and thus have none more to give out.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:16.823
What to do?

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:28.835
Don’t underestimate Prince Jung-an.

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:33.423
We can’t stop him this way.

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.719
At this rate. he might strike back.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:41.222
Then we are the ones in danger!

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:44.726
We didn't found this dynasty
to be killed by him!

01:16:45.727 --> 01:16:47.437
I think it's the time.

01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:50.648
Before we attack
the east of Liaohe River

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.611
we should hit
Prince Jung-an first.

01:16:57.739 --> 01:17:00.408
But when? The timing is crucial.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.122
The day of the white monkey.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:08.124
Day of the white monkey.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:11.627
As everyone will be enjoying
the feast all night.

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:14.714
we can attack while
taking advantage of the commotion.

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:19.427
They must know it. too.
They would not miss this chance

01:17:21.179 --> 01:17:23.431
to mobilize their army.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:26.309
We can finish everything by afternoon

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.480
before his majesty wakes up.

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:33.691
Do you think we can succeed?

01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:37.737
It's solely up to
the prime commander.

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:53.836
Wield this sword for me
by my side.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.339
And protect the crown prince with it.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:59.342
This is my first request
and royal command.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:04.055
Don't forget who raised an animal
to be human today.

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:07.809
You shall risk your life
for me and the king.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:13.648
This is the scent bag that his majesty
gave to his son-in-law.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.748
The time has almost come

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:36.129
for us to carry out our plans.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.048
I'll notify you in advance.

01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:41.592
When your plan is accomplished.

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:43.344
not only will Kim’s clan fall.

01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:46.139
but the entire army of this country
will be paralyzed.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:47.807
Then...

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.811
what would happen
to the prime commander?

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:58.818
What... do you think?

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.137
I shall leave

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.140
as it is already quite late.

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:56.542
She is the girl I told you about.

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:21.108
Treat this as your mother
and your duty from now on.

01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:24.237
Do not ever forget

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:26.614
how your mother died.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:31.118
It's a peony.
Engrave it into your memory.

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:39.335
Thankfully.
it’s just burnt on the edge.

01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:10.658
No doubt that Prince Jung-an will
attack with his private soldiers.

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:12.910
He will probably aim
for the east gate.

01:21:12.994 --> 01:21:15.246
Call in troops from outside the city
and assign them inside the palace.

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:18.207
- You should be fully prepared.
- Here it is. commander.

01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:31.846
I would like to meet you discretely
on the day of the white monkey.

01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:36.392
I knew it.
She's no different from the others.

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:43.608
Is it the medicine for the princess?

01:21:44.317 --> 01:21:45.318
Yes. sir.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:48.446
I see. give it to me.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.740
I'll deliver it myself.

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:55.036
I don't think I can
attend the feast

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:57.413
as I feel suddenly dizzy.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:01.042
Don't worry.
I'll explain to the king

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.210
so that he doesn't worry.

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:10.551
Your highness. Kim Min-jae
has started to move.

01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:15.514
- How long did I sleep?
- A bit less than 2 hours.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:22.313
Even the Heavens shall never know

01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:25.441
what you are about to do tonight.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:44.335
I pay my respects to
your majesty and your highness.

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.297
Where is the princess?

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:51.592
She could not come as she is ill.
She sends her regards.

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:54.053
What a shame. is she very ill?

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:55.763
It’s not a serious condition.

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:58.641
She seemed to feel dizzy
as she is a bit feeble.

01:22:59.517 --> 01:23:01.268
If sister is very ill.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:04.230
please send her some herbal medicine.
your majesty.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:06.107
Sure.

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:10.820
Due to that...

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:15.241
I would like to return
and attend to her...

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.742
Of course. go ahead.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.371
He's such a sweet husband.

01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:28.629
Any messages from the peony?

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.841
We just sent the soldiers
to the appointed location.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.022
- Is everything ready?
- Yes. sir.

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:48.733
Everything is perfectly prepared.

01:23:57.283 --> 01:23:59.118
I'll forgive you
for what you did last time.

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:01.120
However...

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:04.123
You shall fulfill
your end of the deal today.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.504
I hate getting the
short end of the stick.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:16.886
I gave you your token. so now you need
to give me something in return.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.191
I changed my mind.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:34.153
I think I prefer your father
since he. at least. is not

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:35.821
a complete piece of scum.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.531
Scum?

01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:42.620
Are you crazy?

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:46.457
Say that again.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.628
Huh? Repeat what you just said
with that filthy mouth of yours!

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:52.338
This filthy mouth.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.839
I shall reap this...

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.520
Attack!

01:26:18.132 --> 01:26:18.841
What's the fuss?

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:20.509
Go and find out now!

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:53.250
Your majesty. your highness.

01:26:53.334 --> 01:26:54.418
you should shelter yourselves.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.715
What are you looking at?
Go and guard the king!

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:03.552
Stop right now!

01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:05.554
Your majesty.
they plotted treason against you.

01:27:05.638 --> 01:27:07.848
No. that cannot be true.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:11.518
It is Prince Jung-an
who raised the armies!

01:27:11.602 --> 01:27:12.728
Sambong!

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:16.565
How dare you lie
in front of the king?

01:27:17.816 --> 01:27:20.194
Bang-won. how dare you?

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:22.446
Your majesty. Kim Min-jae
assigned soldiers at the east gate

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:24.531
plotting treason against you!

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:26.408
It's slander. your majesty!

01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:28.410
If he is not plotting treason.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:30.329
why are these soldiers
inside the palace

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:32.748
and not guarding the outer walls.
as they should?

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:39.254
Lord Sambong and Kim Min-jae
plotted to kill me and other lords

01:27:39.338 --> 01:27:42.549
who found out about
the adultery of Kim Jin.

01:27:42.633 --> 01:27:45.636
their heir and
your majesty’s son-in-law.

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:47.513
What are you talking about?

01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:51.642
Who’s having an affair with whom?

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.355
How could I believe you.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:58.649
telling me my son-in-law
committed adultery?

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:00.234
Your majesty.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.237
I have undeniable proof.

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:21.380
Bring them in!

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:23.507
Here are the accused!

01:28:34.435 --> 01:28:35.519
Princess!

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.146
Father!

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:56.123
I declare the end of the feast.

01:28:56.623 --> 01:28:58.125
Imprison the sinners

01:28:58.751 --> 01:28:59.710
and the rest of you...

01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:02.337
return home!

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:38.207
How could such a thing happen?

01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:51.637
Whose letter is it?

01:29:53.347 --> 01:29:54.640
Lady Gahee told me

01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:58.435
to give this to your highness
at 9 PM.

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:02.773
You will find out
how the tale ends

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:06.777
if you come to the warehouse now.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.125
Wife!

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.417
Don't!

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:24.711
I will listen to what she has to say.

01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:27.506
My dear. I...I just...

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:30.759
that bitch seduced me...

01:30:30.843 --> 01:30:32.219
Her state doesn't look like

01:30:33.804 --> 01:30:35.848
that of a seducer.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:38.517
So tell me.

01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:41.812
why did you make me find out?

01:30:42.688 --> 01:30:43.814
Can your highness

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:47.526
forgive the husband
who cheated you

01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:51.446
and stay with him all your life?

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:53.115
How dare you?

01:30:54.158 --> 01:30:56.743
I can put you to death
if I talk to his majesty. the king.

01:30:57.327 --> 01:31:00.622
I do not wish for my own life.

01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:03.625
But I didn't want to harm Lord Kim

01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:07.629
and this was only solution
I could come up with.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.841
Please understand this.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:15.846
I do not care about myself.
but Lord Kim...please save him.

01:31:16.847 --> 01:31:17.848
Who are you?

01:31:23.729 --> 01:31:28.150
That's all I know.

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:32.237
I knew Bang-won was up to something...

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:37.117
We should’ve never given him
the opportunity.

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:43.332
That is why I put my faith in you
and asked for your protection.

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:47.502
Is this your answer

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:49.755
to my sincere request?

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.590
Kill me. your majesty.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:53.133
I will spare your life

01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:54.843
as the princess requested.

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:58.639
But you will have to kill the girl

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.225
discretely within the night.

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.520
Why are you silent?

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.528
Do you intend to defy
a royal command?

01:32:14.279 --> 01:32:16.657
Are you trying to put me and the
crown prince in danger

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:19.409
by giving them an excuse
to overthrow us?

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:22.120
Kill the witness!

01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:24.122
It is the royal command!

01:33:09.793 --> 01:33:12.546
So it was all planned
from the beginning.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.717
Did you truly use me to
take revenge for your mother?

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:19.511
Tell me.

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:23.807
The truth will not
make a difference now.

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:27.144
You know too well

01:33:27.728 --> 01:33:30.731
that even if I were to deny it all.
it’s too late to change anything.

01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.275
Do you really want me to kill you?

01:33:33.859 --> 01:33:37.696
If I were afraid of death.
I would not have started at all.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:39.740
If I have sinned.

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:42.034
It would be that I was born
a low-class peasant girl

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:44.119
and survived.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.331
How can it be a sin?

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:50.208
It is for a wench like me.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:54.129
Because I am not even human
in their eyes.

01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:59.343
This country values a cow
more than three peasant lives.

01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:03.597
Nobody is punished for
raping and killing a slave girl.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.727
but you die
if you rape your father's concubine.

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:14.608
You mean during all those times
that we shared together...

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:20.322
you never loved me?
Not even for a moment?

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:23.575
I died when my mother died.

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:29.247
I cannot forgive her murder even if
Kim Jin pays for it with his life.

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:34.211
I will do anything
to make him pay for his sins.

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:37.130
This is...

01:34:39.341 --> 01:34:41.134
all I can say.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.521
No.

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:56.733
If so.
why would you inform the princess.

01:34:57.526 --> 01:34:59.111
You were risking the plan

01:35:00.237 --> 01:35:04.116
in order to save me!

01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:05.826
Just kill me.

01:35:06.535 --> 01:35:09.162
Only when I die. can you live.

01:35:09.246 --> 01:35:10.247
Enough.

01:35:11.123 --> 01:35:12.833
Do not forgive me.

01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:21.842
I will never

01:35:23.677 --> 01:35:25.345
forgive you.

01:35:29.683 --> 01:35:31.143
So...

01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:35.313
you need to live.

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:50.245
Your highness. please...

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:57.294
I told everyone to return home!

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:11.349
The girl and Kim Min-jae ran away.
your majesty.

01:36:13.727 --> 01:36:15.312
What will you do

01:36:16.813 --> 01:36:18.732
with that Kim Min-jae

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:21.693
who ran away
disobeying the royal command?

01:36:25.322 --> 01:36:27.532
Rest assured.
From now on.

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:42.839
I. your son.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:46.635
shall handle everything.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.406
So you are claiming innocence?

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:10.534
This is really unfair.

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:16.331
I frightened her a bit to get back

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:19.125
what that bitch
stole from me.

01:37:19.209 --> 01:37:20.418
I see.

01:37:23.713 --> 01:37:27.342
I will believe you.
for you are my husband.

01:37:28.635 --> 01:37:32.138
I will explain to my father. the King.
and ask for his forgiveness.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:34.140
Thank you. my love.

01:37:48.738 --> 01:37:50.407
But since sometime back...

01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:54.536
you no longer bore the smell
of the scent bag.

01:37:58.331 --> 01:37:59.249
That is...

01:37:59.332 --> 01:38:00.625
And instead.

01:38:02.127 --> 01:38:04.421
I could smell it on Gahee.

01:38:08.842 --> 01:38:11.636
I didn’t mention anything
as such a thing was...

01:38:13.847 --> 01:38:16.600
beyond human imagination.

01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:22.147
Only if you had told the truth
just now.

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:27.319
I might not have come this far.

01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:42.542
Ignite!

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:46.212
Fire!

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:21.289
Watch out!

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:31.508
Please give me the chance
to get rid of him.

01:39:49.776 --> 01:39:50.860
Please get on the boat. sir.

01:39:53.613 --> 01:39:54.698
I won’t go without you.

01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:56.908
Go first.
I'll follow if I survive.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.411
How could I go alone
and leave you behind?

01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:06.793
Don’t worry.

01:40:08.795 --> 01:40:10.296
I won't be long.

01:40:12.215 --> 01:40:15.301
So be sure to survive.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:22.684
No!

01:40:25.812 --> 01:40:28.398
My lord!

01:40:31.693 --> 01:40:32.777
Lord!

01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:35.905
My lord. please!

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:39.284
Sir!

01:40:41.578 --> 01:40:42.579
My lord!

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:50.712
No! My lord!

01:41:26.164 --> 01:41:27.457
Hurry. sir!

01:42:30.687 --> 01:42:32.897
Lord!

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.400
Come here! Come to me!

01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:36.776
Please hide!

01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:39.487
Lord!

01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:40.780
My lord...

01:42:44.284 --> 01:42:47.579
I promised to protect you.

01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:53.418
What are you doing. my lord...

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:55.795
No matter what happens...

01:42:56.713 --> 01:42:58.131
I made a pledge to you.

01:42:58.214 --> 01:42:59.299
My lord!

01:43:57.482 --> 01:43:58.775
No. my lord!

01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:13.391
No!

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.309
No!

01:46:21.793 --> 01:46:23.377
I won't let go of this hand

01:46:24.796 --> 01:46:26.798
no matter what.

01:46:29.175 --> 01:46:33.596
- Can you promise the same?
- Yes. my lord.

01:46:53.699 --> 01:46:55.368
I had a dream.

01:46:56.786 --> 01:46:59.205
What kind of dream?

01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:04.377
People were gathered and
dancing together.

01:47:05.711 --> 01:47:07.755
There seemed to be no need

01:47:08.714 --> 01:47:11.217
for drawing one’s sword.

01:47:11.676 --> 01:47:14.178
No need for hurting others.

01:47:15.513 --> 01:47:21.144
Everyone just mingled together
as equals. enjoying themselves.

01:47:22.478 --> 01:47:25.481
You and I were there

01:47:26.399 --> 01:47:29.152
hand in hand
smiling at each other.

01:47:35.408 --> 01:47:36.784
It is a good dream.

01:47:39.704 --> 01:47:42.206
I would like to go there

01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:45.543
with you. my lord.

01:48:26.792 --> 01:48:29.795
They could not
find the bodies.

01:48:35.176 --> 01:48:36.302
I see.

01:48:38.804 --> 01:48:40.223
Let the names of

01:48:40.806 --> 01:48:42.892
Kim Mn-Jae and his family

01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:46.479
be omitted from all records.

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:50.483
And in his place.

01:48:51.275 --> 01:48:52.902
put the names of

01:48:55.488 --> 01:48:58.407
his adjutant. Lee Je.
and Lord Sambong.

01:48:59.784 --> 01:49:02.286
As you command!

01:49:27.186 --> 01:49:31.565
November 1400. Prince Jung-an.
Lee Bang-won ascended to the throne.

01:49:31.649 --> 01:49:36.279
He is Joseon Dynasty’s 3rd king.
Taejong the Great.
