00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.742
"thinking about
these wonderful things.

170
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:53.372
"'My darling. ' she said at last.
are you sure you don't mind

171
00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:55.707
"'being a mouse
for the rest of your life?'

172
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:58.751
"'I don't mind at all. ' I said.

173
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.796
"'It doesn't matter who you are
or what you look like.

174
00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:02.756
'as long as somebody
loves you.'"

175
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.731
- Felix. get up! Felix!
- [moans]

176
00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:21.275
Get up! I need your help.

177
00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:22.734
[lift bell dings]

178
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.738
So. when you see her.
you breathe as Darth Vader

179
00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:27.780
and then you say...

180
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.073
FELIX: "Hello. Aunty Sara.

181
00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:31.493
I am Darth Vader.
May the Force be with us."

182
00:07:31.494 --> 00:07:32.535
Do it properly. Felix.

183
00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:34.079
When the mask is on.
you remain in character.

184
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.746
[gruffly]:
"Hello. Aunty Sara.

185
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.541
I am Darth Vader.
May the Force be with us."

186
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:41.753
Yeah! Daniel Day-Lewis just
came everywhere in his pants!

187
00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:44.255
Okay. Now. can you hold up the sign?

188
00:07:44.256 --> 00:07:46.758
I'll come in and take care of the rest.

189
00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.758
Yes. Uncle David.

190
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.762
I mean... [gruffly]
...yes. Uncle David.

191
00:07:50.763 --> 00:07:51.763
All right.

192
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.933
Do it. Darth.

193
00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.769
[Felix breathes like Darth Vader]

194
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.646
[screams]
MAN: What...?

195
00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:01.523
FELIX [gruffly]:
Aunty Sara.

196
00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:02.648
Felix?!

197
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.734
I am Darth Vader.

198
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:06.486
Felix. what are you doing here?

199
00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.362
What? No!

200
00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.741
What the fuck are you doing?!
- I live here!

201
00:08:10.742 --> 00:08:12.743
Yeah. well...
who the fuck is that?!

202
00:08:12.744 --> 00:08:14.744
- Rory.
- That's Rory from work.

203
00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.247
Well. do me a favor and get Rory
from work out of your vagina!

204
00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:19.124
- Don't go anywhere. Rory.
- Is this Dave?

205
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.791
Yeah. hi. Rory. I'm Dave.

206
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.877
I'm Sara's boyfriend
of nine fucking years.

207
00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:24.546
Can you watch your language
around the kid. please?

208
00:08:24.547 --> 00:08:26.798
FELIX: I am not a kid.
I am Darth Vader.

209
00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:28.717
May the Force be with us.

210
00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:31.220
DAVE:
Oh. yeah.

211
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.639
Yeah. you fucked up. didn't you. Sara?

212
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.931
Because I was gonna marry you.

213
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:36.767
I was possibly gonna give you a baby.

214
00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:38.726
I even made this engagement ring

215
00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.479
out of a pipe-cleaner
I found under Felix's bed.

216
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.771
No. you do this.

217
00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:44.733
You say one thing.
You never come through.

218
00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:46.776
Hello? I was just about to!

219
00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:49.738
I don't mean marriage and a baby. Dave!

220
00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:51.280
I needed you to love me.

221
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.533
And you're incapable of loving
anyone but yourself.

222
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.911
At least I'm not stuffing
real estate agent dick in me

223
00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:56.744
the first chance I get!

224
00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.413
RORY: That's enough.
- Oh. what are you gonna do?!

225
00:08:58.414 --> 00:09:00.915
You need to watch your language!

226
00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:02.793
You need to stop having sex
in front of kids!

227
00:09:02.794 --> 00:09:03.835
Don't talk to Rory like that.

228
00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:05.796
Rory is more in touch
with his emotional self

229
00:09:05.797 --> 00:09:06.921
than you'll ever be.

230
00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:09.758
The only thing Rory is in touch
with is your slutty vagina!

231
00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:11.217
- Not cool.
- Yeah?

232
00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.761
"Not cool" this. motherfuck...

233
00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:13.929
Arggh! Jesus!

234
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.096
Arggh! Arggh!

235
00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:16.640
Oh. God! Fuck!
RORY: That's it.

236
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:17.765
Calm down!
DAVE: Yuck!

237
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:18.808
Your dick's on my arm!
Your sweaty dick!

238
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:20.768
RORY: It's disrespectful!
DAVE: Shit! No. shit! Okay!

239
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.770
Come on. easy. buddy!
RORY: Are you gonna behave yourself?

240
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.773
DAVE: There's a kid here. man! Ohh!
RORY: Are we good now?

241
00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:26.733
Yes?
DAVE: Arggh! Yeah. yeah. Yeah.

242
00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:27.775
[Dave groans]

243
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.778
RORY:
I'm sorry I had to resort to violence.

244
00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:30.820
DAVE: Fucking Rory!

245
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.780
Violence is never the answer.

246
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.784
FELIX: If you only knew
the power of the Dark Side.

247
00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:36.784
DAVE: Fucking...

248
00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.705
I gave you the best years of my life!

249
00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.749
You saw how much bush was thrown
at me when I was in a band.

250
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.791
That was 10 years ago!

251
00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.294
Stop going on about the band.
It's pathetic.

252
00:09:46.295 --> 00:09:48.797
Yeah. well. I never screwed anyone else.

253
00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:50.757
I chose to be with you.

254
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:54.720
There is a big difference
between being with someone

255
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:56.722
and being there <i>for</i> someone. Dave.

256
00:09:56.723 --> 00:09:57.722
RORY: Mmm.

257
00:09:57.723 --> 00:09:59.766
I hope you grow up enough
one day to realize that.

258
00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:01.768
I don't need to do that! You do!

259
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.730
Fucking idiots!

260
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:13.071
Don't ever expect to see me
back here again!

261
00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.747
Felix?
FELIX: I am not Felix. I am Darth Vader.

262
00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:23.269
DAVE: Darth Vader. now!

263
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.791
[breathes like Darth Vader]

264
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.838
DAVE:
Oh. I don't know.

265
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.466
FELIX: Mommy!
- [sighs]

266
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.761
I've been trying to call you.
Where the hell have you been?

267
00:10:35.762 --> 00:10:38.721
FELIX: Uncle David took me
to see Aunty Sara.

268
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.766
Yeah. and guess what Aunty Sara
was doing when we got there?

269
00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:42.893
Having sex with a real estate agent.

270
00:10:42.894 --> 00:10:45.019
- Hang on. What?
- Yeah. I know!

271
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.648
You woke my son up so he could
go see two people having sex?

272
00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:49.315
No. not specifically.

273
00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:51.777
The naked man punched
Uncle Dave on the nose

274
00:10:51.778 --> 00:10:54.696
'cause Aunty Sara has a slutty vagina.

275
00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:55.780
I don't believe this.

276
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:57.740
I know. It's unbelievable!

277
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.033
I mean. how could she do this to me?

278
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:02.746
If you can't understand
how incredibly inappropriate it is

279
00:11:02.747 --> 00:11:04.373
to take your nephew out
in the middle of the night.

280
00:11:04.374 --> 00:11:05.623
then you can find
somewhere else to stay.

281
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:08.377
What are you talking about?
He had a great time!

282
00:11:08.378 --> 00:11:09.836
Look. he's Darth Vader!

283
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.192
I am your father. Mommy.

284
00:11:11.193 --> 00:11:12.547
See? He's really good at it.

285
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:15.759
It's late.
I have a double shift tomorrow.

286
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:18.470
Get out of my house.

287
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.390
[sobs]

288
00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:24.393
What. are you crying now?

289
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.480
Mommy. you said it's good to cry.

290
00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.941
[sobbing]

291
00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:35.612
Why can't Uncle David
stay on the couch?

292
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.994
Look. if you're gonna stay here.
then you have to start contributing.

293
00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:42.994
Yeah.

294
00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:44.954
Just... put him to bed now.

295
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.956
And you can take him
to school tomorrow.

296
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:49.042
Can we play the shooty game.
Uncle David?

297
00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:52.212
I don't want us
to get in trouble. Felix.

298
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.007
We'll have to play it with the sound off.

299
00:11:56.008 --> 00:11:59.136
FELIX: I need to get to class
early for Miss Caroline.

300
00:11:59.137 --> 00:12:00.825
It's my turn to feed Neville.

301
00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:02.670
Is Neville special-needs?

302
00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:04.515
Neville's the class guinea pig.

303
00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.352
Hey. Felix!
What's for lunch today? [laughs]

304
00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:09.312
That's Max and Ashton.

305
00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:13.317
They think I'm not strong
because of what Mommy packs me for food.

306
00:12:13.318 --> 00:12:14.984
What fucking douchebags!

307
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:17.863
Max looks like he could use
a few more tofu pizzas.

308
00:12:17.864 --> 00:12:19.156
Max was the fat one. yeah?

309
00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:20.448
What's a douchebag?

310
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:23.911
It's a small bag chicks use
to irrigate their vaginas.

311
00:12:23.912 --> 00:12:27.538
I hope you've got yummy
broccoli today. Felix!

312
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.584
Was that retarded kid using
irony to make fun of you?

313
00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:32.376
Mickey has spina bifida.

314
00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.046
MICKEY [chants]: You love broccoli!
You love broccoli!

315
00:12:34.047 --> 00:12:35.379
Hi. Felix!

316
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.132
- Come on. this way!
- Okay!

317
00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:38.341
[laughs] Felix!

318
00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:40.636
Look at you slaying puss
in the playground. huh?

319
00:12:40.637 --> 00:12:42.678
Beth is my girlfriend.

320
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.347
- Yeah. dog!
- [bell rings]

321
00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:46.224
Treat 'em mean. keep 'em keen.

322
00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.100
WOMAN:
Good morning. Vivienne.

323
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.395
[mutters]:
Fuck me! Who is that?

324
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.564
Yes!

325
00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.360
And... yes! Nice!

326
00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:59.071
That's Miss Caroline.

327
00:12:59.072 --> 00:13:01.322
Jesus!

328
00:13:01.323 --> 00:13:03.282
Felix. Lucky last.

329
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.328
Sorry. Miss Caroline.
I can still feed Neville.

330
00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:08.330
Max has already fed him.
FELIX: Aww!

331
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:09.622
DAVE:
Ooh! Jeez.

332
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:12.183
Neville will be lucky to have
anything left with that kid around.

333
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:15.003
Uh... quickly.
put your bags on your hook

334
00:13:15.004 --> 00:13:16.504
and unpack crunch-and-sip.

335
00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.674
DAVE: Come on. mate.
I'll give you a hand with that. Come on.

336
00:13:18.675 --> 00:13:20.008
Hey. hey.

337
00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:21.342
Thank you.

338
00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:22.845
I'm Dave. I'm Felix's uncle.

339
00:13:22.846 --> 00:13:24.096

Oh. Miss Caroline. jeez.

342
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.497
You are just a beacon of positivity
in my little nephew's life.

- [objects crashing in room]
- He talks about you all the time.

344

Oh! I don't know about that.

His mom's going through a weird
breakdowny thing at the moment.

Oh. no. Really?

348

Yeah. It's bad.

349

- Yeah.

350
00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:47.910
I hope Tess is okay.

351

Well. thankfully for everyone.
Uncle David is here to help.

DAVE: Yeah. I mean.
what's going on with his mom

354
00:13:55.378 --> 00:13:56.795
might be affecting his rhythms.

355
00:13:56.796 --> 00:13:58.379
Don't worry.

356
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.175
I'll give him some
special attention today.

What a loser!

359
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.388
You know. I don't really
think of him as a nephew.

360
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:08.390
I think of him as a friend.

361
00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:10.391
My best friend. I love kids.

I had this crazy rehearsal.

a really rough day today.

- Who did?
- Felix.

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:23.340
Well. it's a good thing my band's
finished rehearsing for the day.

392

That's my band.

- "God's Sledgehammer"?
- That's right.

394

Is that a Christian band?

395
00:15:28.387 --> 00:15:31.974
No. It's more of a stadium
rock-slash-death metal band.

396
00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:35.142
Oh. 'Cause I'm a Christian. so...

397
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.980
It is a Christian band.
I'm a Christian myself. actually.

Um. Beth's older brother is really sick.

- Oh. no!
- It's gastro.

401
00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.363
But I'm afraid I won't be able
to chaperone the excursion tomorrow.

402
00:15:46.364 --> 00:15:48.322
Oh. Of course.

403
00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.951
A lot of my class is off sick
with gastro as well.

404
00:15:50.952 --> 00:15:52.285
I hope I'm not leaving you in the lurch.

to find someone else?

I'm someone else!

the blue safety cap off

and you push the other end in here.

Can I bring this tomorrow. Uncle David?

want to go on this excursion tomorrow?

Yeah. What other reason would there be?

why you would so readily
volunteer for something

that sounds like your worst nightmare.

433
00:16:46.757 --> 00:16:49.259

I'm actually a good person.

00:56:24.719 --> 00:56:25.969
Mm-hmm.

1200
00:56:27.763 --> 00:56:30.766
DAVE [on voicemail]: <i>Hey. it's Dave.
Just leave a message.</i>

1201
00:56:30.767 --> 00:56:33.726
Dave. I'm here. I'm nearby.

1202
00:56:33.727 --> 00:56:36.813
They won't let me past to where you are.
and they won't tell us anything.

1203
00:56:40.317 --> 00:56:41.442
If you get this message.

1204
00:56:41.443 --> 00:56:43.820
could you please tell Felix
that Mommy loves him?

1205
00:56:46.323 --> 00:56:48.283
Dave. please look after him.

1206
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:55.540
Hey. Are you okay. mate?

1207
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:58.794
Yes. but Beth is a bit frightened.

1208
00:56:58.795 --> 00:57:01.588
My mom puts me to bed.

1209
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:03.548
Oh.

1210
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:05.217
Well. we're gonna see your mom tomorrow.

1211
00:57:05.218 --> 00:57:06.676
I'm scared.

1212
00:57:06.677 --> 00:57:10.514
My mommy made up a special rhyme
to help me go to sleep.

1213
00:57:10.515 --> 00:57:12.307
Do you want to hear it?

1214
00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:17.228
"Now the day is over
and I'm in bed. rugged up tight.

1215
00:57:17.229 --> 00:57:21.024
"I hope those little monsters
won't get me in the night.

1216
00:57:21.025 --> 00:57:24.820
"If I say this little rhyme.
they'll try to put up a fight.

1217
00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:26.028
"But they won't come get me.

1218
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:28.781
"No. they won't give me a fright.

1219
00:57:28.782 --> 00:57:31.576
Little monsters. you go away!
Little monsters..."

1220
00:57:31.577 --> 00:57:34.788
Oh. I think we need Beth
to help with this bit. yeah?

1221
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:37.791
Beth. when I point at you.
can you say. "Go away"?

1222
00:57:37.792 --> 00:57:39.793
- Go away?
- Yeah. exactly like that.

1223
00:57:39.794 --> 00:57:41.294
Yeah. Okay. let's start again.

1224
00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:44.339
FELIX AND DAVE:
"Little monsters. you can't stay!

1225
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.050
"I don't want to see your little claws!

1226
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:49.761
"I don't want to hear your little roars!

1227
00:57:49.762 --> 00:57:51.013
Little monsters..."

1228
00:57:51.014 --> 00:57:52.138
"Go away!"

1229
00:57:52.139 --> 00:57:54.725
"Come back and see me in the day.

1230
00:57:54.726 --> 00:57:57.269
"We can have a little party

1231
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.812
"And eat cake and tea and play.

1232
00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:02.232
"But we all must get a proper sleep.

1233
00:58:02.233 --> 00:58:04.818
So. little monsters. please..."

1234
00:58:04.819 --> 00:58:06.027
"Go away!"

1235
00:58:06.028 --> 00:58:09.323
[laughs] That's it.
That's exactly it.

1236
00:58:09.324 --> 00:58:11.012
You reckon you can sleep now?

1237
00:58:11.013 --> 00:58:12.701
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? Okay.

1238
00:58:15.037 --> 00:58:17.789
How did you know the rhyme. Uncle David?

1239
00:58:18.874 --> 00:58:22.794
Well. your mom used to sing it
to me before I went to sleep.

1240
00:58:22.795 --> 00:58:24.795
Back when I was Boo-Boo.

1241
00:58:24.796 --> 00:58:26.798
- [giggles] Boo-Boo?
- [chuckles] Boo-Boo. yeah.

1242
00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:28.079
You want to get some rest. mate?

1243
00:58:33.722 --> 00:58:35.766
- Goodnight. Uncle David.
- 'Night. mate.

1244
00:58:37.017 --> 00:58:39.728
[zombies moaning]

1245
00:58:47.653 --> 00:58:50.739
- [zombies howling outside]
- Oh. God.

1246
00:59:02.543 --> 00:59:03.627
[grunts]

1247
00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:21.562
[sighs]

1248
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:28.360
Sorry I've been swearing
so much. Audrey.

1249
00:59:29.319 --> 00:59:30.779
That's fine. David.

1250
00:59:32.239 --> 00:59:34.366
I'm fucking terrified too.

1251
00:59:36.118 --> 00:59:39.162
I just need them to feel like
the adults are in control. you know?

1252
00:59:42.457 --> 00:59:46.170
- DAVE: How do you do it?
- AUDREY: Do what?

1253
00:59:47.045 --> 00:59:48.380
Be a superhero.

1254
00:59:49.381 --> 00:59:50.924
Not quite.

1255
00:59:53.343 --> 00:59:54.969
Do you want kids?

1256
00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:57.680
Oh... my girlfriend and I just split.

1257
00:59:57.681 --> 01:00:00.392
Yeah. I caught her with someone else.

1258
01:00:00.393 --> 01:00:01.393
Oh.

1259
01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:03.478
That's... awful.

1260
01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:07.900
See. it wasn't her fault.

1261
01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:10.402
I left first.

1262
01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:13.405
She wanted a baby. I didn't.

1263
01:00:14.865 --> 01:00:16.158
How come?

1264
01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:19.745
I told her I didn't want it
to get in the way of my band.

1265
01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:22.372
Was that not the reason?

1266
01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.669
Felix's mom reckons I might be
frightened of being a father.

1267
01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:33.862
See. our dad left
when I was about Felix's age.

1268
01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:37.626
Started another family.
left Tess and I with mom.

1269
01:00:37.627 --> 01:00:41.391
Mom fell apart.
Like. <i>really</i> fell apart.

1270
01:00:43.852 --> 01:00:46.146
We spent our holidays in psych wards.

1271
01:00:46.813 --> 01:00:49.775
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1272
01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:52.319
Tess looked after me.

1273
01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:58.367
I couldn't see that at the time. though.
I was too angry at everyone.

1274
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.912
I never thanked her.

1275
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:05.916
I'm sure you won't end up
like your father. David.

1276
01:01:09.378 --> 01:01:13.402
"The man in between
waits between the two.

1277
01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:17.396
"Not hearing the lie.
not seeing the true.

1278
01:01:17.397 --> 01:01:20.832
"Unknowing what is
and denying what seems.

1279
01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:24.268
And there he will sleep.
the man in between."

1280
01:01:25.602 --> 01:01:28.145
Wow. Is that Gandhi?

1281
01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:30.399
[chuckles]
No. Neil Diamond.

1282
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.088
You like Neil Diamond?

1283
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:33.777
I love Neil Diamond.

1284
01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:36.404
Oh.

1285
01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:40.366
You may think I'm a superhero. but...

1286
01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:44.538
When I was 18.
I was heading down a really bad path.

1287
01:01:45.414 --> 01:01:48.624
I started following this band around.

1288
01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:52.379
I used the money my parents
had put away for my education.

1289
01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.006
and I followed them here.

1290
01:01:54.007 --> 01:01:54.881
Whoa.

1291
01:01:54.882 --> 01:01:57.175
I chased them all around Australia.

1292
01:01:57.176 --> 01:02:00.136
and I break into one of
their hotel rooms in Perth.

1293
01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:03.140
Well. I was just so determined
to meet one of them in person.

1294
01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:05.976
I would have let them
do anything to me.

1295
01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:10.229
What... what happened?

1296
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:16.069
Oh. Taylor walked into the room
and called security right away.

1297
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.030
Hang on. Wait. Swift?

1298
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.406
No! [scoffs]

1299
01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:23.410
Taylor Hanson. Sorry.
I thought I said who they were.

1300
01:02:23.411 --> 01:02:25.453
Taylor Hanson?

1301
01:02:25.454 --> 01:02:28.415
Yeah. Taylor Hanson.
From Hanson.

1302
01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.167
Hanson the band?

1303
01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.335
Yes.

1304
01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:34.671
- "Mmmbop"?
- "Mmmbop."

1305
01:02:35.756 --> 01:02:37.673
Mmm. Okay.

1306
01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:42.304
I begged him not to call security.
but he didn't even hesitate.

1307
01:02:42.305 --> 01:02:44.681
I didn't know what to do.
so I jumped out the window.

1308
01:02:44.682 --> 01:02:45.723
Shit.

1309
01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:50.354
But thank God. an awning broke my fall
and all I broke was my collarbone.

1310
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.398
[sighs]
So. there I was.

1311
01:02:54.399 --> 01:02:58.487
In a foreign country. in a sling.
No parents. no money.

1312
01:02:58.488 --> 01:03:01.406
And then a wonderful thing happened.

1313
01:03:02.282 --> 01:03:04.659
I got a job helping out at the school

1314
01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.663
to help pay my medical bills
and get back home.

1315
01:03:07.664 --> 01:03:09.373
And working with kids...

1316
01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:13.897
...standing in front of them.

1317
01:03:13.898 --> 01:03:16.337
looking at me with no judgment...

1318
01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:19.424
They trusted me even when I didn't
particularly trust myself.

1319
01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:24.388
I started to believe in myself again.
you know?

1320
01:03:24.389 --> 01:03:25.806
Learned to step up.

1321
01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:29.351
And now I can't imagine
doing anything else.

1322
01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:34.398
Are you and... Ian gonna have kids?

1323
01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:40.153
I'm afraid Ian and I have not
been together for a long time.

1324
01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:43.407
He was cheating on me.
With someone from his work.

1325
01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:47.034
But why do you still wear the ring?

1326
01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:50.289
It stops fathers from hitting
on me in the playground.

1327
01:03:50.873 --> 01:03:52.164
I know it's bad to lie.

1328
01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:54.751
but you'd be surprised
how crude men can be.

1329
01:04:00.966 --> 01:04:02.926
My band broke up six years ago.

1330
01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:06.972
God's Sledgehammer fell apart
when my bandmates quit.

1331
01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:11.768
And I'm not really Christian.

1332
01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:16.106
Anything else you've lied about?

1333
01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:20.360
[chuckles]
No. I think that pretty much covers it.

1334
01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:21.402
Okay. Good.

1335
01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:24.531
Otherwise I'd have to put you
in the naughty corner.

1336
01:04:25.782 --> 01:04:28.994
- [chuckles] Uh-oh.
- [laughs]

1337
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.747
Why don't I stay up on watch?

1338
01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:35.000
No. no. You need sleep more than anyone.

1339
01:04:36.126 --> 01:04:37.377
Um... I'll step up.

1340
01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:39.421
Okay.

1341
01:04:45.385 --> 01:04:46.470
'Night.

1342
01:04:55.312 --> 01:04:57.397
[moaning]

1343
01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:03.403
RADIO:
<i>All-unit command. all-unit command.</i>

1344
01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:07.199
<i>All-unit command. all-unit command.</i>

1345
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.408
[sheep bleating]

1346
01:05:09.409 --> 01:05:12.161
In order to ensure total
annihilation of the infected.

1347
01:05:12.162 --> 01:05:16.917
we will proceed with Operation Hailstorm
in T-minus one hour.

1348
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:27.427
- [gasps]
- Oh!

1349
01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:32.766
[quietly]:
I've got an idea to get us out of here.

1350
01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:35.394
No. No. no. no!

1351
01:05:35.395 --> 01:05:37.396
No. no. no.

1352
01:05:37.397 --> 01:05:39.355
No.

1353
01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:42.400
I'm not going anywhere.
Want to know why?

1354
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:46.113
Because I'm the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice
Favorite Global Television Presenter

1355
01:05:46.114 --> 01:05:47.447
five years running. that's why.

1356
01:05:47.448 --> 01:05:48.781
You want to know what that means?

1357
01:05:48.782 --> 01:05:52.369
That means to the layman
I'm a huge fucking deal.

1358
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.517
Someone will notice that I'm missing.

1359
01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.529
sound the alarm.
and come and get me.

1360
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:58.541
We can't stay here indefinitely.

1361
01:05:58.542 --> 01:06:00.419
We're good as dead if we stay here.
There's no food.

1362
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.546
[sighs]
We'll eat one of the kids.

1363
01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:05.299
I hope you're joking.

1364
01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:09.553
Look. Teddy. all we need
for you to do is make a distraction

1365
01:06:09.554 --> 01:06:11.388
while I make a run for the tractor train.

1366
01:06:11.389 --> 01:06:12.638
I drive it to the front door.
