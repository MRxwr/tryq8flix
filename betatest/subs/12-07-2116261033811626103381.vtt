HEMSWORTH (off-screen): There's
nothing quite like the ocean

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.320
at first light.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.360
It's a special place.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.440
But you're always aware
there may be bigger creatures

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.800
out there than you.

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280
HEMSWORTH: I've spent a
big part of my life in
and around the ocean.

10
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.720
but I've never seen a
shark when I've been surfing.

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.040
I've been called out of the
water by the helicopters.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.440
the shark spotters
a couple of times.

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800
Been in the water
when other people have said

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.840
they've seen the shark.

15
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.880
But you definitely
feel their presence.

16
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.520
I've had a couple of
spooky moments where I'm

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.120
pretty certain that
there was something

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.920
swimming underneath me.

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.360
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): For me.
sharks are some of the planet's
most elegant and

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.960
magnificent creatures.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.160
Unfortunately when we
humans enter the water.

22
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.720
they can present
unique dangers.

23
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.120
In Australia. where I live.

24

spate of fatal shark

25
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.120

HEMSWORTH (off-screen): As
someone who loves sharks.

30
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.120
and being in the water.

31
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.360
I want to get beneath
that reputation.

32
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.200

creatures tick.

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.480
and maybe even
meet one in person.

34
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.000

we can live together.

So if someone says the
word sharks to you Chris...

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.240
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.

38
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.920
DIRECTOR (off-screen):
What comes to mind?

39
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.520
HEMSWORTH: I have a very
mixed kind of gut reaction

40
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.800
to sharks these days. you know.

41
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.960
Obviously I grew up
watching <i>Jaws</i> and plenty
of films like that.

42
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.360
that scare the hell out
of you. and you know.

43
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.520
make you think twice
about getting in the ocean.

44
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.240
But we need to figure
out a way to work and

45
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.160
live in harmony
with them. so you know.

46
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.640
we're protected
but also so are they.

47
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.880
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Growing up in paradise.

48
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.360
you learn about the beauty
and importance of the natural

49
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.240
world pretty early on.

50
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.840
That's me. with my mum.
dad and big brother.

51
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.280
I was always encouraged
to appreciate the

52
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.120
wilderness around me.

53
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.480
It means generally
I don't think twice about

54
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.640
getting in the water.

55
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.680
No matter what might
be lurking out there.

56
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.080
Where. are you
thinking. here or...

57
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.400
MICK: I'm thinking here.
down this way.

58
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.480
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): My
mate Mick Fanning shares a
similar love of the ocean.

59
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.880
despite some troubling
first-hand experience.

60
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.280
MICK: I don't know.
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.

61
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.600
MICK: We'll figure it
out once we get out there.

62
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.560
HEMSWORTH: Any sharks?
MICK: Probably.

63
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.560
Yeah. we're in an area
that is known for sharks.

64
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.000
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.

65
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.160
MICK: Been a bit more
activity around lately.

66
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.480
HEMSWORTH:
There has. hasn't there?

67
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.320
MICK: Maybe we'll go and
do it before they show up.

68
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.160
HEMSWORTH: That's right.
Shall we get out there?

69
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.000
MICK: Yeah. let's go do it.

70
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.680
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Now
I'm competitive by nature.

71
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.120
so I love to think I
can keep up with Mick.

72
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.000
Just one problem.

73
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.320
He's a three time
world champion.

74
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.640
MICK: Is it like a real heat?

75
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.080
HEMSWORTH:
This is the world title.

76
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.320
MICK: Awesome.

77
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.840
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Maybe
intimidation is my best bet.

78
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.960
HEMSWORTH: We're friends now.
but once we hit the water.
we're enemies.

79
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.600
MICK: You're not
riding that. are you?

80
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.480
HEMSWORTH: I am.
Are you riding that?

81
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.160
(laughter).

82
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.320
HEMSWORTH: I hope
you fall off.

83
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.120
(laughter).

84
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.280
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Nope. that didn't work.

85
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
Maybe it's time to take
up a different sport.

86
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.640
Bowling. cricket. tennis...

87
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.400
I think it's fair to say
I'm obsessed with surfing.

88
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.400
I have been since the first
time I tried it with my dad

89
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.560
and my brothers when
I was six years old.

90
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.240
You get so wrapped up in the
waves. it's easy to forget.

91
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.600
we're really just visitors.

92
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.600
Below us. a whole
other world...

93
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.240
Where sharks have been
feeding for hundreds of

94
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.640
millions of years.

95
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.920
And it's here our
paths sometimes cross.

96
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.600
HEMSWORTH: You've
probably talked about
this about 500 times

97
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.840
since it happened...

98
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.200
MICK: A few.

99
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.760
HEMSWORTH: A few times.

100
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.480
Do you want to
walk us through it?

101
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.400
MICK: It was a beautiful day.

102
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.000
It was extremely sunny.
water was picture perfect clear.

103
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
And you know. we're in the
middle of a surfing event.

104
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.960
You know. we had just started
the final with Julian Wilson.

105
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.960
<i>MAN (over TV): Beautiful carve</i>
<i>to start from Wilson.</i>

106
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.720
MICK: And I'd been sitting
there for probably like four

107
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.160
or five minutes.

108
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.360
And I was just about to move
and then I just heard this

109
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.920
splash behind me. and
I was like. oh no.

110
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.000
And I try and jump on my
board and then all of a sudden.

111
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.040
I just get hit from this side.

112
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.880
I just caught the tail
straight to the face.

113
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.600
And I'm just like.
I'm out of here.

114
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.920
It was...

115
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.080
But then I was like. hang
on. if I just keep swimming.

116
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.440
this thing could just
come and take my legs.

117
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.680
so I was just trying to
get myself up as high as I

118
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.880
possibly could to see
if it was coming up.

119
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.920
HEMSWORTH: Oh wow.

120
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
MICK: And luckily it didn't.

121
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.400
HEMSWORTH:
What kind of shark was it?

122
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.680
MICK: It was a great white.
HEMSWORTH: A great white?

123
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.720
MICK: Yeah.

124
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.000
HEMSWORTH: How long before
the jet ski picked you up?

125
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.040
MICK: Oh it would have been
probably like maybe 30 seconds.

126
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.840
HEMSWORTH: Oh. that's the
longest 30 seconds of your life.

127
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.240
MICK: Yeah.

128
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.400
HEMSWORTH:
After that happened.

129
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.200
did you find you have
more trepidation.

130
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.200
hesitation getting
in the water.

131
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.600
MICK: Definitely things
have changed now.

132
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.760
Like. I see everything
on the water now.

133
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.720
And I'm still scared of
hearing splashes behind me.

134
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.000
It just. I jump.

135
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.080
And even if the waves
are incredibly perfect.

136
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.000
if I just don't feel right.
I just go in these days.

137
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.040
HEMSWORTH: Yeah. yeah.

138
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.440
MICK: It's just.
you know. just...

139
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.480
It's not worth the risk.

140
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.800
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Mick was extremely lucky.

141
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.600
because encounters like
these can turn deadly.

142
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.400
Sharks can bite with
such power and speed.

143
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.680
even if they don't
intend to kill.

144
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.360
the outcome can
be catastrophic.

Despite these tragedies.

161
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.920
it remains highly unlikely
that any of us in Australia

162
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.920
will be bitten by a shark.

163
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.320
But it does seem that
human encounters with

164
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.520
them are increasing.

165
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.000

out there in our oceans that

166
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.680
can explain this?

on the top end of Queensland.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.120
come down the
east coast of Australia...

169
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.560
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Paul
Butcher is one of Australia's
top shark scientists.

170
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.000
He's spent the last 20 years
researching their changing

171
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.800
behavior and movements.

172
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.960
PAUL: For white sharks.
the migration route is as

173
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.400
a group during April.
May. up the east coast.

174
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.240
and we've got a location
here called Fraser Island.

175
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.440
Once you get to October.
November. December.

176
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.960
they're turning around and
coming back down to Victorian

177
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.640
and Tasmanian waters.

178
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.880
The big thing is we've got
this very heavy populated

179
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.360
coast line through here. so
we've got large numbers of

180
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.200
people now using the
east coast of Australia.

181
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.200
warm water. beautiful
conditions. great waves.

182
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.320
HEMSWORTH: So it's
just that there's more
people in the water.

183
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.200
PAUL: More people. but we're
definitely seeing more sharks

184
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.480
up against the coastline.

185
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.760
HEMSWORTH: So why do
you think they're coming

186
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.720
closer to shore?

187
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.200
Is that the water
temperatures?

188
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.200
PAUL: So we've got this warm
current that comes down along

189
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.840
the east Australian coast.

190
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.000
That nearly runs the entire
year now. where previously.

191
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.000
over decades and decades.

192
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.080
it just runs during
summer and spring.

193
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.280
HEMSWORTH: And it
runs the entire year.

194
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.640
you think because of...

195
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.880
PAUL: Global warming.

196
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.920
So we've now got those
warm temperatures.

197
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.200
we're starting to see more
animals along the coastline.

198
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.160
which is an increase
in sharks as well.

199
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.920
So it's inevitable that we're
going to see white sharks and

200
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.120
other sharks interacting with
human users in the water.

201
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.680
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
It now seems like our
altering of the climate

202
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.880
might be drawing an
increasing number of sharks

203
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.200
closer to shore.

204
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.920
Our world. it seems. is
having a big impact on theirs.

205
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.760
The best way to
really get a handle on

206
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.120
what's going on down there...

207
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.840
<i>HEMSWORTH (over radio): Oh wow.</i>

208
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.240
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Is to take a dip and
see it for yourself.

209
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.600
HEMSWORTH: So we're about to
go and see the legendary shark

210
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.240
conservationist
Valerie Taylor.

211
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.920
and we're going to go diving.

212
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.640
hopefully see some sharks.

213
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.640
hopefully some
friendly sharks.

214
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.480
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Valerie
Taylor started her career as a
champion spear fisher.

215
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.480
But she soon fell in
love with the ocean.

216
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.720
and dedicated her
life to conservation.

217
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.560
She swapped her
spear for a camera.

218
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.400
and started making
marine documentaries with

219
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.440
her husband Ron.

220
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.320
VALERIE (off-screen): Great
whites are most dangerous.

221
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.480
when they feel
themselves to be trapped.

222
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.560
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): They
specialized in filming sharks
in their natural habitat.

223
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.000
VALERIE (off-screen): It was
an extremely risky method of
filming these big predators.

224
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.320
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
And even helped shoot the
Hollywood blockbuster

225
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.000
<i>Jaws.</i>

226
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.680
I grew up watching
Valerie's shows. and at 85.

227
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.000
she still cares deeply about
the health of our oceans.

228
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.920
Hey Valerie.

229
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.880
VALERIE: G'day Chris.

230
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.560
HEMSWORTH: Good to see you.
How's it going?

231
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.320
VALERIE: Fine.
HEMSWORTH: Great.

232
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.640
So what's the plan today?

233
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.080
VALERIE: We're going out to
Fish Rock. and if we're lucky.

234
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.360
we'll see grey nurse sharks.

235
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.280
HEMSWORTH: Fantastic.

236
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.000
So what's the temperament
of a grey nurse shark?

237
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.480
VALERIE: It's a very
easygoing shark.

238
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.360
HEMSWORTH: Easygoing. yeah.

239
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.040
VALERIE: Yeah.
They will come close.

240
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.960
HEMSWORTH: Great.

241
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.120
VALERIE: Don't make
sharp movements. you know.

242
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.360
like this.

243
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.280
Don't do that.

244
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.320
They'll thump your
tail. you'll hear it.

245
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.320
HEMSWORTH: Yeah. right.

246
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.840
VALERIE: And they go away.
it means they're cross.

247
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.720
HEMSWORTH: Okay.

248
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.880
VALERIE: But you're
not going to do that.

249
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.160
HEMSWORTH:
We're not going to do that.

250
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.040
Okay. Great.

251
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.680
VALERIE: Well let's go.
HEMSWORTH: Let's go.

252
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.760
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Fish Rock. off the coast
of New South Wales.

253
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.520
is a very special
place for Val.

254
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.960
and the story of
shark conservation.

255
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.040
And today is going to
be her first visit back in

256
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.720
over a decade.

257
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.760
VALERIE: You look like
you're in the tropics.

258
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.800
I look like I'm in Antarctica.

259
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.440
(laughter).

260
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.320
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): 50 years
ago it was thought that grey
nurse sharks were killers.

261
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.560
so they were culled.

262
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.480
and almost became
extinct in Australia.

263
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.280
But Val started campaigning.
and thanks to her efforts.

264
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.560
the grey nurse was the first
species of shark in the world

265
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.400
to gain protection.

266
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.880
I don't think there's anyone
out there who knows these

267
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.480
creatures better than Val.

268
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.560
VALERIE: Sharks are the
garbage men of the sea.

269
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.560
They eat the old. the
sick and the unwary.

270
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.640
They don't eat people.

271
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.120
They bite them.

272
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.320
HEMSWORTH: And spit them out.

273
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.320
VALERIE: Spit them out.

274
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.760
Wrong thing. made a mistake.

275
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.600
They don't have hands.
they can't go and say. ooh...

276
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.080
Oh nice.

277
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.200
(laughter).

278
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.760
VALERIE: They bite and they
have to feel with their teeth.

279
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.840
You know. if I bit
you. no. not me. if a shark

280
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.680
HEMSWORTH: You can
bite me. it's alright.

281
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.400
VALERIE:
Bit you with its teeth.

282
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.240
your first instinct
would be to pull away.

283
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.800
but if you stay still.
they'll let go.

284
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.440
But nobody can stay still.

285
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.080
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Now I'm
a total diving novice...

286
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.440
HEMSWORTH: Should I be nervous?

287
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.240
(laughter).

288
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.520
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): But
I reckon I'm in safe hands.

289
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.600
Val's completed over 5.000
dives in the last 60 years.

290
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.440
and knows this place like
the back of her hand.

291
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.160
<i>VALERIE (over radio):</i>
<i>It's a bit murky down here.</i>

292
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.240
<i>Chris. are you okay?</i>

293
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.320
<i>HEMSWORTH (over radio):</i>
<i>Yep. all good.</i>

294
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.680
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Although 40 feet underwater.
looking for giant sharks.

295
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.800
I do wish I could
see a bit further.

296
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.280
Val says the grey nurses
we're hoping to see can grow

297
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.160
up to 12 feet long.

298
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.640
and live for up to 40 years.

299
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.480
<i>VALERIE (over radio):</i>
<i>Oh. look. look.</i>

300
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.120
<i>HEMSWORTH (over radio): Oh wow.</i>

301
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.240
<i>VALERIE (over radio):</i>
<i>That's a big female.</i>

302
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.400
<i>HEMSWORTH (over radio):</i>
<i>Incredible.</i>

303
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.400
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Coming face to face with them.

304
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.040
it's hard to put into
words the serene beauty

305
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.440
of these magnificent
creatures.

306
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.680
Up close you see the grey
nurse's jaws are filled with

307
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.800
over 100 needle-sharp teeth.

308
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.800
<i>HEMSWORTH (over radio):</i>
<i>Just amazing.</i>

309
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.640
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
But luckily. they only
eat small fish and

310
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.400
crustaceans from the sea floor.

311
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.960
It's such a privilege
seeing these massive

312
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.920
creatures up close.

313
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.040
Being under the waves.

314
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.320
rather than surfing
on top really does give
you a new perspective.

315
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400
VALERIE: How was it?

316
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.520
HEMSWORTH: It's amazing.

317
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.480
Well. it was amazing for me.

318
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.320
I saw one and then it kind
of swam off pretty quick.

319
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.560
and we swam in a different
direction and there were.

320
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.760
I don't know. three or
four. or five. but...

321
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.760
VALERIE: One of them was huge.

322
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.400
HEMSWORTH: One really
big one. yeah. yeah.

323
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.360
VALERIE: Yeah. biggest grey
nurse I've ever seen actually.

324
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.320
HEMSWORTH: That
was the biggest grey
nurse shark you've seen?

325
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.280
VALERIE: Ever.
HEMSWORTH: Oh wow.

326
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.680
The big female?

327
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.240
VALERIE: I think it might
have been a female actually.

328
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.320
because usually
you can see the...

329
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.600
male parts.

330
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.960
How do you say
that on television?

331
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.000
HEMSWORTH: The male parts.
that'll do.

332
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.880
Bits and pieces.

333
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.160
VALERIE:
Oh God Valerie. shut up.

334
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.360
(laughter).

335
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.520
VALERIE: I'm glad
you saw them.

336
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.640
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): It's
believed there are now only
2.000 grey nurse sharks left in

337
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.280
the whole
of eastern Australia...

338
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.440
making this. a pretty
special encounter.

339
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.560
HEMSWORTH: So that was. you
know. beyond my expectation.

340
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.600
You definitely feel like this
is their space and their home.

341
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.120
and you are a guest.

342
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.440
It's certainly not something
that you're in control of.

343
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.480
nor an environment that
you're able to manipulate.

344
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.000
you know. take power over.

345
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.720
You. you feel completely at
the mercy of what's around you

346
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.360
with those creatures
and that situation.

347
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.480
but at peace too
at the same time.

348
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.000
I had no idea that I would
feel that way and have even

349
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.400
more respect for the ocean
and its beautiful creatures

350
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.280
that we need to protect.

351
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.760
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Like so
many other species of shark.

352
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.400
the grey nurses
have been pushed to the

353
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.600
brink of extinction.

354
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.200
The question is.

355
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.040
what can we do to turn
this huge problem around?

356
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.920
And critically.
for us ocean lovers.

357
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.840
are there ways we can protect
humans without harming sharks?

358
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.600
HEMSWORTH: Here sharky-sharky-
sharky sharky-sharky.

359
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.200
♪ ♪

360
00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.720
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Sharks
are always on the move.

361
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.680
Their predatory instincts
often draw them to the

362
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.360
coastline to feed on
fish and marine life...

363
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.120
making encounters
with us more likely.

364
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.320
So for many years.

365
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.160
some authorities have
set nets to capture sharks.

366
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.320
to stop them reaching
popular beaches.

367
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.520
But they've had
devastating consequences.

368
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.000
Conservationist Val Taylor
has seen the terrible impact

369
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.400
of shark nets first hand.

370
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.760
VALERIE: Although
they do protect the
beach to a certain extent.

371
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.800
what I dislike about them.

372
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.400
well I really loathe
about them. is they bycatch.

373
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.920
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.

374
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.400
VALARIE: All that harmless.
beautiful marine life that
is killed.

375
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.880
HEMSWORTH: So these
are some videos of animals

376
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.640
being caught in the nets.

377
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.160
VALERIE: Look at that.
oh it's so sad. so sad.

378
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.440
HEMSWORTH: So sad. isn't it?

379
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.240
VALERIE: Look. it's alive.

380
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.920
HEMSWORTH:
Yeah. isn't that awful?

381
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.280
VALERIE: It catches
a lot of turtles.

382
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.320
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.
Wow. that's awful.

383
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.000
VALERIE: Yeah. all sorts
of creatures in there.

384
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.480
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.

385
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.480
So these animals.
they get caught.
and then they die. right?

386
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.600
VALERIE: With sharks. they
have to keep moving to aerate.

387
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.720
They actually take oxygen
out of the ocean water.

388
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.720
And when they're trapped
like that they can't do it.

389
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.320
Ron and I made ourselves very
unpopular in our day because

390
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.320
we'd go out and cut
the living animals out.

391
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.240
HEMSWORTH: And free them.
VALERIE: And free them.

392
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.680
I had a very good
pair of scissors.

393
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.600
It's easier with the
scissors than with a knife.

394
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.240
And I'd just cut them
out and free them.

395
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.600
I've only ever seen
one really dangerous
shark caught in the net.

396
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.440
because they can swim
under them and around them.

397
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.480
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
The impact of these nets
really is heartbreaking.

398
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.160
and as Val points out.

399
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.040
sharks can often swim
around them anyway.

400
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.320
Thankfully. less
damaging solutions are
now starting to be used.

401
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.840
To find out more.
I'm going back to shark expert

402
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.640
Dr Paul Butcher.

403
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.800
HEMSWORTH: Hi boys.

404
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.000
PAUL: Hi Chris.
welcome on board.

405
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.160
HEMSWORTH: Thank you.

406
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.400
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Together with his team.
he wants to show me a new

407
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.360
technique they're using to
keep sharks and humans apart.

408
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.520
HAYDEN: Everyone holding on?

409
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.800
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Alongside nets. parts of
Australia have used

410
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.480
traps known as drumlines
to control sharks.

411
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.160
Their fixed. baited
hooks catch the animals.

412
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.280
which are then
simply left to die.

413
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.920
But Paul's team is
pioneering a new technology.

414
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.360
the smart drumline.

415
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.200
So when you say
the smart drumlines versus
the previous drumlines.

416
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.360
were the previous drumlines
just set up to catch them?

417
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.040
PAUL: Yeah. they were
designed to catch and kill.

418
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.360
They set them the day before.
check them the next day.

419
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.360
so the sharks are always dead.

420
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.640
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Over the last 50 years.

421
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.000
this method has killed
over 20.000 sharks

422
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.640
in Australian waters.

423
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.760
PAUL: So we're just
approaching the first line.

424
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.320
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
The smart drumline
program is different.

425
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.880
PAUL: Do you want
to cut a bait?

426
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.880
HEMSWORTH: Yeah. sure.

427
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.400
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): It's
designed to catch sharks but
then tag and release them.

428
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.920
unharmed.
back to the wild.

429
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.640
PAUL: Nice.

430
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.520
This is what we
call the smart unit.

431
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.080
When a shark takes the bait.
it triggers this magnet here.

432
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.960
within 30 seconds it's
sending a signal to satellite.

433
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.360
and then we get a
message on our phones.

434
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.560
We get to those sharks as
quickly as we can. then tag.

435
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.080
release and let
that animal go.

436
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.160
Then we can just...

437
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.600
HEMSWORTH:
Launch the old fish.

438
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.400
PAUL: Go for it.

439
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.080
HEMSWORTH: Boom.

440
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.280
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Conservation like this
requires a strong stomach.

441
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.040
which I may not have.

442
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.800
HEMSWORTH: Oh. my
hands smell good.

443
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.040
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
But it's essential work.

444
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.600
The tags Paul and his team
attach not only monitor

445
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.640
sharks' movements.
they're also connected to
a coastal alarm system.

446
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.480
That means surfers and
swimmers can be quickly

447
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.000
alerted to any danger.

448
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.280
PAUL: We set them just
far enough offshore.

449
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.600
which is 500 meters out.

450
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.880
which is pretty much just
behind the beach break.

451
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.160
where we know the sharks
are travelling up and down.

452
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.080
HEMSWORTH: So the smart
drumline actually acts as

453
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.760
protection for the surfers.

454
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.000
PAUL: Yeah. our surfers and
water uses know where they are.

455
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.200
and if they're
in each day as well.

456
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.080
HEMSWORTH: Launch this out.
PAUL: Yeah.

457
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.680
(whistles)

458
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.800
HEMSWORTH: Here.
sharky-sharky-sharky
sharky-sharky.

459
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.520
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
But as is often the case
with marine research.

460
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.120
it's all a bit of
a waiting game.

461
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.400
Hopefully we'll catch
one before I throw up.

462
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.480
HEMSWORTH: Feeling good.

463
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.000
A little seasick and
queasy for a minute there.

464
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.040
but job done.

465
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.840
What did we get.
23. 24 buoys in?

466
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.760
I feel confident. you know.
that we've dropped enough

467
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.000
drums in the water so
we'll be able to catch one

468
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.640
and tag one and...

469
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.440
fingers crossed.

470
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.560
Thanks boys.

471
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.120
I got the shark
alert on my phone.

472
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.880
So looking forward
to getting a shark and we'll

473
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.440
tag it and do our thing.

474
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.560
PAUL: Make sure
that phone's on.

475
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.960
HEMSWORTH: I will.
Thanks a lot.

476
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.840
PAUL: See you mate.

477
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.200
HEMSWORTH: See you guys.

478
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.640
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): The use
of technology is encouraging.

479
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.480
But could there be other
more traditional ways
to live with sharks?

480
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.520
NICKOLLA: It's their domain.
it's their home.

481
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.240
They've always been there.

482
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.960
HEMSWORTH: I couldn't
agree with you more.

483
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.800
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): While
I'm waiting for an alert.

484
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.120
I want to find out
if there are simpler ways of

485
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.520
coexisting with sharks.

486
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.760
As a kid. my family and I
lived in the Northern Territory.

487
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.120
in an indigenous
Australian community.

488
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.640
Up there. wildlife was something
to revere and respect.

489
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.160
Here on the east coast.
those same values hold true.

490
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.880
NICKOLLA: I have an example
of one of my artworks here.

491
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.640
which is all about country.

492
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.520
It was...

493
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.520
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Local artist Nickolla Clark
is an Arakwal

494
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.360
woman of the
Bundjalung nation.

495
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.080
For over 20.000 years.
her people have called the

496
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.880
area around Byron Bay their
home. and have an intimate

497
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.680
understanding of
both land and ocean.

498
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.000
HEMSWORTH: So we're
here in Byron Bay.

499
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.920
I learned to
dive at Julian Rocks.

500
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.480
It's beautiful out there.

501
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.480
Can you tell us the
significance of Julian Rocks

502
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.960
to the Arakwal people?

503
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.120
NICKOLLA: It's a significant
site to us. where our creator.

504
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.440
where he lays rest.

505
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.320
So we don't go
on Julian Rocks.

506
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.520
we don't harm it.

507
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.120
we don't touch it.
so it's pretty important.

508
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.400
HEMSWORTH: Yeah.

509
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.800
Do the Arakwal people
have a big connection

510
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.960
the ocean specifically?

511
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.160
NICKOLLA: Yeah.
so we're coastal people.

512
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.800
For us. living so
close to the beach.

513
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.360
collecting bush foods and
having the ocean to swim and

514
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.240
play. and we would
live off the sea.

515
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.040
HEMSWORTH: Have you
noticed more activity with

516
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.560
sharks in particular?

517
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.840
NICKOLLA: There's definitely
been an increase in activity

518
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.840
between people and the ocean.
and sharks in particular.

519
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.520
And a lot of the places people
actually go here on country is

520
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.080
they go to these
beautiful beaches.

521
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.640
right next to rocky
outcrops where sharks nest.

522
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.280
It's their domain.
it's their home.

523
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.440
They've always been there.

524
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.960
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Over generations. the
Arakwal people have gained

525
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.240
a detailed knowledge about when
and where to avoid going in

526
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.160
the water to stay safe.

527
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.680
NICKOLLA: Here in Byron Bay.

528
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.960
it's really visible to
see when they're feeding.

529
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.640
when there's feeding
frenzies going on.

530
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.000
Traditionally in winter
we wouldn't swim further
than your knee height.

531
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.400
sharks are more active then.

532
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.160
That is a cultural
signifier we'd have.

533
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.480
so coexisting is
really important.

534
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.600
Like if we want to be here.

535
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.880
we're going
to have to do that.

536
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.800
HEMSWORTH: Yeah. I couldn't
agree with you more.

537
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.400
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
This ancient wisdom.

538
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.760
coupled with
humane technologies.

539
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.440
offers a way to
coexist with sharks.

540
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.720
close to our shores.

541
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.840
Unfortunately. the problems
facing sharks around the world

542
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.840
are often more complex.
and more serious.

543
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.000
Over the last 50 years.

544
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.320
there's been a 70%
drop in the number of sharks

545
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.040
in the world's oceans.

546
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.760
The cause is our
over-exploitation of the sea.

547
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.400
and the slaughter of tens
of millions of sharks.

548
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.920
simply for their fins.

549
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.040
The reality is these beautiful
animals have got more to fear

550
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.200
from us than we do from them.

551
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.000
I think like everybody who
spends time in the ocean.

552
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.560
I've had the fear of sharks
at times. and shark attacks.

553
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.800
and talking to people who
have been very close or been

554
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.640
involved in an attack.

555
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.520
It certainly makes
it even more real.

556
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.400
I think we should have a
healthy respect for sharks.

557
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.200
and how dangerous they
can be. but realize that
we are in their environment.

558
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.080
and what's more scary is
an ocean without sharks.

559
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.080
There's been an alert from
one of the smart drumlines.

560
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.080
It means something's
taken the bait.

561
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:11.120
Hopefully it'll be a chance
to help with some shark
conservation and also.

562
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.000
meet a great white
face to face.

563
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.520
Is this exciting for you?

564
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.000
HAYDEN: It's always
exciting for me.

565
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.000
It's the thrill of fishing
and not knowing what's going

566
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.320
to be on the
other end of the line.

567
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.880
HEMSWORTH: Yeah. right.
It could be a jet ski.

568
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.000
HAYDEN: You'd hope not.

569
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.200
HEMSWORTH: It'll be my
first time handling a shark.

570
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.520
PAUL: You're the number one
man today. so yeah. shark 101.

571
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.840
you're going to be
out there tagging.

572
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.040
HEMSWORTH: Put it in a
headlock and I'll get the tail?

573
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.080
(laughter).

574
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.400
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
But as soon as we arrive.

575
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.800
it's clear
something's not right.

576
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.160
HAYDEN: We just look for
movement in the back bubble.

577
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.680
And when there's shark on.

578
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.960
they'll swim from
side to side sometimes.

579
00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.760
And to me. that's laying
there with the wind.

580
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.560
PAUL: If you want to grab that
bungee Chris and pull it in.

581
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.440
HEMSWORTH: Oh. where's
my fish that I baited up?

582
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.920
PAUL: Bait's gone.
so yeah. good signs
but not what we wanted.

583
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.400
So to lose a full bait. we
rarely have that happen.

584
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.800
HEMSWORTH: Do you reckon it
might have something to do

585
00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.920
with the person who baited it?

586
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.120
PAUL: Oh. not at all.

587
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.000
So let's get this
baited up again.

588
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.480
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
It's disappointing.

589
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.720
But it's not yet game over.

590
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.120
PAUL: Throw it in there.

591
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.680
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Hopefully we can tag one
before the end of the day.

592
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.200
CHARLIE: Okay guys.
the trial can start now.

593
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.680
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
In the meantime. I want
to find out how we can

594
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.640
protect ourselves if
a shark does attack.

595
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.680
I think it's fair to say.

596
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.280
however good we
get at keeping humans and
sharks apart in the ocean.

597
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.080
there will always
be moments when we meet.

598
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.680
And in those worst case
scenarios. when sharks bite.

599
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.760
is there anything
that can be done?

600
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.080
Charlie Huveneers is a
scientist who's thought more

601
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.720
about this than most.

602
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.080
Hey mate. how are you?

603
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.000
<i>CHARLIE (over computer):</i>
<i>Not too bad. thanks.</i>

604
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.080
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
For several years he's
been looking at ways of

605
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.400
deterring sharks that
decide to attack.

606
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.440
Is your research and line of
work due to your passion and

607
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.960
love for sharks. or passion
and love for humans.

608
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.120
or who are you?

609
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.680
Who are you more invested in?

610
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.320
It's okay to say
the sharks too.

611
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.080
<i>CHARLIE (over computer):</i>
<i>It depends in what</i>
<i>situations. but yeah.</i>

612
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.520
<i>it's a combination.</i>

613
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.200
<i>It's really. I've always</i>
<i>been interested in sharks.</i>

614
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.720
<i>since I was a kid.</i>

615
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.240
<i>But yeah. the fascination for</i>
<i>sharks just changed into a</i>

616
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.400
<i>real interest in the science</i>
<i>and understanding the sharks</i>

617
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.720
<i>better. so that we can</i>
<i>actually help in providing a</i>

618
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.080
<i>safer environment. for</i>
<i>people but also for sharks.</i>

619
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.160
HEMSWORTH: Yeah. are you
going into the field soon

620
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.000
to test any of those deterrents?

621
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.120
<i>CHARLIE (over computer): Yeah.</i>
<i>actually we're going next week.</i>

622
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.080
HEMSWORTH: Well
good luck with it.

623
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.880
<i>CHARLIE (over computer): Thanks.</i>

624
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.080
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Charlie
and his colleagues from Flinders
University in Adelaide

625
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.640
are heading into the
seas off south Australia.

626
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.760
On board they're testing the
latest shark deterrent and

627
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.400
protection technologies.

628
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.480
CHARLIE: So what we've seen in
that in recent years there has

629
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.800
been an increase in the number
of shark bites globally.

630
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.320
including in Australia. and
this has resulted in a lot of

631
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.640
interest in the devices to
try to reduce those risks.

632
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.680
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
The team have sailed to
the Neptune Islands.

633
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.120
a hot spot for great whites.

634
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.280
The sharks come here to prey
on Australia's largest colony

635
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.160
of long-nosed fur seals.

636
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.600
So it's the perfect place to
test products designed to take

637
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.560
advantage of sharks'
very unusual senses.

638
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.080
CHARLIE: There's only a small
number of animals that have

639
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.280
this ability to
detect electric field.

640
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.080
and sharks have it through
these black dots called

641
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.800
Ampullae of Lorenzini.

642
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.560
The idea behind these electric
field based deterrents is that

643
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.520
they will produce
such a strong pulse.

644
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.560
that it will overwhelm this
sensory organ and make the

645
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.760
shark physically move
away from the source.

646
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.240
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): The aim
is to develop a safer surfboard.

647
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.680
with an electrical shark
deterrent built into it.

648
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.920
CHARLIE: This produces an
electric field through two

649
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.800
electrodes which
are positioned just
underneath the board.

650
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.920
and this is kind of
a replica of a surfboard.

651
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.120
This has produced a
field which is transmitted
to these electrodes.

652
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.320
and creates a bit of a
barrier around the surfboard.

653
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.200
which is theory should
be deterring the sharks.

654
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.160
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
To test the theory.

655
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.840
the experiment compares
a shark's reactions to a

656
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.200
board with the electrical
device switched on.

657
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.080
to a board with it off.

658
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.360
But getting robust data
means repeating the process

659
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.760
many times over.

660
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.640
Over hundreds of
previous trials.

661
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.640
the team have
captured remarkable footage

662
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.480
of sharks in action.

663
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.080
MAN: Oh!

664
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.880
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): First
they recorded what happened to a

665
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.160
baited board with a
device turned off.

666
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.520
CHARLIE: It's interesting
that we do have a bait just

667
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.840
underneath that board.

668
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.360
MADDIE: It's swimming as
we would expect to see it

669
00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.040
swimming around a bait.

670
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.720
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): And then
what happened to the sharks when

671
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.640
the device was turned on.

672
00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.640
CHARLIE: Look at it.

673
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.160
MADDIE: So that was a
pretty obvious flinch.

674
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.680
CHARLIE: He's coming back now.

675
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.160
That kind of
flinch or reaction.

676
00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.120
we didn't see that when the
deterrent was turned off.

677
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.080
MADDIE: And you can see the
really obvious flinching in

678
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.640
the gills as well.
and the jaw gaping.

679
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.400
CHARLIE: Oh look at that one.

680
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.880
so that one came
really from down below.

681
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.560
it was only within half a meter.

682
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.160
Overall there was a 60%
reduction in the proportion of

683
00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.840
bait being taken. so 60%
reduction in shark bites.

684
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.920
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
If the eight people killed
by sharks in Australia

685
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.520
in 2020 had been
able to use an electric
deterrent like this.

686
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.520
then five may still be alive.

687
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.800
Products like these
are promising.

688
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.600
as we may be able to reduce
fatalities in the future.

689
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.320
all without harming the sharks.

690
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840
Meanwhile...

691
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.400
PAUL: Oh. there's
something on there.

692
00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.600
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Will I finally get my chance
to come face to face

693
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.240
with a great white?

694
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.600
Oh wow.

695
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.440
HEMSWORTH: Okay. I just
got a text message. PVC 276.

696
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.040
I assume that's the buoy
number or the coordinates.

697
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.680
and looks like
we have a shark.

698
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.240
So let's go and check it out.

699
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.840
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
My journey to understand
how sharks and humans

700
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.200
can live together
has been eye-opening.

701
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.360
HEMSWORTH: Alright boys?
Are we on or what?

702
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.320
PAUL: Yes. it
looks like we're on.

703
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.280
Good?

704
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.040
HEMSWORTH: Do it.

705
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.320
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
But I still haven't seen a
great white shark up close.

706
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.120
HEMSWORTH: Here we go.

707
00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.840
So we obviously have no idea
what kind of shark it is.

708
00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.640
PAUL: No. but what
we do know is that usually

709
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.240
those buoys that go
off south of the river.

710
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.080
it's usually a
white shark. so it's...

711
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.200
Yeah. we've got our
fingers crossed.

712
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.440
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): We reach
the smart drumline location.

713
00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.720
And this time. the
buoys don't seem to be just

714
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.840
drifting with the wind.

715
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.320
PAUL: Now we've got the buoys
together. they're tangled.

716
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.280
the buoy's
bouncing up and down.

717
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.480
Rest assured there's
a shark on this one.

718
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.960
HAYDEN: Alright Paul.
you alright Chris?

719
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.960
PAUL: Yeah. go ahead.

720
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.160
Well there's
something on there.

721
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.760
Oh. it's a big white.

722
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.720
A huge white.

723
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.320
Big white.

724
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.120
Come in here Chris.

725
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.120
HEMSWORTH: Oh wow.

726
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.600
Wow.

727
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.520
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): To limit
the stress on the shark.

728
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.640
the team must work
as fast as possible.

729
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.440
PAUL: You can lift his head?

730
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.640
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
They need to turn the
shark onto its back.

731
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.040
which puts it into
a peaceful state.

732
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.920
The hook may look gruesome.
but the team need to use it to

733
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.480
stabilize the shark's
head alongside the boat.

734
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.280
HEMSWORTH: How big is that.
two and a half meters?

735
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.600
PAUL: Yeah. 2.6. 2.8?

736
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.520
HEMSWORTH: 2.6. 2.8.

737
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.080
And this is safe and mostly
harmless for the shark. right?

738
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.040
PAUL: That's right.

739
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.400
We've done a lot of research.
especially with great white

740
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.000
sharks now. through a process
of taking blood out of them.

741
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.200
So basically it doesn't
stress the animal out.

742
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.040
HEMSWORTH: It's comforting to
know it's not hurting the shark.

743
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.200
The guys have reassured me
it's pretty docile at this

744
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.360
point and you know.
very little harm.

745
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.080
and so I've seen plenty of
movies and imagery of them.

746
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.560
but never this. up close
in person and. yeah.

747
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.280
just amazing.

748
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.680
PAUL: Male.

749
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.480
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): We
record as much information as
possible in the time available.

750
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.880
PAUL: Alright. Hayden. 2-8-1.

751
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.600
HAYDEN: 2-8-1.

752
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.720
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Each measurement revealing
something different

753
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.120
about its life and history.

754
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.880
PAUL: The tiny little fin clip.

755
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.960
that'll get divided up
into six different pieces.

756
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.480
one sample will go to one lab.
another sample to another.

757
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.680
We want to know how many
sharks there are in the

758
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.280
population. who their
mums and dads are.

759
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.800
who their brothers
and sisters are.

760
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.280
So next part of
the process is working out

761
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.120
what they're eating.

762
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.400
We take a DNA sample from
around its butt basically.

763
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.560
HEMSWORTH: And here we are.

764
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.000
about to take an
anal swab from a shark.

765
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.400
All for science.

766
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.440
So let's dig in. shall we?

767
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.720
Where is its butt?

768
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.000
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
Knowing a shark's diet can
give vital clues about

769
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.840
how and where it feeds.

770
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.800
helping us understand
its life underwater.

771
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.960
Sorry about that mate.

772
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.880
To monitor this
shark in real time.

773
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.560
an acoustic transmitter
tag is then attached.

774
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.640
Are you alright there?

775
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.560
Everyone alright?

776
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.880
PAUL: Yeah.

777
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.480
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Meaning
its movements can be tracked for

778
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.880
up to 10 years.

779
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.480
PAUL: See. just
a quick incision.

780
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.480
shark doesn't even know.

781
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.400
HEMSWORTH (off-screen):
With the science wrapped up.

782
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.280
it's time to let the shark go.

783
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640
Alright.

784
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.960
PAUL: Alright guys.
let's do this.

785
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.360
HEMSWORTH: So you're
going to hold the dorsal
while you're doing it?

786
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.440
PAUL: Just hold that Chris.

787
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.560
HEMSWORTH: Yep.

788
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.840
PAUL: And I'm just going
to let that go there.

789
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.760
and we're going to
wait for him to kick.

790
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.880
And then we. when
he goes the other way.

791
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.000
we'll let him go.

792
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.240
HAYDEN: There he goes.
he wants to swim.

793
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.560
HEMSWORTH: Let him go?

794
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.120
PAUL: There he goes.
out the front of the boat.

795
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.720
straight to New Zealand.

796
00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.720
HEMSWORTH: He cruised
off pretty gently. huh?

797
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.920
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): The
great white is now one of over

798
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.160
400 in the monitoring program.

799
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.240
If any come within half
a mile of the shore.

800
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.280
their tags will
trigger an alarm.

801
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.280
allowing the water
to be evacuated.

802
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.640
keeping swimmers
and surfers safe.

803
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.720
What's more.
having been tagged.

804
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.880
it turns out the shark's
then likely to avoid this

805
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.600
spot for quite a while.

806
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.560
PAUL: We do know from our
satellite tag work that the

807
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.840
next day its 15 to 30
kilometers offshore.

808
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.440
so not only have we taken
it away from the direct beach.

809
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.800
you can see the waves
breaking only 100 meters

810
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.920
away from us. so it's...

811
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.280
HEMSWORTH: I've surfed
there a few times.

812
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.520
PAUL: Surfing in there.
he's released. he's off.

813
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.320
so the smart drumlines have
done their bit for the day.

814
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.520
HEMSWORTH: Great.

815
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.480
PAUL: Well done
on your first shark.

816
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.880
HEMSWORTH: Success. thank you.

817
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.800
HAYDEN: Thank you.
HEMSWORTH: Cheers guys.

818
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.560
HEMSWORTH (off-screen): Meeting
the largest predatory shark in
the ocean has been an

819
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.320
eye-opener for sure.

820
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.960
It's made me realize that
despite their ability to harm.

821
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.400
these are deeply
vulnerable creatures.

822
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.200
Thankfully. we're
now learning how to
better live together.

823
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.200
And I think when
we're enjoying the ocean.

824
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.960
we should never forget
that we are the visitors

825
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.800
to their home.

826
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.120
I think I have a greater
understanding of how fragile

827
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.880
the ocean is. and the
devastating effect we can have

828
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.800
on it. and also the positive
effects we can have on it.

829
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.120
depending on what road
we choose to take.

830

DIRECTOR (off-screen): Are you
going to give up surfing?

831
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.440
