3
00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.250
Hello. everyone. this is the 2008 Beijing Olympics'

4
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.250
Women's volleyball match between China and USA.

5
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.042
The holders are one of the favourite teams among the locals

6
00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:45.958
with a home advantage today.

7
00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:48.542
This match is predicted to have 300 million viewers.

8
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.042
This match is in the spotlight

9
00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:53.583
for another reason.

10
00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.000
That's correct.

11
00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.250
Team USA's head coach

12
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.333
Lang Ping.

13
00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:03.958
Nicknamed the Iron Hammer.

14
00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:08.500
Achieving a legendary feat of 5 world championships in a row with her team.

15
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.917
Lang Ping. in the navy blue uniform

16
00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:15.792
directs the players from the USA bench in English.

17
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.250
Ping's opponent today is her friend of many years.

18
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.542
You know

19
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.792
when China plays the USA

20
00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.458
it's never simple.

21
00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:30.625
Welcome. new comrade.

22
00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.375
Hello. I'm the team manager.

23
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.375
Let me show you around.

24
00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.625
This is the assistant coach leading the spiking practice.

25
00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:39.125
Her here

26
00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:41.542
is No. 5. our outside hitter.

27
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.167
1.8m tall. from Bayi Volleyball team.

28
00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:46.958
From a civil servant family. works extremely hard.

29
00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.125
Great basic techniques.

30
00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:50.792
Can both attack and defence well.

31
00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.167
The girl in blue

32
00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:56.375
also an outside hitter.

33
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.833
She's probably the shortest hitter in the world.

34
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.792
She might not be tall

35
00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:04.917
but she's got her own techniques

36
00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:08.250
to spike anything set to her.

37
00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:12.667
This is backup setter. No. 8.

38
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:14.958
No. 12. No. 9 and No. 2

39
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.667
are our middle blockers.

40
00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:19.833
Here.

41
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.500
Our setter.

42
00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:23.542
The captain.

43
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.083
Excellent rhythm and touch on sets. but

44
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:30.708
temperamental. and at times unwilling to take orders.

45
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:32.833
This is No. 4.

46
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.417
She sets and blocks extremely well.

47
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.625
Most people can do around 20 before collapsing

48
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.125
but she does 200 squats every day.

49
00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:43.167
That middle blocker

50
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.750
like you. is from Fujian.

51
00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.583
Her spikes and blocks are beautiful

52
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.917
but she's jittery and softly spoken.

53
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.708
That's No. 1. our last captain

54
00:05:58.083 --> 00:05:59.667
who's willing to risk her life to save a ball.

55
00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:02.000
Injuries all over her body.

56
00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:03.958
Her knee caps are all worn down.

57
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:15.708
That's Lang Ping. doing squats with weights

58
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.708
is from Beijing.

59
00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:18.167
Called into the national team at 18.

60
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:19.875
Before coming here

61
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:21.708
she couldn't even lift 30 kilos.

62
00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:23.792
Coach has ordered

63
00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:26.917
unless she can lift 100 kilos. she's not to practise with a ball.

64
00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:29.542
This is how Coach trains her.

65
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.917
Her teammates are also helping her.

66
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.417
Let me help you.

67
00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:48.583
Get up!

68
00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:51.833
Sitting there makes you feel more tired.

69
00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:53.667
People are naturally lazy.

70
00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:54.667
Get up!

71
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.708
Our coach needs no introduction.

72
00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:56.708
Come on. up!

73
00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:00.458
When you girls were rolling on the floor

74
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.875
you stayed 2 seconds too long.

75
00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:04.333
Remember!

76
00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.542
2 seconds is long enough for victory on court.

77
00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:09.625
Everyone. 10 more spikes!

78
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.417
You!

79
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.500
Don't cry!

80
00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:15.708
China women's volleyball shed blood but not tears.

81
00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:18.792
I can't do it! I quit!

82
00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.125
You!

83
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.917
You think you can start and stop whenever you like?

84
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.792
No!

85
00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:36.792
If you stop training now

86
00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.083
we'll continue with you tomorrow morning.

87
00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:51.792
Come on!

88
00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:53.458
Again!

89
00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:09.333
If this China team is to win the World Cup

90
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:11.667
they must be as strong as western teams

91
00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.292
and become a well-rounded team.

92
00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:14.625
Coach

93
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.250
I've never worked in women's volleyball.

94
00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.625
I don't know anything about it.

95
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.375
I don't get why you asked me to be...

96
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.708
We want a man as their hitting partner.

97
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:24.375
Coach

98
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.042
the party didn't tell me...

99
00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:27.500
We need a hitting partner who can

100
00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:31.000
copy the playing techniques of our main competitors.

101
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:33.750
Coach

102
00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:36.708
the order I have is to stay here for 45 days.

103
00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:39.167
No one mentioned being a hitting partner.

104
00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:40.583
Plus

105
00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.625
I don't think I'm qualified enough.

106
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.458
Comrade

107
00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:49.292
this is a very important position.

108
00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.958
Welcome to China women's national volleyball team training.

109
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.583
Come this way. Officer Wang.

110
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.375
You must be very tired after 2 days of train ride.

111
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.500
Don't mention it.

112
00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:17.333
Coach

113
00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:18.667
let me introduce him to you.

114
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.042
He's technical officer Wang from Administration of Sport

115
00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:22.333
coming straight from Beijing.

116
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.667
Nice to meet you. Coach.

117
00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:24.792
One. Two.

118
00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:26.000
One. Two.

119
00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:27.250
One. Two.

120
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.917
What is computer technology exactly?

121
00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:33.458
It's an electronic brain.

122
00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.167
That's equal to a thousand human brains.

123
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.167
It can perform complex operations.

124
00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:39.375
A player's strengths

125
00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.583
usual way of playing and tactics can all be analysed.

126
00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:45.375
According to the latest report

127
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.958
US head coach Selinger has begun using computer technology

128
00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:51.417
to enhance the training and match performance of his team.

129
00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:53.750
Which means

130
00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:55.375
all our athletes

131
00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:56.917
are being calculated.

132
00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:59.792
Including you.

133
00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.625
Can we get this computer thing?

134
00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:07.500
There is only one at the Academy of Sciences

135
00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:09.042
but I've heard it couldn't even fit into a truck.

136
00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:11.208
Very few people know how to use it.

137
00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:14.500
I don't think they'd let us use it for volleyball.

138
00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:17.417
One more thing.

139
00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:18.917
Selinger has also mentioned

140
00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:22.750
technology will be the future of sports. not humans.

141
00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:25.333
Whoever has the technologies. wins.

142
00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:34.542
Thank you.

143
00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:40.417
Raise the net by 15cm.

144
00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:47.292
Carry on!

145
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.292
Jump!

146
00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:56.917
Higher!

147
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:01.000
You call those spikes?

148
00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:03.750
If you let them off easy now

149
00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:05.417
they'll lose points during the match.

150
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.250
Harder!

151
00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:15.292
Don't dodge! Harder!

152
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:19.917
Go towards the ball!

153
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.125
That's not enough power and curve!

154
00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:28.208
Catch the ball.

155
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.750
The Americans will not show you mercy!

156
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.750
The Japanese will not show you mercy!

157
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.125
Come on!

158
00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:35.167
Come on!

159
00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:39.667
Do you think my method of training

160
00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.750
can be calculated by a computer?

161
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:44.667
Keep going.

162
00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:55.667
Come on!

163
00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:05.458
Everyone's gone.

164
00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.375
Rome was not built in a day.

165
00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:13.042
Screw it.

166
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:14.833
I'm leaving.

167
00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.125
You can't lift 100 kilos anyway.

168
00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:19.542
I'll tell the Coach tomorrow that you've done it.

169
00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:20.917
I'm going for dinner.

170
00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.000
Hey. what are you doing?

171
00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:40.708
Okay! I've seen it. Put it down!

172
00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.333
You wanna kill yourself!?

173
00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:03.542
I was called up to the national team at 18.

174
00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.458
Everyone tells me I'm lucky

175
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.500
without knowing how hard I've worked.

176
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.500
I didn't know

177
00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.917
I couldn't even touch a ball here.

178
00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:18.625
The experienced players are technically better.

179
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.958
All I can do is work harder.

180
00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:24.250
But the thing is

181
00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:28.750
everyone here works hard. so I can't even win with that.

182
00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:33.292
There are no other choices for me.

183
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.250
I can't go to university.

184
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.792
I can only keep my head down and practise.

185
00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:44.625
10 thousand years are too long

186
00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:45.958
seize the day. seize the hour.

187
00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:52.125
Fight if you can win. run if you will lose.

188
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.167
Some people live in a dream world.

189
00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:58.417
Some people live in reality.

190
00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:00.917
And some make one into the other.

191
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.458
What is that? I don't get that.

192
00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:07.250
Do you know

193
00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:11.333
from the bottom of the flag to the floor is 3.32m.

194
00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:15.125
That's the spiking height of Flo Hyman (USA's outside hitter).

195
00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:19.333
I will jump higher one day.

196
00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:25.792
You're just a backup

197
00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:27.417
talk when you're a starter.

198
00:14:31.042 --> 00:14:33.375
I've already lifted 100 kilos.

199
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.792
I'll be practising with a ball tomorrow.

200
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.917
Hurry up. Lang Ping.

201
00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:58.958
Count faster!

202
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
This is the national team.

203
00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:13.958
We're not on the streets.

204
00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:15.917
Don't whistle like that.

205
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.750
Coach. why am I still not training with the team?

206
00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:31.125
Spike 10 thousand balls with her.

207
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:32.167
OK.

208
00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:33.917
You promised

209
00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:36.708
when I lift 100 kilos. I can join the team.

210
00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:40.167
You have lifted 100 kilos. but they have lifted more.

211
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.167
You spike 10 thousand. they spike 50 thousand.

212
00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:57.792
Catch the ball for me.

213
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.042
Overhead floater.

214
00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:02.333
It needs to go higher.

215
00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:06.042
Another one.

216
00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.083
Relax your arm. straighten your back

217
00:16:11.292 --> 00:16:12.417
and hit in the middle.

218
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.542
Only when your judgement becomes your instincts

219
00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.000
during a match

220
00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:26.417
can you be in the right position.

221
00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.042
How does it become instinct?

222
00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:29.250
By training.

223
00:16:29.708 --> 00:16:30.958
Not just any training.

224
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.667
It needs to be done millions. even billions of times.

225
00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.792
Endless repetition.

226
00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:41.667
Only those who persevere will succeed.

227
00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:03.375
This match...

228
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.417
you're on the bench.

229
00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:05.708
Ping will start.

230
00:17:07.667 --> 00:17:08.833
Don't worry. Coach.

231
00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.458
I'll help Ping reach her potential.

232
00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:14.292
You!

233
00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:17.167
You play opposite for the Jiangsu men's team.

234
00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:22.833
What's the point of this?

235
00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.875
Are we supposed to take this seriously?

236
00:17:27.292 --> 00:17:29.792
Learn from Jiangsu men's team.

237
00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.417
Thank you for the opportunity.

238
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:37.292
Come on! come on!

239
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:40.500
One. two. come on!

240
00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:57.125
Well played!

241
00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:01.208
Let's kick their ass!

242
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:06.833
Look at my hand...

243
00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:09.625
Look at my hand. Focus on the receive.

244
00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:11.417
Let's have more movement.

245
00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:28.375
One. two. come on!

246
00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:31.500
Look at my hand.

247
00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:33.042
Stay low.

248
00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:43.250
Defence!

249
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.167
It's alright. Focus on the next point.

250
00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:53.000
Set the ball higher.

251
00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:55.667
Don't rush. Don't let your opponent know you're rushing.

252
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.958
Give me!

253
00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:07.917
Let me!

254
00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:08.875
I've got it.

255
00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:12.583
Good job!

256
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.083
Do you now get

257
00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:28.125
why I've been training you girls so hard?

258
00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:30.292
It's all those training sessions

259
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.875
that's pushing the men to play seriously.

260
00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:37.375
Seize this opportunity.

261
00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:39.583
Kiddo.

262
00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:48.083
The women here put their lives on the line everyday

263
00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:50.667
to show what they can do during matches.

264
00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:53.625
Get your head straight.

265
00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.083
They need you.

266
00:19:56.792 --> 00:19:58.500
You are a hitting partner.

267
00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:02.500
But you are an important member of this team.

268
00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:05.417
What is the women's national volleyball team?

269
00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:08.000
It's not about you.

270
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:09.583
Not about me.

271
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:11.292
It's all of us.

272
00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:17.208
Come on.

273
00:20:17.292 --> 00:20:18.417
Take every opportunity we get.

274
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.250
Come on.

275
00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:20.250
Fight for this.

276
00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:23.250
China women's national team. go!

277
00:20:25.542 --> 00:20:26.375
Let me tell you

278
00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:31.875
young people just want to do right by themselves.

279
00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:33.917
Eventually they'll find

280
00:20:34.042 --> 00:20:35.417
they've only wronged other people.

281
00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:50.375
Lang Ping!

282
00:21:52.042 --> 00:21:53.250
If you can beat us

283
00:21:53.542 --> 00:21:55.042
I'll train with you for life.

284
00:22:49.542 --> 00:22:57.500
Learn from the women's national volleyball team.

285
00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:07.750
You'll play at the World Cup in Japan soon.

286
00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:12.542
They'll have strong lights for TV on both sides.

287
00:23:13.042 --> 00:23:14.208
You must get used to them.

288
00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:23.333
Look at the court.

289
00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:26.083
No. 3 is 1.9m tall.

290
00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:29.542
He's the same height as Soviet's Pavlova.

291
00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:36.042
No. 7 is 1.96m tall.

292
00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.708
Same height as US' Flo Hyman.

293
00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:45.500
No. 10 spiking height is the same as Cuba's Pérez.

294
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.417
Our training partner's power and build

295
00:23:50.417 --> 00:23:52.208
are similar to Yumi Egami's.

296
00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:02.125
Lang Ping is 1.84m.

297
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:04.792
She's our best match to a western outside hitter.

298
00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:07.792
This is a test match.

299
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:11.792
If we can match a men's team today

300
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.708
tomorrow

301
00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.625
we can win the World Cup.

302
00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:33.917
You ladies ignored teamwork today.

303
00:24:34.792 --> 00:24:35.417
We keep training.

304
00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:37.917
We'll start with the captain.

305
00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:42.375
Make 30 good saves.

306
00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:47.542
Come on!

307
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.500
Come on!

308
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:05.750
It's already New Year!

309
00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:12.458
Let them take a break.

310
00:25:19.917 --> 00:25:20.750
Negative 12.

311
00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:22.792
Who wants to take her place?

312
00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:24.250
Me!

313
00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:30.917
Come on!

314
00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:11.417
That's 30.

315
00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:20.208
Let's eat.

316
00:27:02.958 --> 00:27:03.958
Baby.

317
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.958
Mom.

318
00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:19.208
The coach sent me here.

319
00:27:21.792 --> 00:27:22.458
Don't cry.

320
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.458
I do have selfish intentions.

321
00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:23.542
In 1966

322
00:28:24.292 --> 00:28:25.167
the men's national team

323
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:27.125
came in 9th.

324
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.708
Everyone was confident

325
00:28:31.792 --> 00:28:33.375
we can reach the top.

326
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:35.833
Who would have thought

327
00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:38.833
we'd stop playing for the next 10 years.

328
00:28:39.833 --> 00:28:42.792
There's been a dagger in my heart ever since.

329
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.208
The first time I went abroad.

330
00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:50.583
I was in awe of the hotel room.

331
00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:56.708
Refrigerator

332
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:57.792
colour TV

333
00:28:58.292 --> 00:28:59.042
air conditioner

334
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.625
I've never seen them before.

335
00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:04.917
I couldn't sleep that night.

336
00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:07.542
Looking at the buildings outside

337
00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:08.667
I cried.

338
00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.292
China is so far behind

339
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:14.667
what can we do?

340
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.250
Do we just sit here and sigh

341
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.083
or fight and catch up with the lost time?

342
00:29:24.042 --> 00:29:25.833
The country is reforming to open up

343
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.167
sports in China is a priority.

344
00:29:29.292 --> 00:29:31.542
We don't have the facilities other countries have

345
00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:35.000
so we have to work harder to have any chance of winning.

346
00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:38.375
The Chinese people need to be world champions.

347
00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:42.250
We need to prove to everyone

348
00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:43.792
us Chinese

349
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.333
are great.

350
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.375
Come on.

351
00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:58.333
I'll do whatever it takes

352
00:29:58.625 --> 00:29:59.875
to make you women the world champions.

353
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.292
China women's national volleyball team

354
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:05.917
One. two. come on!

355
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.583
Higher.

356
00:30:18.417 --> 00:30:19.250
Watch your movements!

357
00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:23.542
We can't beat them by heavy attacks.

358
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.583
We need a combination of soft touches.

359
00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:28.833
Watch out for Egami's quick change of pace.

360
00:30:31.042 --> 00:30:33.792
No one can win the World Cup with a smile on their face.

361
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:35.542
Go on.

362
00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:43.083
Come on!

363
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.792
You start with what's special about the Japanese team.

364
00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:04.875
Do you still remember that English sentence?

365
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.083
I love my motherland.

366
00:31:07.167 --> 00:31:09.583
I love my motherland.

367
00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:13.417
I love the morning of my motherland.

368
00:31:14.917 --> 00:31:16.292
The Japanese are quite short.

369
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.333
Defence well.

370
00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:19.542
Hard to be defeated.

371
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.167
When we face them next time

372
00:31:21.292 --> 00:31:22.958
we need to time our jumps with quick hands.

373
00:31:23.042 --> 00:31:23.792
Strong arms.

374
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.125
To make good blocks.

375
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.125
And prepare ourselves for long rallies.

376
00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:29.250
Have to fight till the bitter end.

377
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:32.625
We can fight back by playing their style.

378
00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:35.750
but have to cover our tracks.

379
00:31:38.917 --> 00:31:39.833
Let's continue.

380
00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:08.125
Go!

381
00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:11.250
This is our last chance!

382
00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:19.167
That's all

383
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.000
for the 1981 squad to Japan.

384
00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:23.625
Hitting partner

385
00:32:23.958 --> 00:32:25.583
will not be travelling with us.

386
00:32:30.917 --> 00:32:32.667
Sometimes when it comes to DNA

387
00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:34.542
we really can't fight with nature.

388
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.583
Have you reached 3.32m yet?

389
00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:41.958
But volleyball

390
00:32:42.042 --> 00:32:43.458
is not about personal heroics.

391
00:32:44.333 --> 00:32:45.708
Look to your teammates.

392
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.750
What you should do

393
00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.333
is accept reality.

394
00:32:51.667 --> 00:32:52.792
Accept reality?

395
00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:56.000
So you're willing to be a hitting partner for life?

396
00:33:03.792 --> 00:33:05.125
And what's wrong with that?

397
00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.625
I'll be next to you when you win world championships.

398
00:33:09.292 --> 00:33:11.000
We can't play for life.

399
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.333
What happen when we can't move anymore?

400
00:33:14.042 --> 00:33:15.125
You've not thought about

401
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.542
being the head coach?

402
00:33:27.292 --> 00:33:28.875
You haven't slept in a while.

403
00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:31.208
Try to get some sleep on the plane.

404
00:33:35.417 --> 00:33:36.417
Hello.

405
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.917
Hello.

406
00:33:40.917 --> 00:33:42.000
Nice to meet you.

407
00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:49.750
2 coffee. please.

408
00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:51.208
Hope you all come back as champions!

409
00:33:51.292 --> 00:33:52.083
Thanks.

410
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.875
I think we should take a group photo.

411
00:33:58.667 --> 00:33:59.500
It's so bitter.

412
00:34:00.583 --> 00:34:01.833
Tastes like Chinese medicine.

413
00:34:05.792 --> 00:34:06.542
Ping...

414
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:15.625
One of us did the front

415
00:34:16.083 --> 00:34:17.208
another did the back

416
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:19.375
someone did the sleeves

417
00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:21.708
then there's the collar.

418
00:34:23.042 --> 00:34:24.417
It's a group effort.

419
00:34:24.833 --> 00:34:26.667
Everyone at least did a few stitches.

420
00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:30.292
Even though it's not very neat

421
00:34:31.292 --> 00:34:32.833
and the sleeves are different size.

422
00:34:36.125 --> 00:34:36.625
I want to...

423
00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:38.417
One day when you're the head coach

424
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.000
you'll get your chance to travel.

425
00:34:40.083 --> 00:34:42.375
Ping! Time to board.

426
00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:44.458
Let's go.

427
00:34:53.292 --> 00:34:54.167
Hello everyone.

428
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.458
We're at the Osaka Gymnasium

429
00:34:56.542 --> 00:34:58.625
live at the 3rd FIVB Women's Volleyball World Cup.

430
00:34:58.958 --> 00:35:00.625
The match between China and Japan

431
00:35:00.708 --> 00:35:02.750
for the championship.

432
00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:07.583
During the match so far

433
00:35:07.667 --> 00:35:10.000
the Chinese team has been looking tense. rushing their plays.

434
00:35:11.958 --> 00:35:12.583
Come on!

435
00:35:14.042 --> 00:35:14.958
Japan serves.

436
00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:16.917
This is the 4th set.

437
00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:19.083
The atmosphere is highly intense.

438
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.125
Japan's defense is nearly perfect.

439
00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:23.083
They are doing all they can to save a ball.

440
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.708
China spikes.

441
00:35:38.292 --> 00:35:39.167
It goes out.

442
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.292
It's 8 to 4.

443
00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:46.333
Japan is in the lead.

444
00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:48.708
The nickname "Toyo Witch" sure suits the Japanese.

445
00:35:48.792 --> 00:35:50.875
Their defense is impossible to penetrate.

446
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.083
The Japanese do play for their lives.

447
00:36:17.167 --> 00:36:18.375
They are on a high.

448
00:36:18.458 --> 00:36:19.833
Team China's offense looks shut down.

449
00:36:19.958 --> 00:36:21.083
It's a stalemate.

450
00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:25.292
No. 3's spike hits the net.

451
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:26.458
China loses another point.

452
00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:28.000
Her attack was rushed.

453
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.542
What a terrible spike.

454
00:36:30.625 --> 00:36:31.333
9 to 4.

455
00:36:31.417 --> 00:36:32.375
Japan leads.

456
00:36:53.083 --> 00:36:54.333
Japan aces on serve.

457
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.208
For the last few points

458
00:36:56.292 --> 00:36:57.542
China's main problem has been erroneous first passes.

459
00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:58.625
What's going on now?

460
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.667
China's losing.

461
00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:00.708
Again.

462
00:37:01.917 --> 00:37:02.833
A two-man block from China.

463
00:37:02.917 --> 00:37:03.792
The ball goes out.

464
00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:05.208
China makes another mistake.

465
00:37:05.583 --> 00:37:06.583
Japan serves.

466
00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:07.542
Another point.

467
00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.292
Japan is controlling the play now

468
00:37:09.375 --> 00:37:12.875
but China has prepared for the worst.

469
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:13.750
It's not over yet.

470
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.500
Let's turn it around!

471
00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:15.375
Yes!

472
00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.500
One. two. come on!

473
00:37:31.417 --> 00:37:32.333
Japan spikes again.

474
00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.708
China's No. 7 falls on her hips.

475
00:37:34.792 --> 00:37:36.250
She supports herself up.

476
00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:38.833
Japan gets ready for another attack.

477
00:37:39.042 --> 00:37:39.958
Japan spikes again.

478
00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:41.625
The ball flies out.

479
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.125
Japan wins the 4th set.

480
00:37:59.792 --> 00:38:01.292
China has no other opposite hitter.

481
00:38:01.375 --> 00:38:03.625
How will their Coach handle this?

482
00:38:09.917 --> 00:38:10.625
Coach!

483
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:13.750
This is my last match.

484
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:15.792
Please let me have a go at it!

485
00:38:17.917 --> 00:38:18.583
Get ready.

486
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:20.125
Yes!

487
00:38:27.958 --> 00:38:29.417
Those 4 sets are in the past

488
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.792
don't think about them.

489
00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:34.250
I need you to think about one thing only.

490
00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:37.583
Think about where you're playing now.

491
00:38:38.917 --> 00:38:40.500
We are Chinese.

492
00:38:41.958 --> 00:38:43.792
And you're representing the people of China.

493
00:38:44.958 --> 00:38:47.000
If you don't win this match

494
00:38:50.042 --> 00:38:51.917
all of you will regret this for life.

495
00:38:55.417 --> 00:38:56.167
Come on.

496
00:38:56.792 --> 00:38:58.083
Let's fight.

497
00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:00.292
Come on!

498
00:39:00.375 --> 00:39:01.958
One. two. come on!

499
00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:09.458
Can she still play?

500
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.542
I didn't know they're this desperate.

501
00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:15.833
The crowd's applause is thunderous.

502
00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:17.292
While commentating

503
00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:19.333
our lips are pressed against the mics

504
00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:21.667
Doing our best to cover all actions on court.

505
00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:41.125
No. 1 spikes!

506
00:39:42.042 --> 00:39:42.750
Great spike.

507
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.833
That was one powerful spike.

508
00:39:46.042 --> 00:39:47.875
With that China get the next serve.

509
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.583
This is likely to be her last world cup.

510
00:39:56.542 --> 00:39:57.792
The ball lands inbounds.

511
00:39:57.958 --> 00:39:58.792
A point!

512
00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:15.208
Japan wasn't ready for China's No. 1 to play.

513
00:40:15.792 --> 00:40:17.917
She is turning the game around!

514
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:20.250
We're winning.

515
00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:21.667
China wins a point!

516
00:40:21.917 --> 00:40:24.375
Coach's tactic pays off!

517
00:40:29.583 --> 00:40:30.625
Coach said

518
00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:32.625
Team China's goal

519
00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:35.625
is to fight until the last minute

520
00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:37.042
and take the Cup home.

521
00:40:45.833 --> 00:40:47.792
No. 1 is the kind of player who shines on court.

522
00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:48.750
Her energy is contagious.

523
00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:51.667
She gives the team an extra bounce.

524
00:41:09.792 --> 00:41:12.083
Japan thought our outside hitter only spikes

525
00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:14.042
but instead of her usual high and fierce attack

526
00:41:14.125 --> 00:41:15.417
she used an unexpected tip against them.

527
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.125
China leads at 4 nil.

528
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:06.250
It's rare to see a match like this.

529
00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:08.750
The players are all very active on court

530
00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:11.125
as if they have endless power.

531
00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:24.208
Japan's coach. calls for a timeout.

532
00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:27.375
Let's see how he is going to cope with the deficit.

533
00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:29.833
Hear the sounds around you. Please lift your spirits.

534
00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:33.375
They couldn't play this well for long.

535
00:42:37.167 --> 00:42:38.250
Must keep up the pace.

536
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.417
Call out the play.

537
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:39.875
Yes.

538
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:40.583
Like monsters!

539
00:42:40.667 --> 00:42:41.125
Got it!

540
00:42:41.208 --> 00:42:41.792
Listen.

541
00:42:42.167 --> 00:42:43.625
We can't lose to China.

542
00:42:45.083 --> 00:42:45.792
We must win.

543
00:42:47.667 --> 00:42:49.000
We are the best!

544
00:43:36.917 --> 00:43:40.000
The Japanese rally again.

545
00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:41.750
They are running actively

546
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:43.417
and getting ready for a counterattack.

547
00:44:07.417 --> 00:44:09.542
We've said that Japan is hard to kill.

548
00:44:09.792 --> 00:44:12.250
As long as the game is on. they can win it back.

549
00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:17.792
13 all.

550
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.083
Japan battles back to a tie.

551
00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:22.125
Team China is forced to stay passive again.

552
00:44:22.208 --> 00:44:23.875
Their stamina is going down as well.

553
00:44:41.292 --> 00:44:43.917
At this critical moment. Coach stays very calm.

554
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.875
He is gaining time for No. 3 to rest and adjust.

555
00:44:46.958 --> 00:44:49.792
Is No. 7 able to push on with her hip injury?

556
00:44:55.708 --> 00:44:57.167
Look at the court.

557
00:44:59.292 --> 00:45:00.417
You are the youngest.

558
00:45:01.542 --> 00:45:03.125
And you have the strongest attack.

559
00:45:15.292 --> 00:45:17.958
I called you up to the national team when you were 18.

560
00:45:20.458 --> 00:45:23.417
Everything I've put you through

561
00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:25.750
all leads up to today.

562
00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.083
Get ready.

563
00:45:49.792 --> 00:45:51.167
Set every ball to me.

564
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:53.042
I will hit it over.

565
00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:03.292
Come on!

566
00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:04.833
Fight. this is our chance!

567
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:07.417
Come on. come on!

568
00:46:17.167 --> 00:46:19.417
Japan takes the lead 15:14.

569
00:46:19.792 --> 00:46:21.417
What a crucial moment!

570
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:36.208
China's spiking from the top.

571
00:46:36.583 --> 00:46:37.333
The ball's in!

572
00:46:38.208 --> 00:46:39.958
Good job girls!

573
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.500
Great teamwork!

574
00:46:45.792 --> 00:46:47.667
China gets to serve next.

575
00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:18.125
A diagonal spike from Area 4.

576
00:47:18.208 --> 00:47:19.667
A hard-earned point.

577
00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:21.125
It's a tie at 15!

578
00:47:53.917 --> 00:47:56.000
China blocks and wins a point. 16:15!

579
00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:58.750
They successfully predicted Japan's tactics

580
00:47:58.833 --> 00:48:00.625
and break their attack!

581
00:48:00.917 --> 00:48:01.958
Everyone out there

582
00:48:02.042 --> 00:48:05.000
our fellow Chinese home and abroad

583
00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:09.500
this is the last game in the last match of this World Cup

584
00:48:09.708 --> 00:48:13.125
and the final challenge for the national volleyball team.

585
00:48:15.625 --> 00:48:16.375
China serves.

586
00:48:17.458 --> 00:48:19.250
No. 10 is serving.

587
00:48:24.667 --> 00:48:26.042
Japan receives.

588
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.667
The ball is set to Area 4.

589
00:48:31.167 --> 00:48:32.500
Japan spikes.

590
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.500
It's 17:15!

591
00:48:42.292 --> 00:48:44.417
Victory for China!

592
00:48:55.375 --> 00:48:56.333
This is the moment

593
00:48:56.417 --> 00:48:59.250
that generations of Chinese people have dreamed of!

594
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:00.958
The players are hugging each other.

595
00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:16.125
China takes home the World Cup

596
00:49:16.208 --> 00:49:19.292
with 7 straight wins!

597
00:50:06.292 --> 00:50:07.042
Comrade

598
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.708
are you an athlete?

599
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.458
I'm a volleyball player.

600
00:50:10.833 --> 00:50:12.375
You play volleyball. too?

601
00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:32.333
Congratulations.

602
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.375
China has got a great team.

603
00:50:40.042 --> 00:50:41.958
I've been trying to reach

604
00:50:42.042 --> 00:50:43.708
your jumping height for so long.

605
00:50:47.042 --> 00:50:48.417
I haven't made it.

606
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:51.333
You may not have reached my height

607
00:50:51.417 --> 00:50:53.000
but you're playing better.

608
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.792
Plus your team plays as one.

609
00:51:46.792 --> 00:51:47.625
We'll piggyback you onto the stage.

610
00:51:47.708 --> 00:51:48.750
I can do it.

611
00:51:53.292 --> 00:51:54.542
Stay in line. don't fall behind.

612
00:51:55.375 --> 00:51:56.167
Don't cry.

613
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:13.000
One

614
00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:15.042
Two

615
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.917
Three

616
00:55:48.167 --> 00:55:49.208
In person?

617
00:55:49.583 --> 00:55:50.833
It's much pressure but

618
00:55:51.167 --> 00:55:52.250
we will give it our best.

619
00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:54.292
Rhythm. don't forget rhythm.

620
00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:55.000
Change it up!

621
00:55:56.417 --> 00:55:57.375
Got it.

622
00:55:57.458 --> 00:55:58.417
Don't think too much.

623
00:55:58.625 --> 00:55:59.833
Focus on fighting the opponent.

624
00:56:00.708 --> 00:56:01.083
That's a good one.

625
00:56:01.167 --> 00:56:01.750
What good one?

626
00:56:01.833 --> 00:56:03.167
You spike too early. One more!

627
00:56:03.292 --> 00:56:04.542
Come on. come on. good.

628
00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:10.333
What did you eat today?

629
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:11.750
Marshmallow?

630
00:56:12.167 --> 00:56:14.042
If you spike so low against the Americans

631
00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:15.458
it'd be no difference from hitting a wall.

632
00:56:15.958 --> 00:56:16.917
Spike at the highest point.

633
00:56:17.167 --> 00:56:17.917
Understand?

634
00:56:20.542 --> 00:56:21.625
Thank you for checking in.

635
00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:23.458
The pressure is also great motivation.

636
00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:37.000
What can I do for you. Coach?

637
00:56:38.792 --> 00:56:40.167
The old habit hasn't changed?

638
00:56:40.833 --> 00:56:41.708
How's it?

639
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:43.625
There's a slight breeze...

640
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.667
but it won't affect serves.

641
00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:47.875
Yeah?

642
00:56:48.208 --> 00:56:49.667
To be honest

643
00:56:50.042 --> 00:56:52.417
I feel weird meeting like this before a match.

644
00:56:57.708 --> 00:57:01.000
3 years ago I asked you about taking over the US team.

645
00:57:02.667 --> 00:57:04.292
You told me that I had your support.

646
00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:06.750
Back then

647
00:57:06.833 --> 00:57:08.167
you should have known

648
00:57:09.083 --> 00:57:10.583
that we'd meet like this sooner or later.

649
00:57:11.458 --> 00:57:12.750
We can't run from this.

650
00:57:36.292 --> 00:57:38.292
How could you have that lying around?

651
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:41.875
You don't know English.

652
00:57:44.208 --> 00:57:45.250
My listening is okay.

653
00:57:45.917 --> 00:57:47.708
Just need to work on my oral and reading.

654
00:57:55.208 --> 00:57:57.917
So. why did you ask me out?

655
00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:02.167
You remember what Coach used to tell us?

656
00:58:02.792 --> 00:58:04.458
Why can a glass hold water?

657
00:58:04.542 --> 00:58:05.625
Because it's empty.

658
00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:10.167
Which team do you think will win tomorrow?

659
00:58:11.417 --> 00:58:13.833
You've beaten the US team so many times.

660
00:58:14.708 --> 00:58:17.417
Abilities wise. team USA is no match for Team China.

661
00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:20.583
Ping.

662
00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:23.667
But what you really think is not that the US will lose

663
00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:25.208
but they'd win. right?

664
00:58:26.542 --> 00:58:27.500
I get it.

665
00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:29.375
You want us to relax

666
00:58:29.917 --> 00:58:32.125
and bring out our best.

667
00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:34.667
Of course I hope China can win.

668
00:58:35.167 --> 00:58:36.917
But as a coach

669
00:58:37.208 --> 00:58:39.000
Team USA is my responsibility.

670
00:58:39.667 --> 00:58:41.375
We've been friends for 30 years.

671
00:58:42.167 --> 00:58:43.958
Of course I know

672
00:58:44.417 --> 00:58:45.542
your love for the Chinese team.

673
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:47.625
Relax.

674
00:58:47.833 --> 00:58:49.125
Just give us your best shot.

675
00:58:50.792 --> 00:58:52.792
That's the only way to honour our fighting spirit.

676
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.750
You might have lost hope. wandering around...

677
00:59:01.542 --> 00:59:05.417
like a scarecrow without a soul.

678
00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:11.750
Life is like the waves of the sea.

679
00:59:12.125 --> 00:59:17.583
There are highs and lows.

680
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:21.000
No matter good luck or bad luck

681
00:59:21.542 --> 00:59:25.583
life needs to go on.

682
00:59:27.125 --> 00:59:29.458
Three parts fate

683
00:59:30.083 --> 00:59:32.125
seven parts hard work.

684
00:59:32.708 --> 00:59:38.875
Love the fight to win!

685
00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:53.458
I'm a bad singer.

686
00:59:54.708 --> 00:59:56.083
But I love this song.

687
00:59:56.917 --> 00:59:58.250
"Love the Fight to Win".

688
01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:03.208
Over the years

689
01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:05.958
I've been busy training

690
01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:08.750
Never realise...

691
01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:12.833
how beautiful you all are.

692
01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:18.333
How all of you came to be here.

693
01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.125
Every training

694
01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:22.542
every injury and fall

695
01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:25.667
I've witnessed them all.

696
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:28.958
Looking at you

697
01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:33.167
I remember when I first entered the volleyball team.

698
01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:36.458
And the women there.

699
01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:38.375
You are just like them.

700
01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:41.917
You should be proud of yourselves.

701
01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:45.542
I'm deeply grateful to all of you.

702
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.458
Okay

703
01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:48.458
stop staring at me.

704
01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:49.667
I'm gonna cry.

705
01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:52.875
Today's practice is over.

706
01:00:53.042 --> 01:00:54.458
Eat three blocks of chocolate

707
01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:56.417
for each set you'll win tomorrow! Okay?

708
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.625
Yeah! Come!

709
01:00:57.708 --> 01:00:59.292
Fight!

710
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.292
The last few points were very good.

711
01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.042
Girls. listen.

712
01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:26.667
Next. they'll try to disrupt our first pass.

713
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.750
They're getting nervous. stay on top of them.

714
01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:29.542
Move early.

715
01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.750
Make it difficult for them on the receive.

716
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:34.083
Block. faster!

717
01:01:34.167 --> 01:01:35.625
Pay attention to Area 5.

718
01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:39.708
Area 5!

719
01:01:47.042 --> 01:01:47.917
Don't give them time to think.

720
01:01:50.042 --> 01:01:50.792
First pass!

721
01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.250
Watch the outside. Go for the middle.

722
01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:56.583
Protect when making strong attacks.

723
01:01:57.792 --> 01:01:58.667
High point!

724
01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:02.542
Again.

725
01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:04.125
Hit it short. short!

726
01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:10.542
No rush.

727
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:11.875
I'm not in a hurry. why are you?

728
01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:13.292
It's the weaker rotation

729
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.458
time your blocks.

730
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:15.625
Think.

731
01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:16.583
Put pressure on them.

732
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.208
Tip more.

733
01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:20.917
Hey Logan. watch out for their tips

734
01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:26.667
Protection!

735
01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.500
She's going for the tip!

736
01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:55.375
Our red flag flies as the song of victory echoes in the sky

737
01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:56.958
Alright. listen to me...

738
01:02:57.042 --> 01:02:58.208
Their No. 1 is tired.

739
01:02:58.292 --> 01:03:00.125
Focus on Areas 2 and 3.

740
01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:01.583
Concentrate!

741
01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:02.333
Make strong blocks.

742
01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:03.542
Mark them.

743
01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:08.042
Let's sing for our dear motherland.

744
01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:09.792
Hold on for me.

745
01:03:10.292 --> 01:03:12.125
You can do this. definitely can.

746
01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:13.792
Kim.

747
01:03:13.917 --> 01:03:15.708
Make changes on attack. hit it straight and short.

748
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.333
Yes sir.

749
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:17.875
What did you eat today?

750
01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:18.708
Steak.

751
01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:20.333
Very good. show me what you've got.

752
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.250
No. 1. block her.

753
01:04:22.917 --> 01:04:24.292
What's with the look on your face?

754
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.875
Don't think too much about it.

755
01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:27.833
What we should do now

756
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.875
is to fight back point by point!

757
01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:32.292
We can lose to our opponent

758
01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:33.750
but not to ourselves.

759
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.250
I've got nothing to say.

760
01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:41.542
This is your game.

761
01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:45.417
Fight. this is our last chance!

762
01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:48.000
USA! One. two. three.

763
01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:48.917
One. two. come on!

764
01:04:49.292 --> 01:04:50.500
USA!

765
01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:55.417
The match has come to the 5th set.

766
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.833
Match point for Team USA.

767
01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:05.625
Their first pass is bad.

768
01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:08.083
US adjusts their attack. This is No. 3.

769
01:05:08.167 --> 01:05:09.417
China still has the chance.

770
01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:26.917
US blocks to win the point.

771
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.042
15:11.

772
01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.375
Team USA wins the 5th set.

773
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.958
With that. they win the match 3:2.

774
01:05:34.833 --> 01:05:36.917
China and the US are well-matched teams.

775
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.375
Today China was just short of luck.

776
01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:43.458
Home pressure may have affected their performance.

777
01:05:43.625 --> 01:05:44.458
Despite the loss

778
01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:46.333
they made it to the end.

779
01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:48.208
They are all heroes.

780
01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:50.500
Let's hope they can adjust

781
01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:52.042
and do better in coming matches.

782
01:05:58.583 --> 01:06:00.083
Playing Coach Jenny's home team

783
01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:01.750
we wanted to show that we are the best.

784
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:06.625
Today we did that!

785
01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.875
We did it!

786
01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.167
At least my son is happy.

787
01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:52.917
I can finally go home.

788
01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:58.583
China lost.

789
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.833
And all they do is blame you.

790
01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:28.583
Mom!

791
01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:31.417
Congratulations. You were so great.

792
01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:34.625
I only knew you coached volleyball.

793
01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:38.083
Mom. I'm so happy!

794
01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:40.125
Are you happy?

795
01:07:41.708 --> 01:07:42.833
Yeah.

796
01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:45.000
I'm really proud of you.

797
01:07:46.208 --> 01:07:47.000
Lydia.

798
01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.542
It's been a long time since you've been to China.

799
01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:52.292
It's changed so much.

800
01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:55.958
I no longer recognise some of the places.

801
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.417
Mom. are you crying?

802
01:08:05.625 --> 01:08:09.583
I saw a friend I hadn't seen for a long time.

803
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:15.792
We talked for a while.

804
01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:21.042
I probably

805
01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:24.208
disappointed him today.

806
01:08:27.583 --> 01:08:28.667
I'm sorry.

807
01:09:41.083 --> 01:09:42.083
Excuse me lady?

808
01:09:42.167 --> 01:09:44.958
You know I can have you towed for parking in a handicap spot.

809
01:09:49.958 --> 01:09:51.833
Oh. sorry.

810
01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:53.792
You look too young to need this.

811
01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.042
20 years of being an athlete.

812
01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.417
Oh? What sport?

813
01:09:58.542 --> 01:09:59.625
Volleyball.

814
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:02.250
How the hell do you injure yourself playing volleyball?

815
01:10:02.542 --> 01:10:05.250
Sometimes. it puzzles me too.

816
01:10:21.833 --> 01:10:24.083
Now they can't even beat Japan.

817
01:10:24.292 --> 01:10:26.125
Each generation is worse than the last.

818
01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.042
What is this? They should just dismiss this team.

819
01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:33.792
It's not the 80s. don't get so involved.

820
01:10:34.042 --> 01:10:36.542
Volleyball is just a game.

821
01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:46.500
In 1981's Volleyball World Cup

822
01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:49.500
she finished the match despite a hip injury.

823
01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:51.208
Her fighting spirit inspired a whole generation.

824
01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.042
After the new year

825
01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.167
her conditions deteriorated.

826
01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:59.417
Defeated by cancer.

827
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.333
she passed away on April 1st. 2013 in Beijing.

828
01:11:56.292 --> 01:11:59.917
Stay in line. don't fall behind.

829
01:12:00.542 --> 01:12:01.667
Don't cry.

830
01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:11.875
My match is nearly over.

831
01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:15.667
I'm going to take a break.

832
01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:24.750
Let's be teammates again in our next life.

833
01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:31.042
The service begins.

834
01:12:32.417 --> 01:12:35.042
Please all rise.

835
01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:10.042
You can bring something new to the women's team.

836
01:13:10.542 --> 01:13:12.875
You have our support.

837
01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:15.375
Come back.

838
01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.125
Come back.

839
01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:57.583
How you've been?

840
01:13:58.667 --> 01:13:59.583
Fine.

841
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:18.500
Mom. you'll be home soon?

842
01:14:19.333 --> 01:14:20.167
Lydia

843
01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.333
I might not come back next week.

844
01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:25.667
Is Lang Ping the new head coach?

845
01:14:27.542 --> 01:14:28.417
Please say something.

846
01:14:30.292 --> 01:14:32.042
Can you stay for some photos?

847
01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:34.667
Coach Lang!

848
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.000
Please say something!

849
01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:38.833
It's Lang Ping.

850
01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:39.708
As we had hoped

851
01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:41.875
she's the new head coach of Women's Volleyball Team.

852
01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:48.417
I'm sticking to what I said

853
01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:51.292
we shouldn't have too much expectations on the current team.

854
01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:54.708
The Women's Team is just second-rated.

855
01:14:54.792 --> 01:14:55.750
That's the reality.

856
01:14:56.042 --> 01:14:57.333
The players we have

857
01:14:57.417 --> 01:14:59.542
are much worse comparing to the ones in the 80s.

858
01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:02.083
I suggest we manage them on a daily basis

859
01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:03.333
Be firm.

860
01:15:03.417 --> 01:15:04.958
Take away their phones if needed.

861
01:15:05.208 --> 01:15:05.958
Coach Lang

862
01:15:06.167 --> 01:15:08.375
I watched you play since I was a kid.

863
01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:11.500
I understand you're looking towards the future

864
01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:12.625
but I suggest

865
01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.333
we should stabilise the team as a stop gap.

866
01:15:15.958 --> 01:15:16.875
I'm sorry

867
01:15:17.542 --> 01:15:18.917
I'm here in this meeting

868
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.083
not to listen to what you have to say

869
01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:23.542
but for you all to hear me out.

870
01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:27.208
Changing the team is not a one person job.

871
01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:28.625
Me included.

872
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.583
Our sporting system was set 30 years ago.

873
01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:34.042
It's outdated.

874
01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:37.208
There's only one way to go

875
01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:39.792
reform.

876
01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:45.000
Now I will announce my 3 reform plans:

877
01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.250
I will start by doing what other international teams do.

878
01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:50.917
Choose from a bigger squad.

879
01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:53.375
Where we used to have 12 players

880
01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:55.750
with 6 or 7 good enough to start

881
01:15:56.042 --> 01:15:58.750
now I'm going to pick 30 players.

882
01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:02.292
Who's that kid with long hair?

883
01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:04.667
She shouldn't play beach volleyball.

884
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:05.750
She should play indoor.

885
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.125
Her name is Zhang Changning.

886
01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:10.667
She just got permission to transfer to indoor volleyball.

887
01:16:11.292 --> 01:16:13.250
This is her last beach volleyball match.

888
01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:17.625
No. 4 Hui Ruoqi. You're her idol since childhood.

889
01:16:17.792 --> 01:16:19.583
Then she should be good.

890
01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:24.917
Who's the setter for Liaoning?

891
01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:27.000
Ding Xia.

892
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.917
As a setter. her best attribute is

893
01:16:31.708 --> 01:16:32.750
spiking.

894
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.750
Shit!

895
01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:36.917
Good one.

896
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.875
If 30 is not enough

897
01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:45.292
we select 50.

898
01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:58.708
Old lady!

899
01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:00.333
This is a dorm. not your home.

900
01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:04.917
- You're out of your mind! - If 50 is not enough

901
01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:06.125
then 100.

902
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:18.333
Coach Lang

903
01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.292
I beg to differ.

904
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.250
Back from your championship days

905
01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:23.833
it was always about training 6 or 7 players

906
01:17:23.917 --> 01:17:27.000
together for a long period of time. like a family.

907
01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:29.250
That's how we become world beaters.

908
01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:30.833
The winning days

909
01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:33.750
were in 1986.

910
01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.208
27 years ago.

911
01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:48.917
Coach

912
01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:50.042
see this No. 5

913
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.375
her name is Zhu Ting.

914
01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:52.500
Born in 1994.

915
01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:53.750
1.94m tall.

916
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.333
I've seen this No. 5 of Henan before.

917
01:17:57.583 --> 01:17:59.375
Zhu Ting's is quite tall

918
01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:01.125
but she's thin. so her spikes are weak.

919
01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:02.833
And she only spikes diagonals.

920
01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.583
We're thinking putting her to the backup team.

921
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.583
Coach. that No. 3 is quite good.

922
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.375
She can spike without a run up.

923
01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:12.083
That's truly something.

924
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.292
I'm here.

925
01:18:22.917 --> 01:18:23.750
Chen Lu.

926
01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:25.583
30 minutes late.

927
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.542
10 laps. 50 pushups.

928
01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.000
I'll tell you when to stop.

929
01:18:34.708 --> 01:18:35.750
Jump later. Slow down!

930
01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.167
Protection!

931
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:40.208
Nice one!

932
01:18:45.792 --> 01:18:46.667
Up!

933
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.458
When you back set

934
01:18:51.542 --> 01:18:53.167
watch the rhythm

935
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:54.208
and your hand.

936
01:18:54.417 --> 01:18:55.625
Don't be scared for a back set.

937
01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:56.250
Fine.

938
01:18:56.958 --> 01:18:57.708
You're the captain

939
01:18:57.792 --> 01:18:58.833
not the coach.

940
01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:01.417
With a large number of new recruits in the team

941
01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:03.792
the conflicts between players of different ages.

942
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:05.083
How would you deal with it?

943
01:19:05.167 --> 01:19:05.792
Fine!

944
01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:07.500
I'm putting it out here right now.

945
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.083
You older players like to stay among yourselves

946
01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:11.417
nitpicking at everything we newcomers do.

947
01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:12.375
Not even when you're wrong?

948
01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:14.042
Do you know what it means to be on this team?

949
01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:14.875
I agree.

950
01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.208
You all are too self-centred

951
01:19:16.292 --> 01:19:17.542
and there are no respects.

952
01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:19.042
Who'd just slap someone on the ass.

953
01:19:19.292 --> 01:19:20.542
We wouldn't dare to do that.

954
01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:23.500
I didn't know being here is about taking lessons from you.

955
01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:26.000
This is too much for me.

956
01:19:26.083 --> 01:19:27.125
I might as well just leave.

957
01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:28.917
Ding Xia. do you think before you speak?

958
01:19:29.417 --> 01:19:30.750
The whole team is waiting for you.

959
01:19:34.042 --> 01:19:34.833
Zhang Changning!

960
01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:35.917
What are you waiting for?

961
01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:37.458
It's not beach volleyball. there's no sand.

962
01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:52.875
My second reform plan:

963
01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:55.000
Hiring coaches around the world

964
01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:57.792
building a coaching team.

965
01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:05.833
This won't work.

966
01:20:06.542 --> 01:20:08.500
We've never had foreigners in the coaching team.

967
01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:10.375
From this day forward

968
01:20:10.708 --> 01:20:11.458
we will.

969
01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:16.000
Stop. put it down.

970
01:20:17.292 --> 01:20:18.000
Ting

971
01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:19.708
you're underweight.

972
01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:20.958
You'll get injured.

973
01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:22.625
This is for you. Protein powder.

974
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:23.792
To increase your muscle mass.

975
01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:25.708
Eat more and take good rest.

976
01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:27.750
Coach. how much is this?

977
01:20:29.167 --> 01:20:30.667
That sounds expensive.

978
01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:41.250
My third change:

979
01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.875
in a bigger squad system

980
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.500
I'll scrap starters and backups.

981
01:20:44.875 --> 01:20:46.542
There'll only be first team and second team.

982
01:20:47.292 --> 01:20:48.583
In this China women's national team.

983
01:20:48.667 --> 01:20:50.917
it seems like everyone can start with this new set up.

984
01:20:51.792 --> 01:20:54.417
Ping has made 26 substitutions since the match began.

985
01:20:58.458 --> 01:21:01.042
The centre of the national team nowadays

986
01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:02.667
are not the players

987
01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.625
but Lang Ping.

988
01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:08.125
With the first and second team system

989
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.750
we can use different lineups and tactics

990
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.833
according to our opponents in competitions.

991
01:21:15.292 --> 01:21:17.458
Also. I'll tell my players

992
01:21:17.792 --> 01:21:19.667
that volleyball is our job.

993
01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:21.792
Not our whole life.

994
01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:22.917
That's it.

995
01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:24.292
No more session today.

996
01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:25.333
Take a break.

997
01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:26.917
Go on a date.

998
01:21:29.042 --> 01:21:30.792
Coach. we don't have anyone to date.

999
01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.792
We're all dedicated athletes.

1000
01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:35.208
We're not going to date before becoming world champions.

1001
01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:40.625
Drop the act. guys.

1002
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.042
Because I can always change my mind.

1003
01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:43.042
Run!

1004
01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:47.042
I hope our players

1005
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:49.250
aren't only the best athletes

1006
01:21:50.542 --> 01:21:52.167
but also the best human beings.

1007
01:21:53.417 --> 01:21:54.833
That's all I've got to say.

1008
01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:56.958
Sounds complicated.

1009
01:21:57.792 --> 01:21:59.375
Make my blood pressure rise.

1010
01:22:00.167 --> 01:22:01.292
What do you think?

1011
01:22:15.542 --> 01:22:16.458
I agree to the proposal.

1012
01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:19.542
We've heard everything.

1013
01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:21.583
Coach Lang

1014
01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:24.958
we will make these reforms.

1015
01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:27.500
Hand the questionnaire in when you finish.

1016
01:22:27.917 --> 01:22:28.542
Thanks Coach.

1017
01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:30.042
What's your personality? Background?

1018
01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:32.375
What's your playing style?

1019
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.750
Why do you play volleyball?

1020
01:22:35.542 --> 01:22:36.500
Your interests?

1021
01:22:36.583 --> 01:22:37.667
Future goals?

1022
01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:39.958
Coach. there's a mistake!

1023
01:22:40.042 --> 01:22:41.250
Mine says Yunli.

1024
01:22:41.542 --> 01:22:42.750
Aren't you guys roommates?

1025
01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.875
You can only fill in the other person's.

1026
01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:46.542
You all got one?

1027
01:22:47.417 --> 01:22:48.417
Make sure you have it.

1028
01:22:52.708 --> 01:22:53.292
Yunli

1029
01:22:53.542 --> 01:22:54.875
why don't we swap and answer?

1030
01:22:55.583 --> 01:22:56.292
No.

1031
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.583
Yunli. you have a thing against we post-90s?

1032
01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:03.000
Well.

1033
01:23:04.042 --> 01:23:05.375
Let's play a game.

1034
01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:07.583
You take a guess at who I'm thinking of.

1035
01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.875
I can only answer yes or no.

1036
01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:14.250
Volleyball player?

1037
01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:14.750
Yes.

1038
01:23:14.833 --> 01:23:15.542
Is it a she?

1039
01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:16.417
Yes.

1040
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.083
Coach Lang?

1041
01:23:21.292 --> 01:23:21.792
Yes.

1042
01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:25.583
I've got someone too.

1043
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:26.500
You.

1044
01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:29.333
How did you know?

1045
01:23:30.333 --> 01:23:32.375
That's the difference between us.

1046
01:23:34.583 --> 01:23:36.875
I want to stay on the court and play volleyball!

1047
01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:38.417
Try it.

1048
01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:41.208
We are a team

1049
01:23:41.292 --> 01:23:42.292
and you need to shout.

1050
01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.292
You need to let it out.

1051
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:46.875
Ting

1052
01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:49.917
you need to know why you play volleyball.

1053
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.958
I was in basketball team before

1054
01:23:56.042 --> 01:23:56.958
and they told me

1055
01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.167
you're too skinny.

1056
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.708
Then the rowing team told me

1057
01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:01.917
kid

1058
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.458
where are you going to put your long legs?

1059
01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:09.542
That's why

1060
01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:11.375
I chose volleyball.

1061
01:24:12.333 --> 01:24:14.875
Today Team China is playing Team Turkey.

1062
01:24:15.375 --> 01:24:17.542
Coach Lang has sent in No. 9 Zhang Changning.

1063
01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:22.292
Still can't quit the habit of spinning the ball.

1064
01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:27.417
The referee whistles for serve time violation.

1065
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:35.667
At the Volleyball World Grand Prix

1066
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:38.167
China is upset by Turkey

1067
01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:39.917
and misses out on the next round.

1068
01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:50.958
After losing to Thailand

1069
01:24:51.167 --> 01:24:51.958
Lang Ping's team

1070
01:24:52.042 --> 01:24:53.458
had the worst results

1071
01:24:53.542 --> 01:24:55.208
for the national team in 38 years.

1072
01:24:55.542 --> 01:24:56.125
Well played.

1073
01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.042
What do you think of your team's performance?

1074
01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:00.875
Today. they're good.

1075
01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:02.333
Our team is good at attacking.

1076
01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:03.292
I'm very happy with them.

1077
01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:03.958
Coach Lang

1078
01:25:04.542 --> 01:25:06.542
we've tried 14 lineups and lost 13 matches.

1079
01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:07.458
Should we keep trying?

1080
01:25:07.542 --> 01:25:08.625
We can lose some more.

1081
01:25:11.417 --> 01:25:12.625
Today's match proved that

1082
01:25:13.042 --> 01:25:15.583
Italy. comparing to China

1083
01:25:15.667 --> 01:25:17.583
plays on another level.

1084
01:25:18.792 --> 01:25:21.500
The time will soon be up for Ping.

1085
01:25:25.042 --> 01:25:25.792
Coach Lang

1086
01:25:26.542 --> 01:25:28.458
it was quite an embarrassing match for China.

1087
01:25:28.542 --> 01:25:30.375
Have you thought about changing the tactics?

1088
01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:35.917
How did you make it into the national team?

1089
01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:38.708
Oh yeah

1090
01:25:38.792 --> 01:25:40.000
I picked you.

1091
01:25:42.792 --> 01:25:43.958
I've read your questionnaires.

1092
01:25:44.417 --> 01:25:45.542
There's 1 question

1093
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.250
"Do you love volleyball?"

1094
01:25:50.083 --> 01:25:51.583
A lot of you left the answer blank.

1095
01:25:53.667 --> 01:25:55.375
So I'm asking all of you one more time.

1096
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.917
You all have to answer it.

1097
01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:00.542
Do you love volleyball?

1098
01:26:04.167 --> 01:26:04.792
Lu?

1099
01:26:08.833 --> 01:26:09.417
Coach

1100
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.083
I don't.

1101
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.875
I don't want to play volleyball anymore.

1102
01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:18.458
No one has ever asked me

1103
01:26:18.875 --> 01:26:20.625
if I really love volleyball.

1104
01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:21.917
You're the first.

1105
01:26:23.542 --> 01:26:24.500
I think

1106
01:26:24.792 --> 01:26:27.417
life is not just about being a volleyball champion.

1107
01:26:28.125 --> 01:26:29.375
I have to find my own way.

1108
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:38.958
Thank you. Coach.

1109
01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:43.250
I'm going to apply for colleges.

1110
01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:17.250
We've heard an athlete has quit the volleyball team.

1111
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.750
Ping firing a number of starters from the squad.

1112
01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:20.833
Everyone is shocked.

1113
01:27:21.042 --> 01:27:23.333
Some fans think Ping has lost her mind.

1114
01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:24.625
Facing questions from all sides.

1115
01:27:25.167 --> 01:27:28.583
I'm going to announce the squad for the Rio Olympics.

1116
01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:30.375
Hui Ruoqi.

1117
01:27:31.167 --> 01:27:32.000
Zhang Changning.

1118
01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:33.375
Liu Xiaotong.

1119
01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:34.667
Zhu Ting.

1120
01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:35.917
Xu Yunli.

1121
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:37.458
Yuan Xinyue.

1122
01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:38.792
Yan Ni.

1123
01:27:39.542 --> 01:27:40.250
Ding Xia.

1124
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.833
Wei Qiuyue.

1125
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:43.500
Lin Li.

1126
01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:45.042
Gong Xiangyu.

1127
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:46.875
That's all for today.

1128
01:27:55.583 --> 01:27:58.583
I've trained 10 hours per day for the last 6 months

1129
01:27:58.958 --> 01:28:02.000
Just to jump that little bit higher on court.

1130
01:28:02.542 --> 01:28:04.167
I'm in good form.

1131
01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:07.167
I don't understand why I'm not going.

1132
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.917
Because you've been playing too well.

1133
01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.333
Our opponents have sussed you out.

1134
01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:19.375
Chunlei

1135
01:28:21.542 --> 01:28:22.417
I'm sorry.

1136
01:28:30.542 --> 01:28:32.625
I'm an experienced player. I get it.

1137
01:28:33.042 --> 01:28:33.875
I accept your decision.

1138
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:38.375
But how many 4 years does an athlete have?

1139
01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:49.542
The first person in history to walk out on the team.

1140
01:28:50.083 --> 01:28:51.708
We understand how you feel.

1141
01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:56.375
But you can't just let go two of the starting players.

1142
01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:58.542
That's self-destruction.

1143
01:28:59.375 --> 01:29:01.458
It was a strategic decision.

1144
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.208
I could talk about it for hours if you'd like to listen.

1145
01:29:04.292 --> 01:29:05.125
No matter what

1146
01:29:05.208 --> 01:29:06.542
we give you our full support.

1147
01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:07.250
Including

1148
01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:08.583
a renown coach.

1149
01:29:09.042 --> 01:29:10.083
Back then

1150
01:29:10.417 --> 01:29:13.750
he withdrew from the head coach selection to support you.

1151
01:29:15.792 --> 01:29:17.250
I think Coach Lang...

1152
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:23.458
is the best fit for the role.

1153
01:29:26.167 --> 01:29:27.167
I withdraw.

1154
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:31.042
We think that with your current players

1155
01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:32.917
attending the International Volleyball League

1156
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.042
will harm the morale and image.

1157
01:29:36.125 --> 01:29:38.792
And have a negative effect on the team.

1158
01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:43.125
So we will recommend the national youth team to go instead.

1159
01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:45.458
It's okay if they lose.

1160
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.708
This way your team can have more time to adjust.

1161
01:29:49.542 --> 01:29:50.667
Yes. Coach?

1162
01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:52.375
Yawen

1163
01:29:52.875 --> 01:29:56.833
Transfer everyone in the youth team to the national team.

1164
01:29:57.417 --> 01:29:58.000
Copy that.

1165
01:29:58.375 --> 01:29:58.958
Well.

1166
01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:01.500
The youth team can't go anymore.

1167
01:30:01.792 --> 01:30:02.542
Lang Ping

1168
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.792
if this is how you want to do this

1169
01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:06.792
just be very clear

1170
01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:10.083
what the consequences could be!

1171
01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.333
Working out late?

1172
01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:28.333
Didn't you say

1173
01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:31.333
that volleyball is supposed to be a joy?

1174
01:30:31.958 --> 01:30:34.667
Do you feel joy making everyone go against you?

1175
01:30:38.917 --> 01:30:40.500
Why can a glass hold water?

1176
01:30:43.042 --> 01:30:44.375
Because it's empty.

1177
01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:49.042
If you are here to change my mind

1178
01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:52.167
you go tell the experts

1179
01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:55.375
I'm going to do this my way.

1180
01:30:56.792 --> 01:30:57.958
You're not alone.

1181
01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.375
Despite what the experts say

1182
01:30:59.458 --> 01:31:00.917
you have the Administration's support.

1183
01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:06.583
Why did you withdraw from the election?

1184
01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:10.250
So that I could win?

1185
01:31:11.542 --> 01:31:12.625
I don't need that.

1186
01:31:12.708 --> 01:31:14.250
You think I wanted to withdraw?

1187
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Yes. I'm old-fashioned

1188
01:31:18.583 --> 01:31:19.667
I don't speak English

1189
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.292
never lived abroad

1190
01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:22.625
and I don't have international horizon.

1191
01:31:24.167 --> 01:31:27.042
But I wanted to win more world championships as the head coach.

1192
01:31:28.667 --> 01:31:30.125
But no one believes it's possible.

1193
01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:32.542
They say that we will never be taller than the Russians

1194
01:31:32.625 --> 01:31:33.750
jump higher than the Brazilians

1195
01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:35.750
stronger than the Serbians and Italians.

1196
01:31:36.042 --> 01:31:37.250
Some even said to me

1197
01:31:37.417 --> 01:31:38.917
time has changed.

1198
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:42.000
Chinese people today don't need women's volleyball.

1199
01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.625
The 80s team at least had the fighting spirit.

1200
01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:48.792
The new team has nothing.

1201
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:50.292
Some even say

1202
01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:52.083
even if we were world champions again

1203
01:31:53.833 --> 01:31:57.458
will people still celebrate on the streets?

1204
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:58.833
Not any more.

1205
01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:02.000
Because you are Lang Ping

1206
01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:05.042
only you can bring hope for the moment.

1207
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.167
For the moment?

1208
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.417
If they think I'm here

1209
01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:18.917
only to give them hope for the moment

1210
01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.917
then they are wrong.

1211
01:32:22.417 --> 01:32:24.000
I don't put on acts

1212
01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:26.167
I am what I act.

1213
01:32:42.292 --> 01:32:44.042
Some would tell you

1214
01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:45.667
it's better to go back to Beijing.

1215
01:32:47.542 --> 01:32:51.542
Better than staying here and sneaking in to practice at night.

1216
01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:56.292
Can I win the world championship there?

1217
01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:00.792
Eagles have to land every so often

1218
01:33:01.167 --> 01:33:03.500
but chickens will never fly as high as the eagles.

1219
01:33:03.583 --> 01:33:04.583
Who do you call a chicken?

1220
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:54.500
Changning

1221
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:56.917
I need you to shake off all the sand in 5 seconds.

1222
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:57.583
Come on!

1223
01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:01.000
Qiuyue

1224
01:34:01.083 --> 01:34:02.250
you need a balloon?

1225
01:34:02.333 --> 01:34:03.500
Your hands are too soft.

1226
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:05.583
Ruoqi

1227
01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:07.417
you need to block not like a leaking hole.

1228
01:34:08.167 --> 01:34:09.292
Xia. less talking.

1229
01:34:09.583 --> 01:34:10.417
Stay focus.

1230
01:34:12.667 --> 01:34:13.292
Let's go again.

1231
01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:28.208
Why did you answer on the questionnaire

1232
01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:30.917
you're playing volleyball for your family?

1233
01:34:35.917 --> 01:34:37.792
My parents are farmers.

1234
01:34:39.417 --> 01:34:41.375
I have elder and younger sisters.

1235
01:34:41.958 --> 01:34:43.917
My parents were under a lot of pressure.

1236
01:34:44.833 --> 01:34:47.542
My dad also takes side jobs like fixing bikes.

1237
01:34:50.083 --> 01:34:53.917
Every time I saw him too exhausted to continue working

1238
01:34:55.833 --> 01:34:57.042
I wanted to

1239
01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:59.000
quit volleyball.

1240
01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:02.542
Then

1241
01:35:03.792 --> 01:35:05.250
get a job in Guangdong.

1242
01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.583
But

1243
01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:13.625
my father said

1244
01:35:14.958 --> 01:35:16.792
the quickest way

1245
01:35:17.417 --> 01:35:19.125
to success for us villagers is sports.

1246
01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.542
Sports is hard

1247
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:23.375
but the real difficulty is life.

1248
01:35:23.958 --> 01:35:25.542
Even if he needed to pawn our valuables

1249
01:35:25.625 --> 01:35:26.458
he'd support me.

1250
01:35:26.542 --> 01:35:27.417
You know

1251
01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:30.500
the first time I saw you

1252
01:35:31.333 --> 01:35:33.083
you reminded me of my younger self.

1253
01:35:37.917 --> 01:35:39.042
Come on.

1254
01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.083
Come on. Ting.

1255
01:35:43.917 --> 01:35:44.542
One more.

1256
01:35:45.125 --> 01:35:45.833
Come on. Ting.

1257
01:35:46.417 --> 01:35:47.042
Zhu Ting

1258
01:35:48.167 --> 01:35:49.167
Give me some noise.

1259
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.583
There's no power without your voice.

1260
01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:54.167
Again!

1261
01:35:59.958 --> 01:36:00.583
Where is it?

1262
01:36:03.292 --> 01:36:04.042
Your voice!

1263
01:36:08.333 --> 01:36:09.708
Stop and sit down.

1264
01:36:09.792 --> 01:36:10.667
Enough for today.

1265
01:36:16.083 --> 01:36:17.250
You play like this

1266
01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:21.958
can you look into your parents' eyes?

1267
01:36:22.583 --> 01:36:23.625
Go and find a regular job.

1268
01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:24.583
You don't need to be here.

1269
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:52.833
Zhu Ting

1270
01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:55.750
whether you're from the city or from a village

1271
01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.375
I treat all of you the same.

1272
01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:00.917
A village is where you're from

1273
01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:03.792
not a story you tell people.

1274
01:37:06.292 --> 01:37:07.708
If you can't play well

1275
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:09.958
try to find normal work

1276
01:37:10.167 --> 01:37:11.292
they'll think you're a freak.

1277
01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:12.542
Stop it!

1278
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.208
You've found your voice.

1279
01:37:17.042 --> 01:37:17.792
Come on.

1280
01:37:29.833 --> 01:37:30.708
Ting

1281
01:37:30.958 --> 01:37:31.792
tell me

1282
01:37:32.708 --> 01:37:33.750
why do you play volleyball?

1283
01:37:37.333 --> 01:37:37.917
Answer me.

1284
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.083
For my parents.

1285
01:37:40.083 --> 01:37:41.333
Then you'll never hit the top.

1286
01:37:41.833 --> 01:37:42.542
Give me something.

1287
01:37:43.333 --> 01:37:44.125
Why do you play?

1288
01:37:44.833 --> 01:37:45.875
For myself!

1289
01:37:48.333 --> 01:37:49.583
And what do you want?

1290
01:37:50.875 --> 01:37:52.000
To be like you!

1291
01:37:52.667 --> 01:37:53.625
You happy!

1292
01:38:03.708 --> 01:38:05.167
I think you've misunderstood me.

1293
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:07.500
You'll never be me.

1294
01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:10.417
When I said you were like me

1295
01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:15.000
I meant you were like when I was a backup

1296
01:38:15.083 --> 01:38:16.833
and played really bad.

1297
01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:18.708
Same as you are now.

1298
01:38:19.875 --> 01:38:21.792
You ladies don't know why you play volleyball?

1299
01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.875
Spend a night here.

1300
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.833
Think about it.

1301
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.792
Group camping?

1302
01:38:52.333 --> 01:38:53.042
What's wrong?

1303
01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:03.125
Coach Lang made the right decision to bring you here.

1304
01:39:03.458 --> 01:39:06.958
In the past. whenever I was in low-spirit. I came here.

1305
01:39:07.833 --> 01:39:11.042
I spiked hard against this old wall.

1306
01:39:13.833 --> 01:39:15.917
And my heart would be filled with hope again.

1307
01:39:17.083 --> 01:39:18.958
You don't believe it?

1308
01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:20.417
Have a go.

1309
01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:22.750
You're not sleeping anyway.

1310
01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:23.708
Try it.

1311
01:39:38.417 --> 01:39:39.250
Look.

1312
01:39:40.625 --> 01:39:43.375
All the dents on the wall

1313
01:39:43.583 --> 01:39:45.542
are left by those girls

1314
01:39:45.958 --> 01:39:48.208
hitting balls into the wall over and over again.

1315
01:39:48.958 --> 01:39:49.792
Look

1316
01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:52.375
This is Lang Ping's.

1317
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Back then. we had none of the resources you have.

1318
01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.042
But we had this in here.

1319
01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:06.708
Now you have everything.

1320
01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:08.417
But sometimes

1321
01:40:09.083 --> 01:40:10.333
you lose this.

1322
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.625
Come. all together.

1323
01:40:16.875 --> 01:40:18.417
You're not sleeping.

1324
01:40:23.042 --> 01:40:25.208
Coach Lang and I used to come here.

1325
01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:27.583
I was with her training

1326
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:29.250
day in. day out.

1327
01:40:30.583 --> 01:40:32.708
You know she's not in good physical condition.

1328
01:40:33.458 --> 01:40:36.042
Volleyball has broken every bone below her neck.

1329
01:40:37.292 --> 01:40:40.167
But why is she still here. fighting alongside you guys?

1330
01:40:44.042 --> 01:40:45.958
Because she has this inside.

1331
01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:48.458
What is this?

1332
01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:50.583
It's the team's fighting spirit.

1333
01:40:51.333 --> 01:40:52.792
It's our country.

1334
01:40:56.292 --> 01:40:57.250
Go on.

1335
01:40:59.958 --> 01:41:00.792
Harder!

1336
01:41:03.792 --> 01:41:05.375
Harder. give me some noise!

1337
01:41:08.375 --> 01:41:09.125
Where's your voice?

1338
01:41:09.583 --> 01:41:10.917
Girls! Voice!

1339
01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:13.708
Your voice!

1340
01:41:37.125 --> 01:41:37.875
Remember?

1341
01:41:38.583 --> 01:41:41.208
30 years ago. you and I had coffee here

1342
01:41:41.292 --> 01:41:42.833
and the team came back winners.

1343
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.458
Drink it up for good luck.

1344
01:41:48.833 --> 01:41:50.375
I know it's bitter. but you have to finish it.

1345
01:41:50.542 --> 01:41:52.750
I'll blame it on you if we lose.

1346
01:41:53.542 --> 01:41:54.292
Fine.

1347
01:41:57.333 --> 01:41:59.875
I know how Brazil feels. fighting on home turf.

1348
01:41:59.958 --> 01:42:02.958
It's more terrifying than the scale 12 typhoon in Fujian.

1349
01:42:06.583 --> 01:42:07.958
When I was still a player

1350
01:42:08.792 --> 01:42:10.417
we played with so much baggage.

1351
01:42:11.167 --> 01:42:13.000
We focused too much on winning

1352
01:42:13.292 --> 01:42:15.042
even second-place was not good enough.

1353
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:17.375
I won't be thinking like that anymore.

1354
01:42:18.333 --> 01:42:21.250
I will treat this one like any other match.

1355
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.500
Don't worry.

1356
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:27.042
Of course.

1357
01:42:29.417 --> 01:42:31.292
I won't worry about you.

1358
01:42:31.625 --> 01:42:33.625
If I didn't. I wouldn't have withdrawn from the election.

1359
01:42:39.625 --> 01:42:42.000
I truly believe that you

1360
01:42:42.542 --> 01:42:45.542
are the one who can bring something new to the team.

1361
01:42:48.167 --> 01:42:50.292
While I die quietly at home

1362
01:42:50.458 --> 01:42:53.542
you will die gallantly on a volleyball court.

1363
01:42:53.875 --> 01:42:55.458
Say something lucky! I'm about to take off.

1364
01:42:55.583 --> 01:42:57.042
Haha. yes.

1365
01:42:57.792 --> 01:42:58.333
Good luck.

1366
01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:13.375
I don't care if others need the women's volleyball team.

1367
01:43:17.875 --> 01:43:18.875
But I do.

1368
01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:23.375
Gotcha.

1369
01:43:47.917 --> 01:43:49.917
It's the 2016 Rio Olympics.

1370
01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:53.833
China women's volleyball has lost to the Netherlands. Serbia and the USA.

1371
01:43:53.917 --> 01:43:56.750
They came fourth and squeezed into the quarter-finals

1372
01:43:57.042 --> 01:44:00.042
where they'll meet the host and reigning Olympic champion Brazil.

1373
01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:03.042
The win-lost record of the two teams is 18:1 since 2008

1374
01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:06.000
with Brazil holding an absolute advantage.

1375
01:44:06.292 --> 01:44:10.250
Many think that Brazil is on another level to China.

1376
01:44:10.542 --> 01:44:14.083
The Chinese team. led by Lang Ping. is likely to go home after the match.

1377
01:44:28.667 --> 01:44:29.958
No training today.

1378
01:44:31.292 --> 01:44:32.167
Take a good rest.

1379
01:44:52.958 --> 01:44:54.292
Tomorrow is the elimination match

1380
01:44:54.667 --> 01:44:56.500
we go home if we lose.

1381
01:44:57.542 --> 01:45:00.667
I saw Coach Lai looking at flights just now.

1382
01:45:03.375 --> 01:45:07.000
We've been playing badly. Coach Lang shouldn't have taken us here.

1383
01:46:03.042 --> 01:46:04.875
We're got 2 options:

1384
01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:07.417
We leave everything behind and fight on court

1385
01:46:07.833 --> 01:46:10.417
or be a nervous wreck and lose before the fight.

1386
01:46:19.042 --> 01:46:20.333
I've figured it out.

1387
01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.500
Tomorrow

1388
01:46:22.708 --> 01:46:25.542
we'll win 3:1.

1389
01:46:33.083 --> 01:46:35.250
We only lost the last match

1390
01:46:35.333 --> 01:46:37.167
because there are only 5 sets.

1391
01:46:37.417 --> 01:46:39.792
If we play to 7. we will surely win.

1392
01:47:00.208 --> 01:47:01.083
Hello?

1393
01:47:01.167 --> 01:47:04.000
We are closing. Can you lock the door on your way out?

1394
01:47:05.333 --> 01:47:07.042
Alright. thank you.

1395
01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.500
I got nervous.

1396
01:47:25.292 --> 01:47:27.958
I thought I've had enough experience

1397
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.875
to call myself a sports professional.

1398
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:33.542
Turns out I'm not.

1399
01:47:36.292 --> 01:47:38.833
A foreign reporter once asked me

1400
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.083
why do Chinese

1401
01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:44.458
take winning a match so seriously?

1402
01:47:46.792 --> 01:47:47.750
I said

1403
01:47:48.125 --> 01:47:50.708
because we're not strong enough inside.

1404
01:47:52.292 --> 01:47:56.333
When we have true inner strength

1405
01:47:57.708 --> 01:47:59.417
winning will no longer be

1406
01:48:00.292 --> 01:48:02.250
a match's only value.

1407
01:48:04.167 --> 01:48:06.458
Our generation went through a lot of hardship.

1408
01:48:06.667 --> 01:48:08.125
Whatever we do

1409
01:48:08.792 --> 01:48:11.917
we carry a heavy burden with us.

1410
01:48:13.292 --> 01:48:14.792
My doctor told me

1411
01:48:15.583 --> 01:48:17.625
I have the heart of a sixty-year-old

1412
01:48:17.708 --> 01:48:18.917
and the body of an eighty-year-old.

1413
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.375
My sister asked me

1414
01:48:22.833 --> 01:48:24.000
if I could

1415
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.667
save half a life for the family.

1416
01:48:35.417 --> 01:48:36.375
The truth is

1417
01:48:39.208 --> 01:48:40.667
I can't let go.

1418
01:48:43.542 --> 01:48:45.458
I can't let go of you.

1419
01:48:45.792 --> 01:48:47.333
I can't let go of volleyball.

1420
01:48:50.167 --> 01:48:52.250
I feel I have the responsibility to help you

1421
01:48:53.042 --> 01:48:55.375
to enjoy the sports itself.

1422
01:48:56.083 --> 01:48:57.667
And enjoy volleyball.

1423
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:00.750
Ladies

1424
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:02.625
tomorrow is the big match.

1425
01:49:03.167 --> 01:49:06.750
The burden of the past should be carried by my generation.

1426
01:49:07.625 --> 01:49:10.042
Fight it your own way.

1427
01:49:10.125 --> 01:49:11.458
You should keep your heads up

1428
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.042
without worries

1429
01:49:13.125 --> 01:49:14.667
relax and give it all you've got.

1430
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.583
I'm always by your side.

1431
01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:23.792
Come on!

1432
01:51:07.625 --> 01:51:09.958
The first game today will be very difficult

1433
01:51:11.708 --> 01:51:12.792
but it's okay.

1434
01:51:13.292 --> 01:51:14.792
Look how fired up they are.

1435
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.875
They're only ready for 3 sets.

1436
01:51:21.167 --> 01:51:23.750
But I've prepared for this day.

1437
01:51:27.292 --> 01:51:28.042
Hang on

1438
01:51:28.125 --> 01:51:30.833
and if we make it to 5th set

1439
01:51:31.042 --> 01:51:32.417
we have a chance to win.

1440
01:51:32.542 --> 01:51:33.417
Come on!

1441
01:51:34.625 --> 01:51:35.958
One. two. fight!

1442
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.292
This is not ping-pong.

1443
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.208
Go home China.

1444
01:51:44.542 --> 01:51:46.750
It's the 2016 Rio Olympics women's volleyball match

1445
01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.917
between China and Brazil.

1446
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.458
Brazil is currently world No. 1 and playing at home.

1447
01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:55.375
You can imagine how loud the cheering is in the stadium.

1448
01:52:02.875 --> 01:52:04.958
In terms of win-lost record since 2008

1449
01:52:05.042 --> 01:52:08.042
Brazil has got an absolute upper hand.

1450
01:52:08.375 --> 01:52:12.292
Many predict this to be China's farewell match at Rio.

1451
01:52:22.458 --> 01:52:23.292
It's okay.

1452
01:52:23.375 --> 01:52:24.750
Concentrate on the receives.

1453
01:52:24.958 --> 01:52:27.708
I think as long as China plays up to par

1454
01:52:27.792 --> 01:52:29.083
the fans will accept and understand

1455
01:52:29.167 --> 01:52:31.000
whatever the result is.

1456
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:32.542
Brazil blocks to win the point.

1457
01:52:34.792 --> 01:52:35.875
More protection!

1458
01:52:48.708 --> 01:52:50.625
Brazil spikes a point from Area 2.

1459
01:52:51.125 --> 01:52:52.083
A world-beating team indeed.

1460
01:52:58.875 --> 01:53:00.083
Not a good start for China.

1461
01:53:00.208 --> 01:53:02.417
Brazil is definitely a stronger team

1462
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.542
with well-rounded players.

1463
01:53:03.625 --> 01:53:04.625
If we keep pressing in...

1464
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.458
Their serves are very powerful

1465
01:53:07.667 --> 01:53:09.792
leaving our first passes misplaced. we are too passive.

1466
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.625
With the world's 2 best blockers

1467
01:53:12.792 --> 01:53:14.750
Brazil has full control over the net.

1468
01:53:15.375 --> 01:53:17.167
They are peaking too early.

1469
01:53:17.542 --> 01:53:18.667
It might not be a good thing.

1470
01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:20.250
Don't let them control the pace.

1471
01:53:20.333 --> 01:53:22.083
Let's find our own.

1472
01:53:22.417 --> 01:53:23.542
Let's win the set!

1473
01:53:26.375 --> 01:53:27.375
One. two. come on!

1474
01:53:35.958 --> 01:53:39.167
It's a crucial set for both teams. especially for China.

1475
01:53:39.625 --> 01:53:41.250
Turn defense into attack. Ping!

1476
01:53:41.667 --> 01:53:42.917
Ask Yuan for the stats.

1477
01:53:49.417 --> 01:53:52.208
Coach. their No. 12 is leading the attack.

1478
01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:54.167
Her diagonal stats are really good.

1479
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:01.833
Yunli!

1480
01:54:02.167 --> 01:54:04.083
Track her. block her diagonals!

1481
01:54:05.375 --> 01:54:06.292
Serve to Area 6.

1482
01:54:09.125 --> 01:54:10.833
Coach Lang gives tactics to Changning.

1483
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.625
Maybe she's looking for weakness.

1484
01:54:22.583 --> 01:54:24.125
She's targeting Natalia at Area 6.

1485
01:54:24.208 --> 01:54:24.750
Brilliant!

1486
01:54:24.833 --> 01:54:25.417
Don't rush.

1487
01:54:25.875 --> 01:54:26.917
Brazil makes a mistake.

1488
01:54:28.583 --> 01:54:30.167
Changning serves to Area 6 again.

1489
01:54:30.583 --> 01:54:32.042
Brazil's first pass is disrupted.

1490
01:54:35.042 --> 01:54:36.292
China wins another point with a tip.

1491
01:54:36.375 --> 01:54:39.083
Lang Ping has finally found the weakness of her opponent.

1492
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.250
Change it up!

1493
01:54:52.375 --> 01:54:55.000
China opens the 2nd set with great game.

1494
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:56.875
Coach Lang changes their tactics timely.

1495
01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:59.458
China's serves deter Brazil's attack.

1496
01:55:00.333 --> 01:55:02.333
Comparing with its performance in the previous set.

1497
01:55:02.417 --> 01:55:04.042
China looks like a different team now.

1498
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.125
Great one! Ting jumps high.

1499
01:55:07.208 --> 01:55:08.458
Her powerful spike wins China another point!

1500
01:55:09.958 --> 01:55:11.750
The two teams are at the same starting line again.

1501
01:55:11.833 --> 01:55:14.000
Have Qiuyue. Ni and Changning to start.

1502
01:55:16.708 --> 01:55:17.500
Jumping too early!

1503
01:55:18.167 --> 01:55:19.792
Qiuyue. try quick sets.

1504
01:55:22.667 --> 01:55:24.708
Good one! A decisive spike from Yan Ni.

1505
01:55:24.958 --> 01:55:26.125
Play more tips.

1506
01:55:26.292 --> 01:55:28.167
China is playing without fear.

1507
01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.708
Ting. good one!

1508
01:55:31.458 --> 01:55:32.250
That's right.

1509
01:55:32.333 --> 01:55:34.083
The 3rd rotation. 3 attacks from the front.

1510
01:55:35.708 --> 01:55:37.000
Tell Xiaotong to warm up.

1511
01:55:42.042 --> 01:55:44.292
Their hitter is tired. carry on like this.

1512
01:55:44.375 --> 01:55:45.417
Ruoqi is tired.

1513
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:46.708
Coach Lang is making a substitution.

1514
01:55:49.958 --> 01:55:51.458
- Who is this? - The player coming on is

1515
01:55:51.542 --> 01:55:53.875
Xiaotong. who hasn't played much so far.

1516
01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:55.542
We don't have information about her.

1517
01:55:55.625 --> 01:55:56.958
Qiuyue. faster.

1518
01:55:58.083 --> 01:55:59.042
Xiaotong spikes.

1519
01:55:59.458 --> 01:56:02.125
Xiaotong is a relentless surprise.

1520
01:56:02.208 --> 01:56:04.208
She is destroying Brazil's approach.

1521
01:56:04.292 --> 01:56:06.500
Lang Ping works her magic again!

1522
01:56:11.167 --> 01:56:13.000
If I told you one hour ago

1523
01:56:13.083 --> 01:56:15.750
that China would be leading 2:1 now

1524
01:56:15.833 --> 01:56:17.208
no one would have believed me.

1525
01:56:20.250 --> 01:56:21.333
Good one!

1526
01:56:23.833 --> 01:56:24.750
Good!

1527
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:40.042
It's the last set.

1528
01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:42.167
They are under great pressure on home turf.

1529
01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:43.667
I want to fill your blood with gallons of water.

1530
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:44.917
Let go of your other thoughts.

1531
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.208
Be patient with attacks.

1532
01:56:48.542 --> 01:56:49.625
Block faster when they counter.

1533
01:56:49.708 --> 01:56:50.958
We're obviously the stronger team.

1534
01:56:51.042 --> 01:56:52.250
The Gods will give back what you used in the day.

1535
01:56:52.333 --> 01:56:53.875
Don't leave them any chance.

1536
01:56:53.958 --> 01:56:55.042
Give your all

1537
01:56:55.125 --> 01:56:56.167
leave no regrets!

1538
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:58.333
Let's beat their ass!

1539
01:56:59.250 --> 01:56:59.833
Got it?

1540
01:57:00.625 --> 01:57:02.000
One. two. fight!

1541
01:57:02.292 --> 01:57:04.125
Dear audiences. the match has come to the 5th set.

1542
01:57:04.208 --> 01:57:05.917
The court is at a fever pitch.

1543
01:57:06.292 --> 01:57:08.458
The crowd's roar is blowing the roof off.

1544
01:57:08.625 --> 01:57:11.333
I've never been this nervous as a commentator.

1545
01:57:11.625 --> 01:57:13.250
The final game is only 15 points

1546
01:57:13.542 --> 01:57:15.250
so anyone can win this.

1547
01:57:33.792 --> 01:57:36.500
Everyone should come out with their thoughts.

1548
01:57:37.042 --> 01:57:38.000
Leave no regrets

1549
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:39.625
okay?

1550
01:57:42.250 --> 01:57:43.458
Spike! Great one!

1551
01:57:44.875 --> 01:57:46.292
You guys still have a chance

1552
01:57:46.917 --> 01:57:48.458
but this will be my last Olympics.

1553
01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.375
Let me start with myself.

1554
01:57:51.542 --> 01:57:53.125
I haven't been playing well.

1555
01:57:56.208 --> 01:57:58.417
I'm anxious about being a starter tomorrow.

1556
01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.083
I don't want to let you down.

1557
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:04.167
I promise to fight as hard as I can.

1558
01:58:05.875 --> 01:58:07.250
Xia attacks from first pass. score!

1559
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.500
I've been jumping too early

1560
01:58:11.167 --> 01:58:12.292
and my spikes were weak.

1561
01:58:13.875 --> 01:58:14.875
Brazil attacks with a heavy spike.

1562
01:58:14.958 --> 01:58:15.792
It's saved.

1563
01:58:15.917 --> 01:58:17.333
Tomorrow I will avoid such mistakes.

1564
01:58:18.292 --> 01:58:19.792
You set it. and I'll spike it.

1565
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:22.417
A decisive spike from Changning. score!

1566
01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.083
In previous matches

1567
01:58:24.875 --> 01:58:26.208
my rhythm has been off.

1568
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.000
And my blocks are all over the place.

1569
01:58:29.458 --> 01:58:30.208
Yue

1570
01:58:30.458 --> 01:58:32.208
you are good with your emotions.

1571
01:58:33.292 --> 01:58:34.750
You should scream your head off.

1572
01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:37.292
Great set from Qiuyue.

1573
01:58:37.375 --> 01:58:38.333
Yue spikes!

1574
01:58:39.625 --> 01:58:41.333
Ting spikes again! China scores!

1575
01:58:41.417 --> 01:58:44.833
I was the last name in the squad

1576
01:58:45.375 --> 01:58:47.792
and I haven't been playing well.

1577
01:58:47.875 --> 01:58:49.625
Don't overthink it since you're already here.

1578
01:58:50.250 --> 01:58:52.083
Just go for it. I'll be behind you.

1579
01:58:52.625 --> 01:58:54.208
I had 2 heart surgeries.

1580
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:56.042
I don't know how my body will hold up.

1581
01:58:56.125 --> 01:58:57.292
The ball is back-and-forth.

1582
01:58:57.375 --> 01:58:58.833
But as long as I'm on court

1583
01:58:58.917 --> 01:59:00.125
I'll give it my all.

1584
01:59:01.125 --> 01:59:02.292
Ruoqi. it's alright

1585
01:59:03.875 --> 01:59:05.542
we four outside hitters are in this together.

1586
01:59:05.625 --> 01:59:06.792
China attacks from multiple positions.

1587
01:59:06.875 --> 01:59:08.750
They are having full control on court.

1588
01:59:11.375 --> 01:59:12.083
Yes

1589
01:59:12.167 --> 01:59:13.667
I'll even head the ball.

1590
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:15.250
Lin Li's defense is stout.

1591
01:59:15.375 --> 01:59:16.500
She digs the ball!

1592
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.833
China is on top of their game now!

1593
01:59:28.042 --> 01:59:30.125
Brazil tips the ball high over the net.

1594
01:59:30.667 --> 01:59:31.667
China gathers for an attack.

1595
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:32.833
Ting spikes from Area 4.

1596
01:59:33.083 --> 01:59:33.833
She hits it in!

1597
01:59:34.792 --> 01:59:36.667
The referee rules the ball is out of bounds.

1598
01:59:39.792 --> 01:59:40.875
Coach Lang requests a challenge.

1599
01:59:40.958 --> 01:59:42.125
Let's wait for the result.

1600
01:59:50.667 --> 01:59:51.667
In bounds.

1601
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:53.375
China's challenge is successful.

1602
01:59:57.833 --> 01:59:59.208
Their No. 2 is in the back row.

1603
01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:02.292
Receive is her weakness. target her.

1604
02:00:13.792 --> 02:00:15.500
They've been targeting Ting.

1605
02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:19.167
And is using this to break China's rhythm.

1606
02:00:32.375 --> 02:00:33.250
Ting

1607
02:00:34.625 --> 02:00:37.083
out of all the players I've trained

1608
02:00:37.625 --> 02:00:38.958
you're the best.

1609
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.583
I'm proud of you.

1610
02:00:42.667 --> 02:00:44.042
You don't need to be me.

1611
02:00:45.125 --> 02:00:47.333
You just have to be yourself.

1612
02:00:56.083 --> 02:00:57.083
Brazil serves.

1613
02:00:57.625 --> 02:00:59.000
Xiaotong manages to receive it.

1614
02:01:00.250 --> 02:01:02.000
Ting spikes over a block!

1615
02:01:02.083 --> 02:01:03.167
She's unstoppable!

1616
02:01:07.833 --> 02:01:09.167
Brazil's receive flies off

1617
02:01:09.375 --> 02:01:10.750
a chance to counter.

1618
02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:17.875
Ting spikes a point!

1619
02:01:18.875 --> 02:01:20.167
Coach Lang is making a substitution.

1620
02:01:20.250 --> 02:01:22.458
Ruoqi. with the big games experience.

1621
02:01:22.542 --> 02:01:23.833
Allowing Ting to rest.

1622
02:01:24.417 --> 02:01:26.083
Ruoqi helps stabilise the team.

1623
02:01:27.875 --> 02:01:30.750
Brazil keeps the game tight. 12:13.

1624
02:01:32.917 --> 02:01:33.542
Serves into the net.

1625
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:35.083
Match point for China.

1626
02:01:35.167 --> 02:01:38.708
China is on the verge of eliminating the world No. 1. Brazil.

1627
02:01:40.417 --> 02:01:42.917
The Brazil team hopes use their roaring crowd

1628
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.750
to overwhelm the China team.

1629
02:01:45.625 --> 02:01:46.500
A heavy spike from Area 3.

1630
02:01:46.708 --> 02:01:48.167
Brazil gets a point.

1631
02:01:48.875 --> 02:01:49.958
14:13.

1632
02:01:51.917 --> 02:01:53.417
Coach Lang asks for a timeout.

1633
02:02:02.125 --> 02:02:03.167
How are you going to play?

1634
02:02:03.250 --> 02:02:04.833
Ting's in back row. it'd more demanding.

1635
02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:06.625
I'll set it for Yunli. to be safe.

1636
02:02:07.375 --> 02:02:08.875
Be bold. This is the moment.

1637
02:02:08.958 --> 02:02:09.625
Don't play it safe.

1638
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:11.125
Get ready.

1639
02:02:11.208 --> 02:02:12.083
And show them what you've got!

1640
02:02:14.292 --> 02:02:15.625
Audiences in front of the TV

1641
02:02:15.708 --> 02:02:17.583
this is the deciding point of the match.

1642
02:02:17.917 --> 02:02:19.833
Yunli and Qiuyue are old teammates

1643
02:02:19.917 --> 02:02:21.250
they should be a veteran duo.

1644
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.375
Ting is exceptional today

1645
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:25.500
but she's in the back row.

1646
02:02:25.625 --> 02:02:28.750
Passing the ball to her is risky.

1647
02:02:40.625 --> 02:02:42.042
Brazil serves.

1648
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.208
Changning receives well.

1649
02:02:52.292 --> 02:02:53.500
Yunli is off running.

1650
02:02:53.625 --> 02:02:55.333
Qiuyue and Yunli's back set attack

1651
02:02:55.458 --> 02:02:57.208
has worked many times before.

1652
02:02:57.458 --> 02:03:00.458
In front of Yunli is the best middle blocker.

1653
02:03:01.917 --> 02:03:04.583
To everyone's surprise. Qiuyue sets the ball to Area 3.

1654
02:03:07.042 --> 02:03:08.167
Back row attack from Ting.

1655
02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:29.417
Hello?
