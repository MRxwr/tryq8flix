1
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.452
<i>I got my nickname from this song.</i>

2
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:13.908
When I was in the Army they used to
mispronounce Segerman as Sugar Man.

3
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:17.211
And then they just started calling me
Sugar and that became my nickname.

4
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:23.797
<i>It's 40 years since this LP called
Cold Fact by Rodriguez was released.</i>

5
00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:27.467
<i>And in South Africa
it was a very popular album.</i>

6
00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:30.345
<i>It was one of the biggest albums
of the day.</i>

7
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.519
<i>But the thing was.
we didn't know who this guy was.</i>

8
00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.689
<i>All our other rock stars.
we had all the information we needed.</i>

9
00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.186
<i>But this guy? There was nothing.</i>

10
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.611
<i>And then we found out
that he had committed suicide.</i>

11
00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:47.533
<i>He set himself alight on stage and
burnt to death in front of the audience.</i>

12
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.362
<i>It was the most incredible thing.
It wasn't just a suicide.</i>

13
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:55.245
<i>It was probably the most
grotesque suicide in rock history.</i>

14
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:12.253
The first time that I remember
actually recognizing him is

15
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.838
Mike Theodore called me
on the phone one day and said.

16
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.800
"I have this artist
I want you to come see with me.

17
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:19.681
"This guy's name is Rodriguez.

18
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.728
"he's working down by the Detroit River.

19
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.646
"There's a bar down there.

20
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.271
"down by the wharf riverside district.

21
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.726
"Let's go see him tonight.

22
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.061
"I think you'll really like him."

23
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:33.445
<i>So that night. I remember.
we pull up...</i>

24
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.694
<i>away in this kinda isolated
part of Detroit</i>

25
00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.825
<i>right on the side of the Detroit River.</i>

26
00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:42.750
<i>and you could see the mist in the air
coming off the river. We could feel it.</i>

27
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:46.545
And we went inside there.
and as we walked in the door.

28
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.339
we could hear behind us
the sound of the freighters

29
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.132
as they're going down the river.

30
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:54.553
and so it's like you're walking out
of a Sherlock Holmes novel.

31
00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:58.007
You walk out of the mist
and you go into this place.

32
00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.558
and inside the place.
it's all full of smoke.

33
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.261
so there's a mist inside there.

34
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.897
<i>Boom. hey. you know.
it's a wall of smoke.</i>

35
00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.569
<i>Beer all over the place. Peanut shells.
It was just a mess.</i>

36
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:14.649
And then you hear this strumming sound.

37
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:16.700
Strumming and batting the guitar.

38
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:24.242
And then you hear this voice.
Strange voice.

39
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.702
<i>Finally. we walked
through the smoke. and I looked.</i>

40
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.254
<i>and there in the far corner I saw...</i>

41
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.674
I could see the shadow of a man
and I couldn't see his face.

42
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.719
I said. "What's the deal?"
So we got a little closer...

43
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.680
<i>And you see this guy
with his back to you.</i>

44
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:46.722
<i>So all you see is his back
and he's in a corner. singing.</i>

45
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.942
<i>It was an ethereal scene. if you will.</i>

46
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:56.444
Foggy night. foghorns. smoke so thick
you couldn't see through it.

47
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.067
<i>And here's this voice.</i>

48
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.611
<i>Maybe it forced you
to listen to the lyrics</i>

49
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.697
<i>'cause you couldn't see the guy's face.</i>

50
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.080
<i>That's when we talked to him and figured
we needed to do an album on him.</i>

51
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:11.459
The only writer that I had heard of.
of that time period.

52
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:15.042
was maybe Bob Dylan.
that was writing that well.

53
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:38.383
<i>He was this wandering spirit
around the city.</i>

54
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.088
<i>And. uh. sometimes
I might catch him in the corner.</i>

55
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.640
You know. Detroit's got its share of.
uh. burned-out. desolate areas

56
00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.931
and I would occasionally see him. um.

57
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.976
far away from The Brewery.
and I wondered.

58
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:55.309
and it just added
to this mythology of him.

59
00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:59.113
Like. what is he doing?
What is he doing? What does he do?

60
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.784
I heard he did a little roofing.
some construction work.

61
00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.953
Um. I think that's how he got his money
at the time.

62
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.656
He just was. you know.
and I say this with love.

63
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.125
I say this with respect. but.

64
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.202
I thought he was just a...

65
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:19.090
just not much more than a kind of
a homeless person. you know?

66
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.214
He just was a drifter.
He was just... Um...

67
00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.118
<i>I didn't know if he had a home.
you know?</i>

68
00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:29.964
<i>He'd look like maybe he'd go
from shelter to shelter or something.</i>

69
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.105
<i>Detroit in the '70s was a hard place.</i>

70
00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.777
<i>Well. it's still a hard place.</i>

71
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:44.984
<i>Lot of decay. lots of ruined houses.
Real poverty exists in this city.</i>

72
00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.445
<i>And those streets
were Rodriguez's natural habitat.</i>

73
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.657
Any time we met him
to talk about what we were doing.

74
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.661
he would always meet us on a corner
somewhere in his neighbourhood.

75
00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.254
Most of the time
he wasn't coming to my house.

76
00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.378
He'd say. "Meet me on the corner
of this street and that street."

77
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.960
and we would be there.

78
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.172
Uh. Mike and I would get out of our cars
and park our cars.

79
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.631
so we'd be standing on the corner.

80
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.387
and then we'd look round
and he'd be there all of a sudden.

81
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.934
He'd just show up.

82
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.853
<i>We thought he was like
the inner city poet.</i>

83
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:17.523
<i>You know? Putting his poems to music
of what he saw.</i>

84
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.815
<i>And it was definitely a very gritty look</i>

85
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.067
<i>at what he saw
on the streets of Detroit.</i>

86
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.650
<i>What he saw in his neighbourhood.
Who was walking around the streets.</i>

87
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:31.822
<i>And the way he presented it in a song.
I thought was very. very interesting.</i>

88
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.967
<i>We were working
at Tera-Shirma recording studio.</i>

89
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:40.085
<i>When he opened up and sang.
you went. "Whoa. this guy's got it."</i>

90
00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:46.011
<i>Rodriguez. at that time.
had all the machinery in place.</i>

91
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.925
<i>Big names. big money behind it.
Circumstances were right.</i>

92
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:55.683
<i>Why didn't it make it? That's the
big question that today still haunts me.</i>

93
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:59.437
Did he get enough promotion?
Did he do enough performances?

94
00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.018
Was he too political?

95
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.596
Was there this or was there that?

96
00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:07.941
Should it have been green
instead of orange?

97
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.119
Should it have been a violin
instead of an oboe?

98
00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.992
On and on you can go.

99
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.626
But the end of the day is. if you
listen to the stuff now. you'd say.

100
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.670
"I don't understand it. he's right-on."

101
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.958
<i>I only heard him play once.</i>

102
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:29.512
<i>and one of the songs that
he had on his album. it was called...</i>

103
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.384
<i>The Sugar Man? Was it Sugar Man?
Is that the name of the song?</i>

104
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.288
Um. I knew that guy. the Sugar Man.

105
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.732
And his name was Volkswagen Cha...
Volkswagen Frank!

106
00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.229
And he lived right around the corner

107
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.478
and you used to go over
to Volkswagen Frank's.

108
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:47.735
<i>You'd go in and get a little "sugar."
if you know what I mean.</i>

109
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.786
I got some photos here
that I'd like to show you

110
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:44.626
that I've kept since my days in England
with Rodriguez.

111
00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.219
Let me see.

112
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.793
Possibly it's in this book.
I don't know where.

113
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:54.218
These are all my photos
from when I was acting.

114
00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:58.373
That's me. and that's Jimmy Dean.
That was in 1955.

115
00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:02.814
Hang on. I think I've found them.
Think they're in here.

116
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.309
Yeah. here they are.

117
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.279
Wow. Good Lord. here they are.

118
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:15.319
You know. I haven't seen these pictures
in almost 35 years.

119
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.498
He's my most memorable artist.

120
00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.168
You know. I've produced
a lot of great ones. but...

121
00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.665
he's my most memorable.

122
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.167
<i>It's not just a talent.</i>

123
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.924
<i>He's like...</i>

124
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.369
<i>He's like a wise man. a prophet.</i>

125
00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:41.186
<i>He's way beyond
just being a musical artist.</i>

126
00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:44.347
<i>And he probably could have done
fantastically well</i>

127
00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:45.849
<i>if he had have continued.</i>

128
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.937
When I met him. they said.
"Rodriguez. this is Steve Rowland.

129
00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.863
"He really likes your album."
And Rodriguez said to me.

130
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.893
<i>"Well. did you like Cold Facts?"</i>

131
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.766
I said. "Man. I thought
it was absolutely brilliant.

132
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.363
"Absolutely brilliant.

133
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:04.201
"I can't believe that this album
didn't do anything.

134
00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.874
"It's just a fantastic album."

135
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.438
So he played me...

136
00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:12.714
Well. his next album was on...
In those days you had cassettes.

137
00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:17.305
He had demos of this next album that
he was gonna call Coming From Reality.

138
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.557
And I said. "Wow. man.
this has got to be a smash.

139
00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.224
"These are great songs.

140
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:29.897
"Little bit... Little bit different from
the others." I said. "but great songs."

141
00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.237
I said. "And a couple of them
were so sad." You know.

142
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.567
There's one in there
that's absolutely a killer.

143
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.639
It's one of the saddest songs that...

144
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:43.832
I'm laughing. but it's one of
the saddest songs that I've ever heard.

145
00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:47.151
And it's a very simple song.
Hang on. I wanna play this. Hang on.

146
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.541
Okay. listen to these words.

147
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.727
Oh. man.

148
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.506
<i>And it really makes me sad. because...</i>

149
00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.404
<i>that was the last song that we recorded.</i>

150
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:04.533
<i>And that was the last song
that Rodriguez ever recorded.</i>

151
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:10.209
And what makes it even sadder

152
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.671
was the album was released
in November of 1971.

153
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:18.961
and we expected big things.
And it did absolutely nothing.

154
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.341
And then. two weeks before Christmas.

155
00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.311
Sussex dropped him off the label.

156
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:33.421
And the very first line in the song.
as if premonition.

157
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:37.396
was. "I lost my job
two weeks before Christmas."

158
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.491
Oh. man. I just think about that.

159
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:47.656
This guy deserves recognition.

160
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.035
Nobody in America had even heard of him.

161
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.879
Nobody...

162
00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.343
Nobody even was interested
in listening to him.

163
00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:07.384
How can that be? How can that be?
Guy that writes like this.

164
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.220
I mean...

165
00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.809
<i>It's still a bit of a mystery
how the first copy of Cold Fact</i>

166
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.356
<i>actually came to South Africa.</i>

167
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:42.924
<i>But one of the stories I've heard</i>

168
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.389
<i>is that there was an American girl
and she came to South Africa</i>

169
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:49.156
<i>to visit her boyfriend and brought
a copy of the record with her.</i>

170
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.867
<i>And her and him and all their friends
really liked it</i>

171
00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.537
<i>and went out to try and buy it
but you couldn't buy it.</i>

172
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.561
<i>So they started taping copies
and passing copies along.</i>

173
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.504
However it got here.
however it germinated here.

174
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:04.000
once it got here.
it spread very quickly.

175
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:25.063
I remember I was in high school

176
00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:30.302
and we heard this song. "I wonder
how many times you've had sex?"

177
00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.975
And at that time South Africa
was very conservative.

178
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.414
It was the height of apartheid.

179
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.310
and there wasn't television here.

180
00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:41.813
That's how conservative it was.
'cause television was communist.

181
00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.665
It was really... You wouldn't believe.

182
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.718
Everything was restricted.
everything was censored.

183
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.157
Everything was...

184
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:51.426
And here's this guy singing this song.

185
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.166
<i>"Who's that?" Said. "That's Rodriguez."</i>

186
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:58.559
<i>And he became something
of a rebel son' of icon.</i>

187
00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.774
<i>But the strange thing was
that we all bought his records.</i>

188
00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.728
<i>Everybody I knew had his records.
I Wonder.</i>

189
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:06.967
that was the big song
that everybody was singing

190
00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.510
and we all bought a record.

191
00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:12.281
And there he was on the cover.
sort of a hippy with shades.

192
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:15.475
But nobody knew anything about him.
He was a mystery.

193
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:19.451
Unlike other artists
that you could read about from America.

194
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:24.026
get to know something about them.
there was zilch. Nobody knew anything.

195
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.422
It was a mystery. We only had
his picture on the cover of the record.

196
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.188
<i>The album was exceptionally popular.</i>

197
00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:00.900
<i>To many of us South Africans.
he was the soundtrack to our lives.</i>

198
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:03.690
<i>In the mid-'70s.
if you walked into a random</i>

199
00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.688
<i>white. liberal.
middle-class household</i>

200
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.337
<i>that had a turntable
and a pile of pop records</i>

201
00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:11.031
<i>and if you flipped through the records
you would always see</i>

202
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.800
<i>Abbey Road by The Beatles.</i>

203
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.868
<i>You would always see
Bridge Over Troubled Water</i>

204
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.511
by Simon and Garfunkel.

205
00:20:16.607 --> 00:20:19.135
<i>And you would always see
Cold Fact by Rodriguez.</i>

206
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.309
To us. it was one of the most
famous records of all time.

207
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.712
<i>The message it had was:
"Be anti-establishment. "</i>

208
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.152
<i>One song's called
Anti-Establishment Blues.</i>

209
00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.887
We didn't know what the word
"anti-establishment" was

210
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:33.053
until it cropped up on a Rodriguez song
and then we found out.

211
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.153
it's OK to protest against your society.

212
00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.076
to be angry with your society.

213
00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.325
Because we lived in a society

214
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.916
where every means was used
to prevent apartheid from.

215
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.006
you know. coming to an end.

216
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:53.506
this album somehow had in it...

217
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:59.293
lyrics that almost set us free
as oppressed peoples.

218
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.288
Any revolution needs an anthem

219
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:06.231
<i>and in South Africa
Cold Fact was the album</i>

220
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.771
that gave people permission

221
00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:13.948
to free their minds
and to start thinking differently.

222
00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:32.383
<i>It may seem strange
that South African record companies</i>

223
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.864
<i>didn't do more
to try and track down Rodriguez.</i>

224
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.862
<i>but. actually.
if you look back at the time</i>

225
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.866
<i>we were in the middle of apartheid.
the height of apartheid.</i>

226
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.139
<i>South Africa was under sanctions
from countries from all over the world.</i>

227
00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.722
<i>South African musicians
were not allowed to play overseas.</i>

228
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.834
<i>No foreign acts
were allowed to visit South Africa.</i>

229
00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.981
<i>It was a closed-door situation</i>

230
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.154
<i>between South Africa
and the rest of the world.</i>

231
00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.193
<i>The countries around
the world were saying horrible things</i>

232
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:13.757
<i>about the apartheid government</i>

233
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.928
<i>but we didn't know
because they controlled the news.</i>

234
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:20.202
<i>The majority of the population
had been marginalized</i>

235
00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:23.801
<i>and forced out of the commerce in areas.</i>

236
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:25.678
<i>It was what had happened
in Nazi Germany.</i>

237
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:27.638
<i>It was a spin-off from Nazi Germany.</i>

238
00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:30.687
<i>but if a newspaper published it.
they'd get prosecuted.</i>

239
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:34.716
<i>So. because of that. South Africa had
achieved a pariah status in the world.</i>

240
00:22:34.812 --> 00:22:37.556
<i>There were cultural boycotts.
There were sporting boycotts.</i>

241
00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:41.118
<i>It was a very isolated society.
So we were cut off.</i>

242
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.786
We all knew apartheid was wrong.

243
00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:44.034
but living in South Africa.

244
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.456
<i>there wasn't much. as a white person.</i>

245
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:46.731
you could do about it.

246
00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:48.622
'cause the government was very strict.

247
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.795
It was a military state.
to a large degree.

248
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.372
If you spoke out against apartheid.

249
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.402
you could be thrown into prison
for three years.

250
00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:57.743
<i>So although a lot of whites
were part of the struggle.</i>

251
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.508
<i>the majority of whites were not.</i>

252
00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:03.974
<i>You were watched. There were spies.
It was scary and people were scared.</i>

253
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.893
But out of the Afrikaans
community emerged

254
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:09.973
a group of Afrikaans
musicians. songwriters.

255
00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:14.310
and for them. when they heard Rodriguez.
it was like a voice spoke to them

256
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:18.264
and said. "Guys. there's a way out.
There's a way out.

257
00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:21.484
"You can write music.
You can write imagery.

258
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.152
"You can sing. you can perform."

259
00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:26.990
And that was where. really.
the first opposition to apartheid

260
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:29.666
came from inside
the Afrikaans community.

261
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:33.112
It was these young Afrikaans guys
and. to a man.

262
00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.752
they'll tell you
they were influenced by Rodriguez.

263
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:38.004
<i>Koos Kombuis. Willem Moller.</i>

264
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.881
<i>The late Johannes Kerkorrel.</i>

265
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:45.509
The guys who were regarded as the icons
of the Afrikaans music revolution

266
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:48.052
will all tell you.
"Rodriguez was our guy."

267
00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:53.724
<i>We call it the Voelvry movement</i>

268
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:56.352
<i>of Afrikaans artists
singing against apartheid.</i>

269
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:59.234
All of us listened to Rodriguez
at some point. All of us.

270
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:01.357
<i>It had an enormous impact.</i>

271
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.943
<i>It made you just think
that there's another way.</i>

272
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.240
What's presented to you
by the establishment isn't all theirs.

273
00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:19.421
<i>The biggest hit was a song
called Set It Off</i>

274
00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.795
<i>which was when PW Botha
was the president then.</i>

275
00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:26.724
The real bad guy. When he came on TV.
he used to talk like that.

276
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.974
<i>And this song said. "switch it off.
just switch off the TV."</i>

277
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.147
<i>So what lines do you think</i>

278
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.823
were the lines they had problem with?

279
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:44.400
Ah. gee whiz. it's all of them.

280
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.619
"Sugar Man. won't you hurry
Cos I'm tired of these scenes

281
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:52.016
"For a blue coin. won't you bring back
all those colours to my dreams?"

282
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:53.993
The most difficult ones is probably

283
00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:58.456
"Silver magic ships. you carry
Jumpers. coke. sweet Mary Jane."

284
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.173
And what is that?

285
00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:03.840
I'm gonna leave that to you.

286
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.844
- But it's drugs?
- It's certainly drugs.

287
00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:11.848
During the apartheid years.
it was just impossible to play it.

288
00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:13.850
And what happened if you did play it?

289
00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:17.103
Well. you couldn't.
I'd like to show you why.

290
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:24.858
Right. here we have the album.
the vinyl.

291
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.390
At the back of the sleeve
you'll see a sticker that says "Avoid."

292
00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:32.285
But when you open the album
and take it out from its sleeve.

293
00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:36.502
you would see that they have
scratched that particular song

294
00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:40.293
with a sharp tool to make sure
that it would not go out on air.

295
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:45.337
<i>And that's the way that they
banned the music which. in my mind.</i>

296
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:50.137
<i>was quite a brutal way of ensuring the
song would never be heard on the air.</i>

297
00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:54.136
<i>Most of those tracks
were on the banned list at SABC</i>

298
00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:57.564
<i>and they ran
the broadcast industry completely.</i>

299
00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:00.392
<i>There weren't any independent
radio stations or TV stations.</i>

300
00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:06.199
Obviously. when that word got out.
it just made the record more desirable.

301
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:08.926
You know.
it's like having something banned.

302
00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:12.576
You're 16. 17 years old
and you've got something that's banned.

303
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.577
It was absolutely perfect.

304
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:06.842
<i>Cold Fact was just one
of the albums we had in our collections.</i>

305
00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:11.218
<i>and for 10. 20 years. it was just
a record we listened to and enjoyed.</i>

306
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.430
<i>But then a pivotal event happened
that changed everything for me.</i>

307
00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:16.977
<i>We were down in Camps Bay beach.</i>

308
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:20.181
We were sitting around on the beach
and a friend of mine.

309
00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:22.562
a woman. who was from South Africa.

310
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:26.862
but she had got married
and emigrated to Los Angeles.

311
00:27:26.937 --> 00:27:31.317
<i>she said to me. "Where can I
buy Cold Fact in South Africa?"</i>

312
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.246
And I turned round and I pointed
to a store across the road

313
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.574
that sold CDs and I said.
"You can buy it at that store."

314
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:42.252
She said. "Really? Because. you know.
you can't buy it anywhere in America.

315
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:44.546
"I've asked everywhere in America.
no one's even heard of it."

316
00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:47.124
<i>And that was a pivotal moment.
'cause I didn't know that.</i>

317
00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:48.584
<i>I thought everybody knew Rodriguez.</i>

318
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:51.216
<i>especially in America
'cause he was American.</i>

319
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:54.424
<i>So my next thought was.
"Ah. Rodriguez. that's interesting. "</i>

320
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.929
<i>I went back... I came back home
and I took out my Rodriguez records</i>

321
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.432
<i>and that's when I realised
there was nothing on the record</i>

322
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.684
<i>to tell us who he was
or where he was from.</i>

323
00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.932
<i>On Cold Fact there are four names.</i>

324
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:06.895
<i>On the front cover
it just says "Rodriguez."</i>

325
00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:09.776
But if we take the record out
and examine the sleeve.

326
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:12.696
the artist's name is Sixto Rodriguez.

327
00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:14.276
<i>But if you look at the tracks.</i>

328
00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.986
<i>six of these tracks</i>

329
00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:18.447
<i>are credited to Jesus Rodriguez.</i>

330
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.907
<i>and four of these tracks</i>

331
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.618
<i>are credited to Sixth Prince.</i>

332
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.374
<i>So who actually wrote these songs</i>

333
00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:25.705
<i>and who are all these people?</i>

334
00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.961
<i>We didn't have any more information
than a record</i>

335
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:32.591
<i>with him sitting on the cover
with a hat and sunglasses on.</i>

336
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:35.673
<i>We didn't know how tall he was
'cause he was sitting cross-legged.</i>

337
00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:37.224
<i>So how do you solve a mystery?</i>

338
00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:39.301
<i>You use whatever
information's available.</i>

339
00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:42.684
<i>What did we have?
A record cover with lyrics.</i>

340
00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:44.436
So we started looking
quite deeply at the lyrics

341
00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:45.982
and seeing what they said.

342
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.686
and some of them. very few of them.
had geographical references.

343
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:51.397
<i>The one You Can't getaway starts off.</i>

344
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.107
"Born in the troubled city

345
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.989
"In Rock and Roll. USA."

346
00:28:56.068 --> 00:28:57.490
Born in which troubled city?

347
00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.663
Seems all the cities were troubled
in the late '60s.

348
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:02.036
"In the shadow of the tallest building."

349
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:04.288
The tallest building. as far as we knew.
was in New York.

350
00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:06.712
And at the bottom of the song
this verse says.

351
00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:08.414
"In a hotel room in Amsterdam."

352
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:14.337
Then it says. "Going down a dusty
Georgian side road I wander." Georgia?

353
00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.342
So we've had Amsterdam.
we've had Georgia.

354
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.889
we've had the world's tallest building.

355
00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:20.266
Not much to go on.

356
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:29.384
<i>Well. what I heard.</i>

357
00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:30.898
<i>and the story differs a lot.</i>

358
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:34.614
<i>and a lot of people have different
versions of the story. but what I heard.</i>

359
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.343
<i>he hadn't played a concert
in a very long time.</i>

360
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:41.367
And a promoter got him
to play a concert.

361
00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:44.120
and he was hoping
it was gonna be a great show.

362
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:47.328
Of course. the show didn't
work out that way. It started out...

363
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:51.361
The sound wasn't good.
The venue wasn't good.

364
00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.130
A lot of the factors
surrounding the show wasn't good.

365
00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:56.086
And as the show went on and on.

366
00:29:56.169 --> 00:30:00.766
it started going downhill from there.
People started ridiculing him.

367
00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:06.143
People started whistling
or making mention of the fact that.

368
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.599
you know.
the show wasn't going as planned.

369
00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:12.277
And it got to a point where.
just very quietly. very gently.

370
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:13.820
he just sang his last song.

371
00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:16.569
"But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine

372
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:18.616
"And after that's said forget it."

373
00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:23.038
And he reached down and pulled up a gun
and pulled the trigger.

374
00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:26.787
And that was the dramatic.
very dramatic ending.

375
00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:29.461
to what was actually a non-career.

376
00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:04.660
In 1996. the South African record label

377
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:08.959
released Rodriguez's second album.
Coming From Reality.

378
00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:11.875
on CD for the first time
in South Africa.

379
00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:14.402
And because they thought
I knew a lot about him.

380
00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:17.217
they asked if I wanted to co-write
the liner notes for the booklet.

381
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.669
which I did.

382
00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:23.132
And I'll read some of it to you.
They start off by saying.

383
00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:26.640
"if ever there is an air of intrigue
and mystery around a pop artist.

384
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:29.437
"it is around the artist
known as Rodriguez.

385
00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:32.642
"There's no air of intrigue and mystery
around him anywhere else in the world

386
00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:35.853
<i>"because his two albums.
Coming From Reality and Cold Fact.</i>

387
00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:38.735
"were monumental flops everywhere else."

388
00:31:38.814 --> 00:31:40.282
And this is the important part.

389
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:44.953
"There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

390
00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:47.451
"Any musicologist detectives out there?"

391
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:50.747
And that.
that's the line that changed everything.

392
00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:53.666
<i>I started searching for Rodriguez</i>

393
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.964
<i>when a few of us
were sitting around in the Army</i>

394
00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:58.417
<i>and somebody said.
"How did Rodriguez die?"</i>

395
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.877
And just coincidence.

396
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.383
at the time I was looking
for subject matter to write an article.

397
00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:05.341
<i>I remember having. like. five points
on a piece of paper.</i>

398
00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:08.769
<i>And number four. or something.
was "Find out how Rodriguez died."</i>

399
00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:11.497
<i>I thought it would make a good story.</i>

400
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.690
So that was in the back of my mind
for many years

401
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:17.520
and then. many years later.
I came across this. um.

402
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:23.409
<i>re-release of Coming From Reality
and inside. the liner notes said.</i>

403
00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:26.862
"There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

404
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:31.576
"Any musicologist detectives out there?"
Um. was the question.

405
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:33.786
and I think that to me.
was like an invitation.

406
00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:35.963
I thought. "Well. maybe it's me".

407
00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:42.761
<i>The first way I tried to find him
was to just follow the money.</i>

408
00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:44.088
Normally. you follow the money.

409
00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:45.589
That's how you get
to the bottom of anything.

410
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:48.600
<i>But where do dead men's money go?</i>

411
00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:51.053
<i>I was astounded that
no one knew anything about him.</i>

412
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:55.479
<i>I guess it was reminiscent
of how bad the music industry was.</i>

413
00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:57.400
<i>They were renowned
for ripping people off.</i>

414
00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:01.401
And it is one thing.
if they had said to me. "Oh. yeah.

415
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.826
"we send the money
to X place or Y." or whatever.

416
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:08.199
but they just kept on being very vague.

417
00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:12.033
<i>And. in fact. when l put some pressure
on somebody. I did get an address.</i>

418
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:13.617
<i>and I called</i>

419
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.570
<i>and. I can't remember
if I spoke to someone or left a message.</i>

420
00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.565
<i>but when I called the next day.
the number had been changed.</i>

421
00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:20.836
<i>And that to me was...</i>

422
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:24.341
I mean. that's a gift
for anyone who wants to be a detective.

423
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.891
is an obstacle.
because an obstacle is an inspiration.

424
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:31.539
If you just find things easily.
they're not inspiring.

425
00:33:31.635 --> 00:33:34.935
and this was a great obstacle
that somebody had changed their number.

426
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:39.439
I just smelt a dirty money story
somewhere there.

427
00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:41.236
<i>So. if you compare to other artists.</i>

428
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:42.938
<i>how big was it actually?</i>

429
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.069
<i>Every month it just sold.</i>

430
00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:48.027
<i>And every party you went to
and every place you went to.</i>

431
00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:50.532
<i>you'd hear that album at least once.</i>

432
00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:54.992
I don't think I could even think
of how many albums he's sold here

433
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:57.544
'cause it's a long period of time.

434
00:33:57.911 --> 00:34:00.710
<i>What could be probable?</i>

435
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:08.013
I'd have to guess. Maybe half a million
copies over that period of time.

436
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:11.766
<i>It's a lot of records.
especially for a small country.</i>

437
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:14.310
<i>Gold record. ten times over.</i>

438
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:17.139
Rodriguez never got
to know that he was big in South Africa.

439
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:18.632
How could that be?

440
00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:22.023
Don't know.
I mean. everything would have been...

441
00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:23.695
I find that strange.

442
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:26.023
<i>I have no idea.</i>

443
00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:28.154
<i>But you must have sent
royalties somewhere?</i>

444
00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:30.903
<i>Of course we sent royalties.
We sent royalties to A&M Records.</i>

445
00:34:30.986 --> 00:34:33.284
<i>I remember the label. It was A&M Sussex.</i>

446
00:34:33.363 --> 00:34:36.287
<i>Whether they had a partnership.
whatever they had. I don't... You know.</i>

447
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:41.129
So. my suggestion is. if you
can find out whoever the person was

448
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.877
who owned Sussex Records.

449
00:34:43.623 --> 00:34:46.376
then you will find out
what happened to the money.

450
00:34:46.459 --> 00:34:49.178
<i>Because it's weird. isn't it?</i>

451
00:34:49.296 --> 00:34:52.425
<i>It's very strange. Very strange.</i>

452
00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:54.660
<i>How popular was the album?
Was he as famous as.</i>

453
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.932
you know.
the Rolling Stones and the Doors?

454
00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:58.805
Oh. it was much bigger
than Rolling Stones.

455
00:34:58.888 --> 00:35:00.356
Absolutely. at the time. yeah.

456
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.769
<i>When you released
the record. did you try to contact him?</i>

457
00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:07.652
No. not at all. You know?
Because... because. at the time.

458
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:11.681
the legend... the legend was...
here was an artist.

459
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.644
This was like Jimi Hendrix.

460
00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:16.456
With Jimi Hendrix catalogues.
you've gotta understand.

461
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:21.958
if you just got Jimi Hendrix and you'd
got the license for this territory.

462
00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:25.462
you're obviously not gonna go try get
hold of Jimi Hendrix. because he's dead.

463
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.464
- But who did you pay royalties to?
- To Sussex Music.

464
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:29.920
To Clarence?

465
00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:33.257
Yes. Well. to Sussex Music
which is his company. yeah.

466
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.492
So. I decided to make a diagram.

467
00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:38.812
Write down the whole path
and trail that I was trying to work out.

468
00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:41.561
All the various touch points.
all the record companies.

469
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.065
all the people that had dealings with
Rodriguez and his album at some point.

470
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:47.066
<i>I made this whole document.</i>

471
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.673
<i>So I found out there were three
record companies in South Africa</i>

472
00:35:49.773 --> 00:35:52.276
<i>that had released Rodriguez's records.</i>

473
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.030
<i>Finally discovering that
led to a record company in America.</i>

474
00:35:56.112 --> 00:35:57.910
<i>It was a company that
had been signing Rodriguez</i>

475
00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.833
<i>and creating his first album
called Sussex.</i>

476
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.708
<i>I then did my research on Sussex.</i>

477
00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:05.960
<i>That led me to discovering</i>

478
00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:10.465
<i>who the owner of Sussex Records was:
Clarence Avant.</i>

479
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:12.741
<i>Clarence Avant.
he'd been the head of Motown.</i>

480
00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:16.467
<i>one of the most prestigious jobs
to have in the record company industry.</i>

481
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:20.270
So I did my research. I tried everything
to get a hold of Clarence Avant.

482
00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:23.812
but I just got to a lot of closed doors.
I could not get a hold of him.

483
00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:39.281
<i>I don't know
if you've ever seen this picture.</i>

484
00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:42.034
That's him.

485
00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:46.042
That's Rodriguez.

486
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.878
I don't know when this was made.
I have absolutely no idea.

487
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:52.882
- That's 1970. I think.
- Yeah.

488
00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:57.178
This is my man.

489
00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:03.793
Man. don't get me emotional again. Shit.

490
00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.310
You made me emotional once.

491
00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:08.902
I ain't getting emotional no more
sitting here talking to you. man.

492
00:37:10.353 --> 00:37:14.779
<i>If I had to name ten artists
that I have ever been involved with.</i>

493
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:17.611
<i>Rodriguez would be in the top five.
simple as that.</i>

494
00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:19.742
<i>There's nothing...
You never heard anything like him.</i>

495
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:23.200
<i>People would say. "Well. Bob Dylan."
I said. "No. no".</i>

496
00:37:23.283 --> 00:37:27.629
<i>Bob Dylan was mild to this guy.
Did it make any money?</i>

497
00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:29.902
We judge singing here in America...

498
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:33.502
If you say.
"Is it... Was it the top hundred?

499
00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:37.761
"Was it... was it number...
Did it get on the charts as number 12?

500
00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:41.264
"Was there a lot of radio play?"
The answer's. "No. man."

501
00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:44.854
Nobody didn't... Rodriguez?

502
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:48.691
You know. that name didn't register.

503
00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:52.355
Although he looked like he was
a white guy but. even still. Rodriguez.

504
00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:55.358
everybody knew Rodriguez.
that's a Spanish name.

505
00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:58.281
A Latin name.
Latin music was not happening then.

506
00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:00.862
How many records do you think
he sold in America?

507
00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.098
In America'? Six.

508
00:38:03.198 --> 00:38:05.292
Maybe my wife bought it.
maybe my daughter bought...

509
00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:08.941
She couldn't buy it. but maybe
Neil Bogart. maybe Dennis and Mike.

510
00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:13.383
Hey. look. man. you know.
it didn't sell here.

511
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:16.886
<i>There was some excitement about him.</i>

512
00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:21.287
<i>Couple of agents heard him
and wanted to bring him to California</i>

513
00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:24.556
<i>and. you know. when he came
to California he was nervous.</i>

514
00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:26.725
<i>and he turned his back to the audience</i>

515
00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:28.965
<i>and everybody said.
"Well. what the hell is this?"</i>

516
00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:30.559
<i>But the thing is that the guy sold</i>

517
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:33.395
<i>hundreds of thousands of records
in another country.</i>

518
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.739
<i>I'm going to South Africa to try
to chase somebody who's selling records?</i>

519
00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:37.236
<i>Shit. no. man.</i>

520
00:38:37.332 --> 00:38:39.906
<i>But did you know
that he was big in South Africa?</i>

521
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:44.707
Rodriguez. young man. never happened
insofar as I'm concerned.

522
00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:46.408
Period.

523
00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:50.829
But if I'm really gonna try to track
down the money. how should I do it?

524
00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:53.415
Well. is that important. the money?
Or is Rod...

525
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:58.922
Which is important? Rodriguez's story
or you worrying about the money?

526
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.596
How many people in South Africa?

527
00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:03.432
40 million? 40 thousand?
40 million people? How many people?

528
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.018
40 million people live in South Africa.

529
00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:08.723
Well. so they've been freed
for how long? Three hours?

530
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.273
So what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

531
00:39:10.365 --> 00:39:12.939
You told me at lunch.
they scratch records

532
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.686
because they wouldn't let the lyrics...

533
00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:18.273
So the underground movement.
how big was it'? How big was it?

534
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:20.947
<i>He sold half a million records
in South Africa.</i>

535
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:22.865
So he sold half a million records.
So what?

536
00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:24.696
I don't know who he sold them to.

537
00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.623
How many distributors did he have?
I have no idea.

538
00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:29.201
There are only...
There are three record labels.

539
00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:31.127
- I spoke to all the record label...
- Well. great.

540
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:35.966
...bosses in South Africa who
has released his records. It was...

541
00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:38.718
Go back to 'em and tell 'em
to send me an account.

542
00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:41.216
You think it's something
I'm gonna worry about. a 1970 contract?

543
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:43.970
If you do.
you're outta your goddamn mind.

544
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.811
Buddha Records out of business.
I'm out of business.

545
00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:53.149
So you think they give a shit
about that? I know I wouldn't.

546
00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:57.145
<i>I've been looking for information</i>

547
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.897
<i>about Rodriguez for a long time.</i>

548
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:03.068
<i>I've even setup a web page
called The Great Rodriguez Hunt</i>

549
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:05.153
<i>in the hope that
someone out there in cyberspace</i>

550
00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:09.954
<i>would post a message on the forum giving
us any information about Rodriguez.</i>

551
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.952
<i>But there was nothing.</i>

552
00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.667
<i>At that stage I met Craig.</i>

553
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:18.000
<i>who was the musicologist detective
who had read my liner notes</i>

554
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:20.252
<i>and who was also
searching for Rodriguez.</i>

555
00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:23.680
<i>And he flew down to Cape Town
and we met in a coffee shop.</i>

556
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:26.508
<i>And we exchanged
all the information we had.</i>

557
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.918
<i>But unfortunately we had very little.</i>

558
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.265
<i>And at that stage I remember we felt
it was probably best if we just stopped.</i>

559
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:34.850
<i>So basically I was lost.</i>

560
00:40:34.974 --> 00:40:36.592
<i>I'd come to a dead end.
I couldn't find him.</i>

561
00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:38.277
<i>I didn't know where to look any more.</i>

562
00:40:38.353 --> 00:40:40.697
<i>I'd even visited the places
that he sang about.</i>

563
00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:42.861
<i>I'd been to London. Nothing.</i>

564
00:40:42.957 --> 00:40:47.033
<i>I'd been to Amsterdam.
He sings about Amsterdam. Nothing.</i>

565
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.955
<i>And one day I'd basically given up.
I thought. "Well. this is it. "</i>

566
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.875
And one day. just by accident.
I was listening to the album in the car

567
00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:55.040
<i>and I heard the song Inner City Blues.</i>

568
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.292
<i>Great song. And the line came up.</i>

569
00:40:57.372 --> 00:41:01.127
<i>"I met a girl in Dearborn.
early six o'clock this morn.</i>

570
00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:02.711
<i>"A cold fact."</i>

571
00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:05.798
<i>Then I thought. "Hang on a minute."
I 'd never checked out Dearborn.</i>

572
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.803
<i>I didn't even know if it was a city
but then I thought.</i>

573
00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:09.725
<i>"Actually that sounds
like a town or a city."</i>

574
00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:13.556
And I thought. "Hang on.
let me check it out in an atlas."

575
00:41:13.654 --> 00:41:18.731
So I went through to my old atlas
and pulled it out.

576
00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:22.071
I thought. "Let me see
what I could find here.

577
00:41:22.163 --> 00:41:24.566
"Let me see if I could find Dearborn."

578
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:26.405
Urn... Dear...

579
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:31.365
Then I found it.
Dearborn. Wayne. Michigan. F7.

580
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:37.583
F...7.

581
00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:42.756
Dearborn. Part of Detroit.
That was a huge breakthrough in my mind.

582
00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:47.510
Detroit. home of Motown.
Marvin Gaye. Stevie Wonder.

583
00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:51.096
and. eventually. Mike Theodore.
the producer of the album.

584
00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:00.106
<i>I was sifting in my condo.
just having a cup of coffee.</i>

585
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:04.106
<i>I was looking out the window
watching the ocean. Phone rings.</i>

586
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.942
It's a long-distance call

587
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:08.614
from South Africa...

588
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:13.077
from a writer whose name's
Craig Bartholomew.

589
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:19.080
and he starts telling me
this amazing story.

590
00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:22.123
<i>So he said. "Do you know that Rodriguez</i>

591
00:42:22.223 --> 00:42:25.127
<i>"has been selling in South Africa
for 25 years.</i>

592
00:42:25.226 --> 00:42:27.549
<i>"His albums are selling millions."</i>

593
00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.552
<i>I said. "What?"</i>

594
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.476
<i>Then he's sitting there and he wants...
he starts telling me some stories.</i>

595
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.645
He said. "How did Rodriguez die?"

596
00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:39.979
And he's telling me information
that he had that Rodriguez had...

597
00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:43.148
blown his brains out on stage.

598
00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:45.480
or set himself on fire
and killed himself.

599
00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:48.032
I had 100 questions I wanted to ask.

600
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:51.828
I was just hoping I could get
all my questions in. you know.

601
00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:54.413
"Why did he write this lyric?
Why did he write that lyric?

602
00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:58.585
"Where did he record this album?
Where did he record that album?"

603
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:02.505
And we got talking and I asked him
a lot of questions and it was amazing.

604
00:43:02.597 --> 00:43:05.401
It was a rollercoaster ride
of questions and answers.

605
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.845
and it was a euphoric moment
of just having finally broken through

606
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:10.383
and discovered something.

607
00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:14.384
And finally I got to the one question
I wanted to know the answer of. was.

608
00:43:14.483 --> 00:43:18.559
"How did Rodriguez die?
Did he blow himself up on stage? Or...

609
00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:21.228
"What is this dramatic story?

610
00:43:21.324 --> 00:43:25.900
"Let's open up the lid on this
right away. and find out what happened."

611
00:43:25.995 --> 00:43:30.696
And Mike Theodore said.
"What do you mean dead? He's not dead.

612
00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:34.905
"Sixto is alive. He's alive and kicking.

613
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:40.707
"The principal artist known as
Sixto Rodriguez is alive and kicking

614
00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:42.204
"and living in Detroit."

615
00:43:46.332 --> 00:43:49.552
<i>I... I can't remember who
called me and said. "They've found him."</i>

616
00:43:49.644 --> 00:43:55.222
I said. "No. You're shitting me.
This isn't... No."

617
00:43:55.842 --> 00:44:00.097
<i>At first I thought it was a hoax.
I thought somebody was faking it.</i>

618
00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:04.726
You know. it's like going
into Tutankhamen's tomb

619
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:06.228
and finding the mummy.

620
00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:07.729
You know. it was like. "Wow. he lives."

621
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:11.274
I remember dancing on the spot
when I was staying on the phone.

622
00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:15.245
And Craig and I were jumping up and down
saying. "We found him. we found him."

623
00:44:15.336 --> 00:44:17.739
It was the most exciting thing.
We'd actually done it.

624
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.554
<i>So that was it.</i>

625
00:44:50.646 --> 00:44:53.490
<i>I'd come to the point.
it was the end of the story.</i>

626
00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:57.613
<i>I was searching for a dead man.
One morning I discovered a living man.</i>

627
00:44:57.712 --> 00:45:00.561
And to me that was the end of the story.
I wrote my article.

628
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:03.025
I called it "Looking for Jesus."

629
00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:04.619
I faxed it to many individuals.

630
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:05.791
many people involved.

631
00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:10.629
but somehow this article
made its way across the Atlantic

632
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.128
and into the hands
of someone in America.

633
00:45:13.227 --> 00:45:15.871
And what I thought was the end of story

634
00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:18.582
was actually just the beginning
of another story.

635
00:45:18.674 --> 00:45:21.302
and the best part was still to come.

636
00:45:23.596 --> 00:45:26.190
'Cause I don't know where it is.
It might take a while.

637
00:45:26.282 --> 00:45:28.310
They do have the dates.

638
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:31.188
"Three-year search for dead singer."
Yes.

639
00:45:31.312 --> 00:45:34.657
August '97. I was in Kansas.

640
00:45:34.749 --> 00:45:38.495
I got a copy of it to me at work.
I was on. like. a 24-hour shift.

641
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:40.830
And then. I went online

642
00:45:40.988 --> 00:45:45.164
and that's when
I discovered the website.

643
00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:49.039
When I went online there was
this milk carton with a picture.

644
00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:54.716
And it said. "Wanted"
and "Have you seen this man?"

645
00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:58.348
I was like. "Matter of fact.
I have seen him before."

646
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:04.396
I replied. "Rodriguez is my father.
I'm serious.

647
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:07.689
"Do you really want to know
about my father?

648
00:46:07.782 --> 00:46:11.357
"Sometimes the fantasy
is better left alive."

649
00:46:11.452 --> 00:46:13.525
I don't know why I said that.
but anyway I did.

650
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:17.367
And then I gave them e-mail address.
phone numbers.

651
00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:20.703
anything that they wanted to contact me.
And he phoned me.

652
00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:28.173
<i>Well. we'd found out
that Rodriguez was alive.</i>

653
00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:29.871
<i>I'd spoken to Craig.</i>

654
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.714
I came to work and Alex McCrindle.

655
00:46:32.807 --> 00:46:34.755
who was the guy I worked
on the website with said.

656
00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:38.220
"You're not going to believe
what's on the website."

657
00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:41.887
And on the website was a forum
where people could post messages.

658
00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:43.555
and there was a message that said.

659
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:46.225
"My name's Eva.
I'm Rodriguez's daughter."

660
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:47.722
<i>She'd left a phone number and she said.</i>

661
00:46:47.847 --> 00:46:49.099
<i>"I'd like to speak to someone</i>

662
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:50.566
<i>in connection with this."</i>

663
00:46:50.658 --> 00:46:52.777
<i>So that night I phoned her.</i>

664
00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:55.442
I said. "Hi. I'm Sugar."
and she said. "I'm Eva."

665
00:46:55.563 --> 00:46:58.066
and we had the most
amazing conversation.

666
00:46:58.165 --> 00:47:02.241
She explained to me who her father was.
what he had done. where he had been.

667
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:05.911
She asked me who I was
and I explained why my name was Sugar

668
00:47:06.006 --> 00:47:08.409
and how I was involved with the website.

669
00:47:08.509 --> 00:47:10.628
<i>And then at the end I said to her.</i>

670
00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:13.088
<i>"This has been the most
amazing thing for me.</i>

671
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.923
<i>"and what would be really great
is if I could.</i>

672
00:47:15.015 --> 00:47:16.758
<i>"at some point. speak to your dad.</i>

673
00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:18.799
<i>"I'd love it if I could
just say hello to him. "</i>

674
00:47:18.894 --> 00:47:21.468
<i>Because. for me.
this was son' of the end of the search</i>

675
00:47:21.564 --> 00:47:23.432
<i>and I just wanted to speak to this man.</i>

676
00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:25.426
And then I went to bed.

677
00:47:25.526 --> 00:47:28.646
And 1:00 in the morning that night.
the phone rang.

678
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:33.105
And my wife answers it
'cause it was her side of the bed.

679
00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:37.776
And I remember she picked up the phone
and her face just changed.

680
00:47:37.872 --> 00:47:41.948
She had this look of awe.
She said. "it's him."

681
00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:44.116
And I was in shock. I'd been sleeping

682
00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:47.331
and I ran into the other room.
into my study.

683
00:47:47.423 --> 00:47:49.826
and I picked up the phone
and she put hers down.

684
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.499
And I said. "Hello?" and a voice said...

685
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.463
<i>"Hello. is that Sugar?"</i>

686
00:47:54.555 --> 00:47:58.301
And I knew. I just knew.
because I knew that voice.

687
00:47:58.392 --> 00:48:01.967
I'd heard that voice so many times
on the records. I knew it was him.

688
00:48:02.062 --> 00:48:03.805
I was talking to Rodriguez.

689
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:08.136
<i>That. for me. was one of
the greatest moments of my life.</i>

690
00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:20.966
<i>-Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.</i>

691
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.214
<i>Is this all right?
Should I be doing something though?</i>

692
00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:26.594
<i>Should I have a glass of water
or something? Is that right?</i>

693
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:29.934
- Do you want?
- Yeah. I like that.

694
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.803
Yeah. this is...
I'm supposed to be comfortable.

695
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.076
So run the question to me again.
Just so I can hear it in my head.

696
00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:52.620
In the '70s and '80s. did you ever
get any contact from South Africa?

697
00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:55.167
Uh... No. I didn't.

698
00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:01.291
Maybe they didn't have a contact number
or something but. no. I didn't.

699
00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:03.588
How does that feel?
You weren't aware of something

700
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.795
that would have changed
your life completely.

701
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.264
I mean. probably to the better.

702
00:50:08.756 --> 00:50:11.430
Well. I don't know if it would have been
for the better.

703
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.763
but it's certainly a thought. you know.

704
00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:19.359
But wouldn't it have been nice to know
that you were a superstar?

705
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:20.810
Uh. well...

706
00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:27.946
I don't know how to respond to that.

707
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:32.326
After Coming From Reality.
did you wanna continue making albums?

708
00:50:32.446 --> 00:50:36.326
I would have liked to have continued
but nothing beats Reality.

709
00:50:36.425 --> 00:50:38.794
So I pretty much went back to work.

710
00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:41.130
What did you do?

711
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:44.129
L... Well. I'd do hired labor.

712
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:48.216
Demolition. renovation of buildings.

713
00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:53.055
of homes. you know. Restoration.

714
00:50:54.468 --> 00:50:55.811
Did you enjoy that'?

715
00:50:55.886 --> 00:51:00.642
I do. It keeps the blood
circulating. keeps you fit. yeah.

716
00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:03.519
But it's quite far away from music.

717
00:51:03.619 --> 00:51:07.399
Uh... Yeah. quite a bit.
quite a different contrast. yeah.

718
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:09.859
Did you continue
making music on your own?

719
00:51:09.984 --> 00:51:13.363
I do. I play guitar.
I love playing guitar.

720
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:17.492
But I do love to listen.
I like to go see the shows and things.

721
00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:19.669
<i>But I do get about.</i>

722
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:36.037
<i>He never said anything
about being disappointed.</i>

723
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:39.206
<i>He would just move on.
continue to survive</i>

724
00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.041
<i>because you can't just give up.</i>

725
00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:43.118
<i>What did he do instead?</i>

726
00:52:43.202 --> 00:52:44.875
He read a lot.

727
00:52:44.953 --> 00:52:48.457
He was involved in politics.
He was involved in the community.

728
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.043
He would attend protests and rallies.

729
00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:54.676
if those were causes that
he believed in. He would take us along.

730
00:52:54.755 --> 00:52:58.976
He was always a proponent
of working for the people

731
00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:01.145
that maybe didn't always have a voice.

732
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:06.067
or didn't have a chance to speak up.
the working class. the working poor.

733
00:53:07.226 --> 00:53:12.198
He had a lot of experience in that area.

734
00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:15.826
<i>He approached the work</i>

735
00:53:15.918 --> 00:53:17.570
<i>from a different place than
most people do.</i>

736
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:19.451
<i>He took it very. very seriously.</i>

737
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.908
<i>Son' of like a sacrament. you know?</i>

738
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:26.712
He was going to do this dirty.
dirty work for eight or ten hours. okay?

739
00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:28.789
But he was dressed in a tuxedo.

740
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:36.806
<i>He had this kind of magical quality
that all genuine poets and artists have</i>

741
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:41.640
<i>to elevate things.
To get above the mundane. the prosaic.</i>

742
00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:45.144
All the bullshit.
All the mediocrity that's everywhere.

743
00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:49.944
The artist. the artist is the pioneer.

744
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:56.068
<i>Even if his musical hopes were dashed.
the spirit remained.</i>

745
00:53:56.525 --> 00:54:00.280
<i>And he just had to keep finding a place.
refining the process</i>

746
00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:02.498
<i>of how to apply himself.</i>

747
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:04.541
<i>He knew that there was something more.</i>

748
00:54:04.616 --> 00:54:08.041
<i>It was in the early '80s.
He wanted to do something.</i>

749
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.214
<i>do something righteous.
make a difference.</i>

750
00:54:10.289 --> 00:54:13.964
So. lo and behold...

751
00:54:14.042 --> 00:54:16.261
...he told me that he
was gonna run for mayor.

752
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:19.761
and I thought.
"Well. God bless you. Rodriguez.

753
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.219
"You know. if you can become Mayor
of Detroit. then anything is possible."

754
00:54:49.328 --> 00:54:51.205
Some old items from Rodriguez.

755
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:59.805
This is his bumper sticker. from
the first time he ran for city council.

756
00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:05.352
And I think this is a copy
of the ballot.

757
00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:08.101
He didn't win an election. ever.

758
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:13.690
139. There were 169 candidates.
Nine get elected.

759
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:17.114
They spelled his name wrong.

760
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:30.878
My relatives on my mother's side
of the family are European

761
00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:33.372
and Native American.

762
00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:36.216
And my father's family is Mexican.

763
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:38.919
My grandfather came from Mexico.

764
00:55:39.019 --> 00:55:43.140
<i>The Mexican came to Detroit
to work in the auto factories.</i>

765
00:55:43.215 --> 00:55:48.893
<i>so we were working-class people.
blue-collar workers. hard labor.</i>

766
00:55:49.513 --> 00:55:55.065
<i>Um. we lived in 26 different homes
and some houses didn't have bedrooms.</i>

767
00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:57.362
<i>Some houses didn't have bathrooms.</i>

768
00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:02.068
<i>And they weren't homes.
They were just places that we lived.</i>

769
00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:06.455
But just because people are poor
or have little

770
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:10.368
doesn't mean that. you know.
their dreams aren't big

771
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.624
and their soul isn't rich. you know.

772
00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:18.087
and that's where the classes
and the prejudice come from

773
00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:20.669
is that there is a difference
between you and me.

774
00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:22.595
and there's a difference
between them and us.

775
00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:10.261
He wasn't just doing
your average carpentry. you know.

776
00:57:10.344 --> 00:57:13.018
he was really cleaning out the house.

777
00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:15.895
I mean. doing work that no one else
wanted to do.

778
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:19.228
Really. no one else
wanted to do that work.

779
00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:25.239
<i>He would come home. he would be covered
in dust and din'. paint chips.</i>

780
00:57:25.484 --> 00:57:28.613
<i>from his day's work. Long days.</i>

781
00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:33.910
<i>I saw him take refrigerators
down on his back. downstairs.</i>

782
00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:36.703
It was just a day at work for him.

783
00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:41.418
but I knew he was a harder worker than
a lot of other fathers that I knew of.

784
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:45.220
<i>It's a city that tells you
not to dream big.</i>

785
00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:48.094
<i>not to expect anything more.</i>

786
00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:50.642
<i>But he always took me to places</i>

787
00:57:50.717 --> 00:57:54.096
<i>that only certain elite people
would be able to go.</i>

788
00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.649
So. he kind of instilled in me
that I can go anywhere I want.

789
00:57:57.724 --> 00:58:02.480
regardless of what my bank statement
says. and I'm going. you know.

790
00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:07.819
So. that's kinda how he was.
He showed me the top floors of places.

791
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.825
<i>I said. "I'm just as good as they are."
you know.</i>

792
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:14.033
<i>He majored in philosophy
in university.</i>

793
00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:18.496
<i>My dad gave us a lot of exposure
to the arts.</i>

794
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:24.176
<i>He would let us go into the libraries
and the museums and the science centres.</i>

795
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:27.004
and where that was our day care.

796
00:58:28.422 --> 00:58:32.928
and we toured the halls of the museum
in San Diego Rivera

797
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:37.311
and. you know.
all Picasso and Delacroix and...

798
00:58:37.389 --> 00:58:41.189
We began to learn of life
outside of the city.

799
00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:43.942
and that's in books and paintings
and in music.

800
00:59:56.843 --> 00:59:58.845
Well. I started playing
when I was 16.

801
00:59:58.945 --> 01:00:01.849
and the thing is.
it was a family guitar.

802
01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:07.029
and I played a lot of bars in the city
and clubs in the city. small rooms.

803
01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.446
And I met Mike Theodore
and Dennis Coffey

804
01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.028
and they came to the club
to see me play.

805
01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:18.032
I had a gig at a place called The Sewer.

806
01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.660
right out by the Detroit River.

807
01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:24.459
and then we got a record deal
from Clarence Avant.

808
01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:26.211
so that's how it started.

809
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:30.131
<i>But all those early years were.
you know... lot of work.</i>

810
01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.552
<i>I was at a Chrysler plant
called Dodge Maine.</i>

811
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.680
<i>and I also worked
at Eldon and Lynch Road in Detroit.</i>

812
01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:41.180
<i>Worked in the heat treat department.
Stuff like that.</i>

813
01:00:41.279 --> 01:00:43.181
<i>A lot of heavy labor.</i>

814
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:47.186
<i>But it was a good year for me.
This Cold Fact thing.</i>

815
01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:52.400
<i>I had achieved what I was trying to do.
is to get a product. you know.</i>

816
01:00:52.524 --> 01:00:55.198
<i>And it was going very well.
I thought. you know.</i>

817
01:00:55.293 --> 01:01:00.415
<i>How did it feel? A great feeling
of accomplishment. Actualization.</i>

818
01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.202
<i>Did you believe
that it was a good album?</i>

819
01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.047
I did my best with it.

820
01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.710
The reviews were good on it. and...

821
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.842
Yeah. I thought it was good.

822
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:20.018
I'm not the one to ask that. though.

823
01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.936
Ask that question to.

824
01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.600
But you go ahead. yeah.

825
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.432
Were you surprised that it didn't sell?

826
01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.937
Um...

827
01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:33.949
<i>Was I surprised? It's the music business
so there's no guarantees. you know?</i>

828
01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:42.190
<i>So I told him.
"You're bigger than Elvis. "</i>

829
01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:43.875
<i>and he said. "What do you mean?"</i>

830
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.625
<i>I said. "In South Africa you are
more popular than Elvis Presley. "</i>

831
01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.126
And there was this pause.

832
01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:52.296
and I sensed he thought it was
a crank call and he was gonna hang up.

833
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:55.754
So I said. "Listen. wait.
Listen. listen to me. wait.

834
01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.632
"I promise you. just come here.
You won't be disappointed."

835
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.869
<i>He's working his ass off in Woodbridge.</i>

836
01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:05.643
One day. be brought this picture
of himself on a milk carton.

837
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:12.609
And he'd say. "Emmerson. look at this.
You know. they're looking for me."

838
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.992
I said.
"Really? Why is that. Rodriguez?"

839
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:22.076
<i>Next day he says.
"Emmerson. I gotta go on tour."</i>

840
01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:25.000
<i>I said. "Come on. Rodriguez.
are you serious?"</i>

841
01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.993
<i>Because I'm a journalist.
I doubted it.</i>

842
01:02:27.093 --> 01:02:29.917
<i>That son' of thing does not happen
in the rational universe.</i>

843
01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.840
<i>It does not happen.
It's against the laws of God and nature.</i>

844
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.336
<i>This guy is coming to tour here.
he must be an imposter.</i>

845
01:02:35.435 --> 01:02:38.179
It's a clever public relations scam.

846
01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:41.801
Actually. not even a clever
public relations scam. it's a stupid...

847
01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:46.389
'Cause it so obviously can't be true.
Only idiots would believe it. They...

848
01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:50.183
But I was wrong.

849
01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.428
<i>We were always anxious.
of course. to get off the plane.</i>

850
01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:02.074
<i>That was a long flight.</i>

851
01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:05.700
But we got off the plane
and we put our bags on our backs

852
01:03:05.799 --> 01:03:11.081
and. you know. they were heavy and
we just kept moving towards the airport.

853
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.584
And suddenly.
three. two limousines pulled up

854
01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.592
and we were sure
that they weren't for us.

855
01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:22.557
We were like kind of
walking around them.

856
01:03:22.649 --> 01:03:25.223
Like. "Oh. we better get out
of these people's way

857
01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.721
"'cause they're important people
in limos."

858
01:03:27.821 --> 01:03:30.725
But they were for us.
And that's when it began.

859
01:03:30.824 --> 01:03:34.729
<i>It was all another world.
It was another world.</i>

860
01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:40.075
<i>Just like you would see people...
over Madonna or...</i>

861
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:45.618
Like stepping out into the wind
and the paparazzi and all the...

862
01:03:45.713 --> 01:03:51.586
you know. the production assistants
and everybody are there to welcome him

863
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:54.923
and take us into the VIP suite.

864
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.261
<i>The white carpeting.
You know. that was something that</i>

865
01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:03.803
never would we ever even dream
of walking on white carpeting.

866
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.971
especially in your shoes.

867
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.479
<i>They put him in a limo
and they drove him into the city.</i>

868
01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:14.318
<i>And along the way. on all the lampposts.
were placards advertising the concert.</i>

869
01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.271
And he saw his face on every lamppost
as it sped by

870
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:19.819
and he'd go.
"There I am. there I am. there I am."

871
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.818
<i>So we came
and we got to meet all the people.</i>

872
01:04:22.917 --> 01:04:26.617
<i>We got to meet Craig Bartholomew
and their family and their kids</i>

873
01:04:26.713 --> 01:04:28.615
<i>and Stephen Segerman.</i>

874
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.361
And everybody was just so happy.
Everybody was thrilled.

875
01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:33.920
We were even happier.

876
01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:35.831
Stephen phoned me.

877
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.174
He said. "You will never believe this...

878
01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.532
"but Rodriguez is coming to South Africa

879
01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.471
"and we can be the opening band.

880
01:04:43.563 --> 01:04:47.093
"Do you wanna do it?"
I said. "Of course we wanna do it."

881
01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.475
"Why? Where is he?"
"Now they found him.

882
01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:55.146
"They found him. he's alive. he's gonna
come and tour in South Africa."

883
01:04:55.241 --> 01:04:59.317
"Are we gonna be the opening band?"
So I couldn't really believe this.

884
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:05.390
And then I got all the information:
he's living in Detroit and everything.

885
01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.203
And then a little while later he said.

886
01:05:07.295 --> 01:05:09.823
"Look. it turns out
he hasn't got a band.

887
01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:13.498
"Could we be the support band?"
I mean his band.

888
01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:18.002
I remember. even then. we were sort of.

889
01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.376
"Is this really gonna be Rodriguez?"

890
01:05:21.476 --> 01:05:24.004
We'll only know
if he can actually sing these songs.

891
01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:27.383
I mean. we don't know.
What if it's just some guy?

892
01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:29.008
<i>It was just like</i>

893
01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.351
<i>one day we heard about it</i>

894
01:05:30.443 --> 01:05:32.641
<i>and the next day we were there.</i>

895
01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.856
<i>trying to believe our eyes.</i>

896
01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:38.853
<i>thinking it was just all very shocking.</i>

897
01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:41.196
<i>I don't know. he took to it really easy.</i>

898
01:05:41.287 --> 01:05:43.565
<i>He just walked in and did his thing</i>

899
01:05:43.665 --> 01:05:47.195
<i>and I was amazed that he did so well.</i>

900
01:05:47.293 --> 01:05:48.194
<i>But he's not all</i>

901
01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.366
<i>"head in the clouds" kinda guy.</i>

902
01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:53.208
<i>He's a little bit too much grounded.</i>

903
01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.910
<i>He didn't take advantage</i>

904
01:05:55.009 --> 01:05:57.037
<i>of all the amenities and stuff.</i>

905
01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.919
He didn't sleep in the big
double king size bed.

906
01:06:00.014 --> 01:06:03.760
He kinda curled up on the love seat
and I found him there and...

907
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:07.255
Yeah. he just didn't think somebody
should have to make another bed

908
01:06:07.355 --> 01:06:09.257
because he messed it up or...

909
01:06:09.357 --> 01:06:10.634
<i>There was a time</i>

910
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.765
<i>where I stayed in the house we were at</i>

911
01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:15.389
<i>and everyone else had gone out.</i>

912
01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.099
<i>The phone rang and it kept ringing.</i>

913
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:19.317
<i>so I decided to answer it.</i>

914
01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:20.769
And it was a reporter

915
01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.737
looking to speak with Rodriguez

916
01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.782
and set up time for an interview.

917
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:31.184
And then. before she hung up.
after I told her to call back later

918
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.657
to talk to someone
'cause I couldn't help her.

919
01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.337
she told me that she wanted to know.
between she and I.

920
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.334
if it was the real Rodriguez.

921
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.297
We were rehearsing with a CD

922
01:06:45.393 --> 01:06:47.412
of the songs that we've got

923
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:48.926
in the studio here in Cape Town

924
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:52.375
on the day that he came
from the airport. when he arrived.

925
01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:56.042
and we were actually in the middle
of a song when he walked in

926
01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.936
and just took over the microphone
and finished the song.

927
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.484
We switched off the CD player

928
01:07:01.576 --> 01:07:04.320
and it was. like. completely seamless.

929
01:07:04.412 --> 01:07:05.689
<i>Completely seamless.</i>

930
01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:07.945
<i>I mean. "OK. this is the guy."</i>

931
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.822
<i>I think we all knew this is</i>

932
01:07:09.917 --> 01:07:11.945
<i>gonna be something really special.</i>

933
01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:32.637
<i>Thank you. Cape Town. Thank you.</i>

934
01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:35.556
<i>When we. uh...</i>

935
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:36.727
<i>initially got on a plane.</i>

936
01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.751
<i>I thought maybe there 'd be. hopefully.</i>

937
01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:40.965
<i>20 people in the audience.</i>

938
01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.893
Hopefully.

939
01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:47.064
But it turned out really.
really different than that.

940
01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:49.987
And there's old people and young people

941
01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:53.161
and they're coming to see the show.

942
01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:57.241
<i>And there's my step-dad on the stage...
Before he went on stage.</i>

943
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.417
<i>'cause I wanted to take
a picture of the audience.</i>

944
01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:01.494
<i>since nobody's gonna believe this.</i>

945
01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.046
<i>You must remember. this guy.</i>

946
01:08:03.137 --> 01:08:06.086
<i>it's like seeing someone like Elvis
come back from the dead.</i>

947
01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:07.675
<i>People in the audience
still don't believe it.</i>

948
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.593
<i>They're standing there.
They're at the concert.</i>

949
01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.262
They've paid their money.

950
01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.055
They still don't believe that Rodriguez

951
01:08:13.147 --> 01:08:15.049
is actually gonna walk on that stage.

952
01:08:41.909 --> 01:08:45.630
<i>Are you ready?</i>

953
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.587
<i>Please welcome...</i>

954
01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.718
<i>Rodriguez!</i>

955
01:09:29.123 --> 01:09:31.091
<i>It was almost as if he
didn't even have to play.</i>

956
01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.295
<i>They were just happy to see him.</i>

957
01:09:33.378 --> 01:09:34.595
<i>So. for a time.</i>

958
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.641
<i>I think they wanted to meet.</i>

959
01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.885
<i>It was a reunion.</i>

960
01:09:41.052 --> 01:09:42.975
<i>It was something
completely different.</i>

961
01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:45.182
<i>It was for everybody there. I'm sure.</i>

962
01:09:45.306 --> 01:09:49.106
<i>the most exciting concert they'd
ever been to. Because it was unique.</i>

963
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.732
<i>We'd never seen Rodriguez.</i>

964
01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:51.813
<i>And all you heard</i>

965
01:09:51.896 --> 01:09:54.069
<i>was the bass player just playing...</i>

966
01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:00.845
<i>And Rodriguez wandered out
to the front of the stage</i>

967
01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:01.948
<i>and the bass player</i>

968
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:03.032
<i>actually just stopped playing.</i>

969
01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:04.163
<i>And it took a while.</i>

970
01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:05.585
<i>There was about five or ten minutes</i>

971
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.539
<i>of just people screaming at him.</i>

972
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.987
<i>Thanks for keeping me alive.</i>

973
01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:33.540
<i>I think to go</i>

974
01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.796
from being the outcast

975
01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:40.247
to being. uh. who he really was.

976
01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:46.265
Because it was as though it was him
again... and that was who he was.

977
01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:49.769
a musician on stage.
playing for his fans.

978
01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:14.710
<i>I thought I would see him
being bewildered</i>

979
01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:17.292
<i>at all these people staring up at him.</i>

980
01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:20.745
<i>I saw the opposite.
I saw this absolute tranquility.</i>

981
01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:24.512
<i>There was absolute serenity on his face.
Total.</i>

982
01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:28.749
<i>It's like he had arrived at that thing.
at that place</i>

983
01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.223
<i>he'd tried to find his whole life.</i>

984
01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:33.649
<i>Home is acceptance.</i>

985
01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:37.562
<i>Here's a guy who'd lived somewhere else.
on the other side of the earth.</i>

986
01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.799
<i>and it was almost as if
he had found his home.</i>

987
01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.900
<i>And I looked around at all these people</i>

988
01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:46.659
<i>and I thought. "This is
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</i>

989
01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:49.786
<i>"This is never going to happen again."</i>

990
01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.919
<i>Well. isn't this all
our great fate?</i>

991
01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:47.346
Your dreams of yourself. the higher
forms of yourself is that one day

992
01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:52.475
you will be recognised and that
your talents and everything else.

993
01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:56.023
will suddenly become visible
to the world.

994
01:13:56.098 --> 01:14:00.604
I mean. most of us die
without coming anywhere close

995
01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.781
to that sort of magic.

996
01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.233
<i>I tried to get him to talk about that</i>

997
01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:06.613
<i>when I interviewed him.</i>

998
01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.114
<i>about how strange it was.</i>

999
01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.413
<i>and I got absolutely nothing back.</i>

1000
01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:12.081
<i>Absolutely nothing back.</i>

1001
01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.373
<i>And I couldn't tell whether</i>

1002
01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.622
<i>he was just like son' of cripplingly shy</i>

1003
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.827
<i>or whether I was</i>

1004
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.037
<i>asking the wrong questions</i>

1005
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.167
<i>or there was a language barrier</i>

1006
01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:20.463
<i>or whatever. He just...</i>

1007
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:25.587
Maybe that was OK as well
because he preserved his mystery.

1008
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.718
I walked away
from that interview saying.

1009
01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:30.679
"This is all too strange to be true."

1010
01:14:30.758 --> 01:14:33.386
<i>It remains too strange to be true.</i>

1011
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.721
<i>"These are the days</i>

1012
01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.351
<i>"of miracles and wonder."</i>

1013
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.122
<i>Oh. they were so sweet.</i>

1014
01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.378
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

1015
01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:06.210
<i>And I still don't. but the thing is...</i>

1016
01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:11.516
So when I went on stage
5.000 seats all set up.

1017
01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.352
white seats. and the thing is...

1018
01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:17.271
And I said. "This is..."

1019
01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:23.187
<i>So when I played a show. they jumped
out of their seats and rushed the stage.</i>

1020
01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:29.071
<i>South Africa made me feel like
more than a prince.</i>

1021
01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.979
<i>And then signing the autographs
for. like. a couple of hours.</i>

1022
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:37.291
<i>I mean. just the line of people
bringing their guitars to be signed.</i>

1023
01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.414
<i>bringing their CDs and...</i>

1024
01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:40.961
<i>The most amazing thing I'd seen</i>

1025
01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.916
<i>was the man with his tattoo
of the Cold Fact.</i>

1026
01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:48.028
<i>He was a Rodriguez impersonator.
That just stoked my fire.</i>

1027
01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:51.222
<i>I was like.
"Man. that is just too crazy."</i>

1028
01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.310
I have with me here.
presented to Rodriguez

1029
01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.308
<i>for sales of the album Cold Fact.</i>

1030
01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.145
Now just tell the States that.
OK. will you?

1031
01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:11.885
American singer Rodriguez
is certainly alive and well

1032
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.328
and with us in the Front Row tonight.
Welcome.

1033
01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:15.913
Very kind. How are you?

1034
01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.912
I've heard some really riveting tales
about your "death."

1035
01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.995
I mean. they range from you pouring
petrol all over yourself on stage

1036
01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:27.084
and committing suicide to taking
a drug overdose and dying in prison.

1037
01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:42.982
<i>Yeah. it was a beautiful.
beautiful dream</i>

1038
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.694
<i>and then you gotta go back.</i>

1039
01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.440
My dad said he's got two lives.

1040
01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:55.700
The carriage turns into the pumpkin bus
or something. It's like...

1041
01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.198
<i>Did people in Detroit believe you</i>

1042
01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.275
when you came back
and told them what had happened?

1043
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:05.497
You know. people in Detroit
need to hear something good.

1044
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.278
<i>I'm not sure how much of it
they believed</i>

1045
01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:10.877
<i>because it is a grandiose story.</i>

1046
01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.637
It sounds like something
you would make up

1047
01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:16.966
if you were bragging on some dream
or something.

1048
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.473
<i>He was really quite famous.</i>

1049
01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:23.227
<i>He'd be. you know.
tearing down this old shack</i>

1050
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.800
<i>or he'd be sweeping up filth or dirt</i>

1051
01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:30.066
<i>and he started to show me one day.
and I didn't believe him.</i>

1052
01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:33.992
<i>about the album
and how it got to be so popular.</i>

1053
01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:35.739
Somebody had a bootleg copy
of this thing

1054
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.908
and it spread around and everyone...

1055
01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:42.663
It got to be so popular
that children could recite it

1056
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:47.087
and sing the song word for word...
all of the songs word for word.

1057
01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:50.588
And I had never heard of the album
and I said. "Can you get me an album?"

1058
01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.088
And he couldn't even get me one.

1059
01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:55.012
I mean. that's how
obscure of a thing it was.

1060
01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:59.893
But he had all these photos and stuff.
with these giant crowds.

1061
01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:03.096
20.000 people.
like Woodstock or something.

1062
01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:04.772
Like. "Are you kidding me? That's you?"

1063
01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:09.102
<i>I thought it was Photoshopped
or something. I didn't believe him.</i>

1064
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.860
<i>But he had all these giant crowds
and he was quite content</i>

1065
01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:16.513
<i>to just go and sweep up people's lawns</i>

1066
01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:20.614
<i>or clean up and do manual labor.
He stayed.</i>

1067
01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:27.121
He lives a very. very. very modest life.

1068
01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:30.415
<i>Definitely.</i>

1069
01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.296
<i>There's definitely no excess.</i>

1070
01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:39.883
<i>and he definitely still works hard
in order to make ends meet.</i>

1071
01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:46.173
<i>And there's no glamour to his life
in that sense.</i>

1072
01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:49.046
<i>But he must be a rich man today?</i>

1073
01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:51.314
<i>No.</i>

1074
01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:55.318
<i>Rich in a lot of things
but perhaps not material things.</i>

1075
01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.741
<i>I guess it just never got to that.</i>

1076
01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.409
<i>But he's sold
hundreds of thousands of records</i>

1077
01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:00.987
<i>in South Africa.</i>

1078
01:19:01.086 --> 01:19:02.508
Well. yes.

1079
01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:07.289
But I believe there's a great deal
of perhaps bootlegging.

1080
01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.714
piracy. such like that. Perhaps...

1081
01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:15.176
Perhaps other people are rich.

1082
01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:17.779
<i>You know.
when I think about that night</i>

1083
01:20:17.871 --> 01:20:19.739
<i>when I spoke to Eva on the telephone.</i>

1084
01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:23.515
<i>we could not have imagined
how much our lives were gonna change</i>

1085
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.283
<i>after that phone call.</i>

1086
01:20:25.379 --> 01:20:27.281
<i>Eva came on tour with Rodriguez</i>

1087
01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.980
<i>and the organizers arranged
a chaperone bodyguard</i>

1088
01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:32.524
<i>to drive them around
and they fell in love.</i>

1089
01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.121
<i>And they have a child.</i>

1090
01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:38.797
<i>So Rodriguez has a South African
grandson. a South African grandchild.</i>

1091
01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:42.196
<i>For me. I used to be a jeweler
in Johannesburg.</i>

1092
01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:44.665
<i>I now live in Cape Town
and have a music store.</i>

1093
01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.761
<i>Things changed so much for us.</i>

1094
01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:50.163
<i>But. except for one person.
and that's Rodriguez.</i>

1095
01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.381
<i>For him. nothing has changed.</i>

1096
01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:56.003
<i>The life that he was living
is still the life that he's living now.</i>

1097
01:20:56.101 --> 01:21:00.222
<i>What he's demonstrated
very clearly is that you have a choice.</i>

1098
01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.388
<i>He took all that torment.
all that agony.</i>

1099
01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.512
<i>all that confusion and pain.</i>

1100
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.310
<i>and he transformed it
into something beautiful.</i>

1101
01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:11.287
He's like the silk worm. you know?

1102
01:21:11.383 --> 01:21:16.360
You take this raw material
and you transform it.

1103
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.959
And you come out with something
that wasn't there before.

1104
01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:21.506
Something beautiful.

1105
01:21:21.602 --> 01:21:25.348
Something perhaps transcendent.
Something perhaps eternal.

1106
01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.512
<i>Insofar as he does that.</i>

1107
01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:32.710
<i>I think he's representative
of the human spirit. of what's possible.</i>

1108
01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:36.380
<i>That you have a choice.
"And this has been my choice.</i>

1109
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.594
<i>"to give you Sugar Man."</i>

1110
01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:40.713
<i>Now. have you done that? Ask yourself.</i>
