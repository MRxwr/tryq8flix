Paddle faster. Go!
Kevin.

00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:39.748
Wait! Don't be such a wuss.
You're fine.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.608
Wow.
Good morning. guys.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.049
How are you?

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:14.949
Just keep talking to 'em.
Go.

00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.619
See? I knew they'd
be here to see us.

00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.821
Anyway. the weather is nice.
isn't it?

00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:22.026
Want to go swimming later?

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:26.394
- Aren't they awesome?
- Yeah.

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:28.799
Hey. hold still. little buddy. Let's
get you on camera. Come here.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:30.935
Come here.

00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:33.602
That's your favorite one.
right there.

00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:36.405
There you are.
I missed you so much.

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:38.540
You're such a cutie.

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:42.947
Let's go!

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.815
Holly. you're not even
gonna get your paddle?

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:48.086
Come on.

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.066
Race you.

00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:07.704
Be careful. Dad said.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.599
All right.
Time to switch cameras.

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.935
That footage.
though. was amazing.

00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:16.070
Are you gonna
be famous. Kev?

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:19.443
Nah. I just wanna make
real movies. you know?

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:22.776
Need a new camera.

00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:25.113
full editing suite.
sound equipment.

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:26.815
Don't give up. okay?

00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:30.618
Christmas is
only 158 days away.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.120
Yeah. only you
would know that.

00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:34.459
You gotta keep up
with the important stuff.

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:36.824
You're such a nerd.

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:38.860
And you are just jealous.

00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:40.094
Yeah. sure.

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.096
Not.

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:43.697
Look.
Seasalt's back.

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.867
Oh. hey. big guy.
How's the fishing today?

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:47.601
Not good. I guess.

00:05:47.603 --> 00:05:49.837
He's got that "I'm hungry"
look.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.706
And I'm starving. too.

00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:52.873
Ditto.

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:54.976
I'll get the fishing poles.
I'll get the stove ready.

00:05:54.978 --> 00:05:56.079
You fish. and I'll cook.

00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:06.156
Kevin!

00:06:07.057 --> 00:06:07.988
Yeah? Yeah. yeah.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.860
Look.

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:12.026
Probably a loggerhead.
Mm-hmm.

00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:15.163
I just hope they hatch while we're here.
I wanna film 'em.

00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:18.669
Well. it takes them
about 60 days to hatch.

00:06:19.302 --> 00:06:20.935
You read way too much.

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:24.072
Just depends
on the temperature.

00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:25.339
rain. "humididee."

00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.043
It's "humidity."

00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:30.178
That's what I said.
"humimidee."

00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:34.048
Hey. be careful.
You can't touch 'em.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.187
Duh. I know that.

00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:40.524
Loads of creatures around
like the taste of turtle eggs.

00:06:54.271 --> 00:06:56.738
We forgot to call Mom.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.009
Phone's in the kayak.

00:07:39.182 --> 00:07:42.384
This is the perfect spot.
Am I right. Charlie?

00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:44.188
Yes. sir.
Grade A. prime real estate.

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.187
Yeah. working on it.

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.690
He's old friends
with the owner.

00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:50.358
We are gonna
be in business.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.827
So break it to me.
Where do we stand?

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:54.361
The last 10 acres.

00:07:54.363 --> 00:07:56.664
How many acres you say?
Mom called. We gotta go.

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:57.432
Get down. Look.

00:07:57.434 --> 00:07:58.933
It's 100. I believe.

00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:00.168
- 102.
- Ah.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.070
I like exact.

00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:03.003
You stay here.

00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:04.007
Sure thing.

00:08:07.877 --> 00:08:09.877
Okay. are you 100 percent
sure this thing's covered?

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.980
This thing goes south...
I'm finished.

00:08:11.982 --> 00:08:14.048
You have my word on it.
Election's coming up.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.050
I can't afford any screw-ups.

00:08:16.052 --> 00:08:18.420
Get us that zoning permit. and
I'll take care of the rest.

00:08:18.422 --> 00:08:20.988
This deal just might
help you win reelection.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.193
You just remember this.
Mills.

00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:26.030
I go down.
you go down. too.

00:08:27.064 --> 00:08:28.296
Gotta run.

00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:30.264
Swanky lunch fund-raiser
for my campaign.

00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:32.467
Never keep hungry money waiting.
Don't laugh.

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.706
You have two weeks to close the deal
with those investors. or they walk.

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:37.974
It's done.
Don't worry about it.

00:08:41.244 --> 00:08:43.177
Get. um...
Get those blueprints

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.314
that fit all that EPA crap
on my desk ASAP.

00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:49.084
Sure thing. I'll have 'em drawn
up. by. say. Monday morning?

00:08:49.086 --> 00:08:50.421
Excellent. and. um...

00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:53.924
Let's keep this
quiet. okay?

00:08:56.393 --> 00:08:57.725
As a church mouse.

00:08:57.727 --> 00:08:59.026
What do you think
they're doing here?

00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:00.230
This is our cove.

00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:04.431
Don't know. but the man in the
suit sure looked familiar.

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:08.773
Mr. Mills.
Hmm?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.842
Uh. we got trouble.

00:09:14.878 --> 00:09:16.844
Hey. uh. you kids.
you want to come over here

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:18.249
and take a look
through the telescope?

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.320
I don't trust these guys. Let's book it.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

00:09:30.527 --> 00:09:32.296
Hey. Jimmy.
Yeah. it's me.

00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:34.931
We might have
a little problem.

00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:41.969
Go. go. go.

00:09:52.414 --> 00:09:54.148
That was a close one.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.386
Yeah. Wish I could have
filmed those guys.

00:09:57.153 --> 00:09:58.154
Something wasn't right.

00:09:59.822 --> 00:10:01.024
Over here. guys!

00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:07.829
I don't see
the dolphins.

00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:08.999
Must not
like it either.

00:10:12.101 --> 00:10:13.937
Yeah. let's just
head back home.

00:10:22.178 --> 00:10:25.012
Hey! Hey. man!
Hey. no-wake zone!

00:10:25.014 --> 00:10:25.979
What're you doing?

00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:28.148
Hey! Watch where you're going!

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.416
Make him stop. Kevin!
Make him stop!

00:10:29.418 --> 00:10:30.984
Holly. it's gonna be okay.
Just relax.

00:10:30.986 --> 00:10:31.889
Hey!

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.271
Holly.

00:10:48.238 --> 00:10:49.273
Holly?

00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:11.829
Holly!

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.843
Holly.

00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.978
Holly. you okay?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.246
You okay? Come on.

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:32.579
Come on. On the shore.

00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:36.150
Go ahead.

00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:40.054
Come on. Right here.
Just breathe. okay?

00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:41.089
Keep breathing.

00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:43.090
What a loser.

00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:45.895
I'm gonna call the Beach Harbor Patrol!
You're toast. bro!

00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:49.430
Thanks. Kev.

00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:51.232
I knew you'd save me.

00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:54.068
It's wasn't me.
It was them.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.570
They saved us.

00:11:55.572 --> 00:11:57.906
I'm gonna grab the kayak.
Wait here.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.091
Please tell me at least that
you were wearing your life jacket.

00:12:47.557 --> 00:12:48.993
No. sir.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.460
Kev. what if
you two had drowned?

00:12:53.462 --> 00:12:56.397
All right. we trust you to be
responsible and look after your sister.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.266
But... But the dolphins
saved us.

00:12:58.268 --> 00:13:00.501
Exactly. and it was all that crazy
guy in the speedboat's fault.

00:13:00.503 --> 00:13:02.436
Uh-uh. That's not
gonna cut it.

00:13:02.438 --> 00:13:04.738
I told you a thousand times.
you go on that water.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.010
you assume that
everyone's a nut-job.

00:13:07.977 --> 00:13:09.044
Could have lost my camera. too.

00:13:09.046 --> 00:13:11.612
You could have lost your life.
and your sister's.

00:13:11.614 --> 00:13:15.416
Now. you know the rules. Safety first.
Two weeks. no kayak.

00:13:15.418 --> 00:13:17.620
It wasn't our fault!
You want to make it three?

00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:22.357
Sorry. kiddos.
That's life.

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:24.261
There are consequences
for breaking rules.

00:13:25.327 --> 00:13:26.694
Speaking of rules. sweetie.

00:13:26.696 --> 00:13:29.397
what did we say about the
hat at the kitchen table?

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:31.565
Mm. you sure?

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:33.370
Oh. yeah. I'm sure.
Come on.

00:13:42.044 --> 00:13:44.080
All right. that's it.

00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:47.348
All right. frogs outside.
Kids to bed.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.717
- We're gonna take this up in the morning.
- Sorry. Dad.

00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:52.119
Love you.

00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:53.286
Love you.

00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:55.189
- Love you.
- Good night.

00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:56.791
I mean. what are we gonna
do with these two?

00:13:58.061 --> 00:13:59.493
I never acted like that.

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:01.628
Look. they're growing up.
It's just part of it.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.632
No. back in... back in my day and
age. we respected the rules.

00:14:05.634 --> 00:14:07.634
I mean. we knew the rules.
We practiced them.

00:14:07.636 --> 00:14:09.403
because practice makes...
Don't flinch!

00:14:09.405 --> 00:14:11.138
Ow! That's my bum shoulder.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.709
Obviously
your genes are dominant.

00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:17.078
What? Which is why
they're so good-looking.

00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:59.820
What's wrong? I've got
a really bad feeling.

00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:02.456
Yeah. It's probably Dad's
breakfast burritos. huh?

00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:04.459
No.

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.196
It's not a stomach-ache
bad feeling.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.336
They're in trouble.
I just know it.

00:15:14.604 --> 00:15:16.337
There's my queen.

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:18.708
How's it going?

00:15:20.076 --> 00:15:23.210
I was just thinking that maybe
I should skip summer semester.

00:15:23.212 --> 00:15:25.680
Um. I was talking
about the Ryan Express.

00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:27.748
Oh. yeah. Um...

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.150
Just the water pump.

00:15:29.152 --> 00:15:30.785
Oh. just the water pump.
No big...

00:15:30.787 --> 00:15:32.389
Anything else
on your mind?

00:15:33.222 --> 00:15:35.455
Well. I don't know.

00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:37.425
I mean. maybe I should spend
summer with the kids.

00:15:37.427 --> 00:15:39.826
you know.
keep an eye on them.

00:15:39.828 --> 00:15:43.699
Honey. what happened
yesterday is not your fault.

00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:46.700
Okay? And you
spent so much time.

00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:49.302
We gotta get
this master's degree done.

00:15:49.304 --> 00:15:51.873
What would
Coach Dunn say. huh?

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:54.175
You march all the way
down the field.

00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:55.276
if you don't score...

00:15:55.278 --> 00:15:56.877
I know. You'll never finish.
I know.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:00.448
That's right. And if you wanna
compete. you gotta complete.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.316
Look. well.
one semester won't hurt.

00:16:03.318 --> 00:16:06.286
All right. I can be with the
kids. maybe get a part-time job.

00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:07.454
Look. money's
been tight lately.

00:16:07.456 --> 00:16:10.193
and we got a lot of stuff
to take care of around here.

00:16:13.196 --> 00:16:14.264
Come here.

00:16:15.465 --> 00:16:16.531
I got this.

00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:18.166
Everything is
gonna be fine.

00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:20.600
In fact. I have a meeting
this morning with the boss.

00:16:20.602 --> 00:16:24.338
and I happen to know that he wants
to talk to me about the VP slot.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.272
Ooh.

00:16:25.274 --> 00:16:27.510
And you have a smudge
on your forehead.

00:16:29.445 --> 00:16:32.749
Perfect.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.352
The Captain would be
so proud of you.

00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:39.856
You think so?
Oh. I know so.

00:16:41.423 --> 00:16:43.259
I'll see you tonight.
Right.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.294
- Bye. kids!
- Bye.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:47.464
Listen to your mother.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.399
Looks like
we're stuck. Kev.

00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:01.677
I have an idea.

00:17:04.913 --> 00:17:07.480
You see what I mean. Mom? Mom...
Aw. come on.

00:17:07.482 --> 00:17:09.784
Look. Kev. your dad said
no ocean for two weeks.

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:12.219
I know. but we'll just go check things out.
No harm in that.

00:17:12.221 --> 00:17:14.921
Look. I'm sure the
dolphins are just fine.

00:17:14.923 --> 00:17:17.991
Mom. you know how sometimes you get
that feeling down in your belly?

00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:20.894
A really sad.
bad feeling?

00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:24.498
Sweetheart. what's the matter?
I've got that feeling.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.566
She's pretty good
about these things. Mom.

00:17:26.568 --> 00:17:28.704
I mean. in a strange
and weird way. but...

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.842
Well...

00:17:32.808 --> 00:17:34.475
I guess she could
use a test run.

00:17:34.477 --> 00:17:36.480
Yes.
Yeah.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.815
That sure
is a beauty. sir.

00:17:40.817 --> 00:17:41.849
This is it.
Wow.

00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:43.484
Tell you what. You. uh...

00:17:43.486 --> 00:17:45.419
You take your family out
anytime you want.

00:17:45.421 --> 00:17:46.519
Really?
Sure.

00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.759
Oh. they would love that.

00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:51.627
Have a seat.
Thank you. sir.

00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:55.932
Just look at it...

00:17:57.967 --> 00:17:59.866
the mystery. the power.

00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:02.705
Feel it?
Oh. Yeah.

00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:05.405
The ocean's a. uh...

00:18:05.407 --> 00:18:07.341
it's a mirror
of life. Ryan.

00:18:07.343 --> 00:18:09.309
It's always moving
and flowing.

00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:12.546
It's making its own path. just
like we make our own path.

00:18:12.548 --> 00:18:14.282
Mm. yes. sir.

00:18:14.284 --> 00:18:17.751
My wife's a bit more astute
about the water than I am.

00:18:17.753 --> 00:18:21.588
I married the daughter of a
fishing boat captain.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.361
It's... It's Abby. right? You say
she's finishing up her master's?

00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:27.827
Yeah. mechanical engineering.

00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:30.933
That's what I like about you. Bob.
I mean. you're a family man.

00:18:31.901 --> 00:18:33.467
You're a hard worker.
a competitor.

00:18:33.469 --> 00:18:35.369
Football man. right?
Yeah.

00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:37.771
All Gulf Conference. receiver
at North Central State.

00:18:37.773 --> 00:18:40.540
Oh. well...
Well. yeah.

00:18:40.542 --> 00:18:43.344
I. uh... I was
a baseball rat myself.

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:47.347
played a year of semi-pro until I blew
out my left knee sliding to third.

00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:49.083
It's funny. You know.
it still aches sometimes.

00:18:49.085 --> 00:18:54.755
Oh. I feel you. I mean.
both my knees are squinky.

00:18:54.757 --> 00:18:56.657
You know the greatest thing
about sports?

00:18:56.659 --> 00:18:58.793
Teaches you not only
how to win.

00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:00.694
but that the team
comes first.

00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:02.896
That's so funny
that you say that.

00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:05.466
My old coach. Dunn.
that was his motto.

00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:09.339
- "Team first. men. always."
- That is a smart man.

00:19:10.472 --> 00:19:11.838
Why don't we take her out?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.343
I wanna...
I wanna show you something.

00:19:45.508 --> 00:19:47.507
This is where we hang out.
Pretty sweet. huh?

00:19:47.509 --> 00:19:49.546
Yeah. Hasn't changed
since I was a kid.

00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:52.680
Your granddad
used to bring me here.

00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:56.851
- I caught my first yellowtail right over there.
- Cool.

00:19:56.853 --> 00:19:59.556
Yeah. I'm cooler than you thought. huh?

00:20:02.657 --> 00:20:03.690
Look!
There they are!

00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:09.700
See?
That's them.

00:20:10.767 --> 00:20:13.670
Yeah. you're right.
Really beautiful.

00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:20.141
There's only four.
Where is he. Kevin?

00:20:20.143 --> 00:20:21.776
Who?

00:20:21.778 --> 00:20:23.477
Holly's favorite.

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.115
He's not here.

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:30.453
Come here. little buddy.
Where are you? Come here.

00:20:30.952 --> 00:20:32.519
Where are you?

00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:34.455
I knew he was lost.

00:20:34.457 --> 00:20:37.056
Uh. I'm sure he's fine.
He'll be back soon.

00:20:37.058 --> 00:20:39.794
What are we gonna do? Just let
us come back tomorrow. Mom. okay?

00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:42.563
We'll wear our life jackets. We'll sign in.
I promise. We'll do anything.

00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:45.699
We'll talk to your dad
about that. okay?

00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:47.804
We'll head home down the
coast. and see if we spot him.

00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.739
Where are you.
little buddy? Come on.

00:20:52.741 --> 00:20:54.043
Where are ya?

00:21:23.172 --> 00:21:25.541
I brought you out here
for a reason. Ryan.

00:21:27.576 --> 00:21:29.977
You know. Mr. Mills.
I just. uh...

00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:32.645
I got a couple of questions
about this project.

00:21:32.647 --> 00:21:34.815
Could you. um. just cut
the formalities. Bob.

00:21:34.817 --> 00:21:36.749
and call me Winston?
Uh. yes. sir.

00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:38.084
Winston.

00:21:38.086 --> 00:21:41.755
So. uh. I've been waiting on the
final paperwork from Legal.

00:21:41.757 --> 00:21:44.257
and the attorneys have been
more tight-lipped about this

00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:46.026
than anything
I've ever seen.

00:21:46.028 --> 00:21:48.094
Yeah. well. I kind of
wanted it that way.

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:50.264
'cause I'm dealing with some
heavy financial hitters.

00:21:50.266 --> 00:21:53.534
and they requested
total confidentiality.

00:21:53.536 --> 00:21:55.172
That's why I brought you
out here myself.

00:21:56.137 --> 00:21:57.872
See it? It's 102 acres

00:21:57.874 --> 00:22:00.574
of prime ocean-front
real estate.

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:02.709
This is our little secret.

00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:05.112
Deal is we're building an
aquatic-themed ocean park.

00:22:05.114 --> 00:22:07.113
Oh. that's good. My kids
are gonna love the idea.

00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:09.249
They're on the water out in
these parts all the time.

00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:11.584
They're gonna be so excited.
Oh.

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:14.188
- When's the big announcement?
- Well. that's the one hiccup.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.191
There's one piece of land right in the middle
of the property that we haven't secured yet.

00:22:18.193 --> 00:22:20.596
The owner's been
a stickler at selling.

00:22:21.297 --> 00:22:23.663
so. uh. clock's ticking.

00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:27.535
We got less than two weeks to lock
up the deal. or my investors walk.

00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:28.635
Who's the holdout?

00:22:28.637 --> 00:22:32.006
It's. um. some ex-NFL player.
He's...

00:22:32.008 --> 00:22:34.744
Grew up around here.
His name's Luke Lawson.

00:22:36.546 --> 00:22:38.481
Luke Lawson?
Yeah.

00:22:39.548 --> 00:22:42.115
That was
my college quarterback.

00:22:42.117 --> 00:22:43.284
What?
Yeah.

00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:46.286
We were roommates
all of senior year.

00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:49.289
You gotta be kidding.
What a small world. Yeah.

00:22:49.291 --> 00:22:50.757
Do you... Do you think...

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:52.625
I don't know... maybe
you could talk to him?

00:22:52.627 --> 00:22:55.028
Well. yeah. I tell you what.
You take the lead on this.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.698
Make him an offer
he can't refuse.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.700
Luke. I mean. we haven't been
in touch in recent years.

00:23:00.702 --> 00:23:02.672
but I can...
I can certainly try.

00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:04.738
Just at least
think it over.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.074
I mean. it's. uh...

00:23:07.076 --> 00:23:10.878
You know. we lose this piece
of land. the deal goes away.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.750
You know. and I promise you. you
will be rewarded handsomely.

00:23:42.278 --> 00:23:44.010
Izzy speaking French again?

00:23:44.012 --> 00:23:46.646
Yep. He thinks he's European.

00:23:49.151 --> 00:23:52.251
Mom. Izzy wants
a new aquarium.

00:23:52.253 --> 00:23:54.054
Oh. he does. does he?

00:23:54.056 --> 00:23:57.357
Well. I think Monsieur Izzy
is being a little too greedy.

00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:00.059
Did you know that there are
over 40 species of dolphins.

00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:02.962
and some stay with their mama
until they're eight years old?

00:24:02.964 --> 00:24:08.768
No. I didn't know that. but it
doesn't surprise me that you do.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.805
Maybe saying a prayer for your little
friend might be a good idea. too.

00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:14.240
I already did.
Said two. just in case.

00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:17.813
But what about tomorrow?
Can we go look for him?

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.648
I'll talk to your dad
when he gets home.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.414
Okay?

00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:22.749
We'll figure something out.

00:24:22.751 --> 00:24:23.886
Okay.
Right.

00:24:25.253 --> 00:24:27.156
Good night.
Good night. Mommy.

00:24:32.294 --> 00:24:34.130
Come on. Come on.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.297
Where you at? Come on.

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:39.799
Ah. bingo. Bingo.

00:24:39.801 --> 00:24:42.335
All right.

00:24:42.337 --> 00:24:44.074
Hang in there. little buddy.

00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:18.207
Whoo! I'm late.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.708
Morning. darling.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.877
Morning.

00:25:23.112 --> 00:25:25.849
So did you think about what
we talked about last night?

00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:27.715
I mean.
the kids. they're...

00:25:27.717 --> 00:25:29.382
they're really worried
about that dolphin.

00:25:29.384 --> 00:25:31.384
Abby. I don't get it.

00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:34.388
It's a dolphin. What are you
gonna do. put an APB out on it?

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.093
No. I mean. it's just good that they care
about the ocean. the animals. you know?

00:25:39.095 --> 00:25:41.730
Of course. The Captain
taught you well.

00:25:43.898 --> 00:25:45.998
The most beautiful boat
mechanic in all the world.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.236
And I still say no
on the kayak. all right?

00:25:49.238 --> 00:25:51.471
Um. I'm gonna try
and come home early tonight

00:25:51.473 --> 00:25:53.742
so maybe we could
throw the football around.

00:25:55.944 --> 00:25:58.378
So? So?
So?

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.346
Are we out of jail?

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:02.815
So that's why
I haven't seen you two?

00:26:02.817 --> 00:26:05.754
- Mm-hmm.
- Sneaky little boogers.

00:26:06.422 --> 00:26:07.955
So he still
says no kayaks.

00:26:07.957 --> 00:26:09.823
and I can't
take you out today.

00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:12.162
Promised Ms. Peters I'd look at her
freezer. It's on the fritz again.

00:26:12.894 --> 00:26:14.294
Bummer.

00:26:14.296 --> 00:26:15.996
Sorry. kiddos.

00:26:15.998 --> 00:26:18.931
I mean. your dad says
we can put out an APB.

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:22.469
- What's an APB?
- Just kidding. sweetheart. Bad joke.

00:26:22.471 --> 00:26:25.873
It's "all points bulletin."
Police use it to find bad guys.

00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:27.810
Yeah. or missing persons.

00:26:29.878 --> 00:26:31.411
- Is this your dolphin?
- Yeah.

00:26:31.413 --> 00:26:32.946
Can you make
more of these?

00:26:32.948 --> 00:26:34.784
Sure. Why?

00:26:35.483 --> 00:26:36.449
Make 50 copies.

00:26:36.451 --> 00:26:39.253
Oh. and add the word
"missing" at the top.

00:26:39.255 --> 00:26:40.853
Missing?

00:26:40.855 --> 00:26:42.826
And your phone number
at the bottom.

00:26:43.325 --> 00:26:44.557
But why the pho...

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:47.427
I get it.
A real APB. Okay.

00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:49.365
Good job. Mom.

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:03.276
I. um. need your
signature on this.

00:27:03.278 --> 00:27:05.077
Okay.
Thanks.

00:27:05.079 --> 00:27:06.513
Just initial at the
bottom of page one.

00:27:06.515 --> 00:27:08.582
and then sign
the second page for me.

00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:11.285
Great. Want to tell me
what I'm signing?

00:27:11.287 --> 00:27:14.090
Oh. it's just
a standard NDA.

00:27:14.957 --> 00:27:16.390
Sandy...
Mm-hmm?

00:27:16.392 --> 00:27:18.424
I haven't signed
a nondisclosure

00:27:18.426 --> 00:27:20.994
on any project
since I've been here.

00:27:20.996 --> 00:27:24.030
Well. this deal's being structured
a little bit differently.

00:27:24.032 --> 00:27:27.867
and there's several
private parties involved.

00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:29.937
and it's just
what Winston wants. so...

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:30.974
Right.

00:27:32.208 --> 00:27:35.074
Uh. Winston was wondering if
you reached out to Mr. Lawson

00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:36.910
about that land.

00:27:36.912 --> 00:27:39.212
No. but. um...

00:27:39.214 --> 00:27:41.280
but I'm gonna be
right on that.

00:27:41.282 --> 00:27:44.086
Okay. good. 'cause. uh.
Winston was asking.

00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:48.354
And just so you know.
by the way. um.

00:27:48.356 --> 00:27:52.359
the word around the office is that
you're up for Jack's old position. so...

00:27:52.361 --> 00:27:56.028
I'm just saying. VP would look nice
on that trophy case back there.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.265
Yes.
Yeah.

00:27:58.267 --> 00:27:59.568
Yes. it would.

00:28:56.392 --> 00:28:58.193
Done.
This is the last one.

00:28:58.626 --> 00:29:00.427
All righty.

00:29:00.429 --> 00:29:01.694
It's been a long day.

00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:03.663
Uh-huh. Do you
think we'll find him?

00:29:03.665 --> 00:29:05.364
I don't know.

00:29:05.366 --> 00:29:06.501
We will.

00:29:10.338 --> 00:29:11.604
Hey. Digger. Hey. Mikey.

00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:13.507
Oh. hey. Kevin. What
are you two up to?

00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:15.308
APB on a missing dolphin.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.678
That's crazy. How could you
just lose a dolphin?

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.478
It's a big ocean.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.115
This is a good picture. Are you
guys. uh. still doing that movie?

00:29:23.117 --> 00:29:24.284
Yeah.
It's a documentary.

00:29:24.286 --> 00:29:25.584
Have you seen him?

00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:27.453
He's about this big.

00:29:27.455 --> 00:29:29.623
I've seen a lot
of dolphins today.

00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:33.226
- Yeah. one almost jumped in our boat.
- More than any fish did.

00:29:33.228 --> 00:29:34.561
That's for sure.

00:29:34.563 --> 00:29:36.363
You know. we saw the.
uh. Marineland truck

00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:38.632
loading something up about
a half-mile up the beach.

00:29:38.634 --> 00:29:40.566
I mean. what do you think?

00:29:40.568 --> 00:29:43.370
Yeah. it was a pretty good size.
Could have been a dolphin.

00:29:43.372 --> 00:29:44.638
It's him!
I just know it is!

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.539
Okay. Thanks. Digger!
Thanks. Mikey!

00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:48.374
Yeah. uh. good-bye.
Good luck.

00:29:48.376 --> 00:29:49.544
No problem.

00:30:06.528 --> 00:30:08.027
Hello! Hello!

00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:09.528
Help!
Please let us in!

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.097
Sorry. We're closed
for the day.

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:12.565
Opens at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:16.004
You gotta let us in!
You've got our dolphin!

00:30:20.642 --> 00:30:22.709
And this is
our entire facility.

00:30:22.711 --> 00:30:24.344
We have 16 dolphins.

00:30:24.346 --> 00:30:26.680
Oh. and be careful around
the edge of the pool.

00:30:26.682 --> 00:30:28.681
The dolphin we rescued
is over here.

00:30:28.683 --> 00:30:30.417
Oh. see?
He's got a bad sunburn.

00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:33.019
Must have been
beached for hours.

00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:35.154
I didn't know dolphins
got sunburned.

00:30:35.156 --> 00:30:37.092
Well. look at that.
I'm putting that on tape.

00:30:38.124 --> 00:30:38.528
The nerd doesn't
know everything.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:41.728
Yeah. they're a lot
like us in many ways.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.529
So what's gonna
happen to him?

00:30:43.531 --> 00:30:48.035
Uh. we'll keep him here under
quarantine and evaluate his progress.

00:30:48.037 --> 00:30:49.369
When can he
go back home?

00:30:49.371 --> 00:30:52.506
I don't know. That's if
we can even find his pod.

00:30:52.508 --> 00:30:55.574
We know where his family is.
How do you know that?

00:30:55.576 --> 00:30:57.346
They're our friends.
We swim with them.

00:30:58.747 --> 00:31:00.747
Oh. no. that's not good.

00:31:00.749 --> 00:31:02.114
Why not?

00:31:02.116 --> 00:31:05.786
Well. even though dolphins seem
to love interacting with humans.

00:31:05.788 --> 00:31:07.054
they are wild animals.

00:31:07.056 --> 00:31:08.488
They're protected by laws.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.357
If we can release him. you
can't swim with him again.

00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:12.726
Okay?

00:31:12.728 --> 00:31:15.261
They aren't pets.
Promise?

00:31:15.263 --> 00:31:17.264
- Promise.
- Promise.

00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:19.565
I just wish I knew
how he got stranded.

00:31:19.567 --> 00:31:20.834
It was this crazy
boat driver.

00:31:20.836 --> 00:31:22.401
He even flipped over
our kayak.

00:31:22.403 --> 00:31:24.371
Hmm. That makes sense.

00:31:24.373 --> 00:31:27.173
Probably got disoriented
and separated from his family.

00:31:27.175 --> 00:31:29.543
Boats. litter. pollution.

00:31:29.545 --> 00:31:32.778
many reasons we need to be more
responsible for our oceans.

00:31:35.084 --> 00:31:36.315
It's Mom.

00:31:36.317 --> 00:31:37.686
We're late again.

00:31:39.121 --> 00:31:41.124
I knew it.
He's glad we're here.

00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:44.458
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Uh...

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.328
Okay. I guess.

00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:50.630
Looks like someone
has a best friend.

00:31:57.205 --> 00:31:59.305
- They're on their way.
- Oh. fantastic.

00:31:59.307 --> 00:32:02.342
You know. I left work early just to
have a little Ryan fam bam time.

00:32:02.344 --> 00:32:04.344
I shouldn't have said
anything about the football.

00:32:04.346 --> 00:32:05.548
Maybe.

00:32:06.682 --> 00:32:08.317
You think I was
too tough on 'em?

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.086
Perhaps.

00:32:12.453 --> 00:32:14.488
That's very nice.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.289
We're gonna get you a tryout with Miami.

00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:20.262
I just want what's
best for us. you know?

00:32:21.497 --> 00:32:23.666
I'm gonna give them
everything that I never had.

00:32:25.267 --> 00:32:28.634
Abby. I really think that Winston's
gonna give me this VP slot.

00:32:28.636 --> 00:32:31.073
That'd be sweet.

00:32:32.307 --> 00:32:33.507
I mean.
I knew you'd get it!

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:35.741
- I said. "Might." What are you...
- Whoo!

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:40.881
I am so proud of you.
Robert Ray Ryan.

00:32:40.883 --> 00:32:42.815
Nobody works
harder than you.

00:32:42.817 --> 00:32:45.317
I said. "Might."
He picked the right man.

00:32:45.319 --> 00:32:47.853
Boy. well. let's hope.

00:32:47.855 --> 00:32:49.826
Oh. brother. Really. guys?
Out in the open?

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:52.191
Guess what!
We found him!

00:32:52.193 --> 00:32:53.860
Yeah. We found him.

00:32:53.862 --> 00:32:56.666
That's amazing. Yes!
Come here.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.934
So
what's gonna happen to him?

00:33:01.936 --> 00:33:05.171
Uh. we'll keep him here under
quarantine and evaluate his progress.

00:33:05.173 --> 00:33:07.407
Isn't he the
coolest dolphin ever. Mom?

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:10.544
Pretty cool. Handsome
fella. for sure.

00:33:10.546 --> 00:33:12.711
Yeah. I could edit this footage.
post it on the Internet.

00:33:12.713 --> 00:33:14.483
and let everybody
know we found him.

00:33:15.349 --> 00:33:18.584
So as I was saying.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:19.920
if your old man
gets this promotion.

00:33:19.922 --> 00:33:22.655
it could be a really. really
big deal for the whole family.

00:33:22.657 --> 00:33:24.824
That's awesome. That's awesome.
Yeah. cool.

00:33:24.826 --> 00:33:27.561
Mom. he's got
a spot on his back.

00:33:27.563 --> 00:33:30.363
Did you know dolphins
got sunburnt?

00:33:30.365 --> 00:33:33.199
All right. I can
shoot some more tomorrow.

00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:36.670
We can make a "save the dolphin" video.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:40.507
Ooh. ooh! What I have to tell you
has to do with the dolphins. huh?

00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:42.976
Really?
Oh. now you're interested.

00:33:42.978 --> 00:33:44.643
How would
you kids feel

00:33:44.645 --> 00:33:48.347
about an ocean-themed
marine park. huh?

00:33:48.349 --> 00:33:52.621
A marine park where your father can get
as many family passes as he wants?

00:33:53.521 --> 00:33:55.721
A marine park?
Mm-hmm.

00:33:55.723 --> 00:33:56.789
With sea animals?

00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:58.691
With sea animals
and lots of rides.

00:33:58.693 --> 00:34:01.260
an ocean park.
and it'd be really cool.

00:34:01.262 --> 00:34:04.597
because it'll educate people
about the sea animals.

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:07.433
and it will stimulate
the local economy.

00:34:07.435 --> 00:34:09.469
What do you think
about that. huh?

00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:11.306
Win-win for everyone.

00:34:18.012 --> 00:34:19.912
You done?

00:34:19.914 --> 00:34:21.449
Almost.

00:34:22.384 --> 00:34:24.554
I don't like
that marine park idea.

00:34:25.653 --> 00:34:28.224
Yeah. I wish Dad wasn't
so excited about it.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.693
All right.

00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:34.362
Exporting.

00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:36.896
I'm kind of nervous
about this.

00:34:36.898 --> 00:34:39.833
I've never posted any of
my stuff online before.

00:34:39.835 --> 00:34:41.603
It's gonna be great. Kev.

00:34:42.403 --> 00:34:44.507
Yeah. Yeah.

00:34:45.873 --> 00:34:47.773
So nothing out
of the ordinary?

00:34:47.775 --> 00:34:50.043
No one snooping
around the property?

00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:52.746
No. sir. not today.

00:34:52.748 --> 00:34:55.483
I found a few more nests.
removed 'em.

00:34:57.052 --> 00:35:00.356
Good. Get 'em all.

00:35:01.289 --> 00:35:03.226
I do have something for you.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.298
Yeah. that looks like them.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.636
I found a campsite
set up near the cove.

00:35:16.003 --> 00:35:17.804
And?

00:35:17.806 --> 00:35:21.744
I made it pretty clear the
area can be very dangerous.

00:35:23.577 --> 00:35:27.416
You know. I. uh. can't have
any kids getting hurt.

00:35:29.016 --> 00:35:31.486
Who said anything
about them being hurt?

00:35:39.695 --> 00:35:43.095
What are you doing to him?
Working on that sunburn.

00:35:43.097 --> 00:35:45.331
Good news is his blood work
came back good.

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.333
so we'll keep him here
under quarantine

00:35:47.335 --> 00:35:48.770
to monitor his progress.

00:35:49.503 --> 00:35:51.403
What happens then?

00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:54.740
Well. we'd like
to find his pod.

00:35:54.742 --> 00:35:56.443
This is a rare case
for Marineland.

00:35:56.445 --> 00:35:59.012
We aren't a rescue
and rehab facility.

00:35:59.014 --> 00:36:01.514
Our animals can't be
released back into the wild.

00:36:01.516 --> 00:36:03.416
They couldn't survive
without our care.

00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:05.552
We'll help you for free.

00:36:07.121 --> 00:36:09.456
We are definitely short-staffed
with the new budget cuts.

00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:11.990
so I might just take you up
on that offer.

00:36:11.992 --> 00:36:14.394
Oh. All our other
dolphins have names.

00:36:14.396 --> 00:36:15.662
Does he have one?

00:36:15.664 --> 00:36:17.496
Well. hmm.

00:36:18.766 --> 00:36:20.766
Since he has
a big sunburn.

00:36:20.768 --> 00:36:21.903
how about...

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.702
Bernie?

00:36:23.704 --> 00:36:26.409
I love it.
It's perfect.

00:36:27.576 --> 00:36:29.512
You know what?
I have an idea.

00:36:32.914 --> 00:36:34.581
Interesting.

00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:35.882
This could help us.

00:36:35.884 --> 00:36:39.088
Uh. Kevin. can you record
his responses?

00:36:40.588 --> 00:36:42.121
Think you guys
could find his pod.

00:36:42.123 --> 00:36:43.722
play them Bernie's replies?

00:36:43.724 --> 00:36:45.594
Sure. and we could...

00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:49.662
We can't. We're grounded.
We can't be in the water.

00:36:49.664 --> 00:36:51.634
Yeah. right. Oops.

00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:53.766
I'll call your mom.

00:36:53.768 --> 00:36:55.168
I'll see what
I can do to help.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.604
Oh. but no swimming
with them. Promise?

00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:00.407
Pinky swear.

00:37:05.646 --> 00:37:07.016
Oh. Bernie.

00:37:09.684 --> 00:37:11.954
I don't see
the dolphins.

00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:15.789
Maybe they're not here.

00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:19.525
No. they'll be here.
They won't leave Bernie.

00:37:19.527 --> 00:37:21.528
It's like you're part dolphin
or something.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.662
What's wrong with that?

00:37:22.664 --> 00:37:25.697
Nothing. I'm just saying.

00:37:26.768 --> 00:37:29.001
- Look! There they are!
- Oh. sweet.

00:37:29.003 --> 00:37:31.406
Play his video.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:35.810
It's working.
Look. Look at 'em.

00:37:36.177 --> 00:37:37.177
Yes.

00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:38.780
Awesome.

00:37:56.063 --> 00:37:57.229
This was good.

00:37:57.231 --> 00:37:59.833
Cool. We got some
awesome footage today.

00:37:59.835 --> 00:38:01.503
I'll edit it later.

00:38:02.603 --> 00:38:04.137
Let's call it.
"Bernie's Journey."

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:06.873
Cool. Let's go get
some shots of the cove.

00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:08.508
There's always something
going on there.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.546
All right. Let's do it.

00:38:13.514 --> 00:38:15.514
Yeah. I'll go ahead
and edit that part out.

00:38:15.516 --> 00:38:16.648
Hey!

00:38:20.255 --> 00:38:21.856
What's all this?

00:38:22.657 --> 00:38:25.191
No trees passing?

00:38:25.193 --> 00:38:26.796
It's "trespassing."

00:38:27.195 --> 00:38:28.862
No bueno.

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:33.867
I got all the city
board members convinced.

00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:36.068
Our final zoning vote
is this week.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.141
It will pass unanimously.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:45.043
You gonna stand there staring.
or tell me where we stand?

00:38:45.045 --> 00:38:46.579
It's them again.

00:38:46.581 --> 00:38:48.584
It just needs
a working...

00:38:49.818 --> 00:38:51.120
I'm gonna get 'em
this time.

00:38:53.788 --> 00:38:55.722
Just need the last 10 acres.

00:38:55.724 --> 00:38:57.923
But Bob Ryan's working on it.
He's old friends with the owner.

00:38:57.925 --> 00:38:59.726
But...
Shh! Shh!

00:38:59.728 --> 00:39:01.193
- Well. it better work.
- Quiet.

00:39:01.195 --> 00:39:04.030
We're in way too deep
for this thing to be exposed.

00:39:04.032 --> 00:39:05.898
Don't worry. Mayor.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.867
Within 18 months.

00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:09.869
we are gonna
be in business.

00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:11.970
If this thing all goes as
planned. might just catapult you

00:39:11.972 --> 00:39:14.206
into a run for
the governorship.

00:39:14.208 --> 00:39:16.108
Governor Brock Winters.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.712
That does have
a nice ring to it.

00:39:21.983 --> 00:39:23.316
Got 'em. Mr. Mills.

00:39:23.318 --> 00:39:24.050
Look. That one.

00:39:24.052 --> 00:39:26.920
Shh. Shh.
The speedboat guy.

00:39:26.922 --> 00:39:28.854
You sure that's
all of it. Jimmy?

00:39:28.856 --> 00:39:31.693
Yes. sir.
It's all I could find.

00:39:32.927 --> 00:39:33.996
What do I do with 'em?

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.863
Just get it
far away from here.

00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:40.333
Those crazy environmental
nuts see those eggs.

00:39:40.335 --> 00:39:41.333
it'll cost us
millions in fines.

00:39:41.335 --> 00:39:43.869
Hey. why don't you
just take 'em home. Mills?

00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:46.572
Show 'em to your kids.
They might hatch.

00:39:46.574 --> 00:39:51.744
Hey. what do you think about
buying that fish hospital?

00:39:51.746 --> 00:39:53.579
Fish hospital?
Yeah.

00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:55.347
What. are you talking
about the marine habitat?

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:59.619
Yeah. I guess they found
some sunburned dolphin.

00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:02.988
With the right press coverage. we could
turn it into a moneymaker. you know?

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.791
Slimy fish gets new home. and
then you and I look like heroes.

00:40:05.793 --> 00:40:06.592
Hey. Hey. hey.

00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:08.230
I like
the sound of that.

00:40:09.264 --> 00:40:11.764
Bernie's not a fish!
He's a mammal!

00:40:11.766 --> 00:40:14.601
And we're gonna put him back in
the ocean when he feels better.

00:40:14.603 --> 00:40:17.869
- It's time to go. Come on.
- And you guys are going to jail for taking those turtle eggs!

00:40:17.871 --> 00:40:20.907
Now you just hold on
a second. okay?

00:40:20.909 --> 00:40:22.374
No one's going to jail.

00:40:22.376 --> 00:40:24.276
I'm the mayor.
You've seen me on television.

00:40:24.278 --> 00:40:27.313
There's nothing
to worry about.

00:40:27.315 --> 00:40:30.249
Listen. I don't need
any problems. okay?

00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:33.820
Don't worry. Mr. Mayor.
There are no problems here.

00:40:33.822 --> 00:40:35.354
Besides. these two
are trespassing.

00:40:35.356 --> 00:40:37.255
- That's my camera! What are you doing?
- Yeah. yeah.

00:40:37.257 --> 00:40:41.327
And this is my property. and you...
Aren't you Bob Ryan's kids?

00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:43.128
Yeah. and we're gonna
tell our dad everything!

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.831
No. you're not gonna tell
your dad anything.

00:40:44.833 --> 00:40:48.133
because if you do.
I'll fire him.

00:40:48.135 --> 00:40:52.037
And. uh... Where's
your proof now. right?

00:40:52.039 --> 00:40:55.874
Tell you what. Why don't you both get out
of here before I have you both arrested!

00:40:55.876 --> 00:40:57.679
Come on!
Go. go. go!

00:40:58.646 --> 00:41:00.380
Not good. Mills.

00:41:00.382 --> 00:41:02.280
Need to lock this up.

00:41:02.282 --> 00:41:04.953
I'll take care of it. okay?
Get rid of that.

00:41:07.222 --> 00:41:08.757
I'll take care of it.

00:41:14.396 --> 00:41:15.894
How long has it been.
10 years?

00:41:15.896 --> 00:41:17.130
Longer.
Since your wedding.

00:41:17.132 --> 00:41:18.930
No. has it been that long? Yeah.

00:41:18.932 --> 00:41:20.133
Oh. man.

00:41:20.135 --> 00:41:21.668
Time flies.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.269
I gotta admit
I was a little jealous

00:41:23.271 --> 00:41:25.972
I wasn't the one catching
all those touchdowns.

00:41:25.974 --> 00:41:27.206
Hey. I just got lucky.

00:41:27.208 --> 00:41:30.075
Besides. you made me look
good. helped me get drafted.

00:41:30.077 --> 00:41:32.378
Oh.
Yeah. right.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.845
Big Gun Law.

00:41:33.847 --> 00:41:35.815
You just had that
touch. you know?

00:41:35.817 --> 00:41:38.217
Always hit us
right in the numbers.

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:39.887
Hey. sorry
I lost touch. R.R.

00:41:41.088 --> 00:41:43.423
Bouncing around the league
for 13 seasons.

00:41:43.425 --> 00:41:44.856
then wrecking my shoulder.

00:41:44.858 --> 00:41:46.258
One day. you're on
the field playing.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.398
The next day. you realize.
never play again.

00:41:51.632 --> 00:41:53.166
I wouldn't be
complaining too much.

00:41:53.168 --> 00:41:54.867
It looks like
you're doing all right.

00:41:54.869 --> 00:41:56.302
I mean.
what would Coach say?

00:41:56.304 --> 00:41:57.737
"It's not how you start.

00:41:57.739 --> 00:41:59.137
It's how you finish.
dang it. Lawson."

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.840
Oh. you sound just like him now.

00:42:01.842 --> 00:42:03.842
Doosh.
Enough about me.

00:42:03.844 --> 00:42:06.813
What's going on with you. Abby? I
hear you got two kids now. right?

00:42:06.815 --> 00:42:08.347
I mean. Abby's great.

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:09.949
She's getting her master's.

00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:12.385
Kevin's 11. Holly's 9.

00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:14.887
They're both geniuses
like their mom.

00:42:14.889 --> 00:42:18.291
though. uh. Kevin's not
so much into football.

00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:20.059
Can't even get him
to play catch with me.

00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:23.798
Ah. give him time. Probably
late bloomers. like you.

00:42:25.365 --> 00:42:27.201
So glad you found me. R.R.

00:42:29.003 --> 00:42:32.405
So you mentioned my property
on the phone earlier.

00:42:32.407 --> 00:42:36.208
I had a real-estate firm try to buy
it from me a couple months back.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.376
but don't much like
the guy I talked to. though.

00:42:38.378 --> 00:42:41.847
Yeah. right. That's. uh. Winston Mills.
That's my boss.

00:42:41.849 --> 00:42:46.385
Hmm. I don't know. R.R. He just
seemed a little too slick for me.

00:42:46.387 --> 00:42:49.421
Look. I think the deal
could be good for you.

00:42:49.423 --> 00:42:51.224
It's definitely
a positive for the city.

00:42:51.226 --> 00:42:53.959
but the last thing I'm here
to do is hard-sell you.

00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:55.295
I'm gonna
show you the plans

00:42:55.297 --> 00:43:00.166
- after I... finish kicking your butt right now.
- Tell you what.

00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:03.405
You sink that next bag.
you got yourself a deal.

00:43:04.204 --> 00:43:06.139
Sure you wanna do that?

00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:08.106
Why not?
Like old times. right?

00:43:08.108 --> 00:43:09.944
Wow.

00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:11.746
Fine.

00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:21.320
Ooh! Ooh!

00:43:21.322 --> 00:43:23.057
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.394
Why didn't you tell them off? You
could have helped me. you know?

00:44:01.396 --> 00:44:03.766
We just ran like
little scaredy-cats.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.037
You're right. Giving all
this stuff away. What?

00:44:10.038 --> 00:44:11.539
I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

00:44:13.106 --> 00:44:15.106
I'm done.

00:44:15.108 --> 00:44:17.142
So what. are you
just gonna give up?

00:44:17.144 --> 00:44:19.380
No camera. no more films.

00:44:20.347 --> 00:44:22.514
When did you
become such a baby?

00:44:22.516 --> 00:44:24.316
We just need to get
your camera back.

00:44:24.318 --> 00:44:26.952
That footage
could save Bernie

00:44:26.954 --> 00:44:29.391
and put those bad guys
in jail.

00:44:31.525 --> 00:44:34.059
The camera's gone.
and they're not our pets.

00:44:34.061 --> 00:44:35.427
All right? We caused this.

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:38.866
You're right. They're not our
pets. but they are our friends.

00:44:51.346 --> 00:44:55.483
He's so fast.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.885
Go. Bernie! Go!

00:45:01.356 --> 00:45:03.322
Wow. He looks great.

00:45:03.324 --> 00:45:07.829
Yeah. We should be able to
release him soon. Cool. huh?

00:45:09.429 --> 00:45:11.329
Hey. little buddy.

00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:14.432
Here.

00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:31.052
Yay! Wow. look at him go.
He sure is happy.

00:45:32.052 --> 00:45:34.589
Bernie's video
has over 10.000 views.

00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:39.458
Hey. what's the matter. kiddo?

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.128
Your footage is a hit. You
should be doing cartwheels.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.362
That's what I told him.
Be happy. like Bernie.

00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:49.267
Hey. so what's the deal?
Where's your camera?

00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:55.043
All right. somebody
better start talking.

00:45:57.711 --> 00:46:00.012
Okay. I'll just call your mom.

00:46:00.014 --> 00:46:01.313
No. no. no.
No. don't. No.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.516
Yeah. I can't help you
if I don't know how.

00:46:04.518 --> 00:46:07.253
There's nothing
anybody can do right now.

00:46:07.255 --> 00:46:10.222
Our dad's boss and
the mayor. they're trying to...

00:46:10.224 --> 00:46:13.159
- Stop! Stop it! Stop it. Holly. right now.
- We need help. Kevin.

00:46:13.161 --> 00:46:15.264
You pinky promise
you won't tell?

00:46:17.398 --> 00:46:19.465
Well. yes.
I'm very interested.

00:46:19.467 --> 00:46:22.300
So it is for sale. then?
Then let's do it.

00:46:22.302 --> 00:46:24.336
All right. make...
make the offer.

00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:28.606
Hey. look. I gotta go.

00:46:28.608 --> 00:46:32.146
You make sure you get that offer in
before the end of the day. okay?

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.916
Come in.

00:46:38.052 --> 00:46:39.751
Bob.

00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:42.690
Ah. successful meeting. I hope?
Well...

00:46:45.126 --> 00:46:50.132
Got him to sign. and. uh.
I had him initial every page.

00:46:51.632 --> 00:46:55.034
This is. um...
This is well done.

00:46:55.036 --> 00:46:58.204
You are really something.
Bob Ryan.

00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:01.710
Ah. I'm just trying
to do my part. sir.

00:47:03.077 --> 00:47:04.175
Oh. please have a seat.

00:47:04.177 --> 00:47:05.547
Oh. Thank you.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.052
Ah. My kids have
that same camera.

00:47:13.054 --> 00:47:14.552
Oh. Yeah. yeah.
Yeah. I've...

00:47:14.554 --> 00:47:16.521
You know. I've had that thing forever.
My kids love to...

00:47:16.523 --> 00:47:18.023
They love
to fool around with it.

00:47:18.025 --> 00:47:21.293
You know. you! You scored
a touchdown. Bob Ryan.

00:47:21.295 --> 00:47:27.266
Or should I say... Mr. Vice President
of Commercial Acquisitions?

00:47:27.268 --> 00:47:29.101
Thank you. sir.

00:47:29.103 --> 00:47:31.306
It's a big job.
I know you can handle it.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.474
I mean.
you have no idea

00:47:36.476 --> 00:47:40.179
how much this means to me
and to Abby and the kids.

00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:41.780
Um...

00:47:41.782 --> 00:47:43.416
You know.
talking about your kids.

00:47:43.418 --> 00:47:46.418
I ran into them yesterday
down at the cove.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.121
and it seems like
we had a slight...

00:47:49.123 --> 00:47:50.423
...misunderstanding.

00:47:50.425 --> 00:47:52.191
Maybe you
just heard them wrong.

00:47:52.193 --> 00:47:56.729
No. they said they'd fire Dad.
then buy Marineland.

00:47:56.731 --> 00:47:57.796
Buy Marineland?

00:47:57.798 --> 00:48:00.499
Yeah and they have the mayor
on their side. too.

00:48:00.501 --> 00:48:02.601
They're really
mean people. Sidney.

00:48:02.603 --> 00:48:05.237
I mean really.
really bad people.

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:07.606
But we have to tell your parents.

00:48:07.608 --> 00:48:11.242
We can't. They said they'd fire Dad.
But listen. We got this.

00:48:11.244 --> 00:48:14.579
Mom and Dad always said we gotta be
responsible for our own actions. all right?

00:48:14.581 --> 00:48:18.184
We got ourselves in this mess.
We can get out.

00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:20.452
We'll do
the best we can. Bernie.

00:48:20.454 --> 00:48:22.423
Just hang in there.

00:48:27.561 --> 00:48:32.130
- Hey. There you are. How's Bernie?
- Better.

00:48:32.132 --> 00:48:34.833
He's eating a lot. and Sidney
says we can release him soon.

00:48:34.835 --> 00:48:37.336
Well. that's good news. yeah?

00:48:37.338 --> 00:48:39.106
Hand me the pliers. please.

00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:44.578
So. uh. what's with
the long faces?

00:48:46.514 --> 00:48:47.548
Mom...

00:48:48.715 --> 00:48:50.449
what if somebody
was doing something

00:48:50.451 --> 00:48:51.786
really. really wrong?

00:48:53.253 --> 00:48:56.525
Would you tell? Even if
they told you not to?

00:48:57.257 --> 00:48:58.460
That depends.

00:49:00.128 --> 00:49:01.763
What'd you guys do now?

00:49:04.532 --> 00:49:06.197
Um...

00:49:06.199 --> 00:49:07.800
Dad's boss. Mr. Mills.

00:49:07.802 --> 00:49:11.537
uh. he...

00:49:11.539 --> 00:49:13.805
Uh. he. um...
He what?

00:49:13.807 --> 00:49:15.708
He's not gonna build
an ocean theme park.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.213
Hey. kids.

00:49:19.313 --> 00:49:21.847
Kevin. what do you say
we grab the old pigskin

00:49:21.849 --> 00:49:23.916
and I teach you
the five-step drop?

00:49:23.918 --> 00:49:26.485
Because to succeed
in this life.

00:49:26.487 --> 00:49:27.920
you must go deep.

00:49:27.922 --> 00:49:31.559
Seems that they got
something to tell us. right?

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:33.327
Dad...

00:49:34.795 --> 00:49:36.729
Mr. Mills is not gonna
build an ocean park.

00:49:36.731 --> 00:49:39.164
Mr. Mills told me that. uh.

00:49:39.166 --> 00:49:41.233
you overheard him
speaking with the mayor.

00:49:41.235 --> 00:49:44.670
Kids. he was talking about a
completely different project.

00:49:44.672 --> 00:49:46.704
Dad. he's lying. okay?
He said he'd fire you.

00:49:46.706 --> 00:49:48.673
- Oh. he's lying? Is that right?
- Yeah.

00:49:48.675 --> 00:49:50.208
Well. that's...
that's interesting.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.213
because I just
kinda got promoted.

00:49:53.713 --> 00:49:55.548
You're looking
at the new VP.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.450
- That's great. hon. I'm so proud of you!
- Yes.

00:49:59.452 --> 00:50:01.519
Mmm! It is a big day
for the Ryans.

00:50:01.521 --> 00:50:03.923
Uh. you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get changed.

00:50:03.925 --> 00:50:06.358
We're gonna take out
the Ryan Express.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.863
and I'm gonna
show you the spot.

00:50:10.231 --> 00:50:12.932
You see? Your dad knows
what he's doing. okay?

00:50:12.934 --> 00:50:15.470
It'll all work out.
Okay.

00:50:24.311 --> 00:50:25.677
There is it. kids.
Right there.

00:50:25.679 --> 00:50:27.412
Right on that piece
of land right there.

00:50:27.414 --> 00:50:30.715
That's where a massive
ocean park is gonna go.

00:50:30.717 --> 00:50:35.253
It's gonna have rides.
water slides.

00:50:35.255 --> 00:50:36.956
You're gonna love it.

00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:38.791
Uh. but. honey.
this is the kids' hangout.

00:50:38.793 --> 00:50:40.659
You sure this is it?
'Course I am. honey.

00:50:40.661 --> 00:50:42.628
Winston brought me
out here personally.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.398
Look. There they are.

00:50:45.465 --> 00:50:46.798
Tell them
Bernie's okay.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.235
Guys. Bernie's fine.
We found him. okay?

00:50:50.237 --> 00:50:52.371
He got beached.
and he's just sunburned.

00:50:52.373 --> 00:50:54.405
but he's fine now.

00:50:54.407 --> 00:50:56.608
Kev. where's your camera? You
can get some shots for Bernie.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.278
Um. I'm just
gonna use my phone.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.949
You don't have
your camera. Kev?

00:51:02.282 --> 00:51:04.516
- No.
- That's funny. you know?

00:51:04.518 --> 00:51:06.688
Winston has a camera
just like yours.

00:51:09.724 --> 00:51:11.757
All right.
Let's go in.

00:51:11.759 --> 00:51:13.659
I'm excited to show you
the lay of the land.

00:51:31.545 --> 00:51:33.811
Come on.
We're almost there.

00:51:33.813 --> 00:51:36.782
Wait a minute. you guys.
I'm the tour guide here.

00:51:36.784 --> 00:51:38.816
Right there. that's...
that's our...

00:51:38.818 --> 00:51:40.688
What happened?
It's gone!

00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:43.491
Someone took all our stuff.

00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.461
What?

00:51:50.998 --> 00:51:52.434
Oh. no! The eggs!

00:51:53.668 --> 00:51:54.599
Holly!

00:51:54.601 --> 00:51:56.370
Where is everybody going?

00:51:58.306 --> 00:51:59.507
That's it. bud.

00:52:00.807 --> 00:52:03.075
Oh. and by the way. Winston
says no more coming down here.

00:52:03.077 --> 00:52:05.744
'cause once we start construction.
it could be dangerous.

00:52:05.746 --> 00:52:06.912
Um. Dad. uh...

00:52:06.914 --> 00:52:08.780
Isn't it something. huh?

00:52:08.782 --> 00:52:11.252
Yes. sir.
it's something. all right.

00:52:13.721 --> 00:52:15.688
We found them.
They're there.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:18.490
You found what?
Am I missing something here?

00:52:18.492 --> 00:52:21.693
- Mr. Winston's gonna...
- Gonna save the turtle eggs. Dad. right?

00:52:21.695 --> 00:52:23.829
Yes. of course. kids. We're gonna
be ecologically conscious.

00:52:23.831 --> 00:52:27.032
Yeah. Yeah. we'll stay away
from here from now on. Dad.

00:52:27.034 --> 00:52:29.903
That's good.
So that's it.

00:52:30.905 --> 00:52:32.704
Over here is gonna be
the entrance.

00:52:32.706 --> 00:52:35.773
And then.
Holly. over here.

00:52:35.775 --> 00:52:38.980
that's gonna be
a 50-foot water slide.

00:52:59.733 --> 00:53:01.869
Those kids of yours
are quiet tonight.

00:53:03.403 --> 00:53:04.769
Too quiet.

00:53:04.771 --> 00:53:09.807
Ab. you know I only want what's
best for you and the kids. right?

00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:11.346
Of course I do. honey.

00:53:12.012 --> 00:53:13.644
And the kids
know that. too.

00:53:13.646 --> 00:53:16.817
Sometimes I think
I just try too hard.

00:53:18.952 --> 00:53:20.686
Met with Luke Lawson today.

00:53:20.688 --> 00:53:22.054
Luke Lawson?
Mm-hmm.

00:53:22.056 --> 00:53:23.956
I haven't heard you
mention him in years.

00:53:23.958 --> 00:53:26.758
I didn't even know
that he was back in town.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.630
He owned some land
that we need for the park.

00:53:30.898 --> 00:53:32.731
I got him to sell.

00:53:32.733 --> 00:53:34.133
Well. that's good.

00:53:34.135 --> 00:53:35.637
You did your job.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:38.670
What's wrong?

00:53:38.672 --> 00:53:40.608
I know that look.

00:53:41.708 --> 00:53:44.943
Just brought back memories.
you know?

00:53:44.945 --> 00:53:47.713
I mean. sports has
always been my marker.

00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:51.115
It's how I judge success.

00:53:51.117 --> 00:53:52.953
I'm old-school.

00:53:53.853 --> 00:53:56.088
And our kids.
they're just. um...

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:57.392
They're different.

00:53:58.458 --> 00:54:00.025
You know. seeing Holly
out there today

00:54:00.027 --> 00:54:02.561
with the dolphins.

00:54:02.563 --> 00:54:04.796
I mean. it was so cute.

00:54:04.798 --> 00:54:07.699
And I actually think that she
was communicating with them.

00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:09.938
You know.
I think that she was.

00:54:10.905 --> 00:54:12.503
Kevin with his filmmaking.

00:54:12.505 --> 00:54:16.810
I... haven't exactly
been supportive.

00:54:18.445 --> 00:54:21.546
It's no secret that I'm trying
to turn him into a ballplayer.

00:54:21.548 --> 00:54:25.217
but... I don't know
if that's right.

00:54:25.219 --> 00:54:28.086
Yeah. and maybe he
will be a ballplayer.

00:54:28.088 --> 00:54:31.123
They got a lot
of growing up to do.

00:54:31.125 --> 00:54:33.925
We teach them
the best that we can

00:54:33.927 --> 00:54:36.128
and pray that they make
the right choices.

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:37.465
Oh. you're right.

00:54:38.798 --> 00:54:40.932
You're always right.

00:54:40.934 --> 00:54:43.034
I would never admit that
in public...

00:54:43.036 --> 00:54:44.605
Yeah.
...of course. but...

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.443
Some things
never change.

00:54:58.686 --> 00:55:02.054
So what'd you do that for? You know
they aren't saving any turtles.

00:55:02.056 --> 00:55:03.856
It's okay.
I have a plan.

00:55:03.858 --> 00:55:05.923
All right. so this is
Dad's office building.

00:55:05.925 --> 00:55:08.630
He said Winston has the
camera. my camera.

00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:10.662
Yeah. So?

00:55:10.664 --> 00:55:12.798
So. it's
in Winston's office.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.769
Oh. no. We both know
what he's thinking. right?

00:55:16.737 --> 00:55:17.970
It's the only way.

00:55:17.972 --> 00:55:20.108
Without the camera.
the bad guys win.

00:56:16.764 --> 00:56:19.731
Can I help? Uh. yeah. sure.
Grab that bucket over there.

00:56:19.733 --> 00:56:21.769
Sure. It's time to feed Bernie.

00:56:27.307 --> 00:56:29.874
Ew. Dead fish.

00:56:29.876 --> 00:56:32.209
What'd you expect.
spaghetti?

00:56:34.081 --> 00:56:36.113
So the post
really worked. huh?

00:56:36.115 --> 00:56:40.588
Yep. We're getting well wishes from
countries all around the world.

00:56:44.757 --> 00:56:49.061
- Okay. what's wrong?
- I think we caused all this mess.

00:56:49.063 --> 00:56:50.595
Hey. no. stop.

00:56:50.597 --> 00:56:52.130
You two helped save Bernie

00:56:52.132 --> 00:56:54.099
and learned a valuable
lesson about the ocean.

00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:56.867
I don't think he would have
survived without you guys.

00:56:56.869 --> 00:56:59.070
How'd it go with Mom and Dad?

00:56:59.072 --> 00:57:00.838
You tell them?

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.608
Kind of.

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:04.376
What's "kind of" mean?

00:57:04.378 --> 00:57:06.744
Means Dad got
a big promotion

00:57:06.746 --> 00:57:08.947
and thinks his boss
is super awesome.

00:57:08.949 --> 00:57:11.016
Well. that stinks.

00:57:11.018 --> 00:57:12.720
Want me
to talk to them?

00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:14.753
Well...

00:57:14.755 --> 00:57:17.789
The good news is the plan
is to release Bernie soon.

00:57:17.791 --> 00:57:19.791
Yeah. unless Winston
buys the place first.

00:57:19.793 --> 00:57:21.258
What was that?

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:24.865
Nothing. Let's go. We got work to do.
Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Work to do.

00:57:28.702 --> 00:57:31.336
Something sure smells fishy
around here. Bernie.

00:57:31.338 --> 00:57:33.141
and it ain't the fish.

00:58:08.442 --> 00:58:12.209
I really need your
help on this one. Big Guy.

00:58:12.211 --> 00:58:13.811
If you just do me
this one favor.

00:58:13.813 --> 00:58:18.182
I promise I won't
ask you for anything else.

00:58:18.184 --> 00:58:21.788
Well. hope I won't have
to ask you for anything else.

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.197
Kev. you asleep?

00:58:31.831 --> 00:58:33.835
Sweet dreams.
Love you.

00:58:59.793 --> 00:59:00.958
Going somewhere?

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.360
Gotta get my camera.

00:59:02.362 --> 00:59:03.394
You crazy?

00:59:03.396 --> 00:59:04.862
Maybe.

00:59:04.864 --> 00:59:07.099
Well. I'm coming with you.

00:59:07.101 --> 00:59:08.800
- Oh. no.
- Oh. yes.

00:59:08.802 --> 00:59:11.403
Come on. listen.
All right. you just go...

00:59:11.405 --> 00:59:13.037
What are you doing?

00:59:13.039 --> 00:59:14.805
I got Dad's skills.

00:59:14.807 --> 00:59:17.144
So are we doing this
or what?

00:59:18.077 --> 00:59:19.478
All right.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.179
So according to Dad's schedule. the
cleaning crew starts at 10:00.

00:59:22.181 --> 00:59:25.950
All right. I'll. uh...
set this thing for 9:55.

00:59:25.952 --> 00:59:30.822
If we're lucky. we'll be able to
get in and out in 15 minutes tops.

00:59:30.824 --> 00:59:32.193
All right.

00:59:51.077 --> 00:59:53.211
Oh. no.
No. no. no.

00:59:53.213 --> 00:59:55.347
Come on. go! Go! Go now!

00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:57.481
I can't. I can't.
Why not?

00:59:57.483 --> 00:59:59.217
It's a red light.

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:02.820
Really? Look.

01:00:02.822 --> 01:00:05.123
Anybody? Listen.
we don't have that much time.

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.291
Do you wanna get
in more trouble?

01:00:06.293 --> 01:00:07.793
All right?
The law's the law.

01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:09.094
I can't do nothin' about it.

01:00:09.096 --> 01:00:10.862
Oh. brother.

01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:14.465
Yes.
Here we go.

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:43.898
All right. let's go.

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:27.507
Hello.

01:01:28.474 --> 01:01:30.041
Oh. Mayor Winter. Hey.

01:01:30.043 --> 01:01:32.947
How did the. uh...
How'd the vote go tonight?

01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:36.918
Really? Well.
that's spectacular.

01:01:37.483 --> 01:01:39.886
That's good news indeed.

01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:43.291
Yeah.
What. it was unanimous?

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.657
It's him.
We gotta go.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:48.392
I gotta get my camera.

01:01:48.394 --> 01:01:52.898
Mayor. how many times
have I told you not to worry?

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.266
I mean. with income
you're gonna see...

01:01:54.268 --> 01:01:56.133
Oh. no.
...from the chemical plant...

01:01:56.135 --> 01:01:58.003
Chuck's on the loose.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:00.137
- Why'd you bring him?
- For backup.

01:02:00.139 --> 01:02:02.106
Yes. yes.

01:02:02.108 --> 01:02:05.309
What? Oh. no. Yeah. I've got the
signed documents right here.

01:02:05.311 --> 01:02:09.046
Yeah. Bob Ryan. he pulled it off.

01:02:09.048 --> 01:02:11.416
Oh. the... the poor sucker.

01:02:31.938 --> 01:02:33.371
All right.

01:02:33.373 --> 01:02:36.074
Please be unlocked.
Please be unlocked.

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:38.376
Yes. Yes.
Yes.

01:03:03.737 --> 01:03:05.940
Sweet! Yes.

01:03:07.007 --> 01:03:08.943
Oh. come on.
Come on.

01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:15.282
Ah. there you are.

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:38.438
Uh-oh. Oh. no.

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:40.074
Well. well.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:43.441
Look who can't
stay out of trouble.

01:03:43.443 --> 01:03:47.512
Juvenile delinquents.
Your dad will be so. so proud.

01:03:47.514 --> 01:03:50.315
Oh. and you're
thieves as well.

01:03:50.317 --> 01:03:53.050
Run. run. run.
Go. go. go. go. Go.

01:03:56.989 --> 01:04:00.791
You know that. uh. breaking and
entering is a very serious offense.

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:02.760
No. you're the one
that's in trouble.

01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:03.730
I don't think so.

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:18.309
Bye. It was so good seeing you.
You. too.

01:04:18.311 --> 01:04:19.543
We'll do it again. okay? Yes!

01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:20.547
Give me a call.
See ya.

01:04:29.188 --> 01:04:31.389
- Help! Help! He's after us!
- Holly?

01:04:31.391 --> 01:04:33.191
We have the evidence.
Evidence? I...

01:04:33.193 --> 01:04:35.492
Let me see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

01:04:35.494 --> 01:04:37.295
All right. just calm down.
Who's after you?

01:04:37.297 --> 01:04:38.695
Him! He's after us!
There he is!

01:04:38.697 --> 01:04:41.432
That is my camera!

01:04:41.434 --> 01:04:43.467
Thank you. Thank you
for stopping these...

01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:44.504
these thieving kids!

01:04:45.505 --> 01:04:47.704
You're chasing
children. sir?

01:04:47.706 --> 01:04:50.675
Hey. they broke in
to my office.

01:04:50.677 --> 01:04:52.709
These are the Ryans' kids.

01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:54.248
I think you know them.

01:04:56.182 --> 01:04:57.715
Bob Ryan's kids?

01:04:57.717 --> 01:05:00.485
Oh. wow. I had no idea.

01:05:00.487 --> 01:05:02.420
I mean. come on. Look at
the way they're dressed.

01:05:02.422 --> 01:05:04.588
It was in my office.
It was dark.

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:07.391
You know who we are. all right. and
we have you and the mayor on tape.

01:05:07.393 --> 01:05:08.860
What are you talking about?

01:05:08.862 --> 01:05:12.229
Look. look. now that I know who you
are. I think it's a little late.

01:05:12.231 --> 01:05:14.199
You know. I'm a little
concerned about their safety.

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.767
- I'm gonna take 'em home.
- No. I'll take them home.

01:05:16.769 --> 01:05:19.838
Sure. That's a good idea. I'm just
gonna take my camera. thank you.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.175
Do not touch them!

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:24.108
What did you do?

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:24.943
Oh. my goodness.
That is a...

01:05:24.945 --> 01:05:26.711
That's a shame.
Isn't that a shame?

01:05:26.713 --> 01:05:28.378
It really. truly is.
I'll tell you what.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.516
I'm gonna pay
for your phone. okay?

01:05:31.518 --> 01:05:34.251
And I think this should
more than cover it.

01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:35.619
They were right.

01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:37.357
You are a mean man.

01:05:38.391 --> 01:05:39.824
Uh. so. um...
That's my camera!

01:05:39.826 --> 01:05:41.793
No. we've been
through this before.

01:05:41.795 --> 01:05:44.329
All right. uh. you just make
sure to tell your father

01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:46.463
I want to see him first thing
in the morning. okay?

01:05:46.465 --> 01:05:48.398
Big meanie!

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.534
I saw that.

01:05:49.536 --> 01:05:50.604
Let's go.

01:05:59.813 --> 01:06:02.479
They're safe.
That's all that matters.

01:06:02.481 --> 01:06:05.782
Thank you for taking care of them.
Abby. it wasn't their fault.

01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:09.454
Mr. Ryan's boss.
he's not a nice man.

01:06:09.456 --> 01:06:12.423
Broke Kevin's camera
and my phone. too.

01:06:12.425 --> 01:06:15.296
Oh. I'm sorry. Sidney.

01:06:16.295 --> 01:06:17.929
If you'd like me
to take a look at it.

01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:19.731
I'm pretty handy
at fixing things.

01:06:19.733 --> 01:06:20.868
It'll take a miracle.

01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:22.803
Okay.

01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:40.520
I don't even know where
to begin with you two.

01:06:41.688 --> 01:06:46.657
Sneaking out at night.
taking my keys.

01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:48.392
breaking and entering.

01:06:48.394 --> 01:06:49.961
Dad. we're telling the truth.
I can prove it.

01:06:49.963 --> 01:06:52.233
You realize that you
could have went to jail.

01:06:55.335 --> 01:06:59.436
Go. Both of you.
to bed. Now.

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:01.505
- We'll talk about this in the morning.
- But. Mom...

01:07:01.507 --> 01:07:03.376
I said bed.

01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:11.618
Holy moly.

01:07:14.487 --> 01:07:16.688
How am I gonna
explain this one?

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.956
I'm gonna be the first VP
that never VP'ed.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:21.227
It'll all work out. honey.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.496
I talked to Sidney.

01:07:25.632 --> 01:07:27.735
She backs up their story.

01:07:31.371 --> 01:07:32.338
What?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.649
Winston.

01:08:24.323 --> 01:08:25.822
Ryan.

01:08:25.824 --> 01:08:27.357
What are you
doing in here?

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:30.794
I guess you must have heard about your
kids breaking in here last night.

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:33.397
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.465
You lied.

01:08:34.467 --> 01:08:39.469
I mean. you lied about
everything. didn't you?

01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:42.072
Do some research
to back up your play?

01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:43.543
Big fan of mine. huh?

01:08:45.045 --> 01:08:46.614
Luke Lawson.

01:08:51.318 --> 01:08:53.750
You used me to get
to my old pal.

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:56.019
Ryan. we keep files
on all our employees.

01:08:56.021 --> 01:08:57.854
That's just
standard company policy.

01:08:57.856 --> 01:08:59.790
"Come on. Bob.
Do it for the team."

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:02.962
just like good old Coach Dunn
used to say. huh?

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.332
What about
that knee of yours?

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:10.567
The bum one. Which one
did you say it was?

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:12.070
Is it the left
or the right?

01:09:12.072 --> 01:09:16.107
Okay. um. why don't we just sit
down and talk this through?

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.775
Because I have
the sneaking suspicion

01:09:17.777 --> 01:09:20.977
that you never even
played baseball at all.

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:22.847
I mean. you certainly
never played football.

01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:25.650
because a worm like you
wouldn't have the guts.

01:09:25.652 --> 01:09:28.352
All right. you know. get out of my
office before I call the police.

01:09:28.354 --> 01:09:29.754
Why don't we
call the police?

01:09:29.756 --> 01:09:31.522
What do you suppose we
should talk to them about?

01:09:31.524 --> 01:09:33.691
Should we talk to them
about the marine park

01:09:33.693 --> 01:09:36.693
or the big. beautiful.

01:09:36.695 --> 01:09:40.098
illegal chemical plant
you're building?

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.000
You know. Ryan. your. uh. signature's
on those documents. too.

01:09:43.002 --> 01:09:46.470
If I go down.
you're going down with me.

01:09:46.472 --> 01:09:50.674
And you do not want to come at me.
Fifteen years of karate.

01:09:50.676 --> 01:09:51.742
Uh-huh.

01:09:51.744 --> 01:09:52.945
You know. Winston.

01:09:54.046 --> 01:09:56.817
I was gonna take the moral
high ground with you.

01:09:57.617 --> 01:09:58.950
but. uh...

01:10:01.621 --> 01:10:03.590
Now you got a bum knee.

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:06.360
But the worst part
about it is...

01:10:07.527 --> 01:10:08.793
I actually trusted you.

01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:11.094
took your word
over my own kids'.

01:10:11.096 --> 01:10:13.865
I'm gonna sue you
for everything you have!

01:10:13.867 --> 01:10:16.070
That wasn't even
the right knee.

01:10:19.805 --> 01:10:21.071
Morning.

01:10:21.073 --> 01:10:22.440
Morning.

01:10:22.442 --> 01:10:23.708
How 'bout
some breakfast?

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.076
Yes. ma'am.

01:10:25.078 --> 01:10:27.144
Where's Dad?
Trouble today?

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:28.345
He went in early.

01:10:28.347 --> 01:10:31.749
wanted to meet Mr. Mills.
try to explain what happened.

01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:33.617
Sorry about last night. Mom.

01:10:33.619 --> 01:10:36.053
You know.
it's not good. Holly.

01:10:36.055 --> 01:10:38.522
Whatever happened. your Dad's
job is important to him.

01:10:38.524 --> 01:10:40.958
All right.
we all make mistakes.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.930
I just hope
this one works out.

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:46.998
Morning. buddy.
You okay?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.433
It depends on who's
mad at me. I guess.

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:53.036
Hey! I think it's working.

01:10:53.038 --> 01:10:56.174
- What. are you serious? Here. Let me see it.
- Yeah. so...

01:10:56.176 --> 01:10:58.976
Hey. Kev. that's Sidney's phone.
You shouldn't be snooping.

01:10:58.978 --> 01:11:01.715
Yes. It downloaded from the camera.
It's here!

01:11:18.497 --> 01:11:19.629
Sidney. we got it.

01:11:19.631 --> 01:11:21.933
Hey. Bernie.

01:11:21.935 --> 01:11:23.137
What's wrong?

01:11:24.203 --> 01:11:26.637
This was delivered
to my boss this morning.

01:11:26.639 --> 01:11:27.905
You were right.

01:11:27.907 --> 01:11:30.607
Winston Mills is planning
to buy Marineland.

01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:32.143
Yeah. we'll see
about that.

01:11:32.145 --> 01:11:33.647
Check this out.

01:11:35.481 --> 01:11:36.848
Where did you find it?

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.915
Linked the footage from
my camera to your phone.

01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:41.054
Mom fixed it.
And watch this.

01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:44.254
Well. it better work.

01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:46.723
We're in way too deep for
this thing to be exposed.

01:11:46.725 --> 01:11:48.192
Don't worry. Mayor.

01:11:48.194 --> 01:11:50.527
Within 18 months.

01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:51.862
we are gonna
be in business.

01:11:51.864 --> 01:11:53.196
If this thing all goes
as planned.

01:11:53.198 --> 01:11:54.565
it might just
catapult you

01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:56.099
into a run for
the governorship.

01:11:56.101 --> 01:11:57.802
Governor Brock Winters.

01:11:57.804 --> 01:12:00.207
That does have
a nice ring to it.

01:12:02.242 --> 01:12:04.741
Got 'em. Mr. Mills...

01:12:04.743 --> 01:12:06.880
Well. those two
should be in jail.

01:12:07.546 --> 01:12:09.982
I am so sorry.

01:12:11.951 --> 01:12:13.918
I got greedy.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.655
I was blinded.

01:12:17.756 --> 01:12:19.723
I hope you all
can forgive me.

01:12:19.725 --> 01:12:21.125
It's okay. Dad.

01:12:21.127 --> 01:12:23.093
You were just doing
what you thought was best.

01:12:23.095 --> 01:12:24.928
Yeah. that's all right.
We all make mistakes.

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.768
Mmm. thanks. bud. 'cause
I just made a big one.

01:12:29.269 --> 01:12:31.035
I could be in some
real trouble here.

01:12:31.037 --> 01:12:33.173
But we have the footage. right?
Yeah.

01:12:34.039 --> 01:12:36.007
Oh. Winston
and the mayor

01:12:36.009 --> 01:12:38.576
will have too much leverage
over the judges in court.

01:12:38.578 --> 01:12:39.977
It'll be their word
against ours.

01:12:39.979 --> 01:12:42.178
But what about
the sanctuary?

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.581
Sidney says
he's gonna buy it

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.982
and keep Bernie.
What?

01:12:45.984 --> 01:12:48.251
Yeah. they got
an "indunktion" letter.

01:12:48.253 --> 01:12:50.053
They can't release Bernie.

01:12:50.055 --> 01:12:51.688
"Indunktion"?

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:53.924
- You mean "injunction"?
- Yes.

01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:56.162
They're gonna put an injunction
on releasing that dolphin?

01:12:57.162 --> 01:12:58.164
I don't know. Ab.

01:12:59.231 --> 01:13:02.700
Well...

01:13:02.702 --> 01:13:05.736
You're the brains of the outfit.
What do you think?

01:13:05.738 --> 01:13:09.740
Well. we may not win
in a court of law.

01:13:09.742 --> 01:13:12.643
but we have the footage.
we have the Internet.

01:13:12.645 --> 01:13:14.615
and we have one secret weapon.

01:13:15.715 --> 01:13:17.113
We got Bernie. the dolphin.

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:18.782
You're right.

01:13:18.784 --> 01:13:20.086
That's genius.

01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:22.623
What do you say. Kev?

01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:25.125
Give me a couple hours.

01:14:27.987 --> 01:14:29.152
Can I help you?

01:14:29.154 --> 01:14:30.890
Mr. Robert Ray Ryan?

01:14:32.391 --> 01:14:35.259
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Bob Ryan.

01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:37.027
Mr. Ryan.
I'm Detective Wyatt.

01:14:37.029 --> 01:14:38.599
May I have a word
with you. please?

01:14:39.097 --> 01:14:40.600
Yeah. sure.

01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:48.641
Do you have any idea
why I'm here?

01:14:50.376 --> 01:14:52.212
Uh. yeah.
pretty good idea.

01:14:53.378 --> 01:14:57.313
Are you employed by
a Mills Realty Company.

01:14:57.315 --> 01:15:00.886
by one Mr. Winston Mills?
That's right.

01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:03.055
And do you know
the name...

01:15:03.456 --> 01:15:04.921
Luke Lawson?

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.981
Who was that
this early?

01:15:30.983 --> 01:15:34.154
That was a detective.

01:15:35.253 --> 01:15:36.352
What'd he want?

01:15:36.354 --> 01:15:38.090
He wanted
my side of the story.

01:15:39.292 --> 01:15:42.826
What am I gonna do?
I told him the truth.

01:15:42.828 --> 01:15:44.697
Mom. Dad. come here!
Quick! Come here!

01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:55.438
I deny these charges.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.441
I'm gonna sue all of you!

01:15:57.443 --> 01:15:59.509
After a viral
video was released

01:15:59.511 --> 01:16:01.344
on real-estate mogul
Winston Mills

01:16:01.346 --> 01:16:03.280
and city mayor
Brock Winters.

01:16:03.282 --> 01:16:06.250
both men have been arrested
for investigation

01:16:06.252 --> 01:16:08.753
of a proposed massive
real-estate scheme.

01:16:08.755 --> 01:16:11.789
Now. a third accomplice.
still yet to be identified.

01:16:11.791 --> 01:16:15.058
was also arrested for stealing
endangered turtle eggs.

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.527
This is a huge
misunderstanding.

01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:20.397
I continue to fight.
It's an election year.

01:16:20.399 --> 01:16:22.465
Vote Brock Winters!

01:16:22.467 --> 01:16:24.968
Go online
to brockwinters.com.

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.871
Yeah. yeah. "Vote Brock Winters.
the mayor of the state pen."

01:16:27.873 --> 01:16:29.440
We did it!

01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:36.379
We got 20.000
hits since last night.

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.350
Let's go tell Bernie the good news.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:46.893
Luke backed me up.

01:17:04.243 --> 01:17:06.277
I think
he's feeling better.

01:17:06.279 --> 01:17:08.181
His sunburn doesn't
hurt him anymore.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.513
Oh. I got some good news.

01:17:10.515 --> 01:17:12.849
Just received
authorization from NOAA.

01:17:12.851 --> 01:17:13.584
Bernie can go home.

01:17:13.586 --> 01:17:15.119
Wait. Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:17:15.121 --> 01:17:17.120
The longer he stays here.
the harder it will be

01:17:17.122 --> 01:17:19.190
to adapt back
to his natural environment.

01:17:19.192 --> 01:17:21.125
We're releasing him tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

01:17:21.127 --> 01:17:23.326
We gotta find his pod and tell
'em Bernie's coming home.

01:17:23.328 --> 01:17:24.961
Did you
hear that. Bernie?

01:17:24.963 --> 01:17:27.430
You can go home.

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:42.205
Where are you?
Come on. We're over here!

01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:47.213
Where are they?

01:18:49.981 --> 01:18:52.886
Come on!
Please? Come on!

01:18:54.453 --> 01:18:56.957
Don't lose faith.
all right?

01:18:58.356 --> 01:19:00.223
We'll say
some prayers tonight.

01:19:05.597 --> 01:19:07.196
Hi. I'm Summer Sands.

01:19:07.198 --> 01:19:10.366
and with me today
I have Kevin and Holly Ryan.

01:19:10.368 --> 01:19:12.669
our local kids
whose viral footage

01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:15.272
unveiled real-estate mogul
Winston Mills

01:19:15.274 --> 01:19:17.407
and city mayor
Brock Winters' attempt

01:19:17.409 --> 01:19:20.143
to dupe the public
into a fraudulent scheme

01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:22.012
by constructing
a highly illegal

01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:23.479
and dangerous
chemical plant

01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:26.083
under the guise
of a seaside water park.

01:19:26.085 --> 01:19:28.652
So what gave you two kids
the courage to do this?

01:19:28.654 --> 01:19:31.187
Well. Ms. Sands. it was
really our dolphin friends.

01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:34.590
They saved us. so we had
to help save them. too.

01:19:34.592 --> 01:19:36.192
If everyone helps.

01:19:36.194 --> 01:19:38.361
all the ocean animals can have
a safe and happy home.

01:19:38.363 --> 01:19:42.232
Go. Bernie! I'm launching a video
companion called The Dolphin Chronicles.

01:19:42.234 --> 01:19:44.567
Mm-hmm. It'll mainly focus on
protecting the marine life

01:19:44.569 --> 01:19:48.339
and also tell... teach people
how to respect their habitats.

01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:51.107
Wow. Well. there...
There you go.

01:19:51.109 --> 01:19:53.477
True words of wisdom
from our two young heroes.

01:19:53.479 --> 01:19:56.312
We'll be back with the actual
release as it happens.

01:19:56.314 --> 01:20:00.049
I'm Summer Sands. reporting from the
sunny beaches of St. Augustine. Florida.

01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:01.387
Back to you. Peter.

01:20:13.131 --> 01:20:16.032
Come on! Come on. guys!
Bernie's coming home! Come on!

01:20:16.034 --> 01:20:18.102
Bernie's coming home!
Let's go!

01:20:18.104 --> 01:20:21.071
Hey!

01:20:21.073 --> 01:20:23.307
Dad.

01:20:23.309 --> 01:20:26.175
Dad. maybe just stick to
the human talk. please.

01:20:26.177 --> 01:20:28.144
Oh. Right.

01:20:28.146 --> 01:20:30.714
Here. dolphin.
dolphin. dolphin.

01:20:30.716 --> 01:20:32.652
Come on.
Bernie's family.

01:20:33.386 --> 01:20:34.518
That's them!

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.152
Aw. come on.

01:20:36.154 --> 01:20:38.187
No. it's them.
I'm not joking. Look!

01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:39.388
Are you kidding me?
That...

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.026
There they are! Yes! It's them!
Are you kidding me. Kev?

01:20:42.028 --> 01:20:43.360
Yes!
Yes!

01:20:43.362 --> 01:20:45.062
That's them?
Yeah. that's them!

01:20:45.064 --> 01:20:46.530
I'm a... Yo!

01:20:46.532 --> 01:20:48.969
Yes.
Whoo-hoo!

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.641
Yo!

01:20:57.042 --> 01:20:58.575
We found 'em!

01:20:58.577 --> 01:20:59.942
You found them?

01:20:59.944 --> 01:21:03.513
The whole pod's out here. the whole family.
Yeah. Hey. Bernie.

01:21:03.515 --> 01:21:05.417
Come on. buddy. You can do this.
Come on. bud.

01:21:06.519 --> 01:21:07.718
Come on.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.352
The whole family's
out there. man.

01:21:09.354 --> 01:21:12.057
- They're waiting for you.
- Bye. Bernie!

01:21:13.158 --> 01:21:14.590
Remember to write.

01:21:14.592 --> 01:21:18.128
Holly. it's time.

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:21.768
Me and Kevin will see him every day.
We're his family. too.

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:26.570
Come on. buddy. Yes.

01:21:32.144 --> 01:21:33.277
Okay. Bernie.

01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:35.548
You can do this.
I know it. okay?

01:21:38.684 --> 01:21:40.451
Come on.

01:21:40.453 --> 01:21:43.120
Bye. buddy!

01:21:43.122 --> 01:21:45.188

01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:46.522
Bye-bye.

01:21:50.128 --> 01:21:51.160
Bye!

01:21:51.162 --> 01:21:53.097
We knew you could
do it. buddy!

01:21:53.099 --> 01:21:54.197
We knew it!

01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:05.308
Hey. Bernie!

01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:06.610
Come here. babe.

01:22:06.612 --> 01:22:09.412
Come here. you little heroes.
We did it.

01:22:09.414 --> 01:22:10.546
Bye. Bernie!
Bye. Bernie!

01:22:10.548 --> 01:22:12.549
Bye. Bernie!

01:22:12.551 --> 01:22:14.087
See you tomorrow!

01:22:55.895 --> 01:22:58.528
This camera so rocks.
Do a cartwheel here. Holly.

01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:00.296
Check this out. guys.

01:23:00.298 --> 01:23:01.831
Yeah. awesome.

01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:02.734
Here.

01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:07.870
All right. guys. this is
the Ryan camp 2.0. baby.

01:23:07.872 --> 01:23:10.210
Oh. man.
beautiful day out.

01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:20.284
Yeah.
Hey. my turn.

01:23:20.286 --> 01:23:21.855
Wait. What?

01:23:22.854 --> 01:23:24.321
No...
Okay. now you act.

01:23:24.323 --> 01:23:25.688
No. I'm the director.

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:27.590
You're the one that's always
in front of the camera.

01:23:27.592 --> 01:23:29.927
Here. Ready? Go ahead and end
"Bernie's Journey" for me.

01:23:29.929 --> 01:23:31.527
And that's a wrap.
