13
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.250
This is Yardley.

14
00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.754
Which is supposed to be
a very good liberal art school.

15
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.351
Definitely tonguey
enough for my mother.

16
00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:32.409
With its beautiful rural campus.

17
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:36.897
Which is total bullshit. because
you get ticks. walking in the grass.

18
00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:41.368
Yardley is more structured
than the first college I went to.

19
00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:46.790
I lasted a few months at one of those
serious Ivy League sudo intellectual joints.

20
00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:50.752
which my mother thought would
give me an "appropriate" education.

21
00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:54.548
She says I have a high IQ. and
I'm not living up to my potential.

22
00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:58.324
Even though last weekend I
made 20 grand playing poker.

23
00:01:58.467 --> 00:01:59.726
But I'll get to that.

24
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.117
Yardley is where I met
Ashleigh. from a school paper.

25
00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:05.867
That's my girlfriend - Ashleigh Enright.

26
00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:08.329
My dad knew one of her
father's banks in Arizona.

27
00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.427
And naturally. with
those family credentials.

28
00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:13.407
my mother wants us to
get married. sight unseen.

29
00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:15.554
It's the one area I
agree on with my mother.

30
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.100
Because even though we've
only been going out for a few months.

31
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.154
I'm hopelessly in 
love with Ashleigh.

32
00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:23.304
I got an interview
with Roland Pollard.

33
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:26.452
Oh my Gosh. that is amazing.
How did you land that?

34
00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:29.371
He has a new movie
coming out this fall.

35
00:02:29.538 --> 00:02:31.774
And the assignment originally
went to Priscilla McCain.

36
00:02:31.774 --> 00:02:34.548
but she's totally got
mono. so I'm doing it.

37
00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:37.035
Mono's like a two
credit chores at the school.

38
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.507
Listen Ash. I think
this is great for you.

39
00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:40.484
When is it?

40
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.058
It's the 28th of this month.
A Saturday.

41
00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:45.018
And it's on campus?

42
00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:49.731
- It's in Manhattan.
- It's in Manhattan. are you serious?

43
00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:53.485
This is fantastic. we were always talking
about going into Manhattan for a special weekend.

44
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.192
Look. I'm going to make a
reservation at the Carlyle.

45
00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:58.950
It's the place I'm
always telling you about.

46
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.869
with the piano player at the bar.
he sings his old Broadway tunes.

47
00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.463
I'll take you up for lunch and
dinner. how does that sound?

48
00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:06.804
We go see around city.

49
00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:08.202
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

50
00:03:08.457 --> 00:03:10.251
I mean. it will cost a fortune.

51
00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:13.754
Relax. I'm loaded. I scored
20 big ones last Sunday.

52
00:03:14.672 --> 00:03:17.216
- Not another crap game?
- No. stud poker this time.

53
00:03:17.143 --> 00:03:21.095
Sitting there with 3 tens. and some
guy with aces up keeps raising me.

54
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:24.765
How did you get all the money
to play in such a big poker game?

55
00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:26.517
My horse came in this weekend.

56
00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.885
I'm telling you this is
why I have to go to Vegas.

57
00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:31.117
I'm a gambler and I don't
know how else to put it.

58
00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:34.177
I've always wanted you to
have to show me around Manhattan.

59
00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:35.856
This is going to be
absolutely fantastic.

60
00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:38.158
I'm going to. maybe. get in
touch with my dad's ticket brocker.

61
00:03:38.158 --> 00:03:40.434
He'll get us tickets to
Hamilton. how does that sound?

62
00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:43.396
Actually. I don't want all my
parents know I'm in town that weekend.

63
00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:45.083
Why not?

64
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:47.252
My mother is having 
her big annual fall gala.

65
00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:49.116
and she's apoplectic 
I'm not coming.

66
00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:53.182
I told her I have a major paper due.
otherwise I have to put an appearence.

67
00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.140
It's like death.
It's like having ...

68
00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:57.494
Drinks with a hundred
bullshit people.

69
00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:00.247
not one of which has ever
been turned down by a co-op.

70
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.855
I can't believe it.

71
00:04:03.296 --> 00:04:06.358
An interview with the
director of "Winter Memories".

72
00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:09.201
Didn't we see "Winter Memories"
together on our first date?

73
00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:09.944
I think so.

74
00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:11.154
I'm just so excited.

75
00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:15.367
You have to help me come up with
the list of profound questions to ask him.

76
00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.288
I don't want to come
off like a twit.

77
00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:18.686
You are not going
to come off like a twit.

78
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.094
Actually. now that
I'm thinking about it.

79
00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.289
We can't stay at the Carlyle.
it's too close to my parents house.

80
00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.127
But I want you to have a park view.
You know what?

81
00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:25.260
We going to stay at the Pierre.

82
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:28.667
That way you can have a park view.
it's a safe distance from my parents house.

83
00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:31.400
Then after dinner we're going
to go to the Carlyle. we go to bar.

84
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:32.709
and spend some time there.

85
00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:36.921
It's very old New York. I really love it.
The murals are by Ludwig Bemelmans.

86
00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:41.801
I've only been to Manhattan
twice. you know.

87
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.012
Once when I was 2. and
then once when I was 12.

88
00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:49.148
All I remember is we
got incredible bargains.

89
00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.004
My parents could not
believe that you could buy

90
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:54.167
a Birkin bag and a Rolex
on the blanket off the street.

91
00:04:54.452 --> 00:04:55.828
For only 200 dollars.

92
00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:09.842
Are there any other questions
you can think of that I can ask him?

93
00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:15.223
Find out who influenced
him more on love.

94
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.267
Denis de Rougemont
or Ortega y Gasset.

95
00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:21.187
How do you always
know all that stuff?

96
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.482
I read. I just don't read
what they give us at school.

97
00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:28.694
Do I really care who wins between
Beowulf & Grendel. no I don't.

98
00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.197
Maybe if I had a
little money on it.

99
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.242
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

100
00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.617
No college reporters
won a Pulitzer. right?

101
00:05:38.932 --> 00:05:39.918
I do not think so.

102
00:05:39.318 --> 00:05:41.806
You are going to be fine. don't
put so much pressure on yourself.

103
00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:42.867
I think it's going to be great.

104
00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.211
Listen. I want to see the 
Weegee photos at MoMA.

105
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.744
and I booked us a 
dinner at Daniel's.

106
00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:49.548
It's kind of a nice place. we can
dress up for it. It would be really nice.

107
00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:51.844
And I splurged on
the suite at the Pierre.

108
00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:54.639
What the hell. right? It's poker
winnings. it's not even real money.

109
00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:10.154
Gatsby. it's beautiful!

110
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:12.114
I wanted to do something special.

111
00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:15.081
The flowers.

112
00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:17.863
- That's not me. I don't know what that is.
- Champagne.

113
00:06:20.037 --> 00:06:21.467
Look at that view.

114
00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:24.121
I wanted it to be high enough
so you could see Central Park.

115
00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.734
Central Park.
Exciting.

116
00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:31.769
Thank you so much. sir.
I really appreciate that.

117
00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:34.127
Thank you.

118
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.325
Later maybe we could 
take a carriage ride?

119
00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:36.963
Yeah.

120
00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.096
If it doesn't rain.

121
00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.805
We could ride in the rain. it's very moody.
It's very romantic.

122
00:06:41.452 --> 00:06:42.578
 I prefer it.

123
00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:44.423
What time is it?

124
00:06:44.574 --> 00:06:46.129
Yeah we should go. 
this is hotel at downtown.

125
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:47.466
It might be a 
little bit of a traffic.

126
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.380
- It is far?
- It's in Soho.

127
00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:52.627
You are going to like Soho.
It's filled with creative people.

128
00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:56.590
Then it got commercially expensive. so all
the creative people moved to Tribeka.

129
00:06:57.048 --> 00:06:59.259
And that got expensive.
so they all moved to Brooklyn.

130
00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:02.012
Next move is back in
with their parents.

131
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.161
He's only giving me an hour.

132
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.268
It's good. we have a
01:30 lunch reservation.

133
00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:19.866
What are you going
to do while I'm upstairs?

134
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.220
I do not know.

135
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:23.663
Just roam around Soho. 
maybe visit my brother.

136
00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.924
I can't say how nice it is that
you're back in the city.

137
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.633
If it weren't for you I don't know if I
would ever find my way back to Yardley.

138
00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:32.970
- What would you do?
- Find some brilliant way to ruin my life.

139
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.831
Hi. I'm here for
Mr. Roland Pollard.

140
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.565
Roland. this is Ashleigh
Enright from Yardley.

141
00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:43.921
- How do you do?
- Ashleigh. this is Roland.

142
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:47.517
The screening is all set up.
We are running on a really tight schedule.

143
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:52.355
First of all. I'd just like to say that
what an honor this is for me.

144
00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:56.651
I just want to say you're by far the most
interesting american director.

145
00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:57.861
Thank you.

146
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:00.595
I write in the arts for a paper

147
00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:03.596
and I always put you right 
in the class with Renoir and De Sica.

148
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:07.396
I'm surprised to hear that 
someone your age is

149
00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.157
familiar with 
Renoir and De Sica.

150
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:14.284
Film is my total thing.
I've seen all the american classics.

151
00:08:14.284 --> 00:08:17.127
Particularly the europeans.
Kurosawa is my favourite.

152
00:08:19.163 --> 00:08:22.375
Technically. he is not european.
technically. he's. obviously. japanese.

153
00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:25.420
But you really 
speak to my soul.

154
00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:29.173
What college are you from?

155
00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:31.407
Yardley. It's small.

156
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:34.359
I know it well. my first
wife went there.

157
00:08:34.859 --> 00:08:36.402
- Really?
- Yes.

158
00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:42.817
Brilliant woman. long blonde hair
and a state of the art overbite.

159
00:08:42.817 --> 00:08:45.007
Very sexy.
A philosophy major.

160
00:08:45.794 --> 00:08:47.803
To tell you the truth I
didn't deserve her. and

161
00:08:47.803 --> 00:08:50.411
I didn't end up with
her either. so ...

162
00:08:50.757 --> 00:08:53.449
Well. that's a...

163
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:57.473
Neither. either. nor yawn.

164
00:08:57.473 --> 00:08:58.747
I imagine.

165
00:08:59.607 --> 00:09:04.111
I guess. it's probably
more yawn that either.

166
00:09:04.938 --> 00:09:06.194
Are you from New York?

167
00:09:07.107 --> 00:09:08.504
Tucson. Arizona.

168
00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:11.113
What does your family do?

169
00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:12.753
I was afraid you'd ask.

170
00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:14.108
My father owns banks.

171
00:09:14.414 --> 00:09:15.504
Is that bad?

172
00:09:16.712 --> 00:09:18.046
I know what you are thinking.

173
00:09:19.214 --> 00:09:23.093
"Republicans. the one percent".
But we are not.

174
00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:28.557
We're just. totally Episcopalians.
who happen to just be rich.

175
00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:30.976
That's how my Ashley was.

176
00:09:32.185 --> 00:09:33.616
Who's your Ashley?

177
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.201
My first wife.

178
00:09:36.194 --> 00:09:39.489
The one with a long blonde hair
and a state of the art overbite.

179
00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:42.283
Her name was Ashley?

180
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:44.869
A-S-H-L-E-Y.

181
00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:51.000
Mine is A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H.

182
00:09:51.668 --> 00:09:53.461
You use a Forbes 500 spelling.

183
00:09:56.381 --> 00:10:00.677
Since this is your first meaningful
assignment. would you like a scoop?

184
00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:03.555
Of?

185
00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:09.227
Inside information.
You've heard what the term is.

186
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:11.312
Oh. a scoop!

187
00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:17.777
I'd rather share this with you. than
some slick gossip-hungry newspaper.

188
00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:19.571
Oh my God.

189
00:10:21.406 --> 00:10:26.077
You keep going. I'm liable to have my
famous psychological hiccup fits.

190
00:10:26.578 --> 00:10:28.037
When I'm nervous I stammer.

191
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.831
Is this the scoop?

192
00:10:30.957 --> 00:10:32.500
No. that's not the scoop.

193
00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:36.296
The worst. of course. is
when I'm sexually conflicted.

194
00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:38.923
Then I'll hiccup indefinitely.

195
00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:44.612
The scoop is -

196
00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:47.614
I am not happy 
with this film.

197
00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:49.543
You're not?

198
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.654
I am thinking of quitting. actually.

199
00:10:53.947 --> 00:10:54.865
That's the scoop.

200
00:10:58.327 --> 00:11:01.872
If I could speak
frankly. Mr. Pollard.

201
00:11:05.626 --> 00:11:07.540
You've never had mass appeal.

202
00:11:08.577 --> 00:11:10.070
You're too original.

203
00:11:10.682 --> 00:11:14.435
And you've never once made
one single commercial concession.

204
00:11:16.794 --> 00:11:18.420
You are a free creative spirit.

205
00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:25.594
Like Van Gogh. or
Rothko. or Virginia Woolf.

206
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.849
Of course. they
all committed suicide.

207
00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:33.811
It's a very sweet
thing to say. actually.

208
00:11:34.937 --> 00:11:36.777
You should read me on you.

209
00:11:37.846 --> 00:11:39.921
I wrote that your 
best work is yet to come.

210
00:11:40.273 --> 00:11:45.194
It's only in. Yardley Argus.
but we have a good circulation.

211
00:11:45.374 --> 00:11:47.376
You think that my best
work is yet to come?

212
00:11:48.294 --> 00:11:49.170
I do.

213
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:52.298
And I haven't seen your
new film. but I'm willing to bet...

214
00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:53.341
Would you like to?

215
00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:56.344
I'd love to.

216
00:11:57.094 --> 00:12:01.015
I know how secretive you are.
Which I. totally. respect.

217
00:12:02.016 --> 00:12:03.282
What are you doing now?

218
00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:04.371
Now?

219
00:12:04.371 --> 00:12:08.125
Yes now. I'm screening it
for Ted Davidoff. who did the script.

220
00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:12.929
I know who he is. he writes
all your movies. he's a genious.

221
00:12:13.096 --> 00:12:15.431
The screening has
some last minute changes.

222
00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:17.033
Face saving changes.

223
00:12:17.784 --> 00:12:18.868
How long does it run?

224
00:12:20.203 --> 00:12:22.330
I guess I could shift
my lunch plans.

225
00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:27.668
One thing about New York City -
you are here or you are nowhere.

226
00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:33.132
You cannot achieve this level of anxiety.
hostility and paranoia anywhere else.

227
00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:34.717
It's really exhilarating.

228
00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:39.952
Anyhow. I decided to treat 
myself to a cigarette holder.

229
00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:41.283
which makes me look dapper

230
00:12:41.283 --> 00:12:44.209
and serves the double duty 
of delaying the inevitable onset

231
00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:45.905
of cancer or emphysema.

232
00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:47.569
I smoke too much.

233
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.914
So then who do I meet. 
but one of the most obnoxious

234
00:12:51.914 --> 00:12:54.289
and revolting characters 
from my high school.

235
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.115
Welles?
Hey.

236
00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.224
Troller.

237
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:00.446
I heard that you 
flanked out of freshman year.

238
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.222
No. I didn't flunk out. 
I transferred up to Yardley.

239
00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:05.426
because the first place 
I tried was too unstructured.

240
00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:08.099
They word around is flunked.

241
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:08.924
No.

242
00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:11.681
Where the hell is Yardley.
Afghanistan?

243
00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:13.422
Upstate.

244
00:13:13.722 --> 00:13:15.159
- Have you heard about Finletter?
- No.

245
00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:18.105
He got thrown out of Princeton
for passing bed checks.

246
00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.608
- No. I didn't hear about that.
- The big deal.

247
00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:23.778
Because of his father he's
got like the all-time golden parachute.

248
00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:27.239
He could commit mass murder and he'd
still have a cushy job waiting for him.

249
00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:30.910
- It's a weird way to put it.
- And Millstein is marrying Carol Durand.

250
00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:35.164
Which. I'll never understand.
because she resembles Yasser Arafat.

251
00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.583
Not to mention she's an Ice Queen.

252
00:13:38.167 --> 00:13:40.127
You can't believe everything.

253
00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:41.640
What are you doing in town?

254
00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:44.779
It's my girlfriend. I'm just showing 
her around for the weekend.

255
00:13:45.332 --> 00:13:47.376
- Who is your girlfriend?
- You wouldn't know her.

256
00:13:47.751 --> 00:13:49.211
But she's got a 
name. hasn't she?

257
00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:51.838
Ashleigh.

258
00:13:53.048 --> 00:13:55.951
Like Ashley Wilkes
in "Gone with the Wind"?

259
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.106
That whimp.

260
00:13:58.286 --> 00:13:59.371
What about Josh Loomis?

261
00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:02.457
I just saw Josh.
He's shooting a movie at Minetta.

262
00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:05.002
- A movie?
- It's his student film.

263
00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:08.922
NYU project. it looked
completely stupid to me.

264
00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:10.714
You should stop by.

265
00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:13.348
He's with Evans 
and the younger Tyrell.

266
00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:17.778
You've always liked Josh.
That turned into a classic whimp.

267
00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:22.032
Did you say Amy's younger sister is there?
Is Amy there?

268
00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:26.078
Amy is at Vassar.
Big deal. I'm impressed.

269
00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:30.540
Flat-chested.
Like two dimes on a hanging board.

270
00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.586
- Amy was beautiful.
- Yeah. if you like Grace Kelly.

271
00:14:36.254 --> 00:14:37.297
What are you in town for?

272
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:41.259
My girlfriend. she has an interview
with Roland Pollard for the school paper.

273
00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:42.636
Who's that?

274
00:14:43.095 --> 00:14:47.182
It's a director. He did
"Winter Memories". "Moonlight".

275
00:14:47.516 --> 00:14:49.851
Oh yeah! 
I can't stand his flicks.

276
00:14:50.894 --> 00:14:55.440
All that whimpy emotional probing.
and never a single decent toilet joke.

277
00:14:57.192 --> 00:14:59.929
You should go and watch them shoot.
You could be in it.

278
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:01.907
They're looking for volunteers.

279
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:05.999
With that cigarette holder you
could be the perfect milk toast nerd.

280
00:15:07.417 --> 00:15:08.960
I'm running a little bit late.

281
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:14.508
I wouldn't trust my girl with
a big time Hollywood director.

282
00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:16.635
Good to know.

283
00:15:17.344 --> 00:15:19.763
- You didn't ask me what I am doing.
- What are you doing?

284
00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:21.878
I'm only pre-med.

285
00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.461
We have paw at 
the boarding of Grenada.

286
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.363
I can't make lunch.

287
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.889
What? Why not?

288
00:15:29.373 --> 00:15:31.459
- I have to see his film.
- You do?

289
00:15:32.334 --> 00:15:34.281
It's an unbelievable opportunity.

290
00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.909
And then we're going to 
discuss it after and everything.

291
00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:39.036
How did this develop?
I though you just had an hour with him.

292
00:15:39.203 --> 00:15:41.430
So did I. but then he 
started opening up to me.

293
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.422
He did?

294
00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.079
He is going through 
this real artistic crisis.

295
00:15:45.514 --> 00:15:47.148
There's a real story here.

296
00:15:47.438 --> 00:15:48.898
We have a lunch reservation.

297
00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:53.254
You wouldn't want me to
say no to the screening?

298
00:15:53.694 --> 00:15:56.781
I am here for work.
We'll have plenty of time.

299
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.211
When? The film's going
to take a couple of hours.

300
00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:00.795
I mean.

301
00:16:01.463 --> 00:16:04.258
It's 1 now. the movie 
will probably be over around 3

302
00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:06.070
and then I'll have all afternoon.

303
00:16:06.363 --> 00:16:07.948
How did you get friendly so fast?

304
00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:12.536
He's going through this
whole self-sabotage trip.

305
00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:15.709
It's a scoop.

306
00:16:16.357 --> 00:16:17.426
Is that him?

307
00:16:18.221 --> 00:16:19.221
Yes.

308
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.015
He's a little older
looking than I thought.

309
00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:28.663
It's a good look though. 
don't you think?

310
00:16:28.927 --> 00:16:30.085
He is a sufferer.

311
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.067
So what. what's so great 
about suffering?

312
00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:36.738
You should hear him talk
about the arts. he's so passionate.

313
00:16:37.573 --> 00:16:39.992
I can see how all of his leading
ladies fall in love with him.

314
00:16:40.784 --> 00:16:41.785
Do you want me 
to meet him?

315
00:16:42.953 --> 00:16:44.830
- I wouldn't want you to spook him.
- It's okay.

316
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.150
No. he's a very private person.
And distraught.

317
00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:52.070
I'll see you later and
I'll meet you back at Carlyle at 3.

318
00:16:52.237 --> 00:16:54.197
It's the Pierre.
The Carlyle is tonight.

319
00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:01.621
What the hell is it about older guys
that seem so appealing to women.

320
00:17:02.372 --> 00:17:06.835
All they are is decrepit.
What is sexy about short-term memory loss?

321
00:17:07.752 --> 00:17:09.233
I never want to get old.

322
00:17:09.398 --> 00:17:12.230
Of course. with my smoking 
habit. I'll be spitting blood at 40.

323
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.878
If she's going to get 
some big inside news story.

324
00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:19.215
she has to put in 
time with this guy.

325
00:17:19.778 --> 00:17:21.321
Meanwhile. it's going to rain soon.

326
00:17:23.407 --> 00:17:24.261
Gatsby!

327
00:17:24.917 --> 00:17:26.008
Josh.

328
00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:27.927
How are you man?

329
00:17:27.927 --> 00:17:29.549
- It's nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

330
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.091
I just ran into Alman Troller.

331
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.939
He told me you were 
shooting a short film down here.

332
00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:34.318
I thought I'd stop 
by and say hi.

333
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.903
It's just my mid-term project. 
it's nothing big actually.

334
00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:38.132
How's Yardley. 
is that where you are?

335
00:17:38.132 --> 00:17:39.926
It's okay. I'm not really 
liking it too much.

336
00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:41.718
I'd rather be going 
to school in the city. but...

337
00:17:41.846 --> 00:17:43.790
You know my mother. 
If it's not the perfect image.

338
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.088
she bites down that cyanide capsule 
she keeps for special emergencies.

339
00:17:47.228 --> 00:17:48.429
I didn't know that.

340
00:17:48.587 --> 00:17:49.764
The only thing I remember 
about them is

341
00:17:49.764 --> 00:17:52.006
 that they had that 
fundraiser for Jeb Bush. right?

342
00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:53.423
- Right.
- Right.

343
00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:56.788
So listen. how are you? 
How's life?

344
00:17:57.373 --> 00:17:59.291
What's going on here? 
What are you doing here?

345
00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:02.336
You know. just out here trying
to create modern film-noir classic.

346
00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:03.638
Okay. alright.

347
00:18:03.638 --> 00:18:05.112
- Do you want to be in it?
- No.

348
00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:06.711
- Come on. man.
- No.

349
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:10.102
We're just light on extras. we
have all those people who never showed.

350
00:18:10.102 --> 00:18:11.510
You wouldn't have
to talk or anything.

351
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.937
Seriously. you just 
get in the car.

352
00:18:12.937 --> 00:18:15.010
and then on action you 
let the girl out. that's it.

353
00:18:15.041 --> 00:18:17.502
- Okay. I don't have to talk?
- None. Zero words.

354
00:18:18.668 --> 00:18:20.251
- I can handle that.
- Okay. there you go.

355
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:21.590
You remember Chan. don't you?

356
00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:24.010
- Chan Tyrell.
- Hi.

357
00:18:24.761 --> 00:18:27.347
- You're Amy's little sister. right?
- Good to see you.

358
00:18:29.182 --> 00:18:30.892
- Should we do this?
- Yeah. go in there.

359
00:18:31.768 --> 00:18:33.728
I like that coat. actually.
no. keep that on.

360
00:18:33.895 --> 00:18:36.856
Listen. I hear your older
sister's at Vassar now. right?

361
00:18:37.565 --> 00:18:39.265
Yeah. political science major.

362
00:18:39.356 --> 00:18:40.179
Can you believe it?

363
00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:42.948
I mean Amy never heard 
the news that Lincoln was shot.

364
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:45.097
Chan Tyrell.
This is insane.

365
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:48.962
You were a little girl. and now
you are. actually. a young woman.

366
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.715
You are not going to
start singing Gigi. are you?

367
00:18:52.055 --> 00:18:54.128
- I'm not going to start singing...
- So here's the story.

368
00:18:54.128 --> 00:18:56.608
She is totally mad with
loss and she can't let go off you.

369
00:18:57.576 --> 00:18:59.911
She kisses you and then
she bursts away.

370
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.220
Chan Tyrell.

371
00:19:02.338 --> 00:19:05.049
Incidentally. I apologise in
advance for ruining your scene.

372
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.944
- I'm not an actor.
- I'm not an actress either.

373
00:19:07.944 --> 00:19:09.448
I'm just helping out a friend.

374
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.574
And we kiss?

375
00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:13.243
Yeah. that's why I never
wanted to be an actress.

376
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.706
You have to fake passion
with all kinds of weirdos.

377
00:19:18.707 --> 00:19:20.459
- Thank you.
- Nevermind.

378
00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.837
Just kiss me so I can
really feel it in my toes.

379
00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:26.965
I used to kiss your older sister. did
she ever say anything about that or no?

380
00:19:27.216 --> 00:19:30.636
I don't know. I don't recall.
I think maybe she said you were a 4.

381
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.181
- A 4? She said I was a 4?
- I don't know. maybe a 6.

382
00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:39.186
Maybe a 6. I can't recall.
Just this kiss. I want it to be hot.

383
00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.189
If we are going to do it.
let's do it right.

384
00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.483
- Good work ethic.
- Thank you.

385
00:19:46.777 --> 00:19:47.611
Action.

386
00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:57.037
Cut.

387
00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.831
Are you going to
keep your mouth closed?

388
00:20:00.874 --> 00:20:03.181
I have a girlfriend. Chan.
I don't think I can do this.

389
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:05.347
I'm sorry. I think I froze.

390
00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:07.935
You have a girlfriend?
Who's your girlfriend?

391
00:20:08.144 --> 00:20:09.986
Her name is Ashleigh. 
she's from Yardley.

392
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.790
She's from Tuscon originally.

393
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.514
Tuscon? You are dating 
a girl from Arizona?

394
00:20:14.674 --> 00:20:15.828
Do I have your permission?

395
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.711
What do you guys 
talk about. cactuses?

396
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.104
Rattlesnakes.

397
00:20:20.379 --> 00:20:23.272
Arizona? That would be 
great for your asthma.

398
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.221
I don't have asthma.

399
00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:29.006
When we were kissing. I
thought I heard you wheezing.

400
00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:31.925
I always remembered
you as a very snotty kid.

401
00:20:33.376 --> 00:20:34.251
Ready?

402
00:20:35.002 --> 00:20:36.545
What are you up to now?

403
00:20:36.796 --> 00:20:39.924
- I am studying design at a fashion Institute.
- That's unique.

404
00:20:40.216 --> 00:20:41.133
Rolling.

405
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:43.928
Scene 19. take 2.

406
00:20:45.054 --> 00:20:46.013
Action.

407
00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:53.104
Cut.
That's better.

408
00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:55.835
Josh. he's way too uptight 
to open up his mouth.

409
00:20:55.974 --> 00:20:57.268
Are you still 
seeing that shrink?

410
00:20:57.268 --> 00:20:59.158
Give me a break. alright?
I was just taking a walk.

411
00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:01.956
He asked me to help out. alright? 
I've never acted before.

412
00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:05.282
- Scene 19. take 3.
- Action.

413
00:21:10.248 --> 00:21:11.874
Josh. it's starting to rain.

414
00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:18.840
And cut. Great.

415
00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:23.136
See. I knew you could do it.
And I won't tell your girlfriend.

416
00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:25.517
Josh. you like it. you 
want a different version?

417
00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.121
- I can...
- No. we go with that version.

418
00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:28.576
That's the version. 
we're sticking with that.

419
00:21:28.576 --> 00:21:30.136
Alright. well. have 
fun in Arizona.

420
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.451
And whatever you do. don't 
get lost in a desert and die of thirst.

421
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.127
I'll be sure to 
bring a canteen.

422
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:38.005
Don't fall in the Grand Canyon
too. it's really deep.

423
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:49.840
She's always been the 
pain in the ass. kid sister.

424
00:21:49.964 --> 00:21:51.087
How could she not be?

425
00:21:51.087 --> 00:21:53.923
Amy was gorgeous. and so
sexually advanced.

426
00:21:54.257 --> 00:21:57.176
Word on Amy was she performed
an oral sex at the bar mitzvah.

427
00:21:57.635 --> 00:21:59.784
Maybe they should make that 
a part of every jewish holiday.

428
00:21:59.784 --> 00:22:01.288
Certainly beats fasting.

429
00:22:01.438 --> 00:22:05.025
It's also a great way to celebrate the
Jewish New Year. what a great Hanukah gift.

430
00:22:07.777 --> 00:22:09.500
I wonder what's 
been bothering Hunter.

431
00:22:09.646 --> 00:22:12.385
Something was definitely 
on his mind when I called him.

432
00:22:18.548 --> 00:22:20.383
- Gatsby!
- Surprise.

433
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.678
- I told you I might drop in.
- That's crazy!

434
00:22:23.845 --> 00:22:25.305
Listen. if you have something
to do I can come back...

435
00:22:25.472 --> 00:22:28.141
- No. I have nothing to do.
- Good to see you.

436
00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:29.669
How are you?

437
00:22:30.531 --> 00:22:33.242
- I'm good. you?
- Good.

438
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:35.270
Are you coming 
for Mom's party?

439
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.347
No. you can't tell 
her I'm here. okay?

440
00:22:38.122 --> 00:22:39.717
It's okay. Hunter. 
you can pull it off.

441
00:22:39.717 --> 00:22:41.335
You are engaged and 
not in the house now.

442
00:22:41.335 --> 00:22:43.115
she's not going to 
take your phone away.

443
00:22:43.787 --> 00:22:46.423
- If Mom finds out she'll die.
- No. she won't. she'll live.

444
00:22:46.423 --> 00:22:47.648
And she's not going to find out.

445
00:22:47.947 --> 00:22:48.990
Well. count me in.

446
00:22:49.156 --> 00:22:52.349
It's Ashleigh. my girlfriend. she has
to do an interview with Roland Pollard.

447
00:22:52.349 --> 00:22:54.079
the film director 
for the school paper.

448
00:22:54.523 --> 00:22:55.252
It's a big coup.

449
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:57.593
Ashleigh? 
Someone the mom's high on?

450
00:22:57.722 --> 00:23:00.182
- She's never even met her.
- Hunter. your parents want to ...

451
00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:04.729
- Gatsby. It's so good to see you!
- It's good to see you. how are you?

452
00:23:05.229 --> 00:23:06.772
I'm good. what are 
you doing in town?

453
00:23:06.772 --> 00:23:09.340
His girlfriend is 
interviewing Roland ...

454
00:23:09.623 --> 00:23:11.102
Pollard. the film director. but.

455
00:23:11.102 --> 00:23:14.172
do me a favor don't tell my mom
I'm here. it's going to be a big party ...

456
00:23:14.172 --> 00:23:16.364
He hates parties. Mr. Anti-social.

457
00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:19.841
You always hated 
Mom's literary salons.

458
00:23:19.886 --> 00:23:23.306
It's rich housewifes who have
the leisure to pursue esoteric culture.

459
00:23:23.473 --> 00:23:25.391
The out of work.
discussing the out of print.

460
00:23:25.558 --> 00:23:28.895
She just wanted to make sure
that we are exposed to great literature.

461
00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:31.534
What about Jimmy Cannon then?
Or what Tom Adair?

462
00:23:31.534 --> 00:23:33.695
It's not all giant insects
and model maids.

463
00:23:33.783 --> 00:23:36.473
You are not going to 
duck out of our wedding. huh?

464
00:23:36.473 --> 00:23:38.118
How can he? 
He's the best man.

465
00:23:38.557 --> 00:23:39.969
He cries at weddings.

466
00:23:40.109 --> 00:23:44.052
He's not as tough as he makes out.
He cries at weddings and funerals.

467
00:23:44.352 --> 00:23:45.228
Same reason.

468
00:23:46.235 --> 00:23:49.280
I'm going to go take a shower.
But there's coffee.

469
00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:51.840
- I'm so glad you're here.
- It's nice being here.

470
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:55.374
I've always liked her.

471
00:23:55.513 --> 00:23:56.431
Gatsby.

472
00:23:57.882 --> 00:23:59.349
- What's the matter?
- Gatsby.

473
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.868
I don't want to go
through with this wedding.

474
00:24:02.868 --> 00:24:03.805
What?

475
00:24:03.956 --> 00:24:04.971
I can't do it.

476
00:24:05.524 --> 00:24:07.712
I can't. and I can't 
pull out now.

477
00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:10.548
It would kill her. it's two hundred
guests invited. they booked ...

478
00:24:11.394 --> 00:24:13.549
the Century Club. they 
booked an orchestra!

479
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:14.699
God. save me!

480
00:24:15.392 --> 00:24:17.727
Okay. alright.
What happened?

481
00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:19.469
You'll think I'm so stupid.

482
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:21.508
I'm not going to think you're stupid.
just tell me what happened?

483
00:24:21.508 --> 00:24:22.949
I can't. it's too stupid.

484
00:24:23.084 --> 00:24:25.836
You're making me anxious. I want to hear
this fascinating piece of stupidity.

485
00:24:26.003 --> 00:24:27.546
She's ... bright.

486
00:24:28.547 --> 00:24:31.000
Gatsby. she's nice. she's kind.

487
00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:31.852
So?

488
00:24:32.457 --> 00:24:34.214
I can't stand the way she laughs.

489
00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:35.585
What?

490
00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:37.065
Yeah. I can't take her laugh.

491
00:24:37.682 --> 00:24:38.933
- Her laugh?
- Yes.

492
00:24:39.243 --> 00:24:40.661
Yeah. her laugh.

493
00:24:40.827 --> 00:24:43.330
Hunter. that's probably the most
idiotic thing I've heard in my life.

494
00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:44.998
I told you'd think it's stupid.

495
00:24:45.487 --> 00:24:46.706
What's wrong with her laugh?

496
00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:48.438
Listen to it. it's 
a total turn-off.

497
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.271
How much do you love her?

498
00:24:50.438 --> 00:24:53.117
I do. I love her. I love 
her. it's just her laugh.

499
00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:54.582
If you love her 
then get over it.

500
00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:56.532
I can't. I've tried.
I've tried.

501
00:24:57.556 --> 00:25:00.297
Last night. we were talking 
in bed and she laughed

502
00:25:00.421 --> 00:25:02.486
and I couldn't 
make love to her.

503
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.324
- What?
- I couldn't. I was impotent.

504
00:25:05.449 --> 00:25:06.366
From her laugh?

505
00:25:07.034 --> 00:25:08.994
- It's happened before.
- Hunter. you have to see a shrink.

506
00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:11.138
- I'm serious.
- I don't need a shrink.

507
00:25:11.138 --> 00:25:13.514
I know what the problem
is - she has a fatal laugh.

508
00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:19.893
A cross between Dad's sister Betty
and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men".

509
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.814
I've never heard of a
problem like that before.

510
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:24.952
You are young. Gatsby.

511
00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:27.549
The world is full of 
tragic little dealbreakers.

512
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:29.450
Haven't you been 
seeing Lily for over a year?

513
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.765
Why is this coming up now?

514
00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:32.549
Have you talked 
to her about it?

515
00:25:34.134 --> 00:25:36.121
I brought it up. tactfully. but

516
00:25:36.425 --> 00:25:38.738
I don't think she realises 
how serious it's gotten.

517
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.074
I love her. but I can't 
marry her. Gatsby.

518
00:25:42.658 --> 00:25:44.211
I won't be able to 
have sex with her.

519
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:45.598
No. you mean you 
don't want to marry her

520
00:25:45.598 --> 00:25:47.737
so you're focusing 
on this laugh insanity?

521
00:25:47.876 --> 00:25:51.388
Spare me the fruits of your Upper East
Side talking. listen to her laugh.

522
00:25:51.388 --> 00:25:53.548
When she comes down. 
we'll get her to laugh.

523
00:25:53.713 --> 00:25:55.128
You'll see what I mean.

524
00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:02.941
I can't.

525
00:26:03.567 --> 00:26:05.227
- I can't do this. I'm sorry.
- Rollie.

526
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.244
I know. I'm sorry. Ted.

527
00:26:07.244 --> 00:26:08.741
- Rollie. come on.
- It's actually. it's physcially...

528
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:10.129
- Don't do this.
- making me sick.

529
00:26:10.155 --> 00:26:11.103
Don't do this.

530
00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:12.641
- It's humiliating.
- It's a process. Rollie.

531
00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:14.781
- Your changes are shit.
- Rollie. sit down.

532
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.632
- Everything that I did is shit.
- Not shit. different. different.

533
00:26:16.716 --> 00:26:17.267
Mr. Pollard.

534
00:26:17.364 --> 00:26:19.823
- It's not different.
- Not all the changes work. but some are good.

535
00:26:19.823 --> 00:26:21.480
Thank you for coming. Ashleigh.
I need to get a little air.

536
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480
- It's a process.
- I need some space.

537
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.625
- Come and sit down.
- I need to get out.

538
00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:24.182
Don't do this.

539
00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:26.935
- I need to think about.
- Don't! No booze.

540
00:26:27.477 --> 00:26:28.687
- Please. no booze.
- What?

541
00:26:28.885 --> 00:26:29.885
Come on.

542
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:35.802
You just watched 2 hours of
an existential steaming shit pile

543
00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:37.393
and that's all that
you can say to me?

544
00:26:37.393 --> 00:26:39.981
- It's a process. we do this every time.
- Ted. Ted.

545
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:42.518
Rollie. come on. back.
Don't drink.

546
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.277
Oh. God.

547
00:26:43.277 --> 00:26:46.071
- Shouldn't we go afer him?
- That's the sure sign he is going to drink.

548
00:26:46.475 --> 00:26:47.993
You go. you can go.

549
00:26:48.142 --> 00:26:49.519
I have to watch it all

550
00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.900
to be able to talk 
to him intelligently about it.

551
00:26:53.462 --> 00:26:55.005
I love the movie so far.

552
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.883
- You do?
- I do.

553
00:27:00.844 --> 00:27:01.762
Let's go back.

554
00:27:03.515 --> 00:27:06.247
There's a high-stakes card
game later at a Fremont Hotel.

555
00:27:06.247 --> 00:27:08.643
I can't make it. but I know
you love that kind of thing.

556
00:27:08.643 --> 00:27:11.450
You want me to call Joe Cohen.
and say you'll take my chair?

557
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.996
I would love a high-stakes card game.
I'm loaded right now. but

558
00:27:15.108 --> 00:27:17.113
Ashleigh and I. we
have plans for tonight.

559
00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:18.378
I'm dying to meet Ashleigh.

560
00:27:18.378 --> 00:27:20.654
I know. I don't know 
where she is right now.

561
00:27:21.216 --> 00:27:24.114
- I was supposed to show her city today.
- You better take an umbrella.

562
00:27:24.402 --> 00:27:25.695
Watch. I'll make her laugh.

563
00:27:26.613 --> 00:27:30.116
I was just telling Gatsby...
Larry Nash told me a great joke.

564
00:27:30.283 --> 00:27:33.173
Two cannibals are eating
a comedian and one says:

565
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.973
 "Hey. do you taste 
something funny?"

566
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:37.363
That is so ufunny.

567
00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:41.277
Okay. that's my que. Hunter.
lovely to see you as always.

568
00:27:41.277 --> 00:27:42.611
Lily. thank you 
for the coffee.

569
00:27:42.868 --> 00:27:43.991
- I heard one more.
- Sure.

570
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.530
A homeless man stopped a Jewish
mother on the street and said:

571
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.325
"Lady. I haven't eaten in 3 days.
And she said: "Force yourself".

572
00:28:11.354 --> 00:28:12.790
Hello. Ashleigh. what's going on?

573
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.953
You said you were going 
to call me 30 minutes ago.

574
00:28:15.251 --> 00:28:19.046
I know. but the film got delayed.
I'm up at this screening room place.

575
00:28:19.994 --> 00:28:23.005
It's fine. just meet me at the
Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street.

576
00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:25.806
We'll grab a bite to eat there and
then we are going to go see the Weegee's.

577
00:28:25.806 --> 00:28:28.517
- I can't. I can't.
- What do yo mean. why not?

578
00:28:28.597 --> 00:28:30.432
Because I'm onto a 
real story here.

579
00:28:30.932 --> 00:28:34.936
This is a 70 million dollar movie
and Rollie is very unhappy with it.

580
00:28:35.937 --> 00:28:37.147
You call him Rollie?

581
00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:39.310
Yeah. and Ted and I. 
we have to find him.

582
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.688
We have to find 
him and talk with him.

583
00:28:40.688 --> 00:28:44.066
Before he adds one of his crazy fits.
and then re-edits the whole thing and ruins it.

584
00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:45.600
Who is Ted?

585
00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:49.562
Gatsby. I can't talk right now.
But I'll call you as soon as I'm through.

586
00:28:50.605 --> 00:28:53.441
And if I'm running late. I'll
just meet you back at the Plaza.

587
00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:56.299
It's not the Plaz...
It's the Carlyle!

588
00:28:56.589 --> 00:28:58.989
It's a bar and the
piano for tonight.

589
00:29:00.203 --> 00:29:04.291
He's not at the hotel and he didn't show
up for the press interview. so

590
00:29:04.406 --> 00:29:07.719
he's wallowing in self-loathing
somehere. drinking Courvoisier.

591
00:29:07.719 --> 00:29:09.987
thinking of new ways
to screw up our work.

592
00:29:10.176 --> 00:29:12.224
I thought the film was 
full of wonderful things.

593
00:29:12.372 --> 00:29:14.033
Me too. Tell him. you ...
Tell him. tell Roland.

594
00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:16.300
Because hearing that from
me won't mean anything.

595
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.582
I'm always at this end of the
argument. but you are fresh.

596
00:29:19.582 --> 00:29:21.546
honest. new generation woman.

597
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:23.989
Especially a pretty one. maybe ...
You may...

598
00:29:24.113 --> 00:29:25.941
Come on. let's find him.
Are you okay?

599
00:29:25.941 --> 00:29:27.438
- Yeah.
- Come on.

600
00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:33.129
He doesn't like her laugh?
No. Ashleigh's laugh is perfect.

601
00:29:33.797 --> 00:29:37.676
Let's go. Ashleigh. we're blowing
the day and it's so moody out.

602
00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:39.171
We could be on a ferry.

603
00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:42.814
or the top of the Empire 
State Building. black and white.

604
00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.783
- Yeah. he was here.
- He was here?

605
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.683
He seemed very distraught.
He knocked back a couple of brandies.

606
00:29:48.683 --> 00:29:50.824
Mumbled something about
heading out to the studio.

607
00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:55.418
Okay. Let's take my car
and head out to Queens.

608
00:29:55.738 --> 00:29:57.852
- Queens?
- Yeah. it's a big film studio.

609
00:29:57.852 --> 00:29:59.071
Do you still want to come?

610
00:29:59.378 --> 00:30:00.608
Definitely.

611
00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:02.753
When Rollie gets
drunk and morose.

612
00:30:02.753 --> 00:30:04.474
he likes to wander 
around the sound stages

613
00:30:04.474 --> 00:30:06.209
 and pretend he's 
Norma Desmond.

614
00:30:06.353 --> 00:30:07.777
- Thanks.
- Sure.

615
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.703
Can I ask you a few questions?
Since I am on assignment.

616
00:30:20.703 --> 00:30:22.152
Sure.

617
00:30:22.308 --> 00:30:24.517
What's your favorite 
film of Rollie's?

618
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:27.767
"Winter Memories". 
the one in Venice.

619
00:30:28.392 --> 00:30:29.518
When did you first see it?

620
00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:34.690
It's with Gatsby. actually. it
was on our very first date.

621
00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:37.503
Dialogue made 
me want to kiss him.

622
00:30:38.254 --> 00:30:41.466
That line about love and death.
being two sides of the same coin.

623
00:30:42.842 --> 00:30:43.843
Did you understand it?

624
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:47.430
No.

625
00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:51.684
I got confused. and felt insecure.

626
00:30:52.393 --> 00:30:55.021
Like I wanted to. just.
be held and kissed.

627
00:30:56.898 --> 00:30:58.325
Have you ever been to Venice?

628
00:30:58.492 --> 00:31:00.277
No. but Gatsby has.

629
00:31:01.746 --> 00:31:03.289
- Oh my God!
- What?

630
00:31:03.873 --> 00:31:06.375
I knew it!
I knew it!

631
00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:08.856
- Are you okay?
- Oh God!

632
00:31:08.856 --> 00:31:10.272
You turned all white.

633
00:31:10.465 --> 00:31:11.883
I knew it!
She was lying!

634
00:31:12.175 --> 00:31:13.551
- Who?
- Connie. my wife!

635
00:31:13.718 --> 00:31:16.262
- She's seeing Lipszyc!
- Who's Lipszyc?

636
00:31:16.429 --> 00:31:19.515
She said she was going shopping
with her sister. in Connecticut.

637
00:31:19.682 --> 00:31:22.143
But she's walking into
Lipszyc's building!

638
00:31:22.518 --> 00:31:23.944
Is Lipszyc a spy?

639
00:31:24.253 --> 00:31:24.867
What?

640
00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:28.095
No. Larry Lipszyc.
My friend. my best friend.

641
00:31:28.368 --> 00:31:30.249
My best friend. I can't believe it.
She must...

642
00:31:30.563 --> 00:31:32.106
They're having an affair.

643
00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:36.533
Oh God. are you okay?
You are clutching your heart.

644
00:31:36.918 --> 00:31:38.625
Okay. here's what we do.

645
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:42.758
We sit here. we wait until she
comes out. and then I'll confront her.

646
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.408
I hope there's not a gun in here
in glove compartment. like in your movies.

647
00:31:48.385 --> 00:31:49.678
You better go.
You go.

648
00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:52.765
No. I can't leave you alone.
You are all white and shaky.

649
00:31:53.807 --> 00:31:57.019
Breathe. Deeply breathe.

650
00:31:57.644 --> 00:32:00.021
Deeply. Dr. Ross said breathe.

651
00:32:00.814 --> 00:32:03.567
Deeply. Breathe deeply.

652
00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:09.072
No. not you.
Me.

653
00:32:10.175 --> 00:32:11.474
Oh God.

654
00:32:12.282 --> 00:32:13.438
Taxi!

655
00:32:14.852 --> 00:32:15.858
Taxi!

656
00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:25.730
Oh my God. Chan.
What are you doing here?

657
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.833
What the hell. 
you were shooting ...

658
00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:28.458
- Hey. you take it. I'm getting out of this one.
- No. no. no. get in. Gatsby.

659
00:32:28.458 --> 00:32:29.823
- Are you sure?
- I'll drop you.

660
00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:33.228
-  Hey. where are you going?
- You remember. the same 5th Avenue joint.

661
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.307
I remember your appartment
well for my days with Amy.

662
00:32:36.474 --> 00:32:40.228
I remember you calling for her.
my parents kept warning her about you.

663
00:32:40.394 --> 00:32:41.854
Warning? Why the hell
would they be warning her?

664
00:32:42.275 --> 00:32:44.779
Because on the first date 
you took her walking in the rain

665
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:46.584
and she got bronchial pneumonia.

666
00:32:46.728 --> 00:32:48.205
For Christ's sake. I'm never
going to get over this.

667
00:32:48.205 --> 00:32:49.983
You can't get it
from being wet!

668
00:32:49.983 --> 00:32:51.944
Don't yell at me.
I thought it was romantic.

669
00:32:52.021 --> 00:32:52.986
That's because it is romantic.

670
00:32:52.986 --> 00:32:55.708
- It's a romatic gesture.
- That's what I'm saying.

671
00:32:55.708 --> 00:32:57.627
You should tell that to Ashleigh.
She thinks I'm nuts.

672
00:32:58.153 --> 00:33:00.655
Who's Ashleigh?
That rodeo queen you're dating?

673
00:33:01.156 --> 00:33:04.325
She's not a cowgirl. she comes from one of
the biggest banking families in Tuscon.

674
00:33:04.576 --> 00:33:06.755
She was a dead butone. actually.
She came out.

675
00:33:06.755 --> 00:33:08.253
She came out?
Is she gay?

676
00:33:08.455 --> 00:33:11.149
No. she's not gay. she's 
charming and beautiful.

677
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:12.436
And we were 
supposed to have this...

678
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:15.069
Goddamn weekend in the city
together. and suddenly she's...

679
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.196
Parked down with all these 
interviews for the school paper.

680
00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.448
She's ambitious. you should
find that admirable.

681
00:33:21.738 --> 00:33:26.243
One. it was supposed to be one little ...
One tiny little. lousy. hour intervew.

682
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.788
Instead. you know.
Lost the whole. goddamn. weekend.

683
00:33:30.664 --> 00:33:31.865
Would you just relax?

684
00:33:31.865 --> 00:33:34.643
- I don't really know why?
- I'm having a hard time relaxing. Chan.

685
00:33:34.643 --> 00:33:37.163
Because this was going
to be a special weekend.

686
00:33:37.172 --> 00:33:38.943
Instead I'm out here in a ...

687
00:33:38.943 --> 00:33:41.738
Wandering streets. like Hagar
in a goddamn desert or something.

688
00:33:41.847 --> 00:33:45.055
Don't tell me. tell her.
Tell her to get her priorities straight.

689
00:33:45.055 --> 00:33:48.266
You want to drink some wine. walk in
the rain and give her bronchitis.

690
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:53.026
Okay. look she's. apparently.
onto a very big story.

691
00:33:53.026 --> 00:33:54.929
She takes her job
very seriously. alright?

692
00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:56.097
Fine. then get over it.

693
00:33:58.167 --> 00:33:59.668
I'm in the process of
getting over it.

694
00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:02.130
Unless you are worried
somebody's hitting on her.

695
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.892
- What the hell does that mean?
- I don't know.

696
00:34:03.892 --> 00:34:06.491
Is she interviewing attractive men?

697
00:34:07.318 --> 00:34:09.382
I've never really thought about it.
I don't know.

698
00:34:10.055 --> 00:34:12.003
Some might say they are interesting.

699
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.493
Then maybe you better
step in and assert yourself.

700
00:34:15.668 --> 00:34:18.197
- Do you think I have to be more demanding?
- I would.

701
00:34:19.587 --> 00:34:22.215
These are like movie big
shots she's hanging out with.

702
00:34:22.548 --> 00:34:24.926
- Suits?
- Yes. a director and a screenwriter.

703
00:34:25.343 --> 00:34:28.137
Artists. they are usually passionate.

704
00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.139
Oh. Jesus Christ!

705
00:34:31.557 --> 00:34:33.708
Okay. you're right.
I have to call her now.

706
00:34:34.413 --> 00:34:35.719
The sooner the better.

707
00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.512
- You think there's that much of a rush?
- I don't know.

708
00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:39.639
Oh. Christ. alright.

709
00:34:40.515 --> 00:34:41.732
It's your idea.

710
00:34:43.189 --> 00:34:44.544
What do you think I should say?

711
00:34:45.113 --> 00:34:47.115
- There's nothing you can say.
- What do you mean?

712
00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:48.962
Without sounding possessive.

713
00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:51.272
Christ. Chan. you just 
encouraged me to call her.

714
00:34:51.373 --> 00:34:52.357
Now I'm asking for your help

715
00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:54.148
and you are telling me
there's nothing I can say?

716
00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:56.126
You are so wishy washy.

717
00:34:56.317 --> 00:34:59.913
Now that I see your M-O I
know exatly why Amy 86ed you.

718
00:34:59.913 --> 00:35:00.957
No.

719
00:35:00.957 --> 00:35:03.412
Amy didn't dump me.
I got sick of seeing her.

720
00:35:03.412 --> 00:35:06.383
Yeah. because everytime you'd call.
and I'd say it was you on the phone.

721
00:35:06.383 --> 00:35:08.898
she'd wave her arms and
say "I'm not in. I'm not in".

722
00:35:09.925 --> 00:35:11.051
Hey. Gatsby?

723
00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:13.744
Hey. Ashleigh.
Listen.

724
00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:17.661
Look. I know you are very busy. and
that's why we came to New York. right?

725
00:35:18.223 --> 00:35:20.934
And no one has more respect
for honest ambitions than I do.

726
00:35:21.468 --> 00:35:24.221
Do I have to listen to this
without an airsick bag?

727
00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:28.224
I can't talk to you right now.
I'm kind of involved in the situation.

728
00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:30.726
We have a number of
things planned for today.

729
00:35:31.352 --> 00:35:33.113
I'm very busy right now.

730
00:35:33.371 --> 00:35:35.613
But. I really. I can't explain 
it over the phone.

731
00:35:35.912 --> 00:35:37.914
Ashleigh. we were talking
about one movie interview.

732
00:35:38.081 --> 00:35:40.231
What could possible be so
secretive about that?

733
00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:41.699
What's so CIA?

734
00:35:41.699 --> 00:35:45.590
Unless there's some
funny business going on?

735
00:35:46.546 --> 00:35:48.631
I'll talk to you later.
Bye. Gatsby.

736
00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:53.306
Oh. these. goddamn. 
cellphones are ...

737
00:35:53.582 --> 00:35:56.062
I don't know. to me it sounds
dubious to the max.

738
00:35:56.197 --> 00:35:58.532
It sounds dubious to you
because you have sinister mind.

739
00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:02.847
- You must really love her.
- I do. she's a breath of fresh air.

740
00:36:03.848 --> 00:36:07.101
She's charming and delightful.
She's pretty.

741
00:36:07.726 --> 00:36:10.187
She's sexy and somehow
at the same she's witty.

742
00:36:11.689 --> 00:36:13.524
She sings very nicely.
She plays the flute.

743
00:36:13.717 --> 00:36:15.368
I don't know how to 
break this to you.

744
00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:17.664
But I'm sick of 
hearing about her. okay?

745
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.283
Was that your boyfriend?

746
00:36:22.576 --> 00:36:23.911
Gatsby.
Yeah.

747
00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:27.122
- Are you still dizzy?
- No. I'm okay.

748
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:31.043
What's Gatsby do?

749
00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:33.545
He goes to Yardley too.

750
00:36:34.296 --> 00:36:36.924
Which he refers to as 
"Forced law on University."

751
00:36:37.841 --> 00:36:39.176
Is he a journalist too?

752
00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:42.179
He's not really 
focused professionally.

753
00:36:42.805 --> 00:36:46.600
I think that in his wildest dreams
he'd like to be Sky Masterson.

754
00:36:46.934 --> 00:36:50.020
- A Broadway bookie?
- He's a little eccentric.

755
00:36:50.687 --> 00:36:52.398
In what way?
Eccentric?

756
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.737
I think it has to do with the fact that
he and his mom never really hit it off.

757
00:36:59.822 --> 00:37:03.992
She was always forcing him to
read everything. and learn piano...

758
00:37:04.907 --> 00:37:06.471
He is really smart.

759
00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:07.948
He was one of those 
students who...

760
00:37:07.948 --> 00:37:11.353
He doesn't have to study for a
test and then he just aces it.

761
00:37:11.353 --> 00:37:12.271
Sounds like me.

762
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.898
To tell you the truth.

763
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:20.828
Don't tell anybody. but I think
he has a touch of Asperger's.

764
00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:26.482
- You know what Chan?
- Yeah?

765
00:37:26.591 --> 00:37:28.146
I'm going to get out of here too.

766
00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:32.972
- What are you doing now?
- Why?

767
00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:35.429
Why. because I have a
little bit of time to kill.

768
00:37:35.684 --> 00:37:37.198
And I thought about 
going to Modern Museum.

769
00:37:37.198 --> 00:37:38.404
Look at the WeeGee exhibit.

770
00:37:38.404 --> 00:37:41.907
Oh. I see. You have nothing better to
do so you want me to keep you company?

771
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:44.008
You know what? Forget it.
I dated your older sister.

772
00:37:44.008 --> 00:37:46.157
You've always had a little
bit of an attitude. okay?

773
00:37:46.157 --> 00:37:47.320
I'm not looking for any trouble.

774
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.017
I have to check out some paintings
at the Mat's Profession Class.

775
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:51.768
If you want to
keep me company.

776
00:37:51.768 --> 00:37:53.805
I don't know why 
you couldn't have just...

777
00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:55.107
Fine. it's going to be fun.

778
00:37:55.107 --> 00:37:56.331
We can get on
each other's nervs.

779
00:37:56.331 --> 00:37:58.375
Alright. let me change. I'm soaked.
Are you hungry?

780
00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:01.420
I'd give you an Arizona lunch.
but we are all out of beef jerky.

781
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.495
Brings back a lot of memories.

782
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:12.243
My folks are in East
Hampton for the weekend.

783
00:38:12.243 --> 00:38:13.207
How come you didn't go?

784
00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:14.635
I've got a date tonight.

785
00:38:14.944 --> 00:38:15.824
You?

786
00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:18.285
Don't be startled.
it turnes out I'm desirable.

787
00:38:18.452 --> 00:38:20.537
Who's the unfortunate victim?

788
00:38:20.704 --> 00:38:24.458
You wouldn't know him.
he's a girlfriend's dermatologist.

789
00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:26.001
It's romantic.

790
00:38:26.752 --> 00:38:30.296
Don't forget to show him those three
irregular black moles on your back.

791
00:38:30.515 --> 00:38:31.645
I'm sure they're nothing.

792
00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:34.279
I really hope I won't regret
not going to the Hamilton's.

793
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:36.500
The beach is so pretty
in the rain too.

794
00:38:36.913 --> 00:38:39.791
- Would you have to be with your parents.
- So what? I love my parents.

795
00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.001
You know them. they are fun.
Don't you have fun with your parents?

796
00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:45.467
No. fun is not the 
word I would use.

797
00:38:45.593 --> 00:38:46.746
Alright. I'll be right back.

798
00:38:46.746 --> 00:38:50.083
- Hey. listen. can I play your piano?
- Yeah. go ahead. it's a family heirloom.

00:41:09.838 --> 00:41:12.132
Outside it drizzles. grey.

826
00:41:12.758 --> 00:41:15.813
New York City. enveloped
in the light mist.

827
00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:19.150
Two lovers have a date
to meet at 6 o'clock.

828
00:41:19.525 --> 00:41:23.071
At Grand Central Station. under
the clock. like in the movie.

829
00:41:23.312 --> 00:41:26.649
I love that movie.
but I see it outside.

830
00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:31.218
At the East River?
With the tugboats around the water?

831
00:41:31.218 --> 00:41:34.326
- I love tugboats.
- Almost. you're in the Rainbow Park.

832
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.554
I know! I know!
Under the clock.

833
00:41:40.404 --> 00:41:41.321
Which clock?

834
00:41:41.613 --> 00:41:45.325
The Delacorte clock. where all the
animals go around in Central Park.

835
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.514
I love it. it's very old movie.

836
00:41:48.098 --> 00:41:51.059
My Mom and I used to watch
old movies together all the time.

837
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:55.731
She would study the decor.
They are so fabulously escapist.

838
00:41:56.773 --> 00:42:00.700
In my version he's
waiting. the music plays.

839
00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:03.072
And she never comes.

840
00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:06.150
Or she's waiting and he
chooses the other woman.

841
00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:08.615
Can't they just kiss in the rain?

842
00:42:08.615 --> 00:42:11.376
That sounds pretty good
to me. even if it is commercial.

843
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.781
- Picture yourself.
- Okay.

844
00:42:13.922 --> 00:42:15.055
It's four minutes to six.

845
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.800
You're pacing up and down.
rain drops have just started to fall.

846
00:42:19.634 --> 00:42:22.136
You're at your Delacorte clock
in Central Park.

847
00:42:22.762 --> 00:42:25.261
Expecting your ...

848
00:42:26.137 --> 00:42:27.370
Dermatologist.

849
00:42:27.487 --> 00:42:30.712
But he just diagnosed a
carcinoma in his own limp.

850
00:42:30.712 --> 00:42:32.714
It's metastasizing as you wait.

851
00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:37.391
Would you give me a break?
In my version. everything's fine.

852
00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:40.936
He meets me. holds me.
kisses me.

853
00:42:41.353 --> 00:42:43.689
It's lovely.
Nobody needs a biopsy.

854
00:42:47.443 --> 00:42:48.319
Connie!

855
00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:50.009
- Connie!
- Ted.

856
00:42:50.009 --> 00:42:53.095
Is this how you are shopping 
with Judy in Connecticut?

857
00:42:53.222 --> 00:42:54.223
What are you doing here?

858
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.059
I happen to see you out
the window. from the car.

859
00:42:57.477 --> 00:42:58.516
By sheer chance.

860
00:42:58.912 --> 00:43:01.539
- Really? That's awkward. isn't it?
- Awkward. awkward?

861
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:04.288
You've been sleeping with
him for months. haven't you?

862
00:43:04.288 --> 00:43:05.921
- We were going to tell you.
- When?

863
00:43:06.639 --> 00:43:08.686
- When we moved to London?
- No.

864
00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:10.865
Your dream?
That we had moved to London?

865
00:43:10.865 --> 00:43:13.321
It just happened. Ted.
We both fought it.

866
00:43:13.321 --> 00:43:17.259
I'm sure you fought it. in every hotel
room. on every matress. in a backseat.

867
00:43:17.383 --> 00:43:18.883
This isn't about sex.

868
00:43:18.883 --> 00:43:21.519
It's always about sex.
Everything is about sex.

869
00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.132
The economies are about sex.

870
00:43:23.132 --> 00:43:25.372
I can't have this
outburst with you on the street.

871
00:43:25.372 --> 00:43:28.754
You. with my best friend.
It's such a cliché. I can't believe it.

872
00:43:28.754 --> 00:43:30.773
Don't get down on 
Larry. he adores you.

873
00:43:30.905 --> 00:43:32.247
He identifies with you.

874
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.195
I know. he uses my 
aftershave. and my wife.

875
00:43:35.624 --> 00:43:36.476
Who is she?

876
00:43:36.476 --> 00:43:38.719
- Ted. is everything okay?
- What does that have to do with anything?

877
00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:41.695
- Who is she?
- No. everything is fine. stay there Ashleigh.

878
00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:42.834
Keep dry.

879
00:43:43.965 --> 00:43:46.638
- I'm with the Yardley Argus.
- The what?

880
00:43:47.134 --> 00:43:50.313
- The Yardley Argus.
- She's a reporter. doing a piece on Rollie.

881
00:43:50.351 --> 00:43:52.952
On Rollie? Then what is she doing
with you. following me?

882
00:43:52.952 --> 00:43:54.532
- Don't try and turn this around.
- I'm not turning...

883
00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:57.516
Don't try and turn this around.
You've been caught. You're caught.

884
00:43:57.686 --> 00:44:02.433
You. who make a fool of yourself
over every young. ambitious starlet model.

885
00:44:02.433 --> 00:44:04.596
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

886
00:44:04.596 --> 00:44:07.341
You've been having an
affair with Larry Lipszyc.

887
00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:10.247
And you are spying on me with who?
Your 15-year-old concubine?

888
00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:10.838
She's a journalist.

889
00:44:10.838 --> 00:44:12.087
- I'm 21.
- She's 21.

890
00:44:12.087 --> 00:44:13.624
She's 21?
- She's a journalist.

891
00:44:13.624 --> 00:44:15.834
- I have a proof of age. actually.
- No. you don't need this.

892
00:44:15.882 --> 00:44:17.122
This always happens in bars.

893
00:44:17.159 --> 00:44:19.335
- You've been caight.
- You know what. as long as you are a reporter.

894
00:44:19.335 --> 00:44:21.989
I would like to make a
press release about my husband.

895
00:44:22.373 --> 00:44:24.577
- Really?
- Can I write this down?

896
00:44:24.577 --> 00:44:25.935
- Sure. go ahead.
- Ashleigh. please.

897
00:44:25.935 --> 00:44:30.302
Ask him how many times
he has been unfaithful to me?

898
00:44:30.305 --> 00:44:32.035
She's demented.
You're demented.

899
00:44:32.035 --> 00:44:36.287
- His secretary. the actresses. the poetess.
- Wrong. wrong.

900
00:44:36.426 --> 00:44:37.860
- The poetess?
- The poetess?

901
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.614
Were all these women for
a pleasure or for some project?

902
00:44:39.848 --> 00:44:42.026
Stop filling her head with lies.
Ashleigh. come here.

903
00:44:42.345 --> 00:44:47.685
Take this address to the studio. okay?
Find Rollie. come on.

904
00:44:48.223 --> 00:44:50.769
- Find Rollie.
- I don't know my way around New York.

905
00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:52.509
It's okay. tell the cab driver...

906
00:44:52.509 --> 00:44:55.249
- Find Rollie. Stop.
- Ask him if he ever slep with Samantha Leroy.

907
00:44:55.581 --> 00:44:59.715
- The Argus is not a tabloid.
- There are no papers that are not tabloid.

908
00:44:59.715 --> 00:45:02.913
Encourage him about the movie.
so he doesn't mangle it and ruin it. okay?

909
00:45:02.913 --> 00:45:04.440
Please. don't print any of this.

910
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:07.351
- Don't worry. we always protect there from naughty.
- I'm sure.

911
00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:08.872
Connie!

912
00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:11.457
Connie!

913
00:45:17.198 --> 00:45:19.831
The first time I kissed your
sister was in this museum.

914
00:45:19.998 --> 00:45:21.049
I know. she told me.

915
00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:23.513
She said that you were 
looking at a Hieronymus Bosch

916
00:45:23.513 --> 00:45:24.762
and it made you feel romantic.

917
00:45:24.762 --> 00:45:25.878
So that you kissed her.

918
00:45:25.899 --> 00:45:28.145
As of she knew your
shrink wasn't helping you.

919
00:45:28.317 --> 00:45:30.279
Don't tell she got 
the kiss of the 4.

920
00:45:30.646 --> 00:45:33.675
If she'd quoted you a figure 
higher I'd have her audited.

921
00:45:39.092 --> 00:45:42.185
There's something charming
about that elegance.

922
00:45:43.394 --> 00:45:46.814
My mother would've liked Sargent
to have painted her in just that pose.

923
00:45:48.107 --> 00:45:50.526
The dressed so beautifully
in Paris back then.

924
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.655
I could see moving to Paris.

925
00:45:54.011 --> 00:45:57.222
I never really asked you.
What are you future plans. Gatsby?

926
00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.921
I don't know. I'm floundering.

927
00:46:00.332 --> 00:46:01.469
What does that mean?

928
00:46:01.597 --> 00:46:02.906
I don't know 
who I want to be.

929
00:46:03.563 --> 00:46:05.662
I just know what I don't 
want to be. is that terrible?

930
00:46:05.984 --> 00:46:07.694
So you have no game plan?

931
00:46:08.157 --> 00:46:10.756
I know I don't 
want to be a test pilot.

932
00:46:10.756 --> 00:46:13.542
or clergyman 
or proctologist. so...

933
00:46:14.266 --> 00:46:15.673
Ruled those out.

934
00:46:16.475 --> 00:46:17.977
I get it. you don't fit in.

935
00:46:18.603 --> 00:46:21.177
That's why I always had a crush
on you when you dated Amy.

936
00:46:21.177 --> 00:46:23.346
- You had a crush on me?
- I did. isn't it weird?

937
00:46:23.763 --> 00:46:27.464
I don't know. maybe it's because
you took her to do oddball things.

938
00:46:27.613 --> 00:46:29.616
You took her to one 
of those divey piano bars.

939
00:46:29.616 --> 00:46:31.078
where no one 
else ever took her.

940
00:46:31.642 --> 00:46:33.455
I did take her to her 
first crap game.

941
00:46:33.455 --> 00:46:36.437
I know and I loved that.
I loved hearing every detail.

942
00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:38.658
I was hoping she would
get serious with you.

943
00:46:38.658 --> 00:46:41.478
because you were not like
all the other idiots she dated.

944
00:46:41.968 --> 00:46:44.195
I thought you 
were a special idiot.

945
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:46.232
I'm glad I impressed you. Chan.

946
00:46:47.575 --> 00:46:50.407
I remember Amy came home and 
she told me that you took her to

947
00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:53.509
Ballbay scene at Central Park 
and made love to her.

948
00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:57.002
- She told you about that?
- Every moist detail.

949
00:46:57.169 --> 00:46:58.521
Now I embarrassed.

950
00:46:58.658 --> 00:47:00.639
Don't be. that night
she gave you a 6.

951
00:47:00.639 --> 00:47:02.522
She gave me a 6?
Amy.

952
00:47:03.236 --> 00:47:04.591
With a asterix.

953
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:06.296
She said you 
were a little tense.

954
00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:09.423
Yeah. Central Park can be a
little dangerous at 2 AM.

955
00:47:09.423 --> 00:47:11.371
- But very romantic.
- Okay.

956
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:13.009
And then it started to rain.

957
00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:14.751
That was the best part.

958
00:47:15.293 --> 00:47:19.005
Her hair got wet. her clothes
started to cling to her body.

959
00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:22.325
- She started sneezing.
- I don't really remember that part.

960
00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:25.334
Now that I think of it. Chan.

961
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:29.047
You always were around.
giving me the fish eye.

962
00:47:29.948 --> 00:47:31.575
You are just realising this now?

963
00:47:35.838 --> 00:47:36.911
That's all you have to say?

964
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:39.685
You didn't think I was
cute or attractive. anything?

965
00:47:41.042 --> 00:47:42.043
You seemed fine.

966
00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:45.158
You mean I had no
physical deformities.

967
00:47:45.304 --> 00:47:48.120
I didn't have acromegaly
or a hunchback.

968
00:47:48.288 --> 00:47:49.898
You know what. Chan. I wasn't
really paying attention.

969
00:47:49.898 --> 00:47:52.131
because I was a little tense
in front of your parents.

970
00:47:53.081 --> 00:47:56.451
Amy would make her entrance.
like a. goddamn. Miss America.

971
00:47:57.436 --> 00:47:59.316
I'm sure Ashleigh is 
a beauty queen type.

972
00:47:59.316 --> 00:48:03.108
She is. she was an actual first-place
winner at her high school in Tuscon.

973
00:48:03.421 --> 00:48:04.606
4H. right?

974
00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:06.616
Yes. how did you guess?

975
00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:08.927
Ink it in.
Let's get out of here.

976
00:48:11.369 --> 00:48:15.095
These crazy egyptians. they
put all their money on an afterlife.

977
00:48:15.558 --> 00:48:18.431
Listen. Gatsby. let me tell you.
you only look once.

978
00:48:18.577 --> 00:48:20.853
But once is enough if
you find the right person.

979
00:48:22.287 --> 00:48:24.568
You think she's giving me
a runaround today?

980
00:48:25.041 --> 00:48:26.572
I'm struggling to
keep my spirits up.

981
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.930
You really are hooked
on her. aren't you?

982
00:48:31.279 --> 00:48:32.238
Oh my God!

983
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:35.283
That's my aunt and uncle!
They're here for my mother's party.

984
00:48:35.806 --> 00:48:36.290
What party?

985
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.021
They remembered the date - 
my mother's party tonight.

986
00:48:38.021 --> 00:48:39.208
They going to 
tell her I'm here.

987
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:40.762
- Okay.
- I can't discuss this. I have to hide.

988
00:48:40.883 --> 00:48:43.879
Why don't you duck into the
mummy case. I'll get some white tape.

990
00:48:57.277 --> 00:48:57.986
Hello?

991
00:48:58.275 --> 00:49:02.268
Gatsby. I finally got alone.
Where are you?

992
00:49:02.869 --> 00:49:05.455
Let me put is this way.
Have you heard of King Tut?

993
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.061
You are where?
What are you doing?

994
00:49:17.804 --> 00:49:19.926
Hello?
Gatsby. hello?

995
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.041
Gatsby. what a surprise!

996
00:49:26.208 --> 00:49:28.002
I was about to 
call your mother.

997
00:49:35.551 --> 00:49:36.865
Hi. can I help you?

998
00:49:37.379 --> 00:49:38.991
I'm looking for Roland Pollard.

999
00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:41.073
Roland Pollard?
Right. he was here earlier.

1000
00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:43.131
I'm not sure
if he's still back there.

1001
00:49:43.895 --> 00:49:45.563
Mom. it was all planned. okay?

1002
00:49:45.563 --> 00:49:47.568
Ashleigh and I wanted 
to surprise you tonight.

1003
00:49:47.568 --> 00:49:50.262
I happen to run into uncle
Tyler and aunt Grace. okay?

1004
00:49:50.262 --> 00:49:52.016
But don't worry. we are 
going to be there for dinner.

1005
00:49:52.016 --> 00:49:53.669
 it's going to be a 
great time. I just...

1006
00:49:53.669 --> 00:49:56.714
I thought it would be a
fun surprise.

1007
00:49:56.964 --> 00:49:59.300
Oh. we spoiled your surprise.

1008
00:50:00.361 --> 00:50:01.487
Mr. Pollard?

1009
00:50:04.282 --> 00:50:05.158
Rollie?

1010
00:50:06.492 --> 00:50:07.243
Hello.

1011
00:50:07.544 --> 00:50:08.739
Can I help you?

1012
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:11.360
Have you seen Mr. Pollard?

1013
00:50:11.835 --> 00:50:14.711
Rollie's gone.
He left an hour ago.

1014
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.329
Did he seem okay?

1015
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:22.501
To be honest. he seemed
a little drunk to me.

1016
00:50:23.878 --> 00:50:24.837
Are you two friends?

1017
00:50:27.548 --> 00:50:30.134
Oh my God!
You're Francisco Vega.

1018
00:50:31.249 --> 00:50:32.292
Is that good or bad?

1019
00:50:33.745 --> 00:50:37.299
If my roommate was here.
she'd hemorrhage.

1020
00:50:39.126 --> 00:50:42.129
She thinks you are the greatest thing to
come along since the morning-after pill.

1021
00:50:43.036 --> 00:50:43.911
Me too.

1022
00:50:45.538 --> 00:50:47.540
I can't believe I'm talking
to Francisco Vega.

1023
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:52.600
Look at me. I'm a journalist
and I'm reduced to total adolescence.

1024
00:50:55.008 --> 00:50:57.385
- You're Francisco Vega!
- I know that.

1025
00:50:58.252 --> 00:51:00.212
I guess the key question
here is - who are you?

1026
00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:04.431
Who am I? Is that what
you're asking who I am?

1027
00:51:05.973 --> 00:51:08.809
- My identity?
- Yeah. is it coming to you?

1028
00:51:11.606 --> 00:51:13.733
I can't believe I'm blanking on it.

1029
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:15.133
Check your driver's license.

1030
00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:18.769
Right.
Yeah. right.

1031
00:51:20.628 --> 00:51:21.370
Okay.

1032
00:51:22.809 --> 00:51:25.047
I'm Ashleigh Enright.

1033
00:51:25.299 --> 00:51:26.592
I knew it would be on there.

1034
00:51:30.095 --> 00:51:32.266
I work for the Yardley Argus.
I write for them.

1035
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.487
And I'm here in New York. because
I'm interviewing Mr. Pollard.

1036
00:51:35.881 --> 00:51:38.592
Wow. you look exatly the
same but better.

1037
00:51:39.841 --> 00:51:41.237
Let me tell you something.

1038
00:51:41.537 --> 00:51:44.749
You look more beautiful than 
any journalist I've ever met.

1039
00:51:45.712 --> 00:51:47.673
You can make a very
sexy anchorwoman.

1040
00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:50.053
How can you say that when
you're in the papers every week

1041
00:51:50.053 --> 00:51:51.974
with those die-models
and actresses?

1042
00:51:52.054 --> 00:51:52.877
- Get in. get in.
- Where are we going?

1043
00:51:52.877 --> 00:51:53.952
Not now guys. not now.

1044
00:51:53.952 --> 00:51:56.417
Come on. give us a break!
Come on! No!

1045
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.909
Should I be in here?

1046
00:51:59.363 --> 00:52:00.598
Make yourself at home.

1047
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.145
- Would you like to sit down?
- No. no. no.

1048
00:52:04.312 --> 00:52:05.855
- Would you like a drink?
- No thanks.

1049
00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:07.399
Would you like to
have dinner with me?

1050
00:52:08.463 --> 00:52:10.052
Would I like to
have what with you?

1051
00:52:11.372 --> 00:52:14.177
I have no plans. but to
get an early bite and then.

1052
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.756
You and I can go
to a party together.

1053
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.802
Party?
Dinner?

1054
00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.333
What about Tiffany Griffin?
I though...

1055
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:25.687
- I don't want to talk about her.
- You two were twosome.

1056
00:52:25.806 --> 00:52:27.444
No. we just broke up.

1057
00:52:28.242 --> 00:52:30.196
I'm going to change 
into my street clothes.

1058
00:52:30.348 --> 00:52:32.087
While you think about it. okay?

1059
00:52:37.356 --> 00:52:38.274
Oh. Gosh.

1060
00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:43.306
Great. now I have to take Ashleigh
to my Mom's. goddamn. party.

1061
00:52:43.707 --> 00:52:45.000
Why is that so bad?

1062
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.554
Why is that so bad. Chan?
Because I wanted to spend the night

1063
00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:52.097
with Ashleigh alone in New York.
not with forego of wasp plutocrats.

1064
00:52:52.483 --> 00:52:55.214
A forego of wasp plutocrats?

1065
00:52:55.357 --> 00:52:58.152
Sounds like something on
the menu out of a fusion restaurant.

1066
00:52:58.944 --> 00:53:02.541
I'm not interested in the euro. or
how many Basquiats somebody owns.

1067
00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:04.744
or whether they prefer a
falcon to a gulfstream.

1068
00:53:05.467 --> 00:53:07.377
These things have no
meaning to me.

1069
00:53:07.871 --> 00:53:10.327
I noticed you haven't
renounced your family's money.

1070
00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:12.069
What does that mean?

1071
00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:14.980
That means you could move out.

1072
00:53:15.282 --> 00:53:17.583
Get a job. put 
yourself through college.

1073
00:53:17.865 --> 00:53:18.910
Oh yeah. as of what?

1074
00:53:20.246 --> 00:53:22.060
Piano player in the dive.

1075
00:53:22.427 --> 00:53:26.181
Or. maybe a poker player?
Dice hustler?

1076
00:53:27.032 --> 00:53:29.493
You're bad. Chan.
You are going straight to hell.

1077
00:53:30.286 --> 00:53:33.414
There is something romantic
about gamblers.

1078
00:53:33.872 --> 00:53:36.834
And old songs.
Meeting under the clock.

1079
00:53:37.626 --> 00:53:39.712
Yeah. maybe in movies.
but this is real life.

1080
00:53:40.587 --> 00:53:43.048
Real life is fine for people
who can't do any better.

1081
00:53:46.175 --> 00:53:49.785
It's been fun killing time with you.
Have fun with blue neves tonight.

1082
00:53:50.218 --> 00:53:51.928
- Who?
- Your skin doctor.

1083
00:53:53.388 --> 00:53:56.641
At least he knows enough not to
wind up in the egyptian tomb.

1084
00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.276
- Vega!
- Francisco!

1085
00:54:06.609 --> 00:54:08.945
- Thanks for being here.
- It is always like this?

1086
00:54:10.738 --> 00:54:11.656
This is nothing.

1087
00:54:13.491 --> 00:54:16.411
I'm just signing one.
Thank you. thank you for being here.

1088
00:54:17.745 --> 00:54:19.330
Sorry. we have to go.
Sorry.

1089
00:54:22.917 --> 00:54:24.711
- Francisco. who is the young lady?
- I'm no one.

1090
00:54:24.878 --> 00:54:27.164
- What do you do?
- I'm no one really.

1091
00:54:27.475 --> 00:54:31.395
I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale.
Not really a big deal.

1092
00:54:31.751 --> 00:54:32.711
Where did you guys meet?

1093
00:54:33.462 --> 00:54:34.379
Let's go. come on.

1094
00:54:36.602 --> 00:54:37.858
No story here.

1095
00:54:38.099 --> 00:54:40.385
Okay. thank you.
Thank you for being here.

1096
00:54:40.788 --> 00:54:42.473
Ciao. ciao. ciao.

1097
00:54:42.849 --> 00:54:46.065
That's it. that's it.
Alright. thank you for coming. thank you.

1098
00:54:47.177 --> 00:54:49.429
There is so much the public
wants to know about you.

1099
00:54:50.417 --> 00:54:54.045
Is it true that you were born on the
Orient Express right outside of Budapest.

1100
00:54:54.987 --> 00:54:57.138
Are your 2 sisters as
beautiful as you are?

1101
00:54:58.106 --> 00:55:00.067
Please be honest. 
but be modest.

1102
00:55:02.527 --> 00:55:03.737
They are. yeah.

1103
00:55:06.406 --> 00:55:07.657
They are actually even pretier.

1104
00:55:08.492 --> 00:55:09.637
Taylor especially.

1105
00:55:09.637 --> 00:55:12.261
She looks a little bit like
your girlfriend Tiffany Griffin.

1106
00:55:12.656 --> 00:55:14.283
- Could be worse.
- Yeah.

1107
00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:21.707
Are you seriously considering
making remake of "White Heat"?

1108
00:55:21.873 --> 00:55:23.917
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Me?

1109
00:55:25.252 --> 00:55:28.422
Yeah. Sorry I shouldn't
have asked that.

1110
00:55:29.047 --> 00:55:31.842
Sorry. I've been drinking.

1111
00:55:33.176 --> 00:55:38.015
The candle lights are coloring
your face in quite an amazing way.

1112
00:55:40.689 --> 00:55:44.359
I'm sorry. you have a very
affective smile. you know?

1113
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.530
I couldn't help but ask
if you have a boyfriend or not.

1114
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:54.160
Do I have a boyfriend.
Is that what you're asking?

1115
00:55:58.289 --> 00:56:01.042
Yes and. technically. no.

1116
00:56:02.356 --> 00:56:04.915
There's this boy at Yardley.

1117
00:56:07.158 --> 00:56:09.783
But he's just a boy.
He's a mere youth.

1118
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:12.910
We dated a few times.

1119
00:56:14.145 --> 00:56:15.806
You must be crazy about him.

1120
00:56:16.548 --> 00:56:18.591
Is he the captain
of the football team?

1121
00:56:19.797 --> 00:56:22.633
Football?
Gatsby? No.

1122
00:56:23.151 --> 00:56:25.367
No. he doesn't play football.

1123
00:56:26.421 --> 00:56:28.389
He likes to figure
out the point spread.

1124
00:56:28.943 --> 00:56:30.531
So the mathematician.

1125
00:56:32.113 --> 00:56:33.657
Not exactly.

1126
00:56:34.575 --> 00:56:35.743
Gatsby is a...

1127
00:56:37.286 --> 00:56:38.662
Gatsby is very dear.

1128
00:56:40.451 --> 00:56:42.221
Very amusing.

1129
00:56:42.653 --> 00:56:45.291
He's unusual.
Quaint.

1130
00:56:47.366 --> 00:56:50.805
That's the world I would
use to describe Gatsby - quaint.

1131
00:56:52.618 --> 00:56:53.662
He's exotic.

1132
00:56:54.311 --> 00:57:00.834
Searching. shall we say. for his
romantic dream from a vanished age.

1133
00:57:04.073 --> 00:57:06.909
- What is this wine?
- It's Chateau Meyney.

1134
00:57:09.394 --> 00:57:11.438
I shouldn't imbibe so copiously.

1135
00:57:13.023 --> 00:57:16.276
Alcohol plays havoc on
my cerebral neurons.

1136
00:57:17.679 --> 00:57:18.513
And how?

1137
00:57:20.209 --> 00:57:21.630
I lose my sensor.

1138
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:26.017
I become loose. uninhibited.

1139
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:31.280
passionate. aggressive. wicked.

1140
00:57:31.855 --> 00:57:32.832
Absurd.

1141
00:57:38.486 --> 00:57:39.403
Hello.

1142
00:57:40.488 --> 00:57:41.739
Is this where the poker game is?

1143
00:57:42.156 --> 00:57:44.075
- Who are you?
- My name is Gatsby Welles.

1144
00:57:44.286 --> 00:57:46.747
- Who?
- He's okay. that's Hunter's brother.

1145
00:57:48.499 --> 00:57:50.581
I'm just going to take
Hunter's chair if that's alright.

1146
00:57:50.581 --> 00:57:53.042
Yeah. Hunter called and
said you might sit in.

1147
00:57:54.835 --> 00:57:56.624
You sure you want
to play this game?

1148
00:57:56.624 --> 00:57:58.317
He's alright.
Hunter says he's a shark.

1149
00:57:59.326 --> 00:58:01.244
- Better watch out for him.
- Like a guppy.

1150
00:58:02.663 --> 00:58:05.916
If you guys are worried.
I have a little something.

1151
00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:08.418
- This kid is loaded.
- Have a seat then. my friend.

1152
00:58:22.647 --> 00:58:24.023
I will call that.

1153
00:58:28.892 --> 00:58:31.582
This is crazy.
Maybe something's happened to her?

1154
00:58:31.758 --> 00:58:33.288
Maybe she's in 
some kind of trouble.

1155
00:58:33.999 --> 00:58:35.250
Raise. two thousand.

1156
00:58:36.915 --> 00:58:38.955
Maybe the story 
led her into danger.

1157
00:58:39.112 --> 00:58:41.392
Maybe she was 
kidnapped or murdered.

1158
00:58:41.981 --> 00:58:43.274
Should I call the police?

1159
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:46.902
Of course. it would be so
embarrassing if she turn up alive.

1160
00:58:47.958 --> 00:58:51.670
Hey kid. do you going to call or not?
That's two thousand dollars.

1161
00:58:59.674 --> 00:59:00.550
I raise you.

1162
00:59:03.928 --> 00:59:06.055
I reraise you.
All-in.

1163
00:59:48.534 --> 00:59:51.669
With temperature's in the 60s. 
rain is predicted this evening.

1164
00:59:51.669 --> 00:59:53.446
It will be heavy at times.

1165
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:55.741
And more of it tomorrow. 
mostly cloudy

1166
00:59:55.741 --> 00:59:57.940
with the chance of showers 
in the late afternoon.

1167
00:59:58.073 --> 01:00:01.260
On a brighter note: 
Francisco Vega is in town

1168
01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.612
with his new 
main-squeeze on his own.

1169
01:00:03.765 --> 01:00:05.998
All our spies could
find out is that she's

1170
01:00:06.184 --> 01:00:09.017
Ashleigh Enright. a beauty queen.
from Tuscon. Arizona.

1171
01:00:09.017 --> 01:00:11.929
They were spotted later having
drinks over candle light. and

1172
01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:14.145
apparently exchaging 
sweet nothings.

1173
01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:18.405
I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale.
Not really a big deal.

1174
01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.835
- How did you guys meet?
- Who's the girl?

1175
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.750
Good luck. Francisco.
we are all rooting for you.

1176
01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:27.183
That gorgeous couple.
as if they need out help.

1177
01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.603
Jesus. I need a drink.

1178
01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.899
I need a drink.
I need a cigarette.

1179
01:00:38.776 --> 01:00:40.945
What I really need
is a Berlin ballad.

1180
01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:55.251
May I get you another?

1181
01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.378
Yeah. why don't you
make it a double.

1182
01:00:57.378 --> 01:00:58.337
You want a double?

1183
01:00:59.109 --> 01:01:01.385
It's okay. I won't be operating
any form of machinery.

1184
01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:10.668
Hello.

1185
01:01:12.777 --> 01:01:15.571
Mom. you have to give me a chance.
I said I was going to be there tonight.

1186
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.594
Ashleigh's fine.

1187
01:01:22.396 --> 01:01:24.894
Yes. I'll wear a tie and I'll
be there on time. okay?

1188
01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:26.776
I can't really talk right now.

1189
01:01:36.085 --> 01:01:39.338
Francisco Vega.
A bullshit actor.

1190
01:01:39.881 --> 01:01:42.008
This guy is incapable 
of a real moment.

1191
01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:47.500
All those manured gestures and all
that phony self-promoting liberal politics.

1192
01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:51.471
When he offered to set himself
on fire to protest climate change.

1193
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:52.692
they should've let him.

1194
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:55.174
If that's Ashleigh's taste.

1195
01:01:56.343 --> 01:01:58.345
The world is full of
beautiful women.

1196
01:01:59.929 --> 01:02:01.492
Sorry. are you talking to me?

1197
01:02:01.627 --> 01:02:03.649
I'm sorry. I was actually
talking to myself.

1198
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.541
I know the feeling.

1199
01:02:08.047 --> 01:02:10.041
Have you seen a movie
"Out of the Past"?

1200
01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:13.127
- Excuse me?
- Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum.

1201
01:02:14.587 --> 01:02:16.653
She was bad news.

1202
01:02:17.062 --> 01:02:18.542
It's the luck of the draw.

1203
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.207
- Are you alone?
- I am.

1204
01:02:21.508 --> 01:02:23.122
Unless you want
some company.

1205
01:02:24.957 --> 01:02:25.874
Sure.

1206
01:02:29.626 --> 01:02:30.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

1207
01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:33.589
- I'm Terry Ford.
- My name is Gatsby Welles.

1208
01:02:33.745 --> 01:02:35.455
What's the matter. Gatsby?
You seem gloom.

1209
01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:38.958
My girlfriend dumped
me for a movie star.

1210
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.683
You know what they say:
you can't fight charisma.

1211
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.831
I didn't want to
drink in my room alone.

1212
01:02:49.322 --> 01:02:50.588
Are you staying here?

1213
01:02:50.835 --> 01:02:54.881
No. I've been coming here since they
used to only serve me ginger ales by law.

1214
01:02:55.164 --> 01:02:56.633
I love the piano players.

1215
01:02:57.728 --> 01:02:59.939
And now I'm old enough
to order gin and vermouth.

1216
01:03:01.104 --> 01:03:02.189
Time flies.

1217
01:03:02.892 --> 01:03:05.497
Yeah. unfortunately. 
it flies. coach.

1218
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.518
What's that supposed to mean?

1219
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.204
It's not always a
comfortable trip.

1220
01:03:12.948 --> 01:03:13.866
Tell me about it.

1221
01:03:16.044 --> 01:03:17.336
What are you doing
here all alone?

1222
01:03:18.807 --> 01:03:19.706
Working.

1223
01:03:20.572 --> 01:03:21.629
What do you do?

1224
01:03:22.067 --> 01:03:23.444
I make dreams come true.

1225
01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:28.282
- How do you do that?
- Use your imaginion.

1226
01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:35.998
Do we go someplace where
we could be more alone?

1227
01:03:38.712 --> 01:03:40.057
Sure.

1228
01:03:40.718 --> 01:03:41.653
Why not.

1229
01:03:41.962 --> 01:03:42.868
Okay.

1230
01:03:43.345 --> 01:03:44.596
I get five hundred. sweetie.

1231
01:03:46.264 --> 01:03:47.140
Five hundred?

1232
01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:49.559
Right.

1233
01:03:49.767 --> 01:03:52.573
I know what's you are thinking.
Five hunderd seems pretty steep.

1234
01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:54.861
But it's New York.

1235
01:03:56.443 --> 01:03:57.944
How would you like
to make five thousand?

1236
01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:00.007
Five thousand?

1237
01:04:01.953 --> 01:04:03.170
To do what?

1238
01:04:03.403 --> 01:04:05.536
Just to be my date for a
few hours at the party.

1239
01:04:06.345 --> 01:04:09.567
Clothes stay on. no fondling.
no exhange of fluids.

1240
01:04:10.198 --> 01:04:11.888
Just a little role playing.

1241
01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.461
What kind of party?

1242
01:04:14.253 --> 01:04:18.633
Just my Mom's big fall.
bullshit blowout.

1243
01:04:19.492 --> 01:04:22.369
I won 15 G's in the poker game
and I need a date with me.

1244
01:04:22.909 --> 01:04:26.371
Classy item. who answers the
name of Ashleigh Enright.

1245
01:04:27.978 --> 01:04:29.652
- I hope I'm dressed okay.
- Absolutely.

1246
01:04:29.652 --> 01:04:30.642
It's a little fancy.

1247
01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:32.514
- You look perfrect.
- Okay.

1248
01:04:34.049 --> 01:04:36.179
These things can be a
little boring. alright?

1249
01:04:36.814 --> 01:04:38.214
Thank you for coming.

1250
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:39.787
- Hey. Vega.
- How are you?

1251
01:04:39.787 --> 01:04:42.654
- Very good.
- Good to see you.

1252
01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:44.432
This guy is the best cook.

1253
01:04:44.432 --> 01:04:46.378
You have to make 
on of those paella again.

1254
01:04:46.378 --> 01:04:47.672
- Hi. doll.
- Hey.

1255
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:49.158
How are you?

1256
01:04:49.158 --> 01:04:51.224
I wondered if I could steal
you away for 2 minutes

1257
01:04:51.224 --> 01:04:53.793
to talk about your fall schedule
and project with your name on it.

1258
01:04:53.793 --> 01:04:54.664
- Right now?
- Yes now.

1259
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:56.878
Okay. okay. do you mind?
Just 2 minutes.

1260
01:04:56.878 --> 01:04:57.946
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah.

1261
01:04:57.946 --> 01:04:59.099
Yeah? Sure?

1262
01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:00.254
I'll be fast.

1263
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Thank you.

1264
01:05:08.357 --> 01:05:10.253
- You're Gabriela Summers.
- Yes.

1265
01:05:10.253 --> 01:05:12.081
I have so many
questions for you.

1266
01:05:13.001 --> 01:05:14.586
- For my article.
- Okay.

1267
01:05:16.036 --> 01:05:18.498
It's not that much farther.
It's just up the corner here.

1268
01:05:18.793 --> 01:05:20.010
Great. I love to walk.

1269
01:05:20.151 --> 01:05:22.039
It's actually the 
same house I grew up in.

1270
01:05:23.273 --> 01:05:25.384
I bet you went to one
of those fancy school?

1271
01:05:25.384 --> 01:05:26.661
Yeah. I did.

1272
01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:31.143
Is true that all the kids there
have charge accounts at Bergdorf and Prada

1273
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:33.724
and spend lots of money
and do lots of drugs?

1274
01:05:33.769 --> 01:05:35.766
I wouldn't know. I didn't hang
out with the most of the kids.

1275
01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:38.264
I just liked to watch old
movies and play my violin.

1276
01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:39.802
It's kind of weird.

1277
01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:42.542
You were a bookworm?

1278
01:05:42.967 --> 01:05:44.405
Not really.
My mother is just...

1279
01:05:45.196 --> 01:05:48.523
Culture vulture. according to
her I must visit this museum.

1280
01:05:48.523 --> 01:05:51.862
Or I must attend this piano
recital. or see this opera.

1281
01:05:52.146 --> 01:05:56.184
I must read my Henry James. even if Henry
James puts me to sleep. you know?

1282
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:58.046
I like Charlie Parker.

1283
01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.855
Who's that?

1284
01:06:00.751 --> 01:06:02.536
Forget it. that's alright.

1285
01:06:02.536 --> 01:06:03.941
You really are in a bad mood.

1286
01:06:04.978 --> 01:06:06.238
There you are.

1287
01:06:06.385 --> 01:06:07.373
Excuse me for the interruption.

1288
01:06:07.373 --> 01:06:09.250
- You're here.
- Yes. I am.

1289
01:06:09.896 --> 01:06:11.272
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

1290
01:06:11.982 --> 01:06:14.151
I had to get my
thoughts in line.

1291
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.561
You vanished off the planet.
Mr. tortured artist.

1292
01:06:17.865 --> 01:06:19.636
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute?

1293
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.116
Yeah.

1294
01:06:21.927 --> 01:06:23.957
I have actually been
dying to talk to you.

1295
01:06:24.369 --> 01:06:26.812
Your movie was so much better
than you let me to believe.

1296
01:06:26.812 --> 01:06:27.688
Yes?

1297
01:06:28.063 --> 01:06:32.067
And the climax was so moving.
It was very vintage Roland Pollard.

1298
01:06:33.277 --> 01:06:34.194
Sit.

1299
01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.730
I was afraid I wasn't
going to see you again.

1300
01:06:41.858 --> 01:06:44.819
Forgive me.
I'm a little drunk.

1301
01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.613
We were very
worried about you.

1302
01:06:48.406 --> 01:06:52.994
I spent the day. thinking.
reflecting about my work. my life.

1303
01:06:55.788 --> 01:06:58.207
I want for us to get to
know each other. Ashleigh.

1304
01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.585
You do?

1305
01:07:01.294 --> 01:07:03.921
Would you consider coming
with to the South of France?

1306
01:07:04.714 --> 01:07:06.007
The where of what?

1307
01:07:07.047 --> 01:07:12.303
Your voice is the only voice. that's
adding me clarity for me in ages.

1308
01:07:12.469 --> 01:07:16.473
The only voice that enouraged
me. what I actually believed in.

1309
01:07:18.225 --> 01:07:19.226
Like a muse.

1310
01:07:21.187 --> 01:07:23.200
I think you had too
much to drink today.

1311
01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.866
I know I have.

1312
01:07:26.066 --> 01:07:26.942
Come with me.

1313
01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.384
You can wake up every
morning. smelling orange trees.

1314
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:34.435
I'll talk to you about
my new movie

1315
01:07:34.735 --> 01:07:37.468
and I can learn from your
own spoiled honesty.

1316
01:07:39.843 --> 01:07:42.512
You can smell the orange trees.

1317
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.936
I think you are confusing me
with this like total. other Ashley.

1318
01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:49.854
L-E-Y spelling.

1319
01:07:51.988 --> 01:07:53.531
I thought that was you!

1320
01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:55.241
Ashleigh.

1321
01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.312
- You are here.
- I'm here.

1322
01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:00.444
Everybody's here.
Roland's here.

1323
01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.670
I came with him.
I was trying...

1324
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.509
I was trying to figure
out a way to cantact you.

1325
01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:08.392
- I apologise for today.
- It's okay.

1326
01:08:08.392 --> 01:08:10.575
You were very very
understanding. thank you.

1327
01:08:10.755 --> 01:08:12.716
- I felt really bad for you.
- No. no. no. I'm fine.

1328
01:08:13.628 --> 01:08:16.926
I'm fine. I'm about as well
as it could be expected.

1329
01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.884
Yeah.

1330
01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.438
For a guy. that just
discovered that

1331
01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:25.454
- his wife is with his best friend.
- Yeah.

1332
01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:27.745
- You're at the party!
- I am at the party.

1333
01:08:27.745 --> 01:08:29.641
I got home. I got 
to my appartment

1334
01:08:29.641 --> 01:08:31.954
and I was wondering 
why Connie's infidelity

1335
01:08:32.473 --> 01:08:34.387
didn't wound me as
deeply as it should.

1336
01:08:35.938 --> 01:08:38.998
I kept thinking about. I remembered
what you said about my movies.

1337
01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.860
And I thought. my God. 
why is Ashleigh's

1338
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.945
approbation is so meanigful to me?

1339
01:08:44.543 --> 01:08:47.155
Really. it was.
And it strucked me. it stricked me.

1340
01:08:47.155 --> 01:08:48.759
You and I were 
thrown together.

1341
01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:54.536
We were trying to find a wandering
rogue Roland Pollard.

1342
01:08:54.536 --> 01:08:57.569
We had an adventure together.
And in the movie version.

1343
01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:01.107
In my movie version. the guy
who looks up and he realises

1344
01:09:01.547 --> 01:09:04.009
 he's fallen in 
love with the girl.

1345
01:09:05.692 --> 01:09:08.773
- I've played that role so many times.
- Writers like this does not come along...

1346
01:09:08.773 --> 01:09:09.691
- Hi.
- Hey.

1347
01:09:12.151 --> 01:09:14.464
I'm going to call Sam if you
don't answer me by Friday.

1348
01:09:14.464 --> 01:09:15.987
Yes. alright. ciao.

1349
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.843
- I'm sorry. it took me so long.
- It's so funny.

1350
01:09:18.962 --> 01:09:21.889
My father would always say when
drinking you should never mix

1351
01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:23.693
grain and grape together.

1352
01:09:24.074 --> 01:09:26.053
But I think they
go really good.

1353
01:09:28.508 --> 01:09:29.940
I think we should split.

1354
01:09:30.853 --> 01:09:31.917
We should split?

1355
01:09:36.283 --> 01:09:40.153
Gatsby. if you always intended to
come you should've told us.

1356
01:09:40.645 --> 01:09:42.939
You know I am
not fond of surprises.

1357
01:09:43.398 --> 01:09:47.193
Mother. Dad. this is
my girlfriend Ashleigh Enright.

1358
01:09:47.514 --> 01:09:48.432
Hi. how are you?

1359
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:51.234
- How lovely to meet you. Ashleigh.
- You too.

1360
01:09:51.299 --> 01:09:53.181
- One's a pleasure.
- Hi. how are you?

1361
01:09:53.181 --> 01:09:54.694
- I'm well. thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

1362
01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:58.240
- I've done business with your father.
- Yes. he speaks very highly of you.

1363
01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:01.493
Actually. I've never
met him. it's his bank.

1364
01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:03.787
Yes. he's got so many banks.

1365
01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.108
How are things at Yardley?

1366
01:10:07.419 --> 01:10:11.256
It's very quiet. we get a lot of snow
in the winter. that sort of thing.

1367
01:10:11.633 --> 01:10:13.828
Very rural. but I chose 
it because they have

1368
01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:16.338
a great Kurdish 
studies program. yes.

1369
01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:18.196
Have you thought
more about the career?

1370
01:10:18.196 --> 01:10:21.616
Your father was bemoaning the fact
that you are still undecided.

1371
01:10:22.243 --> 01:10:23.753
I have. Leonard.

1372
01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:25.922
I want to go into nuclear physics

1373
01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.558
and maybe open a little 
store and sell dark matter.

1374
01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:30.353
He's kidding you. No.

1375
01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:34.118
He likes to sit at the piano
and sing. and play blackjack.

1376
01:10:34.859 --> 01:10:38.812
And when you were a boy. your mother
wanted you to be a concert pianist.

1377
01:10:39.543 --> 01:10:41.307
She always had 
big plans for me.

1378
01:10:41.307 --> 01:10:43.202
How about you. Ashleigh?
What are your plans?

1379
01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:46.205
- She wants to be a journalist. actually.
- TV or print?

1380
01:10:46.321 --> 01:10:48.725
- Political stuff. she'll report from all of the...
- TV. I'd like to do the weather.

1381
01:10:48.959 --> 01:10:49.954
Troubled spots.

1382
01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.357
On the weather.

1383
01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:57.312
Right.

1384
01:11:00.007 --> 01:11:04.025
You've been staring at Ashleigh all
night long. is there something wrong?

1385
01:11:04.531 --> 01:11:06.708
There is something
about that girl.

1386
01:11:06.857 --> 01:11:08.297
She's quite pretty.

1387
01:11:08.641 --> 01:11:11.039
And sophisticated for 
a young girl.

1388
01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.825
Come on in.

1389
01:11:25.756 --> 01:11:27.007
- Look at this place.
- Nice. isn't it?

1390
01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:31.740
What was that all about with
Ted Davidoff and Rollie Pollard?

1391
01:11:32.854 --> 01:11:33.951
We were just talking.

1392
01:11:34.218 --> 01:11:35.571
Yeah? Alright.

1393
01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:37.936
Don't worry.

1394
01:11:38.849 --> 01:11:41.252
I'm sure they are very interested
in that story you are writing.

1395
01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:43.802
Today has been 
quite a story.

1396
01:11:45.879 --> 01:11:48.672
And that's just the beginning.
Please. sit down.

1397
01:11:49.512 --> 01:11:50.546
Relax.

1398
01:11:52.816 --> 01:11:54.109
This is really amazing.

1399
01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:56.382
She's very charming.

1400
01:11:56.853 --> 01:11:59.126
And hot. you didn't
say Ashleigh was hot.

1401
01:11:59.276 --> 01:12:01.612
- I told you she was sexy.
- Is she older than you?

1402
01:12:02.632 --> 01:12:03.550
She looks older.

1403
01:12:04.914 --> 01:12:06.791
That's what you want.
a little experience.

1404
01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:10.064
You have to grow up
and have a profession.

1405
01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:12.738
You think a girl like that
wants to live hand to mouth.

1406
01:12:13.464 --> 01:12:14.924
Funny you should
put it that way.

1407
01:12:16.751 --> 01:12:18.920
Keep your hand on
the wheel. Ashleigh.

1408
01:12:20.932 --> 01:12:23.120
He obviously wants
to go to bed with you.

1409
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.740
How do you feel about this?

1410
01:12:29.055 --> 01:12:30.098
You have a boyfriend.

1411
01:12:31.766 --> 01:12:32.683
Yes. but...

1412
01:12:34.526 --> 01:12:36.110
This is Francisco Vega.

1413
01:12:37.904 --> 01:12:40.113
Apart from him. being so sexy.

1414
01:12:41.799 --> 01:12:43.486
He's an international icon.

1415
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:47.119
Mahatma Gandhi.

1416
01:12:48.147 --> 01:12:49.273
How can you say no?

1417
01:12:50.816 --> 01:12:52.818
This is the story you can
tell your grandchildren.

1418
01:12:54.487 --> 01:12:55.696
May I show you upstairs?

1419
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:58.263
Sure.

1420
01:12:58.592 --> 01:13:00.593
If you liked it here. you're
going to love it over there.

1421
01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:01.781
Okay.

1422
01:13:02.793 --> 01:13:04.031
I got us some whiskey.

1423
01:13:06.788 --> 01:13:07.873
Is this where you sleep?

1424
01:13:08.444 --> 01:13:09.599
Yeah.

1425
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.266
when I sleep.

1426
01:13:12.459 --> 01:13:15.871
You can see the whole apartment
from here. it's quite special.

1427
01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:17.471
- Nice.
- Yeah. I know.

1428
01:13:18.087 --> 01:13:19.005
I know.

1429
01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:30.523
Let me help you.

1430
01:13:34.407 --> 01:13:35.575
Look at you.

1431
01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:39.663
Who the hell is that?
Give me a sec.

1432
01:13:40.901 --> 01:13:43.362
- Yes?
- It's Tiffany! I'm home!

1433
01:13:44.609 --> 01:13:46.531
I thought you two
weren't together anymore.

1434
01:13:46.531 --> 01:13:47.924
No. we...
Oh no!

1435
01:13:48.747 --> 01:13:49.563
Wait a second.

1436
01:13:50.315 --> 01:13:51.472
It's going to be fine.

1437
01:13:52.206 --> 01:13:53.810
You said that you weren't
together anymore.

1438
01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:54.859
Yeah. I know...

1439
01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.761
You know what.
you have to hide there.

1440
01:13:56.908 --> 01:13:58.135
Go behind that door.

1441
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.587
Go. she can't see you.
Go.

1442
01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:14.491
- Surprise! Hi!
- What are you doing here?

1443
01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.614
We wrapped 2 days early.

1444
01:14:15.614 --> 01:14:17.944
I'm so glad you are home 
it's starting to pour.

1445
01:14:18.531 --> 01:14:19.740
I just got off the plane.

1446
01:14:21.465 --> 01:14:23.355
I bet you weren't
expecting me.

1447
01:14:23.811 --> 01:14:25.099
I'm loving this.

1448
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.403
Fransciso. why are you...
What are you doing running around?

1449
01:14:30.781 --> 01:14:32.425
Getting ready for you.

1450
01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:39.509
Welcome back.

1451
01:14:41.265 --> 01:14:44.268
I just got off the plane.
We wrapped 2 days early.

1452
01:14:45.171 --> 01:14:48.591
I came right from airport.
I knew If I'm being surprise I'll arouse you.

1453
01:14:52.194 --> 01:14:54.405
Baby. I've missed you.

1454
01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.874
Yeah. me too.

1455
01:14:55.874 --> 01:14:57.207
I've missed you too.

1456
01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:04.582
What was that?

1457
01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:09.862
- I didn't hear anything.
- I'm sure I heard something.

1458
01:15:16.582 --> 01:15:17.594
- Baby.
- One sec.

1459
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:27.627
Come back. that was nothing.

1460
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:34.666
Excuse me. which
way the Waldorfl is?

1461
01:16:37.079 --> 01:16:38.691
What's on your mind. mother?

1462
01:16:43.193 --> 01:16:44.738
I want to have
a word with you.

1463
01:16:44.915 --> 01:16:45.618
No. no.

1464
01:16:45.618 --> 01:16:47.584
Please don't do this
to me tonight. mom.

1465
01:16:47.718 --> 01:16:50.848
I'm not really in the mood for one of
your tete-a-tete's where I come out

1466
01:16:50.848 --> 01:16:53.827
on the short end as always.
I really couldn't take it tonight.

1467
01:16:53.945 --> 01:16:55.499
Okay?
Where is Ashleigh?

1468
01:16:55.499 --> 01:16:58.479
- I asked her to leave.
- What? Why?

1469
01:16:58.626 --> 01:17:00.670
Don't give me that
Ashleigh bullshit.

1470
01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:03.014
I smelled hooker the second
she walked through the door.

1471
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:04.797
Mother. do you
hear yourself?

1472
01:17:05.424 --> 01:17:07.249
Damn right I hear myself.

1473
01:17:07.728 --> 01:17:09.183
I'm shoked.

1474
01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:13.003
Okay. I apologise.

1475
01:17:14.303 --> 01:17:17.033
I met her in the bar at Carlyle
and I gave her five thousand bucks

1476
01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.984
to pretend she was Ashleigh.
who has dumped me.

1477
01:17:19.984 --> 01:17:21.525
Five thousand?!

1478
01:17:21.749 --> 01:17:25.127
It was worth that much for you
to make a fool of your father and me?

1479
01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.328
I was in a bad mood. it was
my idea of a joke.

1480
01:17:28.328 --> 01:17:29.910
So it was a bad joke. okay?

1481
01:17:30.075 --> 01:17:33.996
I won a lot in a card game. so...
It was an act of rebellion.

1482
01:17:34.206 --> 01:17:37.251
- It was an act of hostility.
- Hostility and rebellion.

1483
01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.613
Rebellion against what?

1484
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.946
Private schools. a nice
home. summers in Europe?

1485
01:17:43.113 --> 01:17:45.530
Against a life of pretentious
appropriateness:

1486
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:48.013
appropriate friends.
appropriate schools.

1487
01:17:48.013 --> 01:17:51.515
appropriate women. that you
may or may not approve of.

1488
01:17:52.142 --> 01:17:55.061
You resent me
because I set a high bar.

1489
01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:57.830
Mother. I don't resent you
because you set a high bar.

1490
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.473
I just want you to see me.

1491
01:17:59.619 --> 01:18:02.652
I'm never going to be like Hunter.
I'm not going to roll off the assembly line

1492
01:18:02.652 --> 01:18:03.919
and make you proud.

1493
01:18:04.151 --> 01:18:07.047
You lied to me when you said that
you were too busy to come to my party.

1494
01:18:07.129 --> 01:18:10.399
That you were too busy at
work. snowed under at Yardley.

1495
01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:14.213
I did lie to you. because I didn't
want to come to your party. alright?

1496
01:18:14.213 --> 01:18:18.223
I wanted to spend the day with Ashleigh
in the city and have a great time.

1497
01:18:18.223 --> 01:18:19.234
Where is Ashleigh?

1498
01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:21.383
I told you she dumped me.
We became separated.

1499
01:18:21.454 --> 01:18:23.135
This city has its own agenda.

1500
01:18:23.313 --> 01:18:25.706
And your rage with 
me is so great

1501
01:18:25.706 --> 01:18:28.426
that you express it by 
bringing home a whore?

1502
01:18:28.426 --> 01:18:29.732
An escort. Mother.

1503
01:18:30.123 --> 01:18:32.024
Let's not split pubic hairs.

1504
01:18:32.345 --> 01:18:35.681
Anything to shake up that
collection of appropriate snobs.

1505
01:18:36.265 --> 01:18:40.895
So you bring her to my gala as
your girlfriend to make a fool of me?

1506
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.165
I'm sorry.

1507
01:18:43.215 --> 01:18:44.130
I don't know why 
I'm like this.

1508
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.125
I don't know where I get this perverse 
streak in my system from.

1509
01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:48.189
I don't know.

1510
01:18:49.254 --> 01:18:50.984
You get it from me.

1511
01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:54.982
I get it from you.
the queen of good taste?

1512
01:18:59.492 --> 01:19:00.368
Alright.

1513
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.994
You're a big enough boy to hear
the whole inappropriate story.

1514
01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:10.208
I met your father.

1515
01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:15.171
in the exact same 
line of work.

1516
01:19:17.215 --> 01:19:18.508
An escort service.

1517
01:19:20.467 --> 01:19:23.178
Or more to the point: hooking.

1518
01:19:24.846 --> 01:19:28.892
As that working girl you
tried to slip pass us as Ashleigh Enright.

1519
01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:31.840
What?

1520
01:19:33.206 --> 01:19:34.540
Lower your eyebrows.

1521
01:19:38.461 --> 01:19:40.582
I knocked on your 
father's hotel room door

1522
01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:42.651
because that's how 
I made my living.

1523
01:19:44.126 --> 01:19:45.503
Fresh from Gary. Indiana.

1524
01:19:47.688 --> 01:19:53.735
Providing the lonely male of the
species with a little casual recreation.

1525
01:19:55.181 --> 01:19:56.099
For a fee.

1526
01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:01.422
Except in you father's
case we fell in love.

1527
01:20:03.696 --> 01:20:05.555
And not only do we marry.

1528
01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:09.721
Winston used my hardened
nest egg to start the company

1529
01:20:10.179 --> 01:20:13.766
that has enabled us to
live a pretty privileged life.

1530
01:20:15.022 --> 01:20:17.858
You following?
Or am I going too fast?

1531
01:20:20.319 --> 01:20:22.112
And I put myself
through school.

1532
01:20:22.279 --> 01:20:26.408
so my brilliant young son
can laugh at my pretentious.

1533
01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:36.215
What I'm saying is that. if I have
been to over too far in my pursuit

1534
01:20:36.215 --> 01:20:40.541
of the finer things and
of cultivating an image.

1535
01:20:41.923 --> 01:20:44.259
If I have caused
you some discomfort.

1536
01:20:46.255 --> 01:20:49.569
It's only an overzealous 
ex-professional hustler

1537
01:20:49.569 --> 01:20:52.273
from the mid west. 
trying to erradicate

1538
01:20:53.568 --> 01:20:59.083
unsavory remnants of many hotel
rooms I still wake up screaming over.

1539
01:21:00.278 --> 01:21:03.466
And if you can't understand
where you get your

1540
01:21:03.466 --> 01:21:06.433
mysterious urge to consort
with a demi-monde.

1541
01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:09.949
You have my genes.

1542
01:21:13.781 --> 01:21:17.576
And I'm sorry to lay this X-rated tale
on my sweet college boy.

1543
01:21:17.677 --> 01:21:20.814
but something tells
me that the time is right.

1544
01:21:48.384 --> 01:21:51.178
Just put on the chairs and
then we done. alright?

1545
01:21:52.763 --> 01:21:54.724
- Hey. Gatsby.
- Hey. Johnny.

1546
01:22:43.104 --> 01:22:44.647
I saw you on television.

1547
01:22:49.011 --> 01:22:50.047
Nothing happened.

1548
01:22:51.445 --> 01:22:53.990
I'm really exhausted.
I've been walking forever.

1549
01:22:54.532 --> 01:22:55.964
And then I got 
lost on the train.

1550
01:22:55.964 --> 01:22:58.442
Ashleigh. you were
with a famous movie star.

1551
01:22:59.061 --> 01:23:00.492
But nothing happened.

1552
01:23:00.943 --> 01:23:02.163
I'd love to believe you.

1553
01:23:04.915 --> 01:23:07.877
Just too many drinks.
too much weed.

1554
01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:11.739
I'm just a little
too tired to explain.

1555
01:23:12.474 --> 01:23:16.019
Tomorrow. I promise. but really
Gatsby. nothing happened.

1556
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.435
Take off your rain coat. I'm going to
get you some black coffee.

1557
01:23:22.739 --> 01:23:24.783
I can't. I have no 
clothes underneath.

1558
01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:31.965
So with Roland Pollard
it was like a spiritual thing.

1559
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:35.259
I was his muse. some 
inspiration because he's...

1560
01:23:35.731 --> 01:23:38.150
Really going through a 
rough creative period.

1561
01:23:38.818 --> 01:23:42.738
And also. my name is totally 
the same as his first wife's.

1562
01:23:42.908 --> 01:23:46.119
Who also went to Yardley.
Who he's never really gotten over.

1563
01:23:46.411 --> 01:23:47.990
And then Ted Davidoff.

1564
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:52.584
He was just absolutely traumatized 
by this affair his wife was having

1565
01:23:52.584 --> 01:23:53.843
with his best friend.

1566
01:23:53.912 --> 01:23:55.222
And there I was. you know.

1567
01:23:55.355 --> 01:24:00.658
Just a person there to talk to. 
to hold his hand. during the crisis.

1568
01:24:01.294 --> 01:24:02.629
What about Francisco Vega?

1569
01:24:03.525 --> 01:24:05.777
Like James Dean. 
minus the acting chops?

1570
01:24:05.937 --> 01:24:09.538
Francisco Vega was just after my body.
But I was onto him.

1571
01:24:09.832 --> 01:24:12.230
And I have a terrific 
material for a hot story.

1572
01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:13.447
I dated a hunk.

1573
01:24:14.303 --> 01:24:15.513
What about you?

1574
01:24:16.435 --> 01:24:18.645
How was going to 
your Mom's fahrey?

1575
01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.732
It was pretty nice. actually.

1576
01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.523
We got in a sort of a 
crazy conversation.

1577
01:24:26.945 --> 01:24:29.943
For the first time in my life 
she surprised me in a good way.

1578
01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:32.506
Now I feel closer to her.

1579
01:24:34.028 --> 01:24:37.031
Must have been a big talk.
What did you discuss?

1580
01:24:38.671 --> 01:24:40.048
The oldest profession.

1581
01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:42.744
Journalism?

1582
01:24:44.408 --> 01:24:45.826
That's the second oldest.

1583
01:24:47.051 --> 01:24:49.887
Let's put it in this way. she's a 
lot more than I gave her credit for.

1584
01:24:51.006 --> 01:24:52.132
I sold her short.

1585
01:24:53.192 --> 01:24:55.778
What a shame we never 
got to take that carriage ride.

1586
01:24:55.945 --> 01:24:57.260
We can still do it.

1587
01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.302
We have plenty of 
time. we can get it in.

1588
01:24:59.839 --> 01:25:01.397
Said the John to my mom.

1589
01:25:02.022 --> 01:25:03.985
- What?
- Nothing.

1590
01:25:04.202 --> 01:25:06.204
We should probably leave 
our luggage downstairs.

1591
01:25:06.627 --> 01:25:09.088
As you know I'd hate to 
miss our bus back to Yardley.

1592
01:25:21.642 --> 01:25:23.227
New York on a misty day.

1593
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:27.564
I can't tell why it means something 
to me. but it means everything.

1594
01:25:29.595 --> 01:25:32.139
It's only one carriage ride 
and the weather's gloomy.

1595
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:38.719
I couldn't really sleep last night.
Did you hear all those fire engines?

1596
01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:39.682
I did.

1597
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:42.198
The roaring traffic's boom.

1598
01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:44.871
Silence in my lonely room.

1599
01:25:45.268 --> 01:25:48.397
I know that! That's from 
Shakespeare. right?

1600
01:25:55.404 --> 01:25:56.696
Sir. would you stop 
for a second?

1601
01:25:57.427 --> 01:26:00.222
- Why are we stoping?
- Ashleigh. you go back to Yardley.

1602
01:26:00.632 --> 01:26:02.606
- I'm going to stay in New York.
- What?

1603
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.909
I need a carbon 
monoxide to survive.

1604
01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.913
- What are you talking about?
- We are two different creatures. right?

1605
01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.958
You like the sound of crickets 
and I like the rattle of the taxies.

1606
01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:14.277
You blosom in 
the sun and me...

1607
01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:16.281
I come into my 
own under grey skies.

1608
01:26:16.843 --> 01:26:19.929
You were a big hit here. you 
are a crackerjack reporter.

1609
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.922
You were loved spiritually. emotionally and 
physically by 3 gifted men. right?

1610
01:26:24.122 --> 01:26:25.402
- Yeah.
- You don't want to be with me.

1611
01:26:25.402 --> 01:26:26.898
You deserve better than I am.

1612
01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:29.483
Are you dropping 
out of Yardley?

1613
01:26:30.736 --> 01:26:32.219
If I won't sound 
to pretentious:

1614
01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:33.931
I want to review
my other options.

1615
01:26:33.931 --> 01:26:36.309
Excuse me. sir. do you think 
it's possible to take her to Pierre hotel?

1616
01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:38.842
- Gatsby. I do not understand.
- You take this. Just take this.

1617
01:26:39.177 --> 01:26:40.972
Get your luggage 
and return to Yardley.

1618
01:26:41.994 --> 01:26:43.915
So you're not 
coming back to Yardley?

1619
01:26:44.865 --> 01:26:47.119
I don't know Ash. I have to 
figure some stuff out of my life.

1620
01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:49.997
Have a great trip and you tell 
everybody at Yardley I said goodbye.

1621
01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:52.041
So you're not 
coming back to Yardley?

1622
01:26:53.427 --> 01:26:54.735
Gatsby.

1623
01:26:54.979 --> 01:26:56.609
Wait. sir. I'm...

1624
01:26:57.784 --> 01:26:59.880
Gatsby. I don't understand.

1625
01:27:09.263 --> 01:27:12.516
Could you hurry?
I think it's starting to rain.

1626
01:28:49.427 --> 01:28:51.134
How did I know you'd be here.

1627
01:28:51.134 --> 01:28:53.547
You didn't think I was going 
to blow this moment. did you?

1628
01:28:53.547 --> 01:28:55.234
What about the skin doctor?

1629
01:28:55.595 --> 01:29:00.090
Very handsome. very rich 
and very clever. but I'm here.

1630
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:03.164
For a kiss that was a 
maximum of an eight?

1631
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:06.858
It's fall.
By spring I'll have you up to 10.

1632
