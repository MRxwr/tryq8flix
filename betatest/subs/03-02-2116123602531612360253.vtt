In my whole life.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.583
Ever since I was a little donkey.

00:01:55.583 --> 00:02:00.208

00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.916
You have just one question left.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:16.541
If you answer correctly.
you'll be a millionaire.

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.541
and that question will be
coming up on your screen now.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.833

00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.875
Better wake up. you can't
just lay in bed and sleep.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:32.791
You gotta get up and face the world.

00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.000
- Is this is my Phone a Friend?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.291
- Hurry up. Mangu. you only
have 10 measly seconds left.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.291

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.083
You can't sleep all day. wake up. Donkey.

- I did it. I won. I'm so
happy. I'm a millionaire.

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:53.416
I'm a millionaire. I bet
you're proud of me. huh?

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:54.250
Hi. Uncle.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.458
- Don't sit there and "Hi" me. lazy bones.

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:58.500
- Oh. dear Uncle Perry.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.833
you woke me up 10 seconds
before I became rich.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.833
I would have been the
first donkey millionaire

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:07.583
in the history of Azad
City. I would have a big.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:09.750
beautiful house. a fiery sports car.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.916

- What's with all the hugging?

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.125
Stop the hugging. stop it.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.875
Listen. Mangu. when will you
stop living in a fantasy?

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.958
- Oh. no. Uncle. my father said.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.666
"Anything is possible if you dream it.

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.750
"Let your dreams shift your world."

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.708
- You're so naive. that is
not how the world works.

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:58.541
You come from a long line
of donkeys who died poor.

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.708
The same will happen to
you. you can't change that.

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:01.541
- Cut it out.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.875
- Your father. my brother. Changu.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.375
he was a dreamer and it didn't
do him any good. did it?

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:06.333
- Uncle Perry.

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.625
- It's about time for you
to join the real world.

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.958
Get yourself to work and
start washing these clothes.

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.041
Here you go.

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:14.333
- [Mangu] This pile is huge.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:15.666
- Of course it is.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.458
that's because today
is the Jungle Festival.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:20.291
All the clothes in Azad City
need to be washed today.

00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.125
Get going. forgot one. wait just a sec.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.583
You better be very careful with this.

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:26.750
it is incredibly special.
it's the royal robe

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.791
of the King Sun Prince Shazad.

00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:32.291
Gotta get out there and

- Every time.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.041
Oh. Father. I wish you were here.

00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.958
I'm afraid Uncle Perry is right.

00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.375
Can't spend my entire life dreaming

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:54.375
of things that will never happen.

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.416
- [Changu] How dare you lose faith?

00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:57.375
- [Mangu] You're alive?

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:59.958
- Of course not. you're
dreaming. which is good.

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.291
- But Uncle Perry says
I have to stop dreaming

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:04.791
because it won't lead to anything good.

00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:06.583
- My brother's a fool. if you dream

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:09.791
about what you want.
you can make it happen.

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:14.791
- But Dad. be real. we're a
family of donkeys. (brays)

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.083
I rest my case.

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:21.916
- Mangu. my son. listen. a
good donkey can do anything.

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:24.583
but you must first trust in yourself.

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.458
Only then do you have the opportunity

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:30.375
to reach your full potential.
got it. I'm watching.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.416
- I'll try harder.

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.416
- [Uncle Perry] What's the holdup. Mangu?

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:36.333
- Cool down. Uncle Perry.
I'll be there in a minute.

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:39.333
Oh. no. how am I gonna explain this?

00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:45.333
Not good. Mangu. the prince
is gonna chop your ears off.

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:48.583
and then he may eat them.
'cause they're full of protein.

00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:50.958
- [Uncle Perry] Back to work. Mangu.

00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.875
- All right. I'm going.

00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:57.125
(slow orchestral music)

00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:12.875
- The Jungle Festival is tomorrow.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:15.541
The palace is raising taxes to pay for it.

00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:17.958
Read all about it. it's all in the paper.

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.166
How will you ever know what

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:22.291
to think if you don't buy a newspaper?

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:24.458
Buy a paper here. buy a paper here.

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:26.333
- I've got some very
good stuff in my cart.

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.458
- [Monkey] What is wrong with you people?

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:28.833
- [Hawker] Two for the price of one.

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:30.583
two for the price of one.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.833
- My bamboo is like
anything you've ever seen.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.666
We've got (mumbles) on the map.

00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:36.833
- [Hawker] I've got something good here.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.083
I've got something good here.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.166
âª When will you come to
meet me. my dream girl âª

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:43.958
- Stop. stop. you dare knock on my face?

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.250
You're just a washerman.
- Here.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.208
- A no one.

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:49.208
- I disagree. there's no
shame in being a washerman.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:51.958
The president of the United
States is a washerman.

00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:52.791
- What?

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.541
- He lives in Washing Town.
Washing Town. Washing Town.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.458
- Are you crazy?

00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:58.708
- I'm serious. and of
course you're familiar

00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:01.375
with the rapper who's also a washerman.

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:02.583
- What?

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:06.125
âª Soap doggy dog âª

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:09.458
(slow orchestral music)

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.416
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:16.250
Huh?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.250
Whoa. brother. here's
your shirt. I ironed it.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.125
- Wait. this ain't right.

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:30.125
- I know. it's such a nasty stain.

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.708
- How did it get on my shirt?

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:33.041
- You wanted the shirt dry cleaned.

00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:34.916
I hope you know that's
a very delicate process.

00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:35.750
- So?

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:40.000
- So I spit on it and I ironed it flat.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.916
- You spit on my shirt?

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:46.208
- Stop him. stop him.
don't let him get away.

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:47.541
I want his head.

00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:51.041
(lively orchestral music)

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.375
- I'm not the guy. I'm not even a donkey.

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:24.416
It's a common mistake.
can't you see I'm a zebra?

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:28.750
No. I don't want to go. no. (cries)

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:31.958
I can't believe this. it'll take forever

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.458
to get rid of the smell.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:37.166
- [Group] We demand a
fair share in Azad City.

00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:40.583
We demand a fair share in Azad City.

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:44.125
Down with the 1%. down with the 1%.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.333
- Hey. Zandar Bear. why the protests?

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.708
- Mangu. this is not just a protest.

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:51.416
We're taking a stand against the rich.

00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:54.166
- But what if one day I
suddenly become a rich donkey?

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.541
Will you protest me?

00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:59.625
- Mangu. open your eyes. they'll
never let you become rich.

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.541
The game is rigged
against ordinary people.

00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:04.125
It's time for a change.

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.708
corruption as we've seen cannot continue.

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:08.541
- [Group] Down with the 1%.

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:11.875
(overlapping chattering)

00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:16.875
(car engine revs)
(slow hip hop music)

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.166
- Who was that?

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:33.041
(Zandar chuckles)

00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:35.708
- Mangu. that is the royal Prince Shazad.

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:38.333
the spoiled brat who thinks
he'll become king soon.

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:40.583
- Oh. gosh. I have to get to the palace

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:43.833
and deliver his royal
robe. goodbye. Zandar.

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:45.541
And goats. keep up that good protesting.

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:48.958
(overlapping chattering)

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:53.791
(slow orchestral music)

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.833
My goodness. it's such a huge palace.

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.833
(bell clangs)

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:10.125
(whimsical orchestral music)

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:21.666
Who are you?

00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:24.291
- Me. I am Fitna. the fox.

00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:26.541
No one enters the palace unless I say.

00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:29.750
I am the special advisor
to His Majesty. the king.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.708
And you. what is your
name. and why are you here?

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:35.333
- My name is is Mambo. no. it's not.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.000
It's Mangu. the washing machine.

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:40.500
- You're a machine?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.375
- No. I'm a donkey. I use the
machine to do the laundry.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:45.583
I brought the robe. I have
to give it to the prince.

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:47.208
- You're a fool. but you serve a purpose.

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.416
I'll just take this.

00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:52.458
- No. Madame. I like
to deliver this myself.

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.250
Please let me deliver his robe.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.625
I want to meet the prince.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:56.666
- I will take it.

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:58.958
- No. I want to take it to him myself.

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.166
I may never have another
golden opportunity

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:04.583
to meet royalty. (brays)

00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.875
Please. please let me do it.

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:11.500
- Okay. just once. just this once.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.958
you may deliver it. then go.

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.541
(Mangu laughs)

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.500
(slow orchestral music)

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.416
- Wow. it reminds me of
nowhere I've ever been.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.333
Huh?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.458
Help. somebody. help!

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:34.583
The prince is on the
floor. he's not moving.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.750
and I think something
terrible has happened!

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.625
I swear I didn't do anything. (cries)

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:43.958
- Chill out. I didn't fall. I'm fine.

00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.125
I'm just snapping a selfie. you donkey.

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:49.125
- Oh. sorry. sorry. you're not dead.

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:54.000
Yes. I see that now.
(laughs) I have your robe.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.750
Here we go. here we go.
here we go. here we go.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.041
Here we go. here we go. here we go.

00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.041
here we go. here we go.
here we go. your royal robe.

00:12:59.041 --> 00:13:01.166
- What. there's a huge hole in it.

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:04.291
I've had animals shaved
for less than this.

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:07.958
- Prince. if I may speak. the
robe is not ruined at all.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.500
In fact. from what I heard.
it's the newest fashion

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.000
on the scene. it's the very
first air conditioned robe

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.958
in the world.

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:15.791
- What?

00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.791
- Anyone who is anyone has one.

00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:20.625
I wish I had one. look
what you can do with it.

00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:23.625
As you walk about. you can
wag your tail around all day

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.208
and really strut your stuff.

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:27.500
The ladies go crazy when they see it.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.416
- Really. the ladies love it?

00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.000
- Yeah. it drives them wild.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.500
- Wow. I'm so putting this on.

00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:39.291
Miss Fitna. hey. Miss Fitna?

00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:40.916
Where's my fox when I need here?

00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:42.583
Hey. Miss Fitna--

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:45.291
- You know I'm never
ever far away from you.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.708
What can I do for you. my prince?

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:49.625
- How do you think I look. Miss Fitna?

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:50.833
I look amazing?

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.750
- Wow. it's to die for.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.666
Check yourself in the mirror.

00:13:56.666 --> 00:14:00.000
- I look cool. I look
too good for this world.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.500
It's a curse. beauty is a curse.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.458
and it's mine to bear. (cries)

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:09.333
But I do look good. so good.

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:10.625
- I wonder if between them.

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:15.125
they even have half a brain. (laughs)

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:19.250
Good morning. your highness. am I busy?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.250
No. not at all. not too
busy for you. right now?

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:26.500
Yes. sir. right away. hmm.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.833
- Attention. all rise and
pay homage to the king

00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:37.166
as he graces us with his royal presence.

00:14:39.583 --> 00:14:42.666
(slow fanfare music)

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.208
- You may proceed.

00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:57.708
- Yes. Your Majesty.

00:14:57.708 --> 00:15:00.625
preparations for the Jungle
Festival are underway.

00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:03.041
We've spared no expense. my Lord.

00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:06.375
a royal photographer. a
decadent feast to enjoy.

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:09.916
and we've hired your favorite
artist to sing for you.

00:15:09.916 --> 00:15:14.166
- Very good. very good.
everything must be perfect.

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:17.541
Today's festival is important.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.833
I am going to make a royal announcement.

00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:24.458
- Announcement. my Lord?

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:27.708
- Calm yourself. super guard. control.

00:15:27.708 --> 00:15:32.625
Everything will be revealed
at today's festival. (sighs)

00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:36.958
That is all.
(slow orchestral music)

00:15:39.791 --> 00:15:42.375
- My Lord. as usual I'm here for you.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.875
Whatever you wish. I will provide.

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:47.416
- Of course you will. Fitna.

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:50.416
I need your advice on a delicate matter.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.250
- You need my advice?

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.375
- Fitna. more than anyone.

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:56.750
you know how long I've
been sitting on the throne.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.250
But I don't feel I can continue my duties.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.500
My arthritis has gotten worse.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.416
I'm even having trouble
with my. don't ask.

00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:08.291
I believe it's now time for young Shazad

00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:11.375
to replace me and ascend to my throne.

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:12.375
- You don't mean--

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:15.708
- Ah. the announcement
I will make today is.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:19.125
from this day forward. the
prince shall take his place

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:20.333
on the throne.

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:21.791
- You mean Prince Shazad?

00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:23.458
- Yes. you agree?

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:26.625
- Well. what an idea.
what a great idea. sir.

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:29.250
- I will admit to you that
I do have some concerns.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.583
- Concern. what's your concern?

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.541
- I know the prince is immature.

00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:37.750
He's always on Facebook. putting
up nonsense like selfies.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.458
That's why I'm not sure
he's ready for the throne.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.375
- Sadly. it's true. my Lord.

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:45.041
The prince can be very immature.

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:48.125
self absorbed. and rather simple minded.

00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:51.041
In fact. there's some who
would say he's no lion at all--

00:16:51.041 --> 00:16:51.875
- Who says that?

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:54.750
- Well. I don't say that.
I don't say that at all.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.541
- Very good. very good.

00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.500
- I'm sure once the prince
is sitting comfortably

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500
on the throne.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.750
he'll become exactly the
king we all know he can be.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.625
- Really?

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.416
- But of course. my King. of course.

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:07.375
- Fitna. you can't deny one thing.

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.291
The prince is not very
popular with the animals

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:12.041
of this country. so I doubt
they would accept him.

00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:13.625
We can't expect to live peacefully

00:17:13.625 --> 00:17:15.208
if the animals are unhappy.

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:17.291
- Animals. they'll do what we tell them.

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:19.708
- No. Fitna. no way.
this country's love is

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:23.458
what gives him strength. a
king must rule with his heart.

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:27.083
Otherwise. his time on the
throne won't be very long.

00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:29.666
So the animals must love him.

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.583
- There is a way. of course.

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:34.041
but I don't think you're
gonna like it very much.

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:34.875
- Fitna?

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:36.333
- My Lord. what if we were

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:40.166
to turn our great nation into a democracy

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:43.000
and let the animals choose
the king themselves?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.583
- Democracy. what kind
of nonsense is that?

00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:48.083
- Only for public. just for show.

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:52.625
but our democracy will in
reality be a hypocrisy.

00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.750
We control everything.
animals will think they voted

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.500
for a king. but except
everything's been already fixed.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.708
As long as things go according
to plan. the prince wins.

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:04.083
It's the same way humans choose

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.250
their own king all over
the world. you see?

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.500
- No. no way. I refuse to copy them.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.333
- Eh?

00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:14.083
- I refuse to sink my throne
to their level. we are done.

00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:21.041
Democracy. election. (scoffs)
what will they think of next?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.916
- Miss Fitna--

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:25.875
- I didn't do it.

00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:27.958
Godzilla. where have you been?

00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.083
- In here. but hiding from
the king. he scares me.

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.458
You have to admit it yourself.

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:33.291
he scares you as well. right?

00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:37.208
You don't want to have
your pretty head cut off.

00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:41.833
- Scared. (laughs) far
from it. you scaly fool.

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:44.958
Yes. lions and elephants
are stronger than I.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:49.333
but the last time you went to
a circus. did you see a fox?

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:53.125
Go on. have you ever seen
a fox dance in a circus?

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:54.833
- Madame. I only go to the circus

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.041
because I want to see the clowns.

00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:58.625
Oh. I forgot. I also have a sweet tooth.

00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:00.333
so I always get the cotton candy.

00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:02.958
- You talk such foolish
nonsense. you coward.

00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.208
I have a plan. where's Jambora?

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:06.750
He's the one I need.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.333
- You know how Jambora is.

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.875
He's either out there putting
on a show. or he's dead.

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.166
- I don't care what he's doing.

brought me today. a scandal?

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.375
- Jambora. can you tell me
why you keep that thing?

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.083
- These monkeys truly represent

00:20:28.083 --> 00:20:31.500
our three guiding principles. speak evil.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.250
hear evil. and show evil.
because evil means big ratings.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.416
and big ratings means big money. (laughs)

- Okay. here it is. listen closely.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.916
King Khan has decided something crazy.

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.375

Although I gotta admit.

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:37.416
I don't think it's
gonna be anything great.

00:21:37.416 --> 00:21:42.250
- No. no. I bet he's gonna give
Prince Shazad a new Ferrari.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:47.041
Hey. it's Mangu. hey. donkey
boy. we got a score to settle.

00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:49.125
- Huh. the Bull Brothers?

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:50.750
Feet. don't fail me now.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.250
(lively orchestral music)

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:09.583

is anyone brave enough

00:22:09.583 --> 00:22:14.541
to risk his life?
(audience cheers)

00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:18.375
A volunteer. this wonderful
donkey will risk his life

00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:19.958
and limb for your amusement.

00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:20.791
- No. no. no--

00:22:20.791 --> 00:22:21.958
- You're a brave donkey.
- No. no. no. no. no.

00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:23.708
- A very brave donkey.
- No. no. no. no. no.

00:22:23.708 --> 00:22:25.458
- I hope you've notified your next of kin.

00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:27.625
- There's been a mistake. I can't fight.

00:22:27.625 --> 00:22:30.750
- It's Mangu versus Tsunami.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.416
(Tsunami roars)

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:39.041
(Mangu trembles)

00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:42.291
(dramatic brass music)

00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:46.458
- My nephew. that bull is gonna kill him.

00:22:46.458 --> 00:22:48.041
Who will do the washing?

00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:51.041
- That silly little donkey.
two seconds. he'll be dead.

00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:52.041
- Make that just one.

00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:53.458
- No. no. no. no.

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:59.375
My friend. let's just
talk instead of fighting.

00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:00.500
A little chat?

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.916
(whistle tweets)

00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:05.083
(upbeat guitar music)

00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:12.833
(audience cheers)

(upbeat orchestral music)

00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:31.916
(audience cheers)

00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:34.875
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:37.708
(Mangu cries out)

00:23:40.833 --> 00:23:45.833
(audience cheers)
(upbeat orchestral music)

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:50.041
- Mangu. use this to hypnotize him.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:55.791
(slow Carnatic music)

00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:10.541
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:16.875
(Tsunami snorts)

00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:22.000
(audience cheers)

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.375
(Tsunami farts)

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:24.708
- He beat him?

00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:28.041
We'd better go before he comes after us.

00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:32.666
- Ladies and gentlemen.
Mangu beat Tsunami.

00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:36.375
He was the one person brave
enough to take on the bull.

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:40.041
And now His Majesty. King
Khan. has an announcement.

00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:43.375
(slow orchestral music)

00:24:45.416 --> 00:24:47.833
- Hear me. one and all.

00:24:47.833 --> 00:24:50.833
Although I have spent
my whole life carrying

00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:53.750
and watching over your little lives.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.458
all good things must come to an end.

00:24:56.458 --> 00:24:59.750
And so I hereby announce my departure.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.375
and I shall step down as your king.

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:03.833
But a new king will rise.

00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:05.708
- [Audience] What. a new king?

00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:07.208
- Yes. a new king.

00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:10.666
a king who is younger.

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:13.125
After much consideration. I have come

00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:17.125
to an inescapable conclusion. that yes.

00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:21.291
my young son you know as Prince
Shazad is the best choice

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.875
to take my place on the throne.

00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:31.208
- The prince. he's a spoiled
brat who cares for nobody.

00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:33.458
How will he make a good king?

00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:35.541
- I hear that your prince is a lazy bum.

00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:38.416
I think we should just
reject him. how about you?

00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:41.291
- You're right. no. we
can't accept him as king.

00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:43.708
not the prince. unacceptable.

00:25:44.666 --> 00:25:46.833
(overlapping chattering)

00:25:46.833 --> 00:25:48.708
- [Audience Members] Unacceptable.

00:25:48.708 --> 00:25:52.125
(overlapping chattering)

00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:59.041
- My Lord. the people
are not happy. not happy.

00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.541
(Khan growls)

00:26:03.666 --> 00:26:06.625
- My King. my King. if
you lose your temper now.

00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:08.833
things could get very ugly.

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:11.250
Remember my proposal to hold elections?

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.791
That's the way we get what we want

00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:14.041
and keep the animals happy.

00:26:14.041 --> 00:26:18.583
- Quiet!
(slow orchestral music)

00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:21.000
I have not finished my announcement.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.208
Shazad is my choice. but then
something occurred to me.

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.750
Our nation needs something modern.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.458
You. the animals. should
have rule by democracy.

00:26:31.458 --> 00:26:36.208
You will vote. you shall select
your next king by decree.

00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:40.958
I'm told the humans
have a similar practice.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.208
Now. of all of you. who will step forward

00:26:46.208 --> 00:26:48.666
and run against the prince
for the democratic right

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:51.083
to be your king. huh. anyone?

00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:53.958
- One moment. your Highness.

00:26:53.958 --> 00:26:57.291
how can anyone here possibly
compete with the prince?

00:26:57.291 --> 00:26:59.583
As you know. we are but common animals.

00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:02.333
- No. no. His Majesty has spoken.

00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:04.791
He says the animals will
choose their next king.

00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:07.291
and when His Majesty has made a decision.

00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:09.291
nothing in the world
could change it one bit.

00:27:09.291 --> 00:27:12.750
Isn't that right? (laughs)

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.000
- Of course. of course.
and so it is now decided.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.666
leading the search to find someone

00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:22.416
to run against the prince
will be Fitna here.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:24.875
In exactly two weeks from today.

00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:26.458
we'll hold the first election

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:29.541
in our nation's history. that is all.

00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:37.791
(upbeat poppy music)

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:50.958
- Welcome. ladies and
gentlemen. to "Royal Idol."

00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:52.958
the show where we search the entire nation

00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:56.083
for a reality TV star
to be the brand new king

00:27:56.083 --> 00:28:00.000
of Azadnagar. based on
a 30 second audition.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.375
- Why should you be our new king?

00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:06.625
- To be a good king. you
have to love the people.

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:09.000
and I'm all about loving all the people.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.625
I really do. (laughs) all of them!

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:16.333
- If you make me the king of
the United States of Azadnagar.

00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:19.291
I'll be the best king of
all time. the greatest.

00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:21.083
I will drain the swamp

00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:23.083
'cause nobody will do it better than me.

00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:26.250
And I get the ratings. TVs always love me.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.708
You know you love me.

00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:29.208
- This is a very simple matter.

00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.291
The next king should be a goat like me.

00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:34.791
- A true king has to be able
to move and have perfect pitch.

00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:36.125
We do. let's show them.

00:28:36.125 --> 00:28:37.916
- [Both] One. two. three. four.

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.666
âª Boom. we blow your mind.
boom. we blow your mind âª

00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:41.208
âª Boom. we blow your mind âª

00:28:41.208 --> 00:28:44.875
âª You can't handle our
beat. but you need it âª

00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:48.333
âª It was trapped in your
butts but we freed it âª

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:51.708
âª If you make us the
king. we will see this âª

00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:54.708
- The problem with this
country are the children.

00:28:54.708 --> 00:28:57.083
They are given too much freedom.

00:28:57.083 --> 00:29:00.583
If I am king. they will be
given much less freedom.

00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:02.833
- Hello. hello. you can stop the search.

00:29:02.833 --> 00:29:05.083
I am here. you will make me
the king. what's the holdup?

00:29:05.083 --> 00:29:08.791
I just know you won't let me
have it because I'm a woman.

00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:11.458
- Good evening. ladies and
gentlemen. you know me from MNN.

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:13.208
Today I would like to
break a major scandal

00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:15.958
and speak truth to power.
it pains me to say it.

00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:17.708
but the facts are quite clear.

00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:20.208
Corruption. it's everywhere.
including the king.

00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:22.083
who is robbing the country blind.

00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:24.958
I have to tell you this.
the truth can't be denied.

00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:26.333
The country needs a change.

00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:28.625
and I'm the change the
country needs. vote for me.

00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:30.291
- Audition. audition. audition. audition.

00:29:30.291 --> 00:29:32.833
audition. audition. that is my audition.

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:35.625
It's an excellent audition.
what more do you fools want?

00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:39.000
âª You can't handle our
beat but you need it âª

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.083
(upbeat poppy music)

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:50.791
- Really. this is terrible.

00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:53.125
Watching these wannabes
is giving me a headache.

00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:54.583
Why does this have to be so hard?

00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:56.291
My hat would make a better king.

00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.541
The prince will run unopposed.

00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:01.458
and the king will be so
upset he'll have our heads.

00:30:01.458 --> 00:30:03.583
- No. no. we cannot give up.

00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:06.333
We really must have a
competitive election.

00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:09.000
We need someone to run against the prince.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.375
I don't care if it's a donkey.

00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:12.625
- What. donkey?

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:17.833
Donkey. that's it. Jambora.
a donkey. what an idea.

00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:20.458
Quick. the washerman. what's his name?

00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:21.291
- Mangu?

00:30:21.291 --> 00:30:23.500
- Yes. that's it. go and bring him back.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.166
- But that donkey is such a--

00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:28.916
- I know he's a joke. but he's
a joke that belongs to us.

00:30:28.916 --> 00:30:31.083
He's exactly what we
need in this situation.

00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:33.250
He's someone who will do whatever we say.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.291
We'll come out of this
smelling like roses.

00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:36.875
"Royal Idol" has a winner.

00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:40.416
- "Royal Idol" audition
number 419. take one. action.

00:30:40.416 --> 00:30:42.125
- Hello out there. my name is Mangu.

00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:46.916
and I'll be the donkey king. (brays)

00:30:46.916 --> 00:30:47.750
(Mangu snorts)

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.208
- Cut. cut. cut. you're
terrible. total disaster.

00:30:51.208 --> 00:30:53.000
No one in the world would vote for you.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.333
He belongs in the dumpster.

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:57.666
- This wasn't my idea. anyway.
I'd make a rotten king.

00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:59.208
- Don't talk like that. Mangu.

00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:00.916
You're the perfect choice
to lead this country

00:31:00.916 --> 00:31:03.291
in a new direction. who
better than a donkey

00:31:03.291 --> 00:31:05.541
to bear the burden of leading our people?

00:31:05.541 --> 00:31:07.791
- Oh. no. Madame. I
couldn't possibly do that.

00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:10.125
- Silly Mangu. of course you can.

00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:12.458
Think of the endless possibilities.

00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:16.458
When you're king. you'll have
tons of money. a huge mansion.

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:18.333
a beautiful girlfriend who will shower you

00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:21.250
with love and other things.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.583
- My dream girl?

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:27.333
(slow poppy music)

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:34.416
âª You are my dream girl âª

00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:42.666
âª You are my dream girl âª

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:46.791
- Mangu. yoo hoo. Mangu. Mangu?

00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:48.916
- Yeah. I'm with you.

00:31:48.916 --> 00:31:49.916
- You have to realize

00:31:49.916 --> 00:31:52.750
you can have everything
you've ever wanted.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.583
- Everything?

00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:57.750
- Of course. come with me.
let me show you something.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.791
Come along. just look at this
palace. imagine living here.

00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:03.875
- Madame. the king has
stepped out for a moment.

00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:04.833
but he'll return.

00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:07.666
- That's quite all right.
just two minutes. please.

00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:10.125
Now. donkey. doesn't
this make you feel good?

00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:13.250
- Oh. Madame. just
being here terrifies me.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.666
- Good. the king will be here any moment.

00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:17.666
- No. Miss Fitna. I don't belong here.

00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:20.458
I am only a humble washerman donkey.

00:32:20.458 --> 00:32:23.000
- Mangu. being a donkey is not your fault.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.750
but acting like a little coward.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.125
you're the one who's making that choice.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.750
and it is a choice that is going to stay

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.833
with you and haunt you your whole life.

00:32:30.833 --> 00:32:33.708
Are you sure that's what
you really want. Mangu?

00:32:33.708 --> 00:32:36.000
- Huh. me as the king. who is she kidding?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.166
What kind of idiot will follow a donkey?

00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:40.416
- Boy. get over here.

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:41.375
- Again with the cane?

00:32:41.375 --> 00:32:42.541
- Why are you leaving?

00:32:42.541 --> 00:32:44.875
- Come on. Dad. I don't
belong in the palace.

00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:47.000
- If not here. then where
exactly do you think

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.708
you would belong. my son.
washing clothes forever?

00:32:50.708 --> 00:32:53.375
This is your one chance
to do so much more.

00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:54.375
- What can I do?

00:32:54.375 --> 00:32:55.583
- You always have a choice.

00:32:55.583 --> 00:32:58.666
Some wait their whole lives
for an opportunity like this.

00:32:58.666 --> 00:33:00.166
I don't want you to fail to hear

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:02.541
that doorbell. you gotta answer it.

00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:05.166
You may not get this
opportunity ever again.

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:07.375
- So should I say yes?

00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:10.000
- You fool. have you
not heard a single word

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.625
that I've said out here?

00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:14.791
Of course you're going to say yes. go.

00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.166
- Miss Fitna.

00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:20.708
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:21.958
I've decided that I'm ready

00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:24.083
to carry the burden of the kingdom.

00:33:24.083 --> 00:33:25.166
(Fitna cheers)

00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:27.250
- I told you so. I told
you so. I told you so.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.083
- On one condition.

00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:29.916
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:32.333
I will carry the burden of the kingdom.

00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:35.375
but I can't handle if it
weighs any more than 30 pounds.

00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:37.541
I have a bad back. here. you want to see?

00:33:37.541 --> 00:33:38.375
- No.

00:33:38.375 --> 00:33:39.458
- As you wish.

00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:42.416
- What a fool this donkey
is. that he actually thinks

00:33:42.416 --> 00:33:46.750
he could rule this kingdom
by himself. (laughs)

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.416
(Shazad laughs)

00:33:52.666 --> 00:33:55.000
- Oh. Miss Fitna. Miss Fitna.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.833
say it again. just one more time. (laughs)

00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:00.041
- Prince Shazad. you will--

00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:03.916
(Shazad laughs hysterically)

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:07.666
- I can't take it. I
can't take it. (laughs)

00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:09.625
- What's all this big laughing about?

00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:11.375
One simple question for you.

00:34:11.375 --> 00:34:13.875
have you been able to
find a candidate yet?

00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:18.666
- Dad. it's even better. (laughs)

00:34:18.666 --> 00:34:19.500
- Fitna?

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.333
- Yes. sir. the opposition
candidate will be Mangu.

00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:26.000
- Oh. the donkey from the arena.

00:34:27.208 --> 00:34:31.500
- Dad. he does laundry. (laughs)

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.250
- You see. you are certain to become king.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.083
to victory. (blows kisses)

00:34:37.083 --> 00:34:38.500
- Someone will have to be in charge

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.916
of the prince's campaign.

00:34:39.916 --> 00:34:42.291
and that will be your job. Miss Fitna.

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:44.583
- I'll take care of
everything. you just lay down

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:46.291
and sleep through it all.

00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:49.625
- Yes. a nap is what I really need.

00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:52.416
(Khan groans)

00:34:52.416 --> 00:34:53.458
Oh. my arthritis.

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:55.250
- Little does the king know yet.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.958
but when the credits roll
at the end of this film.

00:34:57.958 --> 00:35:01.208
I'll be the one sitting
on the throne. (laughs)

00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:03.083
- I'm so excited. I just can't hide it.

00:35:03.083 --> 00:35:05.875
I love this election. nothing
could stop the prince now

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:09.583
from becoming king. it's
totally in the bag ski.

00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:12.250
- We will stop him. we'll
make the donkey king.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.250
- What. but I thought that. I'm confused.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.916
- Will you hack into the voting machines?

00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:19.125
- No. we don't need to do that.

00:35:19.125 --> 00:35:20.375
We'll use your news channel

00:35:20.375 --> 00:35:22.250
to make people think Mangu is a hero.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.041
and the prince is horrible.

00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:27.625
- I like the idea because a
foolish king is a great source

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:29.208
of scandalous news.

00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:32.375
My ratings will likely go
completely through the roof.

00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:34.416
- And what if the king should
find out about your plans?

00:35:34.416 --> 00:35:38.958
- Watch. see that pocket.
keep your eye on the ball.

00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:40.416
(slow orchestral music)

00:35:40.416 --> 00:35:42.625
- Huh. you were aiming for this ball.

00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:44.791
I don't know how you did that. mind blown.

00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.375
- This is how we will control every aspect

00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:48.041
of the upcoming election. you see.

00:35:48.041 --> 00:35:50.416
I will accompany the
prince everywhere he goes.

00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:52.083
You two will follow Mangu.

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:54.250
and everything he says
should sound brilliant.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.041
But every time the prince makes a mistake.

00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:58.333
you have to have a reporter on the scene.

00:35:58.333 --> 00:35:59.750
and that reporter will find a way

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.041
to blow everything out of proportion.

00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:04.750
- I gotta say. your plan
is right up my alley.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.166
First we speak evil. then hear evil.

00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:09.958
and. of course. then show evil.

00:36:09.958 --> 00:36:13.208
(Godzilla scats)

00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:16.000
- I've always said lions
and elephants may be strong.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.083
but their real talent is to
perform like dogs in a circus.

00:36:20.083 --> 00:36:22.625
(Fitna laughs)

00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:27.333
(Fitna scats)
(Godzilla scats)

00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:29.500
- My friends and those
who are not my friends.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.583
As the song goes. "Times are changing."

00:36:31.583 --> 00:36:33.666
and we must change with
those changing times.

00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:36.625
or the times will simply
change without us.

00:36:36.625 --> 00:36:39.250
Speaking of changing times. I
missed the bus this morning.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.541
And since we're having a
conversation about buses.

00:36:41.541 --> 00:36:43.625
you should all know I
prefer the yellow bus.

00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:45.583
And while we're on the subject of yellow.

00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:48.500
don't you agree with me that
yellow bees are very annoying

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.291
in the summer. and in the summertime.

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.625
there's nothing I love more
than going to the beach.

00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:55.416
Speaking of the beach in the
summertime. I cannot swim.

00:36:55.416 --> 00:36:58.500
so I just lie on the beach
and get all sandy. (laughs)

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.083
- Cut. cut. cut.

00:37:00.083 --> 00:37:02.458
What in this nonsense
you're speaking. donkey?

00:37:02.458 --> 00:37:03.958
- You gave me specific instructions

00:37:03.958 --> 00:37:05.791
and you said. "Talk like a politician."

00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:08.250
- Mangu. my pea brained donkey friend.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.083
don't try to be a
politician. just be yourself.

00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:13.375
- I can't do this anymore. I'm out.

00:37:13.375 --> 00:37:16.125
- Godzilla. bring me that donkey.

00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:21.291
I said get the donkey.
go get me that donkey.

00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:26.208
(whimsical orchestral music)

00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:28.333
(group cries out)

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:31.833
(lively orchestral music)

00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:54.250
- Just stop. calm down.
think happy thoughts.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:58.125
- Mangu. I have an idea.
we'll write your speeches.

00:37:58.125 --> 00:37:59.791
and I'm sure they'll be great.

00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:02.458
- Not only that. we'll manage
every aspect of your campaign.

00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:06.041
Don't worry. we'll take
care of everything.

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:17.125
- Oh. I'm just thinking here.

00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:20.000
but if Mangu wins. things will change.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.708
He's a regular donkey.
not some stuck-up elitist.

00:38:23.708 --> 00:38:28.041
He's a laundry man. he
has no love for the 1%.

00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:32.458
The 1% can die. (chuckles) but
you didn't hear that from me.

00:38:32.458 --> 00:38:34.958
and if you did. no biggie.

00:38:34.958 --> 00:38:38.125
- Indeed. could that Mangu really win?

00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:40.208
The animals would all have a voice.

00:38:40.208 --> 00:38:42.875
Then we could really
turn this country around.

00:38:42.875 --> 00:38:44.958
I must spread the word.

00:38:44.958 --> 00:38:47.083
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:49.166
(slow music)

00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:51.916
- My little jungle
animals. other nations like

00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:54.375
to send animals to the
moon. I'll send them

00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:56.875
to the sun because it's bigger.

00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:59.208
- Isn't the sun incredibly hot?

00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:02.208
- Well. of course it is. that's
why I'll send them at night

00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:05.750
and not during the daytime. genius.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.458
- My friends. if you make me king.

00:39:07.458 --> 00:39:10.541
I will protect the rights of all animals.

00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:13.208
I will even protect the
rights of humans because.

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:17.416
let's face it. they have it
worse than we do. they do.

00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:18.541
- Don't waste time.

00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:20.166
you have to go out
there and make promises.

00:39:20.166 --> 00:39:21.291
- But then I'd have to keep them.

00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:23.250
- Election promises
are just like balloons.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.291
After the election. you
ignore them and they deflate.

00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.708
- No longer will we push carts. instead.

00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:30.208
we will all have brand new cars

00:39:30.208 --> 00:39:32.166
to drive. (imitates engine revving)

00:39:32.166 --> 00:39:33.416
Out of the way.

00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:36.208
- When I am king.

00:39:36.208 --> 00:39:38.916
fortunes will decline
while poverty thrives.

00:39:38.916 --> 00:39:41.583
- You mean fortunes will
thrive as poverty declines?

00:39:41.583 --> 00:39:43.625
- That's what I'm saying. you animals have

00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:46.083
to open up your ears and listen to me.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:49.041
Otherwise. how will poverty
ever be able to thrive?

00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:51.416
- Godzilla. have you ordered the food yet?

00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:52.250
- What for?

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.541
- What for. let me explain it.

00:39:54.541 --> 00:39:57.833
People actually vote with
their bellies. their bellies.

00:39:57.833 --> 00:39:58.666
- When I am king.

00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:01.333
a new and vastly improved
country will emerge.

00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:04.000
and then we'll sell the old one.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.708
- Any comments?

00:40:06.708 --> 00:40:09.125
- Four words. I hate donkeys.

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:11.666
- You heard it here. how do you respond

00:40:11.666 --> 00:40:13.208
to this insult. Mangu?

00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:17.291
- Inky pinky punky. I am
just a donkey. (brays)

00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:18.291
- You heard it here.

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.500
- My friends. when I
am made king. I will--

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.583
- Fitna. Fitna. Fitna. I see Mangu's face

00:40:23.583 --> 00:40:25.833
in every newspaper and all over TV.

00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:29.416
- Don't worry. elections
are very much like circuses.

00:40:29.416 --> 00:40:32.333
The clown is just there
to entertain the crowd.

00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:36.208
The show stopping final act
always belongs to the lion.

00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:37.041
- I'm glad.

00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:39.000
- When the two face off in the debate.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.458
Shazad will have that donkey
begging for mercy in no time.

00:40:42.458 --> 00:40:46.375
So relax. my king. and
enjoy the show. ta ta.

00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:49.291
(slow poppy music)

00:40:55.916 --> 00:40:57.958
âª Inky pinky punky. inky pinky punky âª

00:40:57.958 --> 00:41:00.666
âª Time for the king to be a donkey âª

00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.666
âª Ding a ding a da da.
ding a ding a da da âª

00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:05.333
âª Lions are the kings through history âª

00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:07.583
âª Inky pinky punky. inky pinky punky âª

00:41:07.583 --> 00:41:10.041
âª Time for the king to be a donkey âª

00:41:10.041 --> 00:41:12.333
âª Ding a ding a da da.
ding a ding a da da âª

00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:14.875
âª Lions are the kings through history âª

00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:17.416
âª Inky pinky ponky âª

00:41:17.416 --> 00:41:19.791
âª Inky pinky ponky âª

00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:21.791
âª Inky pinky ponky âª

00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:24.708
âª Inky pinky ponky âª

00:41:24.708 --> 00:41:27.041
âª I can carry any trouble you have âª

00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:29.500
âª Make that burden fall away âª

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.791
âª If it means climbing trees.
I will do it for the jungle âª

00:41:31.791 --> 00:41:33.791
âª Just another day for me âª

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.750
âª Listen to the lion who's always trying âª

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.041
âª To please a daddy who's been a king âª

00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:41.125
âª Mangu. Mangu. washerman fool âª

00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:43.750
âª Your efforts don't mean nothing âª

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.916
âª Inky pinky ponky. inky pinky ponky âª

00:41:45.916 --> 00:41:48.583
âª Time for the king to be a donkey âª

00:41:48.583 --> 00:41:50.791
âª Ding a ding a da da.
ding a ding a da da âª

00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:55.625
âª Lions are the kings through history âª

00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:56.541
- Careful what you're saying.

00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.041
it's a foolish game you're playing.

00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:02.083
âª My voice can sing a royal song âª

00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:03.416
- I've got awesome ears.

00:42:03.416 --> 00:42:05.541
âª Shazad âª

00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:07.500
- I'm a rockstar. Mangu style.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.750
âª It's all done. you're washed out âª

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.416
âª There's no way you'll
ever see the throne âª

00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:14.625
âª I'll never quit. I'm a Mangu hit âª

00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:17.500
âª I am loved by all in the jungle âª

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.083
âª You are just a washerman.
some would say a donkey âª

00:42:20.083 --> 00:42:22.500
âª You're a liar. understand.
and a liar full of gas âª

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.625
âª Better get lost âª

00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:24.708
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.958
- I'm warning you.
- I am so ready.

00:42:26.958 --> 00:42:29.333
âª Ding a ding a dong a dong a.
better get out while you can âª

00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:30.250
âª Pinky pinky ponky âª

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.791
âª I will be the new king and a donkey âª

00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:32.958
âª Watch yourself. you play with fire âª

00:42:32.958 --> 00:42:34.125
âª Take a selfie. then inspire âª

00:42:34.125 --> 00:42:35.083
- Wanna fight?

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:37.083
- You know I just might.

00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:46.666
- Mangu. here's your final
speech. tomorrow's election day.

00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:49.333
If you make any mistakes. we're dead.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.541
- Time to seal the deal. don't choke.

00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:53.375
There are hundreds of people out there.

00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:57.041
- Wait. wait. wait. Mr.
Jambora. please. I have some--

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.958
- Hey. cut out the
whining. what do you fear?

00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:01.625
- Dad. I have to give a speech.

00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:03.250
There's hundreds of people out there.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.250
- That's it. just speak from
your heart. you'll be fine.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.375
- You said to speak from my heart?

00:43:07.375 --> 00:43:10.791
- Uh-huh. you got it. boy.
you see. when you speak

00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:13.666
from the heart. when you speak truth.

00:43:13.666 --> 00:43:16.041
then your words. they grow wings

00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:19.458
and fly into the hearts of your audience.

00:43:21.375 --> 00:43:24.666
- Fly into hearts. my words. grow wings?

00:43:24.666 --> 00:43:29.208
I could really go for some
buffalo wings right now.

00:43:29.208 --> 00:43:33.125
- Ladies and gentlemen.
predators and prey.

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:38.125
I give you a donkey who
needs no introduction. Mangu.

00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:39.708
(audience applauds)
(slow orchestral music)

00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:42.708
- So many people. here goes nothing.

00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:51.250
- He's doomed. this will never work.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.291
What the heck were we thinking?

00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:55.666
- [Changu] Remember.
Mangu. speak the truth

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:59.541
and your words will fly into their hearts.

00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:01.041
- Hey. Mangu. if you forgot your speech.

00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:05.375
you can always dance.
(audience laughs)

00:44:05.375 --> 00:44:07.083
- No. my friend.

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:09.625
I haven't forgotten anything.
but you don't need me

00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:14.250
to give a speech to you.
what good is another speech?

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:18.416
Royalty and politicians. they
will say anything to you.

00:44:18.416 --> 00:44:20.208
say any old thing.

00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:21.791
They usually say. "Vote for me.

00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:24.583
"and your troubles will
vanish like magic."

00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:26.791
They will go to your neighbor
or your mother in law.

00:44:26.791 --> 00:44:28.958
(audience laughs)

00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:33.083
But that is not how things
work. this is the real world.

00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:36.208
Uncle Zandar. you're here.
glad you could make it.

00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:38.000
Sit down. sit down.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.791
- Hey. donkey. we're not
here to meet your family.

00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:42.583
(audience laughs)

00:44:42.583 --> 00:44:46.250
- All right. you got
me. I'm a donkey. I am.

00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:49.250
I shoulder the burdens of the world.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.625
but if that makes me a donkey. well.

00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:53.625
then. all of you out
there are donkeys. too.

00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:57.541
Look. I see a donkey there.
and there's another one.

00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:02.125
And there. you too. you with
the horns. you're a donkey.

00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:03.875
- Mangu. watch your mouth.

00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:05.958
- Sadly I cannot do that. my friend.

00:45:05.958 --> 00:45:07.875
My teeth get in the way.

00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:10.583
(audience laughs)

00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.458
What I'm saying is this.

00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:16.708
It's not your looks that make
you a donkey. but your mind.

00:45:16.708 --> 00:45:20.625
It takes a whole jungle.
no one can live alone.

00:45:20.625 --> 00:45:23.083
We can't be greedy. we need each other.

00:45:23.083 --> 00:45:25.375
We must set aside our petty differences

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:27.291
and stop being selfish.

00:45:28.416 --> 00:45:31.208
We have to work together. everyone.

00:45:31.208 --> 00:45:33.166
and shoulder our burdens together.

00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:35.583
not just be content to push them aside.

00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:38.916
Azad City can be a place
of peace and harmony.

00:45:38.916 --> 00:45:41.375
We can make that happen.

00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:44.125
Then it won't matter who you make king.

00:45:44.125 --> 00:45:46.791
Prince Shazad or a silly donkey.

00:45:47.833 --> 00:45:50.416
Thank you. I have nothing more.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:58.958
(Zandar claps)
(audience applauds)

00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:02.458
(upbeat orchestral music)

00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:14.500
(slow orchestral music)

00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:19.833
- Hey. aren't you gonna vote today?

00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:21.250
- What's the point. my friend?

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.083
One vote won't make a difference.

00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:25.083
- You make a good point.

00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:29.958
- Get up. you. you need to
go out and cast your vote.

00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:34.250
- Your voice is like a
jackhammer on my brain. woman.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.583
I'm tired. can't you go
vote for the both of us?

00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:39.750
- I'm ashamed to know you.

00:46:41.541 --> 00:46:42.875
- Excuse me. my friend.

00:46:42.875 --> 00:46:44.375
who do you think will win the election?

00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:46.083
- I don't care at all.

00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:46.916
- You don't care?

00:46:46.916 --> 00:46:51.416
- No. the key to happiness
is. just don't care at all.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.375
(slow orchestral music)

00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:57.375
- It's election day. I'm so excited.

00:46:57.375 --> 00:47:01.041
The polls are closing. but no
one's at the polling stations.

00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:03.541
not even the dumb birds.
(bird caws)

00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:05.958
Get lost. beat it. it
seems that only members

00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:07.791
of the royal family have even bothered

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.958
to show up and cast their vote.

00:47:09.958 --> 00:47:12.875
Is the rest of the country
sleeping through the election?

00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:17.833
Keep watching (grunts) Monkey
News. it's a family thing.

00:47:17.833 --> 00:47:20.125
- I will protect the
rights of all animals.

00:47:20.125 --> 00:47:22.583
- My king. no one's showing up to vote.

00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:24.416
and no one's going to. either.

00:47:24.416 --> 00:47:26.541
Shazad. you might as well
pick out what you want to wear

00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:27.791
because you're going to win.

00:47:27.791 --> 00:47:29.125
- Dad. which jacket do

00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:31.375
you think will get me
more likes on Facebook?

00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:34.625
- No likes. be serious. and grow up.

00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:37.625
Fitna. if you have things
under control here.

00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:39.333
I need to take a nap.

00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:41.625
- That's a very good idea. absolutely.

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:46.625
Rest easy. I have it all under
control. my King. (laughs)

00:47:46.916 --> 00:47:50.125
- I never thought getting
old would be so painful.

00:47:50.125 --> 00:47:52.000
- The situation is under my control.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
and now it's time to turn
things to chaos. (laughs)

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:02.375
(phone vibrates)

00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:03.333
Hi. Jake.

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.833
- Yes. boss?

00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:07.000
- [Fitna] It's showtime.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.416
- Got it. boss. (laughs)

00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:20.041
(car horn honks)

00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:25.666
(slow orchestral music)

00:48:25.666 --> 00:48:29.458
- Hey. Zandar. come here. you hear me?

00:48:29.458 --> 00:48:30.875
I said come here.

00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:34.666
- Hey. bear. would you
like some ice cream?

00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:37.416
- You don't. eh. ungrateful.

00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:42.416
- You see. about the vote.
don't bother. just go on home.

00:48:42.708 --> 00:48:43.875
- And if I don't?

00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:46.250
- What? (laughs)

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.458
Have you forgotten how much

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:50.541
the royal family loves a good barbecue?

00:48:50.541 --> 00:48:55.541
After all. lions are naturally
carnivorous. (laughs)

00:48:56.583 --> 00:48:58.000
- I'm not scared.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.541
- Move along. teddy bear.
voting is closed. (laughs)

00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:05.333
No one's voting here today.
go home. enjoy the day.

00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:09.250
We'll cast your vote for you.
now go. voting is closed. go.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.333
(background noise drowns out speaker)

00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:13.000
(crowd screams)

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:22.791
- We will not be intimidated by them.

00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:24.708
We'll prove that you can't stop the will

00:49:24.708 --> 00:49:27.958
of the animals. the will of the animals.

00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:30.666
Now come on. follow me.

00:49:30.666 --> 00:49:33.333
(slow drumming)

00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:36.250
Wake up!

00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:38.500
- Hmm?

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:39.333
- Huh?

00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:41.625
- [Group] Hmm?

00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:44.958
- People of Azad City. wake up. wake up!

00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:53.541
We must all go and vote. I
don't care who you vote for.

00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:59.166
Mangu or Shazad. I'm just
asking you to go and vote.

00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:02.958
It's true. your vote counts.

00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:08.958
Far too often. the wrong
candidates can be elected

00:50:08.958 --> 00:50:13.416
because good people don't
bother to go and vote.

00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:16.375
But today. we can change things.

00:50:16.375 --> 00:50:19.125
You have to vote. so do you.

00:50:19.125 --> 00:50:22.375
We can change the destiny of Azad City.

00:50:22.375 --> 00:50:26.041
Wake up. everyone must
go and vote. go vote.

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:29.875
Go vote. go vote.

00:50:30.958 --> 00:50:33.458
- You know what. the
bear has the right idea.

00:50:33.458 --> 00:50:36.583
One day we'll regret it
if we don't cast our vote.

00:50:36.583 --> 00:50:38.833
- Come. my brothers.
come. Zandar is right.

00:50:38.833 --> 00:50:40.791
It's time to vote. come on.

00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:41.625
- Come on.

00:50:41.625 --> 00:50:46.625
- Come on. everyone. you too.
(uplifting orchestral music)

00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:49.333
Come on. let's go.

00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:24.750
(slow orchestral music)

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.416
- The vote counting is underway.

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:29.041
In just a few moments. we'll know who won.

00:51:29.041 --> 00:51:32.291
and then our nation will
have a brand new king.

00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:33.958
new king. new king.

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:36.333
While we wait for
tonight's election results.

00:51:36.333 --> 00:51:39.833
I am joined in the studio
by two very special guests.

00:51:39.833 --> 00:51:42.333
the very well dressed
government representative.

00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:45.333
Mr. Propaganda. and Mangu's
rather poorly dressed

00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:48.958
Uncle Perry. Uncle Perry.
what insights can you give us

00:51:48.958 --> 00:51:50.750
about Mangu as a child?

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.916
- Ask anyone. I was like a father to him.

00:51:52.916 --> 00:51:54.833
I showed him almost everything in life.

00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:57.291
I told him. you gotta reach
high if you want the best.

00:51:57.291 --> 00:52:00.166
I always believed he was
destined to be our king.

00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:01.708
Mark my words. in no time at all.

00:52:01.708 --> 00:52:04.375
he'll bring us all together. (laughs)

00:52:04.375 --> 00:52:06.875
- Is it true that Mangu
has always been something

00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:08.875
of an irresponsible daydreamer?

00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:11.958
- Mangu wasn't being
irresponsible. it was important.

00:52:11.958 --> 00:52:14.583
In fact. every morning. I would
smack him when he woke up.

00:52:14.583 --> 00:52:15.416
- You wouldn't.

00:52:15.416 --> 00:52:17.583
- Of course I would. he needed to go back

00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:20.250
to sleep if he was gonna keep on dreaming.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.833
Donkey. donkey. dreaming donkey. donkey.

00:52:22.833 --> 00:52:25.625
- You may mark my words.
Prince Shazad will win.

00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:28.625
- You seem a little nervous.
afraid he'll lose to a donkey?

00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:30.500
- [Mr. Propaganda] How
dare you. I will see to it

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.958
that your laundromat is closed.

00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:33.625
- Then I'm gonna completely cut off

00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:34.750
your laundry service. buddy.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:37.291
- I hereby announce that
if Mangu wins the election.

00:52:37.291 --> 00:52:39.000
I will officially change my name.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.083
- Will you go with Fluffy
or Whiskers? (laughs)

00:52:42.083 --> 00:52:43.875
No. how about Twinkle Toes?

00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.875
- That's it. I'm done with this interview.

00:52:45.875 --> 00:52:49.041
- Let the little kittycat go.
I'll send him a bumper sticker

00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:51.333
when we win. (laughs)

00:52:51.333 --> 00:52:53.416
- I can't let him go. he took our mic--

00:52:53.416 --> 00:52:54.416
- I have one more thing to say--

00:52:54.416 --> 00:52:55.458
- [Uncle Perry] Back for more. Sparkles?

00:52:55.458 --> 00:52:56.416
- [Mr. Propaganda] Watch it. pal.

00:52:56.416 --> 00:52:57.750
- Why don't you go chase your tail?

00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:58.583
- Shut up.

00:52:58.583 --> 00:52:59.916
- You shut up.

00:52:59.916 --> 00:53:00.833
- I'll have you jailed.

00:53:00.833 --> 00:53:01.916
- You'll make a nice rug.

00:53:01.916 --> 00:53:03.000
- I'll rip your ears off.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.125
- I'll kick you into next year.

00:53:04.125 --> 00:53:05.500
- I'll have you in a sandwich.
- I've got breaking news.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.041
- He could use a little catnip.

00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:07.958
- Be quiet!

00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:12.500
The official results have
started to come pouring in.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.375
from Bear Colony. Fish
Market. Buffalo Road.

00:53:15.375 --> 00:53:19.125
Monkey Avenue. Hippo
Hill. it's everywhere.

00:53:19.125 --> 00:53:23.333
Mangu is the winner.
he won in a landslide.

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:26.083
- Yeah. donkey. he really did it!

00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:30.000
Everybody. Mangu won. he's now the king.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
(crowd cheers)
(upbeat drumming)

00:53:36.458 --> 00:53:38.500
You are no longer just a donkey.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.583
From now on. you are the Donkey King.

00:53:42.458 --> 00:53:45.708
- I can't believe it. could
this really have happened?

00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:49.750
- Come on. come on. let's
march to the palace. let's go!

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:53.333
- [Crowd] All hail Donkey
King. king of all the animals!

00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:56.833
All hail Donkey King.
king of all the animals!

00:53:56.833 --> 00:54:00.666
All hail Donkey King.
king of all the animals!

00:54:04.958 --> 00:54:07.833
- What is that outside. so much noise.

00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:10.791
Fitna. Super Guard. what's
going on. where is everyone?

00:54:10.791 --> 00:54:14.875
- My king. it's a
disaster. a total disaster.

00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:16.416
We're finished. I can't take it.

00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:17.250
- What happened?

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:20.041
- The donkey. my Lord. the
one who shoulders the burden

00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:22.166
of the animals. he's riding the shoulders

00:54:22.166 --> 00:54:24.375
of the animals right now.

00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:27.166
My Lord. Mangu has won the election.

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:29.625
I don't know how. but he has won.

00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:32.041
Our life in the palace is over. (cries)

00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:33.625
- How is that even possible?

00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:34.458
- Yes.

00:54:35.583 --> 00:54:39.916
Sir. I wish you had never
decided to hold this election.

00:54:39.916 --> 00:54:42.333
I've heard of people shooting
themselves in the foot.

00:54:42.333 --> 00:54:46.375
but you managed to shoot
yourself in the head. so sad.

00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:49.583
I just want to tell you. you
made a horrible mistake. sir.

00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:51.833
It was a terrible mistake you made.

00:54:51.833 --> 00:54:53.541
- But this idea was all yours. Fitna--

00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:56.791
(glass shatters)

00:54:56.791 --> 00:55:01.250
- King Khan. my king. we
can sort this out later.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:03.583
Right now. we have to get
you out of the palace.

00:55:03.583 --> 00:55:05.291
The crowd is getting out of control

00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:07.208
and I'm worried they'll come for you.

00:55:07.208 --> 00:55:09.583
I couldn't bear to see that happen to you.

00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:13.041
I think you need to go
into hiding for a while.

00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:15.833
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:55:15.833 --> 00:55:18.750
- [Mangu] Miss Fitna. Miss Fox?

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.625
- Just hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:24.458
(thunder rumbles)

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:31.708
- Ancestors. I beg your forgiveness.

00:55:31.708 --> 00:55:35.250
My mistake has brought
our dynasty to an end.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:38.333
- My Lord. we must hurry. we
can use the secret passageway

00:55:38.333 --> 00:55:40.666
to escape the palace. hurry.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.333
- The country will be ruled by a donkey.

00:55:53.916 --> 00:55:57.583
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:56:02.916 --> 00:56:07.041
- Help me. help me. help me.
help me. help me. help me.

00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:09.000
- Super Dude. be gentle.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.791
The donkey is now the king of the country.

00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:14.583
- Yes. I know. he's filthy

00:56:14.583 --> 00:56:17.250
and should take a bath
before the crowning ceremony.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.625
- I don't want to take a bath.

00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:20.208
I'm not really a fan of cold water.

00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:22.833
- But Mangu. I mean. Your Majesty.

00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:23.875
I don't think you really want

00:56:23.875 --> 00:56:25.375
to smell bad when you are introduced

00:56:25.375 --> 00:56:28.583
to the animals as their
new king. am I right?

00:56:28.583 --> 00:56:29.833
- On one condition.
- What?

00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:32.333
- I will not use shower
gel. it dries out my skin.

00:56:32.333 --> 00:56:34.083
- I beg to differ with you. my Lord.

00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:36.791
It makes your skin as
smooth as a baby's bottom.

00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:38.833
- Really. that's not what you said.

00:56:38.833 --> 00:56:40.583
- I will drop and do 20 pushups.

00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:41.416
- No way.

00:56:41.416 --> 00:56:42.250
- Thank you. sir.

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.000
- Draw my bath. I'll use the gel.

00:56:46.333 --> 00:56:50.000
Be very careful. (laughs)
'cause I'm ticklish.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.625
- Don't forget to use the royal shampoo

00:56:51.625 --> 00:56:54.625
and conditioner. my Lord.
we wouldn't be his fur not

00:56:54.625 --> 00:56:56.791
to be silky smooth when
he meets his public

00:56:56.791 --> 00:56:59.333
for the first time. (laughs)

00:56:59.333 --> 00:57:02.166
(upbeat drumming)

00:57:20.791 --> 00:57:23.708
(slow brass music)

00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:30.041
- Attention. stand and behold His Majesty.

00:57:31.333 --> 00:57:34.750
the king of the jungle. Mangu the donkey.

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.583
- People of Azad City.
look proudly upon me

00:57:55.583 --> 00:58:00.583
and raise your ears. use your
tails to whip the flies away

00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:05.583
because Azad is now under
donkey rule. (brays)

00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:11.500
(slow drumming)

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.916
(slow music)

00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:27.416
âª Donkey Mangu is the new king âª

00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:29.583
âª Donkey Mangu is the new king âª

00:58:29.583 --> 00:58:34.375
âª Donkey Mangu is the new king âª

00:58:34.375 --> 00:58:39.375
âª Lion was the king before.
but you elected a donkey âª

âª Now to lead âª

01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:59.583
- Madame. I'm just loving the donkey.

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:04.125
but when the lions come back.
I'm worried they'll kill us.

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:06.791
(dissonant piano music)

01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:08.583
- Don't worry. little green one.

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:10.875
Just remember what I told you.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.916
Lions and elephants may
be stronger than we are.

01:01:13.916 --> 01:01:16.375
but where could they all end up?

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:18.250
- The circus. in the circus.

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:20.333
- Finished off. so true.
(phone rings)

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:24.000
little lizard. so true. (laughs)

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.916
Hello. this is Miss
Fitna. talking to you live

01:01:27.916 --> 01:01:32.583
from the palace. (laughs) hello. hello?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.833
Sir. hello?
(ominous laughing)

01:01:39.791 --> 01:01:41.583
(Fitna trembles)

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:46.416
Sir. hello. sir. I was just
about to call you. yes. I was.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.708
Mangu the donkey has been elected king.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:51.583
I just need some more time.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:55.083
but everything is going according to plan.

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.708
(whip cracks)

01:01:56.708 --> 01:02:00.708
Sir. I promise. everything
will be fine. I promise.

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:03.958
We will start the second phase tonight.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:08.583
No. no. no. I can assure you
everything will go smoothly.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:11.666
There will be no mistakes. not one.

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:14.583
(ominous laughing)

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:19.291
Hello?

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:23.458
Goodbye. have a good night.

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:27.041
He said it is showtime.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.875
(slow poppy music)

01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:43.375
âª You are my dream girl âª

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.625
âª You are my dream girl âª

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:57.958
- Your Majesty. get up. time to go.

01:02:57.958 --> 01:03:01.750
Please try to wake up
now. hop to it. King.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:05.750
- Good morning. Super
Dude. why did you wake me?

01:03:06.958 --> 01:03:09.541
I was about to get married
to a beautiful woman.

01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:12.208
- But my Lord. you
can't just marry anyone.

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:14.916
You're the new king. the donkey king.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.541
- Why didn't you tell me this before?

01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:19.041
- I'm very sorry. Majesty.
I'll drop and give you 20.

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.375
- Nonsense.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:24.041
- Thank you. sir. a crowd
waits to speak to you.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:26.458
- A crowd. let us greet them.

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:32.583
- Attention. all. I said. attention all.

01:03:32.583 --> 01:03:34.875
Be wise and stand down.

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:35.875
- What do you mean?

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:39.125
Is there someone plotting
evil against our new king?

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:43.125
- What I meant was stand
downwind. just in case.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:47.583
- Your Majesty. when the last king left.

01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:49.250
the government went with him.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.250
so nobody knows what should be done.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.708
- What. you're right.
we need a government.

01:03:53.708 --> 01:03:55.125
So who will put that together?

01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:55.958
- You do.

01:03:55.958 --> 01:04:00.958
- Oh. well. then I shall build
a government. (cries out)

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:03.875
All righty. what exactly do we need?

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:06.750
- Your Majesty. one of the
first things we need is someone

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.625
to go to when we have a complaint.

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:12.333
- A Minister of Complaints. you say?

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:15.000
So who could we name. any ideas?

01:04:15.916 --> 01:04:17.958
- What if we name that sparkling TV guy.

01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:19.708
Lando. as Minister of Complaints?

01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:22.250
- Yes. that's a great idea. Lando?

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.083
- Yes?

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:23.916
- Do you agree?

01:04:23.916 --> 01:04:25.375
- You want me to eat a tree?

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:27.666
- Not eat a tree. agree.

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:28.500
- What?

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.333
- Lando. do you agree?

01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:33.041
- He's so crazy tall that none

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:34.541
of the people's complaints
will ever make it up

01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:37.083
to reach his ears. (laughs)

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:38.333
- Your Highness. we could also

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.916
really use some new policemen.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:44.375
- Hmm. it seems that we
need a new Chief of Police.

01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:46.833
Who could it be. who could it be?

01:04:46.833 --> 01:04:50.333
- I think Rapid would make
a great Chief of Police.

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:52.625
- Right. great idea. Rapid?

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:54.541
- Did somebody call me?

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:56.958
I was so busy with my meditation.

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.583
- I'm naming you Chief of Police.

01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:01.583
The safety of the city is
on your shoulders. okay?

01:05:01.583 --> 01:05:03.916
- Hold on. let me get this straight.

01:05:03.916 --> 01:05:07.250
You want me to put the
entire city on my shoulders?

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:10.000
- That turtle is so
slow. by the time he gets

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.791
to the scene of a crime.
it'll be too late. (laughs)

01:05:13.791 --> 01:05:16.166
He would make even humans seem fast.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:17.875
- My King. we desperately need teachers

01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.458
for all of our schools.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:22.375
- Teachers. new teachers. teachers?

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:27.208
- Nothing says you have
to strain your brain.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:29.333
You've made some big decisions today. sir.

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:30.708
It's a lot for a donkey.

01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:35.708
- You're absolutely right.
(snorts) yes. yes. yes.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.583
It's a lot for a donkey to do. (brays)

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:47.625
But I am now the king. with
an important job to do.

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:49.750
the one who must teach the children is me.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:50.583
- Are you sure that's--

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:52.833
- That's enough. this meeting is over.

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:54.375
The king needs his rest.

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:57.708
- That's so true. anyway.
I have laundry to do.

01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:59.166
I'm done here.

01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:01.583
(wolf howls)

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:07.291
(ominous orchestral music)

01:06:12.083 --> 01:06:14.833
(goat cries out)

01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:21.583
- Hello. police. this is the police?

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:23.750
I'm not sure. but I think someone
followed me into my house.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:24.583
Send help right--

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:27.333
(goat cries out)

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:39.833
(slow orchestral music)
(car wheels screeching)

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:41.583
- [Hippo] Help. help!

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.166
(Mangu snores)

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:52.083
- Wake up. my king. you look
good. how are you feeling?

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:53.166
- Dad. again?

01:06:54.833 --> 01:06:58.083
Do I notice you're calling
me king instead of Mangu?

01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:00.458
- But of course. what
else should I call you?

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:03.416
Because now you're the king.

01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:05.791
So how are you. are you happy now?

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:07.958
- Me? (laughs)

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:11.583
I'm like King Midas. even
moldy. useless dirt turns

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:14.583
to gold in my touch. I'm ridiculously rich

01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:18.000
and have the unlimited power
that anyone could ever want.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.875
I have achieved all these
great accomplishments

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:22.708
through my own work. I
did it all on my own.

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:23.625
- Your own?

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.916
You really think so?

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:28.458
- You think you helped
me with any of this?

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.708
- What about all the animals?

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.125
They voted for you.

01:07:32.125 --> 01:07:35.250
- Voters. they just do
what they're told. yeah.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:38.041
- So now you think you're
better than everyone.

01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:42.083
Watch out. the higher you may
fly. the farther you fall.

01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:44.583
- Earth to Dad. I'm
Mangu. believe it or not.

01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:45.791
I don't need you to haunt me

01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:47.625
and speak in riddles all the time.

01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:51.708
I'm no longer a child.
I'm now the donkey king.

01:07:51.708 --> 01:07:55.250
Now go away. (yawns) now let me sleep.

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.250
- Sleep while you can. my son.

01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:02.250
Your future may not be as
restful as you think. (chuckles)

01:08:02.541 --> 01:08:06.125
- My poor dad. he was
always just a donkey.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:09.125
I've never been so tired.

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:13.416
- [Crowd] We demand
action. we demand action!

01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:16.166
We demand action. we demand action!

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:19.708
We demand action. we demand action!

01:08:19.708 --> 01:08:22.625
We demand action. we demand action!

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:26.541
- What is the problem. what
are you protesting about?

01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:29.583
- Your Majesty. bad news.
something terrible has happened.

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:32.041
Many animals in the
town have gone missing.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.541
- Animals have gone missing. you say?

01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:34.916
Why wasn't I made aware of this?

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.958
- Don't worry. my King. it's only a rumor.

01:08:36.958 --> 01:08:39.583
- This is not just a rumor. it's a fact.

01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:42.166
- If something like this
happened. then Jambora would have

01:08:42.166 --> 01:08:45.125
to be the first to know. right. Jambora?

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:47.708
- If I don't agree with her.
I know she will expose me.

01:08:47.708 --> 01:08:49.500
and then I'll be ruined.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:53.458
No. no. no. I'm pretty sure
that it's just a rumor.

01:08:53.458 --> 01:08:54.291
and that's all.

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:57.791
- If it's really only a
rumor. then where's Sandy.

01:08:57.791 --> 01:08:59.541
or Brian. Alan. Nina?

01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:02.250
Explain it. they're gone.

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:05.208
Were they abducted by some kind of aliens?

01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:07.208
- I'm sure you're overreacting.

01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:10.000
- No. no. this is really happening.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.333
I bet you know something
about it. don't you?

01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:13.750
Come clean. tell the truth.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.166
- [Crowd] The truth. tell us the truth.

01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:18.083
The truth. tell us the truth--
- Enough of this.

01:09:18.083 --> 01:09:19.625
We'll get to the bottom of this.

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:22.166
We just need the right man. Rapid?

01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:24.833
(slow drumming)

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.291
(Rapid chuckles)

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:31.083
Stop laughing. Rapid. we have animals

01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:32.666
from our city that are missing.

01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:34.750
Begin the investigation straightaway.

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:38.000
and leave no stone unturned. my orders.

01:09:39.458 --> 01:09:41.625
(Rapid yawns)

01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:44.708
(upbeat drumming)

01:09:44.708 --> 01:09:48.875
- Officer. Officer. my son has
been missing for three days.

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:52.791
- I see. you say your son
has been missing. yeah?

01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:54.208
- Yes.

01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:56.541
- So when was the last time you saw him?

01:09:56.541 --> 01:10:00.458
- Well. his last Instagram
post was three days ago.

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:03.458
- I'm sure you're making
a big deal out of nothing.

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.791
You know what I think?

01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:07.458
No doubt he ran off and partied too hard.

01:10:07.458 --> 01:10:09.875
Go home and call me if you get a post.

01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:10.708
- Yes.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:15.041
- Sit down. Mr. Hippo. who
is it you're looking for?

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:17.416
- Well. it's my wife. she
left early this morning

01:10:17.416 --> 01:10:19.041
and hasn't come back yet.

01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:21.875
- My hearty congrats.
you're a free man now.

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:23.458
Of course I'm only kidding.

01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:25.666
Can you tell me what color her eyes are?

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.083
- I can't say I ever noticed.

01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:29.541
but to me they always look angrily red.

01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:30.750
- What about her hair?

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:33.250
- I don't know her real
color. she always dyes it.

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:36.541
- Oh. I'll bet she was
driving in her car--

01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:38.958
- Yes. yes. you're absolutely right. yes.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:42.458
- Of course I am. tell me
everything you know about her car.

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.958
- Black Honda Civic VTI

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:46.250
with supercharged V6 three liter engine

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:49.500
that gets 330 horsepower
automatic transmission.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.875
and it's complete with
full LED headlights.

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:54.666
- You're talking so fast.
saying so many things.

01:10:54.666 --> 01:10:57.958
you're making me dizzy. you
should get a speeding ticket.

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.708
but I'll give you a break.

01:10:59.708 --> 01:11:02.041
I'll find your wife. don't sweat it.

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:04.000
You'll be hearing from me shortly.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:04.833
- Great.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:08.791
- My Lord. what do you
think you would like

01:11:08.791 --> 01:11:10.083
to have for dinner?

01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:13.166
- Well. yesterday I had
baked beans. (farts)

01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:14.750
Why did you do that?

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:16.500
But today. I think I should have salad.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.166
- That's not what chef made today.

01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:20.166
Instead we have royal meatballs.

01:11:20.166 --> 01:11:22.708
- Royal meatballs. but I'm a vegetarian.

01:11:22.708 --> 01:11:25.250
- Mangu. my Lord. as king.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:27.625
you must represent all
your people. which means.

01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:30.666
in point of fact. you
have to be an omnivore.

01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:32.583
- I do. why didn't you tell me?

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:36.208
- Sorry. sir. I'll drop and give you 20.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:37.041
- Get out of here.

01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:38.041
- Thank you.

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:44.291
(Mangu burps)

01:11:44.291 --> 01:11:48.500
- These meatballs are
actually pretty delicious.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.583
- Finally. those meatballs
were specially made

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:54.250
to put him to sleep. (gags)

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:07.458
(ominous orchestral music)

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.250
(car engine stalls)

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:19.333
(elevator rings)

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.583
(tiger knocks)

01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:44.125
- Don't worry. my brothers.
I know it looks bad.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:49.125
but you can mark my words. our
friends will return. Kiddo?

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.875
Can you put a pot of coffee on?

01:12:50.875 --> 01:12:52.333
- There is no coffee.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:55.208
not until we can get the
gas to come on again.

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:57.208
- We have no gas. we have no water.

01:12:57.208 --> 01:12:59.958
no electricity. and folks are missing.

01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:03.166
all because we let the
donkey become the king.

01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:05.333
- Well. it could be much worse.

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:09.083
but I sure don't know how. (laughs)

01:13:09.083 --> 01:13:11.750
- Oh. we have light. finally. electricity.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.000
Spoke too soon.

01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:20.000
- What was in

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:23.833
those meatballs? (groans)

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:26.083
I can't sleep. I feel sick.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:31.083
The bathroom will not smell
too good when I'm done.

01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:33.208
- Another animal disappeared today.

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:37.791
a bear from across the river.
and what's the palace doing?

01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:40.958
Absolutely nothing. nothing. nothing.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.666
We must have action. what
are the police doing?

01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:48.500
This crime wave must stop< these
criminals must be put away.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.416
Keep watching Monkey News all night.

01:13:51.416 --> 01:13:53.416
âª Monkey News âª

01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:54.916
- This is terrible.

01:13:54.916 --> 01:13:57.583
What the heck is my Chief
of Police doing about it?

01:13:57.583 --> 01:14:00.875
(phone rings)

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:01.708
- Good afternoon.

01:14:01.708 --> 01:14:03.500
- It's nighttime. a bear has disappeared

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.208
across the river. go investigate.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:08.083
- The river is far away
and will take a lot of time

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:10.916
to get there. and I don't have that.

01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:12.750
- Wake up. Rapid. like it or not.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:15.250
you will go do your job
and I will meet you there.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.791
- I'll go as fast as I can.

01:14:16.791 --> 01:14:19.958
I'll even try to get a ride out there.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:27.000
(slow orchestral music)

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.750
There are shoe prints
all over the crime scene.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:34.125
- But nobody wears shoes in the jungle.

01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:36.250
- Maybe it was an alien--

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:38.541
- Oh. Rapid. if your
mind moved any slower.

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:40.875
your teeth wouldn't know
what to do in your mouth.

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:44.708
Something's really suspicious
about this whole affair.

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:46.916
- Shoe prints don't appear out of nowhere.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.583
they must lead somewhere.

01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:50.000
- Super Dude. why didn't you tell me?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.958
- Sorry. sir. I'll drop and give you 20.

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:52.791
- Knock it off.

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:53.625
- Thank you.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:54.625
- Follow me.

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:02.500
There's a footprint and there's another.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.875
I think we're getting lucky.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.416
the trail leads right down this path.

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:09.208
Hey. who turned off the sun. it's so dark.

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:11.083
- My king. why don't we set up our camp?

01:15:11.083 --> 01:15:13.291
We'll continue the search in the morning.

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:15.458
- That is a brilliant idea. Super Dude.

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:17.291
- I'm sure you would
have thought of it soon.

01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.125
- You're right.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.125
- Thank you.

01:15:24.666 --> 01:15:28.500
(mosquitoes buzzing)

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:32.666
- These nasty mosquitoes.
I'll never get to sleep.

01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:38.875
Hmm. look at that. he's
fast asleep. pathetic.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:41.208
- Thank you. sir. thank you.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.666
- Those lights. what's that house

01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:48.750
in the middle of the forest?

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.166
And I wonder who lives there.

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:55.541
Oh.

01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:04.500
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:09.833
Goodness. what are all these
animals doing in cages?

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:10.666
- Mangu!

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:14.041
(Mangu cries out)

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.041
Mangu!

01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:18.250
- My Lord. how. you shouldn't
be in there. my Lord.

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.041
I mean. ex Lord because I'm king now.

01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:21.916
Wow. this is pretty
awkward. don't you think?

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:23.666
- Get us out of this cage.

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:25.458
- But how did you get in
the cage in the first place?

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:30.166
- You wouldn't believe me if
I told you. but I'll tell you.

01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:32.083
Remember election night?

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.000
(thunder crashes)

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.125
- My Lord. we must hurry. we
can use the secret passageway

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:42.125
to escape the palace.
(slow orchestral music)

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:46.708
- Miss Fitna. when will
we reach the safe house?

01:16:46.708 --> 01:16:49.791
It's so dark. just like life.

01:16:49.791 --> 01:16:52.541
- Fitna. when will we reach
the end of the tunnel?

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.416
- My Lord. we are nearing
the end of our journey.

01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:57.666
If you can just be patient
for a little while longer.

01:16:57.666 --> 01:16:59.666
everything will sort itself out.

01:16:59.666 --> 01:17:02.208
Here we are. here's the end of the tunnel.

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:03.375
See. like I told you.

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:06.958
there's the entrance
right in front of you.

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:14.791
- [Shazad] Where are we going?

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:21.333
- Oh. no. no.

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:23.583
- Fitna. how did this happen?

01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:27.041
- I have no idea how
we got trapped in here.

01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:29.708
But really. you're the one that's trapped.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:33.458
you and your son. (laughs) stupid son.

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:38.458
- Is this a joke?
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:17:42.541 --> 01:17:45.541
(Ringmaster laughs)

01:17:49.041 --> 01:17:50.708
(whip cracks)

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:54.250
- Welcome. welcome Ringmaster. sir.

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:55.916
- Ringmaster. my butt.

01:17:55.916 --> 01:17:59.416
He looks just like a circus clown. a tool.

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:04.625
- You are quite mistaken.
Ringmaster is not the clown

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:06.750
of the circus. no. he's not.

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:11.666
On the contrary. if I may say.
he's the king of the circus.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
(Ringmaster laughs)

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.125
And now the two of you will
have the great pleasure

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.833
of performing in his circus at the crack

01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:24.833
of his whip. what fun.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.250
I've always said lions and
elephants may be stronger.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.291
but they belong in the circus.

01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:31.875
This is only the
beginning. Ringmaster. sir.

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:32.833
(whip cracks)

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:35.833
Oh. don't worry. I do
remember my promise to you.

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.750
You told me to let the
elections happen and I did.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:38.750
(Ringmaster growls)

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.166
Let the donkey wear the cap.
sorry. sorry. I mean crown.

01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:42.500
and then I will deliver hundreds

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:47.500
and hundreds of animals to
your circus. hundreds. (laughs)

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:50.625
(Ringmaster laughs)

01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:54.041
(whip cracks)

01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:58.250
- Fitna. how could I have been so foolish?

01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:00.333
All this time. I thought I was the king.

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:03.000
but as it turns out. I was only a pawn.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.958
- Ah. their ultimate goal
was to steal all the animals

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:06.958
for the circus.

01:19:06.958 --> 01:19:08.000
- Got it. DK?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:08.916
- DK?

01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:12.416
- It stands for donkey king.
don't you understand anything?

01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:13.250
- Oh. yes.

01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:17.958
- It sounds like they're coming back.

01:19:17.958 --> 01:19:20.125
DK. you must get us out of here.

01:19:20.125 --> 01:19:21.375
- You know. I may be a donkey.

01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:23.958
but that doesn't make me a
fool. I need a place to hide.

01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:27.541
(ominous orchestral music)

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.916
- Who were you just speaking to. old man?

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.833
You better tell us right away. you better.

01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:36.833
- No one. no one. I was
just practicing my speech.

01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:37.958
- Just saying. the king

01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:40.208
of the jungle giving a
speech will be a huge hit

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.500
in the circus. (laughs)

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.000
(Ringmaster growls)

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:44.833
- Daddy.

01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:49.291
- You talk to him. I'm right behind you.

01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:02.958
(Ringmaster laughs)

01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:10.333
(whip cracks)

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:12.916
Ringmaster was very clear
when he said. what did he say?

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:14.000
(Ringmaster growls)

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.375
(whip cracks)

01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:16.583
Maybe you should talk to him.

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:19.708
- No need to be upset.
Ringmaster. everything is ready.

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:21.208
Tomorrow morning. just as planned.

01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:23.250
I'll bring all the animals to the circus.

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:26.250
(Ringmaster laughs)

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:38.500
(door slams)

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.166
- Fitna. Fitna. you may do
what you have to with me.

01:20:42.166 --> 01:20:44.750
but for heaven's sake. spare
the rest of the animals.

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:47.416
They're innocent. there's no
place for them in the circus.

01:20:47.416 --> 01:20:49.708
- Excuse me. why would I let them go?

01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:51.208
If we can't use them in the circus.

01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:54.166
we can sell their skins.
or perhaps we'll sell them

01:20:54.166 --> 01:20:59.166
for animal testing. there's
always a market. (laughs)

01:21:10.375 --> 01:21:12.541
(phone clatters)

01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:14.958
Godzilla. go see who that is.

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.125
What is this?

01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:26.166
Come back here. stop.
(upbeat orchestral music)

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.208
Come back here.

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:38.666
I just want to see your
Twitter feed. honest.

01:21:41.958 --> 01:21:43.958
Can I offer you a bribe?

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:48.625
He's so fast. is he part cheetah?

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:58.416
Oh. snap. donkey dead.

01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:09.125
(Mangu snores)

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:12.125
- Who said you could sleep?

01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:13.625
- What's going on?

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:19.625
Father. Father.

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:25.875
Father. I have to admit
it. I'm a complete fool.

01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:29.916
That evil fox made me do
some really terrible things.

01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:32.000
(Mangu cries)

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.333
- Son. despite what people may say.

01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:36.458
you have a brain up
there under that crown.

01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:38.625
and it's full of little gray cells.

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:40.958
and now it is time for you to use it.

01:22:40.958 --> 01:22:43.125
- You told me that dreaming was good.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:46.000
but I'm living a nightmare.
- Okay. calm down.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.166
- [Mangu] I was under the
illusion that I was a king.

01:22:48.166 --> 01:22:49.833
- It's not an illusion.

01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:52.666
You are the legitimate king.
and you shouldn't need me

01:22:52.666 --> 01:22:56.750
to tell you that. so now
go and save your people.

01:22:57.875 --> 01:23:00.208
- I know you're right. wait.
let me upload this video

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.833
to Facebook first. all right?

01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:04.208
- Oh. Mangu. forget it. in life you've got

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:07.250
to face your problems. not Facebook them.

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:11.041
- Dad. I don't know if
I can do this alone.

01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:12.000
Come with me. please.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.458
- Sorry. you have to do this yourself.

01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:17.041
The people elected you king. now it's time

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:21.000
to show them exactly why
they elected you king.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
It's your story. Mangu. it's
your story. you are the hero.

01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:27.625
Now go on. get out there

01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:30.583
and be the king you promised
the animals you would be.

01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:31.416
- But--

01:23:31.416 --> 01:23:32.875
- Though you were born a donkey.

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:35.875
now you wear the crown of a king.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:39.666
Now go. donkey king. don't
make me have to tell you again.

01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:44.666
Go and make me proud.
(upbeat orchestral music)

01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:53.875
A father's work is never done.

01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:57.916
- I haven't seen the king today.

01:23:57.916 --> 01:23:59.541
Could he have been kidnapped too?

01:23:59.541 --> 01:24:01.458
- We should be so lucky.

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:03.958
then maybe things would
start working again.

01:24:03.958 --> 01:24:07.166
- There he is now. the new king.

01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:09.291
(Mangu pants)

01:24:09.291 --> 01:24:10.333
- Sir. sir.

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:13.458
- Get that away from me. I
don't deserve the respect.

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:14.458
- It's an umbrella.

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:18.166
- Not now. brothers. I
need you to forgive me.

01:24:18.166 --> 01:24:21.291
Forgive me for how I failed
you. I didn't mean to.

01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:23.125
- But Mangu. what do you mean?

01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:25.833
- Zandar. you can't imagine
a horrible thing I've done

01:24:25.833 --> 01:24:29.125
as your king. but they made me do it.

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:31.000
Fitna's been working to destroy us.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.916
and she's been using me
as her unwitting donkey.

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:34.875
- What did he say?

01:24:34.875 --> 01:24:37.291
- Bull brother. bull bro. I discovered

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:38.916
where they took your missing brother.

01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:41.708
and your son who's been
missing for so long.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:43.416
Your children are being held in cages.

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:44.250
- What?

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:46.916
- I've seen them myself
there with my own eyes.

01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:49.208
- Oh. where are they. please tell me.

01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:51.625
- Fitna. Fitna is the one holding them.

01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:54.083
They're all being held
in cages. her plan is

01:24:54.083 --> 01:24:56.750
to transport them to
the Ringmaster's circus.

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.166
Though I found them. I
couldn't set them free.

01:24:59.166 --> 01:25:00.708
- What kind of madness is this?

01:25:00.708 --> 01:25:02.708
- The worst kind of madness.
she even has the king

01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:04.416
and Shazad locked up. too.

01:25:04.416 --> 01:25:06.416
- Wow. Mangu. (claps) wow.

01:25:06.416 --> 01:25:09.000
As a king. you're already a joke.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.250
but you just took it to the next level.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.541
(group laughs)

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:14.041
- Brothers. you must believe me.

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:15.458
We can't let them get away with it.

01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:18.458
- Why should we. have you done
anything to earn our trust?

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:20.791
- We don't have time to
stand here and debate this.

01:25:20.791 --> 01:25:22.666
If we don't do something right away.

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:26.041
Fitna's gonna turn those
animals into circus slaves.

01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:29.666
- Mangu. we should never
have made you king.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:32.583
It was the biggest mistake we made.

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:39.750
- Maybe. maybe you're right.
but I am still the king now.

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:43.000
and despite what you may
think. that won't change.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.625
It's time for me to act like
the king you want me to be.

01:25:45.625 --> 01:25:47.625
I'm going on a rescue mission.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:50.208
even if I have to go all alone.

01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:52.708
- Then go.

01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:55.125
- Thanks for nothing. I'm out.

01:25:55.125 --> 01:25:56.416
- Hey. everyone. look.

01:25:56.416 --> 01:25:59.125
Mangu's finally acting like a real donkey.

01:25:59.125 --> 01:26:01.708
(group laughs)

01:26:02.875 --> 01:26:04.833
(horn honks)

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.666
- They're on their way to the circus.

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:08.916
but I'm the one who's gonna stop them.

01:26:08.916 --> 01:26:12.583
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:26:14.791 --> 01:26:15.625
- DK!

01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:19.291
- Save us. King. save us!
(overlapping chattering)

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:22.625
(slow orchestral music)

01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:39.833
- Sir. did you happen
to see this video posted

01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:41.791
on Mangu's Facebook page?

01:26:41.791 --> 01:26:43.916
- Then Mangu is telling the truth?

01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:45.708
Get this story out immediately.

01:26:45.708 --> 01:26:47.541
- But this isn't evil news.

01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:49.375
- There are times for doing evil.

01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:53.166
and there are times for
doing what is so needed.

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:54.625
Go and break the news.

01:26:54.625 --> 01:26:57.958
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:26:57.958 --> 01:27:02.083
- Fitna and the Ringmaster's
plan is exposed.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:05.583
Can the donkey king defeat
these villains all by himself?

01:27:05.583 --> 01:27:08.041
You gotta keep watching Monkey News.

01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:10.625
It's about our family today. (cries)

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:13.291
Come on. we have to go help Mangu.

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:15.000
- Mangu was right. we have to help.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Come on. now. get going.

01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:21.625
- [Mangu] No. no. no. no.

01:27:28.833 --> 01:27:31.666
(Mangu cries out)

01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:36.000
(horn honks)

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:42.250
- My King. you need to
straddle the bike. it's safer.

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:46.250
- But my pants are really
tight. they could rip.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:49.750
- Not good.

01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:52.416
- I got you.

01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:04.791
- Hey. is somebody cooking meatballs?

01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:07.791
Oh. no. it's me. I'm cooking.

01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:09.041
Oh. that's bad.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.833
- Yeah.

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:22.083
- Excuse me. fun fact about cars.

01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:27.083
They often have two doors.
one on each side. (laughs)

01:28:30.125 --> 01:28:33.666
- It is a goal. the crowd goes wild.

01:28:33.666 --> 01:28:36.041
The crowd goes wild.

01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:37.291
- Mangu. Mangu!

01:28:45.583 --> 01:28:48.041
- What's going on. why is this happening?

01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:50.000
I was just minding my own business.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.791
They're out to get me.
they're all out to get me.

01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:56.708
People tell me I'm
crazy. but obviously not.

01:28:56.708 --> 01:29:00.375
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:11.291
- Let's go. ex king. give me your hand.

01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:19.583
(tires screeching)

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:24.875
(whimsical orchestral music)

01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:36.791
- He's up. he's up. it's
going. he has done it again.

01:29:36.791 --> 01:29:39.041
The crowd goes totally wild.

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:43.750
- Where have (mumbles) hijinks gotten to?

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:48.750
- Go. stop the fox. now.
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:52.291
(brakes screeching)

01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:53.125
- No.

01:29:53.125 --> 01:29:55.791
- [Super Dude] Shazad. Shazad!

01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:57.208
- Oh. no. no way.

01:29:59.291 --> 01:30:00.708
- [Shazad] Daddy!

01:30:07.958 --> 01:30:10.500
(Fitna laughs)

01:30:12.416 --> 01:30:15.250
(Mangu cries out)

01:30:19.666 --> 01:30:21.375
- [Mangu] Come on. Prince.

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:22.208
- [Shazad] DK.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:24.000
- Give me your hand.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.666
- If you're asking for my
hand. you have to ask my dad.

01:30:26.666 --> 01:30:28.875
- I'm not trying to marry you. come on.

01:30:28.875 --> 01:30:31.333
Let's go. Shazad. come on. let's go.

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:32.583
- Daddy. Daddy!

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.833
- Shazad. this is a rescue.

01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:37.625
I've never seen anything like him.

01:30:37.625 --> 01:30:42.625
(Mangu cries out)
(ominous orchestral music)

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:54.208
(Fitna growls)

01:30:54.208 --> 01:30:58.875
- What shall I feast on today.
donkey pie or donkey fry?

01:31:00.166 --> 01:31:01.750
- I prefer goodbye.

01:31:07.333 --> 01:31:10.708
(brakes screeching)

01:31:10.708 --> 01:31:13.208
(Fitna gasps)

01:31:13.208 --> 01:31:15.083
- That sure was a close one.
I could have been killed

01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:17.958
by that. but I'm okay now. huh?

01:31:17.958 --> 01:31:20.791
(Fitna cries out)

01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:25.500
- I need to invade your personal space.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.125
- [Shazad] Under no circumstance
are you to invade my--

01:31:28.125 --> 01:31:31.416
(Shazad cries out)

01:31:31.416 --> 01:31:35.333
- Oh. oh. oh. (screams)

01:31:35.333 --> 01:31:39.000
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:45.291
(crowd gasps)

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:49.208
(quiet overlapping chattering)

01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:54.625
- I know sometimes he can
be very inappropriate.

01:31:54.625 --> 01:31:57.125
but he died saving my life.

01:31:57.125 --> 01:32:00.375
- Mangu was good at heart. a good king.

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:10.083
- Move out of my way
so I can see who died.

01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:12.375
Oh. no. darn. (cries)

01:32:12.375 --> 01:32:14.875
- My Lord. it was you we were mourning.

01:32:14.875 --> 01:32:16.791
How did you manage to escape?

01:32:16.791 --> 01:32:18.375
- Even though a shark tried to eat me.

01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:19.791
he decided against it.

01:32:19.791 --> 01:32:22.166
I guess he thought I was just too bony.

01:32:22.166 --> 01:32:23.875
(group laughs)

01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:26.458
(group cheers)

01:32:31.458 --> 01:32:34.958
Your Majesty. allow me
to return your crown.

01:32:34.958 --> 01:32:39.083
You see. I'm a donkey. that
is all I will ever need.

01:32:39.083 --> 01:32:43.250
- Mangu. the people of Azadnagar
chose you to be their king.

01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:46.916
That's a sacred bond that no
one can ever take from you.

01:32:46.916 --> 01:32:47.750
- Huh?

01:32:48.708 --> 01:32:50.041
- Not even me.

01:32:50.041 --> 01:32:52.541
(slow orchestral music)

01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:55.125
- Zandar. please. make
him try to understand.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:57.791
- I'd love to help you. but
I can't because he's right.

01:32:57.791 --> 01:33:00.875
The animals elected you. you
are the duly elected king.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:04.000
- How can I possibly run the
government all by myself?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.125
- You don't have to. a government is run

01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:09.250
by more than a king.
it's run by many animals.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:11.583
- But where will I find all these animals?

01:33:11.583 --> 01:33:14.041
- They're all around you. Mangu.

01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:17.125
each one ready to serve if you pick them.

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:19.166
- Zandar. I'm so confused.

01:33:19.166 --> 01:33:22.500
- It's like this. if your
ears were where your eyes are

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.875
and your eyes where you have ears.

01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:28.208
nobody would be able to
see or hear anything.

01:33:28.208 --> 01:33:30.208
If you put the wrong person in a position

01:33:30.208 --> 01:33:34.041
that's wrong for them. then
nothing's ever going to work.

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.625
- Oh. I get it now.

01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:40.875
In that case. I hereby state

01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:43.000
that you will be our
new Commander in Chief.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.875
No one would dare defy
my orders if they knew

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:48.000
that you were around the palace.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.041
And you. Rapid?
- Good afternoon.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.166
- I'm now gonna make you
the Minister of Complaints.

01:33:52.166 --> 01:33:54.333
You have the patience
to listen to everyone.

01:33:54.333 --> 01:33:55.166
And you. Lando.

01:33:55.166 --> 01:33:56.000
- Pardon?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.041
- You are in charge of
protecting our border.

01:33:58.041 --> 01:33:59.291
You'll be able to see the threats

01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:00.291
that come to us from afar.

01:34:00.291 --> 01:34:03.000
- You want a brand new car?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.833
- You can see far.

01:34:04.833 --> 01:34:06.875
- Very smart. sir. with the right person

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:09.458
in the right position. in no time at all.

01:34:09.458 --> 01:34:11.166
we'll be a new nation.

01:34:11.166 --> 01:34:13.916
- Super Dude. why didn't you tell me this?

01:34:13.916 --> 01:34:16.375
- I'll drop and give you 20 pushups. sir.

01:34:16.375 --> 01:34:17.375
- That's nonsense.

01:34:17.375 --> 01:34:19.041
- Thank you.

01:34:19.041 --> 01:34:20.916
- And in this new nation of ours.

01:34:20.916 --> 01:34:23.583
Monkey News shall speak no evil.

01:34:23.583 --> 01:34:28.083
hear no evil. and in the
future. we will show no evil.

01:34:29.666 --> 01:34:31.166
- Sir. the ratings?

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:33.458
- I said forget the ratings.

01:34:33.458 --> 01:34:36.541
- Excuse me. excuse me.
can someone please tell me

01:34:36.541 --> 01:34:39.041
what there is for me to do around here?

01:34:39.041 --> 01:34:43.166
- Three jobs. entertainment.
entertainment. entertainment.

01:34:43.166 --> 01:34:48.125
(Shazad cheers)
(group laughs)

01:34:48.125 --> 01:34:51.333
Good people of Azad City. a few words.

01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:53.625
Lift your ears proudly and use your tails

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:56.625
to whip the flies away because now.

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:58.875
our nation is under donkey.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.583
no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.583
It's animal rule.
(upbeat orchestral music)

01:35:05.583 --> 01:35:08.166
(crowd cheers)

01:35:16.833 --> 01:35:20.333
- Okay. it's time for me to go. son.

01:35:20.333 --> 01:35:23.000
- But Father. how would
I do this without you?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.291
- You don't need me anymore.

01:35:25.291 --> 01:35:30.041
You have proven that while you
may have been born a donkey.

01:35:30.041 --> 01:35:32.708
you are now a king.
(slow orchestral music)

01:35:32.708 --> 01:35:36.583
You'll be fine. just
wash behind your ears.

01:35:36.583 --> 01:35:40.416
- Huh?
(slow orchestral music)

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.875
(upbeat drumming)

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:54.000
- Three. two. one. yo. what's good?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.500
It's your boy. Kenny Knox. and
I'm playing the donkey king.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.208
Mangu. we're here. day one.
you about to get started.

01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:03.458
I'm excited. probably be really fun.

01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:06.125
It's my first leading
role. it's animation.

01:36:06.125 --> 01:36:07.541
I always wanted to do animation.

01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:11.875
I'm excited. goodbye.
(upbeat music)

01:36:13.625 --> 01:36:15.125
- Day one. recording my voiceover.

01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:16.833
It's Mark Dohner. I'm playing Shazad.

01:36:16.833 --> 01:36:18.791
He's got the blue streak in his hair.

01:36:18.791 --> 01:36:23.291
I went with the pink. but
we'll see how it goes today.

01:36:25.625 --> 01:36:27.958
- [Production Assistant]
Okay. go ahead. do it.

01:36:27.958 --> 01:36:30.041
(Kenny brays)

01:36:30.041 --> 01:36:33.208
- I'm trying to make the donkey noise.

01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:36.791
- I look amazing.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:37.958
- [Fitna] Wow.

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.166
- I look amazing?

01:36:39.166 --> 01:36:40.583
- [Production Assistant]
Yeah. there you go (mumbles).

01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.416
- How do you think I look. Miss Fitna?

01:36:42.416 --> 01:36:43.916
I look amazing?

01:36:43.916 --> 01:36:45.291
- [Fitna] Wow.

01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:46.625

Just be a little more excited

01:36:46.625 --> 01:36:48.791
about this. like he's proud of his--

01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:51.041

01:36:51.041 --> 01:36:52.875
I look amazing. I look amazing?

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:53.916
- [Production Assistant] Yeah. great.

01:36:53.916 --> 01:36:57.750
- How do you think I look.
Miss Fitna. I look amazing?

01:36:57.750 --> 01:37:00.500
- [Production Assistant] Perfect.

01:37:02.958 --> 01:37:06.208
âª Donkey. new king. donkey.

(Shazad laughs)

01:37:47.375 --> 01:37:49.125
- [Shazad] Miss Fitna. Miss Fitna.

01:37:49.125 --> 01:37:51.416
say it again. just one more time.

01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:54.833
(overlapping chattering)

01:37:56.666 --> 01:37:59.791
- Great day. day one is
wrapped. we in this thing.

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:01.208
I'm onto day two.

01:38:05.083 --> 01:38:06.125
- That was really. really dope.

01:38:06.125 --> 01:38:07.875
really easy to work with the crew.

01:38:07.875 --> 01:38:08.958
and it was fun. I'm excited

01:38:08.958 --> 01:38:13.958
to hear how it sounds all
vocally produced and mixed. so.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.291
- [Interviewer] Can you explain
your character real quick?

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:18.708
- Mangu is a donkey. he's a washerman.

01:38:18.708 --> 01:38:21.458
He's just a silly. a
really silly character.

01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:23.958
and he's about to become king.

01:38:25.208 --> 01:38:29.708
You gotta watch the movie.
you gotta see what happens.
