Yeah. I do.

68
00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:11.323
He was a good man.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.624
And he would've been
proud of me.

70
00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:14.826

71
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.895

Exactly like Ma did.

75
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.570
She saw through his shit

76
00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.105

- Fuck that! She left us.

77
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:28.573

Dad took care of this family!
He gave us all a chance!

81
00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:35.113
What. while he was up at county?

82
00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:36.781

That shit's on you.

90
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.750
You ain't supposed to see that.

91
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.853
You ain't supposed to see
anything like that.

92
00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:15.921
Stop!

93
00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:18.924
You don't need to protect me.

94
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.327
I ain't made o' glass.
I can handle it.

95
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.700
Maybe you just need
a little space.

96
00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:30.735
ya know?

97
00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.639
I think things'll be better
once you--

98
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:37.309
It's just that he doesn't
remember the way it was.

99
00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.012
If he keeps pushing me
like that.

100
00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:43.214
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm just about to snap and I--

101
00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:45.050

103
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:50.655
Yeah. Of course.

104
00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:12.243
You gotta get that temper
under control.

105
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.080
or you're gonna
put us all at risk.

106
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.350
I'm not just talking
about Boots.

107
00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:23.855
He was five.

108
00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:26.391
I know.

109
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.028
We don't get to pick
our heroes. ya know?

110
00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.167
We're all he's got.

111
00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:41.406
Maybe we're sending him down
the wrong path.

112
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:45.810
We're doing the best we can.
Like always.

113
00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:50.649
You two gonna be good?

114

You ought to let him in here.

182
00:15:45.412 --> 00:15:47.345
He's not gonna be able
to learn otherwise.

183
00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:53.952
What?

184
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:59.090
What happened
with Ted Wallace's wife?

185
00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.560
Didn't have anything to do
with me.

186
00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:06.397
That's not what
Ted Wallace thinks.

187
00:16:08.668 --> 00:16:10.535
Yeah. well. what she does

188
00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:12.537
in her own private time
is her business.

189
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.177
Listen.
This stuff is here either way.

190
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.480
The only thing
that makes a difference is

191
00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:24.449
who makes the money.

192
00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:59.050
What the hell
are we doin' here. man?

193
00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.419
Waitin'.

194
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:04.422
Ain't you never waited
for nothin' before?

195
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.160
Well. what are we waitin' for?

196
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.067
I want you to meet
someone is all.

197
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.571
Yeah. who?

198
00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:23.341
He served two tours
a couple years before me.

199
00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:26.077
He's a war hero?

200
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.247
Just because ya fight in a war.
don't make you a hero. man.

201
00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:30.748
Yeah. it does.

202
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.218
Don't talk about shit you
don't know nothin' about. Boots.

203
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.720
Hey. you fought
for your country.

204
00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:37.822
You killed terrorists.

205
00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:39.657
I don't care.
you're a hero to me.

206
00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:41.325
I laid on rooftops
and shot at people

207
00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:42.794
who didn't even know
I was there.

208
00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:45.096
That ain't being
a fuckin' hero. man.

209
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:48.666
Hey. hey. hey. man.
who's this guy?

210
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.702
That's my brother. Boots.

211
00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.771
Boots.
I want you to meet Packard.

212
00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.941
How you doin'. man?

213
00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.309
Hey. you know.
it is what it is. y'know?

214
00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.279
Yeah. Here.

215
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.450
Oh. man.
Hey. I know it's not much--

216
00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.385
No. no. no. You keep that.

217
00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.654
You take care of yourself.
Take care of that woman too.

218
00:18:09.656 --> 00:18:11.255
Of course. man.
We're gonna do that.

219
00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.690
Yeah. All right. man.

220
00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:15.493
Hey. your brother. man.

221
00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:18.329
He's a good man.
best I ever knew.

222
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.831
Come on. Boots.

223
00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:28.306
Hey. what was that all about?

224
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.143
You skimming off
the top for that guy?

225
00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:34.579
Two pills every run.

226
00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:37.315
Does Josie know?

227
00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:39.617
What you think?

228
00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:52.396
Why are you showing me this.
man?

229
00:18:58.538 --> 00:19:00.838
I know you've been meeting up
with people.

230
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.342
Trying to make moves.

231
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.583
Come on. man. it's nothing.
It's-- It's...

232
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:14.685
You need to kill it.

233
00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:17.922
No. man.
I'm not gonna fucking kill it.

234
00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:20.691
Fuck! I'm trying to look out
for you. all right?

235
00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:22.326
You don't need this shit.

236
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:27.231
This shit is what we do. man.

237
00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:30.935
There ain't nothin' else for me.

238
00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:38.209
Just fucking kill it.
You hear me?

239
00:19:40.647 --> 00:19:41.712
Yeah.

240
00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:44.482
Whatever.

241
00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:00.698
Is it really that bad?

242
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.201
You think this is boring?

243
00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.635
You should come visit me
in Tisdale.

244
00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:06.704
- I'll show you boring.
- Yeah.

245
00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:12.910
So. you. uh...

246
00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.714
you talk to your brother yet?

247
00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.650
You sure you wanna mess
with this. man?

248
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.254
Yes.

249
00:20:24.257 --> 00:20:25.723
Fuckin' yeah. I am.

250
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:29.227
I ain't just gonna sit around
with my dick in my hand all day.

251
00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.529
I gotta fuckin'
make shit happen.

252
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:33.331
All right! Fine.

253
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:36.300
He's. um... He's got a guy.

254
00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:39.570
He sells other shit. but no oxy.

255
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.639
No pills. Not yet.

256
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:43.541
His name's Marcus.

257
00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:45.543
Marcus. All right.

258
00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:47.445
- The only thing. man...
- What?

259
00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:51.816
It's gotta be quite a lot.
Make it worth it and everything.

260
00:20:54.487 --> 00:20:56.287
Okay. Yeah.

261
00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:58.889
I can get as much
as his ass can pay for.

262
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:00.458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

263
00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:12.603
Blue 45.
Blue 45. hut-hut!

264
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.423
- Later. Jimmy.
- Thanks.

265
00:21:46.606 --> 00:21:47.838
Oh. shit.

266
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.990
Was lookin' for you
everywhere!

267
00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:08.959
Uh. this isn't a great time.

268
00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:10.461
Come on. I just wanna watch.

269
00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:12.463
You sure you don't want
to sit with your--

270
00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:13.631
No. I'm good.

271
00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:23.607
Ten-hut!

272
00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:31.582
That was amazing.

273
00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:45.129
Somethin' on your mind?

274
00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:49.834
No. Nah. Just. um...

275
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:54.071
You and me?
We're. um. still good?

276
00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:59.643
Still maintaining our
delicate balance?

277
00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:04.115
Is that what this is?

278
00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:07.718
A delicate balance?

279
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:16.660
So long as I don't see anything
I don't wanna see.

280
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.131
I know. Of course.

281
00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:23.501
You take care. Kyle.

282
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.803
You made a choice. Jo.

283
00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:30.674
You don't have to do this.

284
00:23:31.978 --> 00:23:34.979
Some choice I have. huh?

285
00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:19.056
I always forget
how quiet it gets out here.

286
00:24:21.694 --> 00:24:24.829
Yeah. It's too quiet.

287
00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:27.631
You can hear yourself think.

288
00:24:29.202 --> 00:24:31.802
When was the last time
you slept a full night?

289
00:24:35.208 --> 00:24:36.707
2009.

290
00:24:47.854 --> 00:24:49.220
How do you do it?

291
00:24:53.092 --> 00:24:55.125
How do you shut it all up?

292
00:24:56.229 --> 00:24:57.761
Shut what up?

293
00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:04.034
People.

294
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.606
The...

295
00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:14.545
I mean. all of your sins.
just...

296
00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:17.982
Just waitin' for a chance...

297
00:25:19.552 --> 00:25:22.853
so that they can pop back up
and remind you.

298
00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:35.566
Well...

299
00:25:35.568 --> 00:25:38.235
One of us ought to get
some sleep at least.

300
00:25:42.108 --> 00:25:43.173
Hey.

301
00:25:47.113 --> 00:25:49.179
Are we any different than Dad?

302
00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:54.051
We're doing what we need to do
to get by.

303
00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:56.954
No different than anyone else.

304
00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:04.962
Can I get ya anything?

305
00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:09.833
- Nope.
- All right.

306
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.136
Good night.

307
00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:41.865
This plant--
The herbs are gonna need

308
00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:43.834
the same kind
of plant in a pot.

309
00:26:43.836 --> 00:26:46.804
Three to four in a pot
depending on their roots.

310
00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:48.372
This is French thyme.

311
00:26:48.374 --> 00:26:50.074
Now. what's--
What's French thyme?

312
00:26:50.076 --> 00:26:51.609
Uh. French thyme is what

313
00:26:51.611 --> 00:26:55.646
you would call a mother thyme.
and it grows...

314
00:28:03.449 --> 00:28:04.948
- Sup. brother?
- 'Sup. man.

315
00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:12.890
So. you're the kid. huh?

316
00:28:12.892 --> 00:28:16.360
You must be Marcus.
Got the money?

317
00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:22.032
All right.

318
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.269
Cooper. come here.

319
00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:27.571
What?

320
00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:28.971
- Get in the car.
- Why?

321
00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:30.441
Because this isn't
your deal anymore.

322
00:28:30.443 --> 00:28:31.842
- Get in the car.
- Boots?

323
00:28:31.844 --> 00:28:33.277
This is my deal.
What the hell!

324
00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.712
Ryan! This is my deal!

325
00:28:34.714 --> 00:28:36.714
It's all good. man.
It's all good.

326
00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:37.882
Fuck you!

327
00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:39.049
Get your ass in the car. boy.

328
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.384
Ryan. what the hell?

329
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.090
All right. then.

330
00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:48.792
That's all there is to it.

331
00:28:55.735 --> 00:28:57.267
Ryan. what the fuck?

332
00:28:58.003 --> 00:28:59.169
What the fuck?

333
00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:00.370
Hey. man...

334
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:03.841
- Ryan!
- Pathetic.

335
00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:05.442
Ryan! What the fuck?

336
00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:07.411
You got no idea
who you're fucking with.

337
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:09.113
Hey. just leave him.

338
00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:10.481
- Is that right?
- Boots!

339
00:29:10.483 --> 00:29:13.784
I know your face. man.
You're fucked.

340
00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:15.919
Fuck this. man. Come on.

341
00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.187
Let's go!

342
00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:18.756
You steal from the Conleys?

343
00:29:18.758 --> 00:29:21.825
We'll turn you inside out
and take back what's ours.

344
00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:23.260
Marcus.

345
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:27.865
You're a lot dumber
than I thought. Conley.

346
00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:29.399
Come on. Marcus! Let's go!

347
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:30.851
Hey. Wait. I--

348
00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:32.302
You said it. You're not
giving me much of a choice.

349
00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:33.837
I didn't mean it--

350
00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:45.149
What the fuck is happening?

351
00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:46.850
Ryan!

352
00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:48.886
- Fuck this.
- Ryan!

353
00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:51.255
Ryan!

354
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.586
That all of 'em?

355
00:30:23.823 --> 00:30:24.888
Kip!

356
00:30:26.058 --> 00:30:27.157
That all of 'em?

357
00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:28.592
Yeah.

358
00:30:32.965 --> 00:30:34.565
Come on.
you gotta help me with this.

359
00:30:34.567 --> 00:30:36.133
We gotta move.

360
00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:38.235
Kip. this shit's real.

361
00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:41.038
I didn't know... I didn't know
that they would do that.

362
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.439
Hey. shut the fuck up.
or I'll bury you

363
00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:44.141
right next to the rest
of these motherfuckers.

364
00:30:47.213 --> 00:30:48.412
You gonna help me or what?

365
00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:22.279
Got all the pills?

366
00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:27.651
Yup.

367
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:30.921
And you cleaned it all up?

368
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.626
Yup.

369
00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:44.201
You need to eat somethin'.

370
00:31:46.572 --> 00:31:48.138
Two kids are dead. Josie.

371
00:32:05.224 --> 00:32:08.492
What happened out there...
was awful.

372
00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:15.365
But all the more reason
why we can't just walk away.

373
00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:18.936
We can do this together.

374
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:21.238
Josie...

375
00:32:23.342 --> 00:32:24.608
promise me something.

376
00:32:28.013 --> 00:32:30.247
Protecting this family
comes first.

377
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:34.017
When it's time to quit. we quit.

378
00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:36.386
No questions asked.

379
00:32:38.157 --> 00:32:39.957
- Of course.
- Promise me.

380
00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:41.525
No questions asked.

381
00:32:46.966 --> 00:32:48.465
We're all in this together.

382
00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:21.598
What are we doin' here?

383
00:33:31.744 --> 00:33:34.478
What's going on?
What's my car doing here?

384
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.146
Someone could've seen it. Boots.

385
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:39.549
There's way too much
on the line.

386
00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:43.420
- You gotta be smarter.
- Wait!

387
00:33:43.422 --> 00:33:47.124
Josie. what the fuck!
Come on. Hey. look.

388
00:33:47.126 --> 00:33:49.243
I know I messed up.

389
00:33:49.244 --> 00:33:51.361
You wanted to be part of this?
This ain't a kid's game.

390
00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:53.230
The world's a cold.
ruthless bitch.

391
00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:54.765
I can't afford for you
not to understand that.

392
00:33:54.767 --> 00:33:57.034
- Look. I didn't mean--
- It's never just you. Boots.

393
00:33:58.404 --> 00:33:59.803
You doing this
ain't gonna make me

394
00:33:59.805 --> 00:34:01.438
learn better or anything.

395
00:34:03.075 --> 00:34:04.441
Oh. I'm not gonna do anything.

396
00:34:06.412 --> 00:34:09.046
You're a big man now.
You can clean up your own shit.

397
00:34:12.418 --> 00:34:14.051
Show us you're ready for this.

398
00:34:17.623 --> 00:34:19.823
No evidence gets left behind.

399
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.400
Josie. I'm sorry.

400
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:42.079
Josie. I'm sorry!

401
00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:44.568
- Hey.
- Hey!

402
00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:48.505
Kip. uh.
asked me to swing this by.

403
00:36:48.507 --> 00:36:49.673
More baby stuff?

404
00:36:50.742 --> 00:36:51.975
That was sweet of ya.

405
00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:53.343
So. um...

406
00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:56.680
you and Kip been lookin'
at houses at all?

407
00:36:58.584 --> 00:36:59.716
Yeah. a bit.

408
00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:02.319
I think we're gonna look at
some more this week.

409
00:37:02.321 --> 00:37:03.887
All here in town. I hope.

410
00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:05.922
Oh. yeah. we ain't gonna go far.

411
00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:09.359
Good. Because I still need him.

412
00:37:10.963 --> 00:37:12.829
Yeah. Course.

413
00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:16.833
All right.

414
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.803
See ya around.

415
00:37:19.805 --> 00:37:21.004
Yeah.

416
00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:55.739
So. what do you want me to do?

417
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:56.773
Nothin'.

418
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.209
Not a goddamn thing.

419
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.643
Then what's the point of me
even bein' here--

420
00:38:00.646 --> 00:38:02.479
If it were up to me.
you wouldn't be here.

421
00:38:02.481 --> 00:38:03.580
Yeah. well...

422
00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:13.823
Here we go.

423
00:38:37.716 --> 00:38:39.316
Stay here and watch.

424
00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:56.099
What the fuck is this?

425
00:38:58.704 --> 00:38:59.869
Who the fuck are you?

426
00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:01.938
Just give me the fucking money.

427
00:39:07.379 --> 00:39:09.913
Yeah.
that's not gonna be enough.

428
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.717
Fuck you. man. You're done.

429
00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:15.685
You son of a fucking bitch.
I'm gonna get you for this.

430
00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:17.087
Don't fucking
walk away from me.

431
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:30.867
Really? Is this it?
This is what you wanna do?

432
00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:32.869
Yo. what's going on?

433
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:34.104
Get back in the car. Boots!

434
00:39:34.106 --> 00:39:35.705
What the fuck
are you doing. man?

435
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:36.907
Who the fuck are you?

436
00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:38.108
Hey. calm down.
that's my brother.

437
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.809
He's gonna get you
some more money. all right?

438
00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:40.977
- Just calm down.
- Yeah?

439
00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:42.412
- Well. come on then!
- Boots.

440
00:39:42.414 --> 00:39:44.514
in the glove compartment.
there's more cash.

441
00:39:44.516 --> 00:39:45.982
Just bring it to me. all right?

442
00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:49.686
Well. come on then!

443
00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:50.954
Fucking calm down.

444
00:39:56.428 --> 00:39:57.994
The fuck is he doin'?

445
00:40:05.704 --> 00:40:07.070
Hey. hurry up!

446
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.483
Come on. let's go!

447
00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:26.121
I'm just gonna go back
and get it. all right?

448
00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:27.624
Slow.

449
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:32.595
Get back in the fucking car.

450
00:40:33.498 --> 00:40:34.964
Slowly.

451
00:40:36.435 --> 00:40:37.667
Grab the money.

452
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:46.176
Come on.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

453
00:40:46.178 --> 00:40:48.478
Come on. man. let's go.

454
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:53.516
Fuck!

455
00:41:00.492 --> 00:41:02.725
Fuck! Get in the fucking car!

456
00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:12.535
Fuck!

457
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.666
You're good.
Just be smart.

458
00:41:46.204 --> 00:41:48.355
What the hell is going on?

459
00:41:48.356 --> 00:41:50.507
- What do you think?
- Evening. y'all.

460
00:41:53.879 --> 00:41:55.678
Quite a scene you're causing.
Kyle.

461
00:41:56.948 --> 00:41:58.147
Wanna come inside?

462
00:42:00.552 --> 00:42:01.918
I'm fine out here.

463
00:42:04.523 --> 00:42:05.688
How ya doin'. Boots?

464
00:42:07.092 --> 00:42:08.892
You wanna tell us
what's going on?

465
00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:13.563
I don't know if y'all heard.

466
00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.531
but a few kids went missing up
in Tisdale a few days back.

467
00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:17.534
Local boys are on the case.

468
00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:20.303
They followed some tire tracks
into the woods

469
00:42:20.305 --> 00:42:24.674
and found a piñata
of shell casings.

470
00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:27.043
Multiple weapons.

471
00:42:27.846 --> 00:42:29.779
One of which was a .308.

472
00:42:31.216 --> 00:42:33.049
Y'all wouldn't know
anyone else around here

473
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.784
with that kind of hardware.
would ya?

474
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.320
Afraid we can't help you.

475
00:42:38.924 --> 00:42:40.790
None of us ever go up
to Tisdale.

476
00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:42.125
Yeah. see. that's just it.

477
00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:48.264
This wasn't up in Tisdale.

478
00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:52.602
This was just past the river.
Right here in Bates County.

479
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.313
You listen to me closely.

480
00:43:03.315 --> 00:43:06.649
I can't stand by
and just let this happen.

481
00:43:07.586 --> 00:43:09.118
Don't be stupid.

482
00:43:09.888 --> 00:43:11.287
We have leads.

483
00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:14.257
We have witnesses.

484
00:43:15.594 --> 00:43:17.760
And we're closing in
on this thing fast.

485
00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:21.998
Good luck finding that rifle.
Knox.

486
00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:26.235
Y'all have a good night.

487
00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:52.895
- How'd the buy go?
- They fucked us.

488
00:43:52.897 --> 00:43:54.631
Assholes nearly shot us both.

489
00:43:54.633 --> 00:43:55.865
- Josie!
- They what?

490
00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:56.933
That's it.

491
00:43:57.369 --> 00:43:58.635
It's over.

492
00:43:58.637 --> 00:44:00.069
What are you talking about?

493
00:44:00.872 --> 00:44:03.039
I'm done.
We're done.

494
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.408
Excuse me?
You don't get to say when--

495
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.744
You said that when we needed to.
we'd stop.

496
00:44:07.746 --> 00:44:09.145
This is that time.

497
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:11.414
- That's--
- No questions asked. right?

498
00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:15.018
Don't tear this apart. Kip.

499
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.419
Wake up. Josie!

500
00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:18.221
We got cops
knockin' on our doors.

501
00:44:18.223 --> 00:44:19.789
Boots just had a gun
to his head.

502
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.356
Hey. don't fucking talk
about me like I ain't here!

503
00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:23.026
I can't go into a bar
without somebody trying

504
00:44:23.028 --> 00:44:24.293
- to kick my head in!
- That's bullshit!

505
00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:26.029
I will not put this family
in any more danger.

506
00:44:26.031 --> 00:44:27.263
You wanna keep
the Conleys together.

507
00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:28.765
then we stop this shit
right now.

508
00:44:28.767 --> 00:44:30.433
Without the dope.
there are no fucking Conleys!

509
00:44:30.435 --> 00:44:31.834
Don't you fucking get it?

510
00:44:33.138 --> 00:44:34.871
Or are you gonna put your girl
through college

511
00:44:34.873 --> 00:44:36.272
by chopping fucking wood?

512
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:39.742
This gave you everything.

513
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:41.444
It's who we are.

514
00:44:41.446 --> 00:44:44.313
And I'm not gonna quit just
'cause you're getting scared.

515
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:46.983
I will fix it.

516
00:44:47.786 --> 00:44:50.253
Knox. Cooper. all of it.

517
00:44:50.255 --> 00:44:53.690
- I will fix it.
- You're just like him.

518
00:44:54.726 --> 00:44:55.925
Just like him.

519
00:44:55.927 --> 00:45:00.063
Kip. wait!
Kip. I can fix it!

520
00:45:11.276 --> 00:45:13.076
This is so fucked.

521
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.814
This needs to be sorted
and bagged right away.

522
00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:22.351
- Are you a part of this or not?
- Yeah.

523
00:45:27.358 --> 00:45:28.925
Where you goin'?

524
00:46:00.892 --> 00:46:02.125
Hey. what's up. man?

525
00:46:02.127 --> 00:46:04.160
Hey. man.

526
00:46:07.766 --> 00:46:11.234
You. uh. want me to go wipe down
the booth for ya?

527
00:46:11.236 --> 00:46:13.269
No. No.
I'm not working. man.

528
00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:14.971
I'm just here
for a little clarity.

529
00:46:14.973 --> 00:46:16.239
Clarity. huh?

530
00:46:16.241 --> 00:46:18.508
We like to keep most
of our clarity

531
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.009
in the bottom of the glass.

532
00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:21.310
That's what I hear.

533
00:46:22.914 --> 00:46:24.380
Rocks or straight up?

534
00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:26.048
Straight up.

535
00:46:29.788 --> 00:46:31.387
You let me know
if you need anything else.

536
00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:32.455
All right.

537
00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:34.223
Thanks. brother.

538
00:46:37.362 --> 00:46:38.928
You ain't welcome here.

539
00:46:40.799 --> 00:46:42.565
I got no business with you.
brother.

540
00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:45.501
- Hey. Ted--
- Shut up!

541
00:46:49.841 --> 00:46:51.140
Come on. man.

542
00:46:51.142 --> 00:46:52.809
Fuckin' coward!

543
00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:54.377
Hey. you better calm down.
all right?

544
00:46:54.379 --> 00:46:55.511
Calm down!

545
00:46:57.515 --> 00:46:59.015
She was everything to me.

546
00:46:59.017 --> 00:47:01.017
Look at me. you fuckin'--

547
00:47:01.019 --> 00:47:02.285
Not in my bar!

548
00:47:02.287 --> 00:47:04.187
You know what this man did!

549
00:47:04.189 --> 00:47:07.023
Not in my bar ever.

550
00:47:07.025 --> 00:47:10.827
We'll take care of your tab
for tonight already.

551
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:12.094
You go on home.

552
00:47:15.033 --> 00:47:17.433
I hope you get to feel
just an ounce of the pain

553
00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:19.135
you've poured into this town.

554
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:23.172
'Cuz it will fucking eat you up.

555
00:47:38.189 --> 00:47:40.356
You're lucky I was here
to save your ass.

556
00:47:43.328 --> 00:47:44.861
What do you want. old man?

557
00:47:44.863 --> 00:47:47.330
What do I want? Hmm.

558
00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:51.901
When I was a little kid.

559
00:47:51.903 --> 00:47:55.171
we were playin' behind
my house one day.

560
00:47:55.173 --> 00:47:58.007
Little kid
named Jimmie Mooney...

561
00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.510
he got bit by a snake.

562
00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:05.081
Right here on the vein.

563
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:08.484
And we didn't tell my mom.

564
00:48:08.486 --> 00:48:12.455
We knew goddamn well
that we'd get in trouble.

565
00:48:12.457 --> 00:48:17.526
Well. that venom traveled
real fast through Jimmie's body.

566
00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:20.596
And a few hours later...

567
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.066
he died on my porch.

568
00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:26.969
Well. I'm sorry for your loss.

569
00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:28.304
Yeah.

570
00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:31.607
Hear me.

571
00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:37.513
That venom is in you.

572
00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:39.949
It's in all o' you.

573
00:48:40.919 --> 00:48:42.451
And it's spreading.

574
00:48:42.453 --> 00:48:45.922
Deputies came in here
asking about you.

575
00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:49.358
They're probably questioning
that knocked up girlfriend

576
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.960
of yours right now.

577
00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:54.931
And you got a decision to make.

578
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.135
Are you willing to cut off
an arm

579
00:48:59.137 --> 00:49:01.237
to save the body?

580
00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:07.270
Josie.

581
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:09.038
- Hey. Coop.
- What are you doing here?

582
00:50:09.774 --> 00:50:11.207
Can we talk?

583
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.277
I'm... I'm really sorry.

584
00:50:16.414 --> 00:50:17.580
It's godawful.

585
00:50:19.384 --> 00:50:20.750
Losing a brother.

586
00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:24.020
And like that?

587
00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:28.391
Look. me and Boots.

588
00:50:28.393 --> 00:50:31.060
we never meant to cause you
any kind of trouble. or--

589
00:50:31.062 --> 00:50:32.194
I know.

590
00:50:32.797 --> 00:50:34.196
Your brother...

591
00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:38.067
Your brother was just in
with some really bad people.

592
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:40.202
And they caught wind of a deal.

593
00:50:47.645 --> 00:50:51.180
I... I really appreciate you
coming out here.

594
00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:54.316
I was fucking terrified
that you'd--

595
00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:57.486
We got you burned
and that you'd never wanna--

596
00:50:57.488 --> 00:50:58.721
Listen.

597
00:50:58.723 --> 00:51:01.757
They were shooting
at my brother too.

598
00:51:02.527 --> 00:51:03.592
Remember?

599
00:51:03.594 --> 00:51:06.529
It's a miracle
you two got outta there.

600
00:51:14.539 --> 00:51:17.306
I don't advocate for this much.

601
00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.308
But...

602
00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:25.314
you and I are both going through
some shit right now.

603
00:51:28.086 --> 00:51:30.286
If ever two people
deserved to...

604
00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:33.155
unplug for a second. it's...

605
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:35.658
you and me right now.

606
00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:39.328
You with me?

607
00:51:49.107 --> 00:51:50.372
You done that before?

608
00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:53.809
No. I saw my brother do it
a few times.

609
00:51:57.682 --> 00:51:59.548
Feel so good
in a minute.

610
00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:12.728
Fuck.

611
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.697
Yeah.

612
00:52:18.736 --> 00:52:20.736
I'm glad you got outta there.
man.

613
00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:26.442
You're a good kid.

614
00:52:28.279 --> 00:52:30.679
You don't deserve to go down
in your brother's mess.

615
00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:36.352
Have the cops been calling
around here at all?

616
00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:39.855
Huh?

617
00:52:40.391 --> 00:52:41.557
The cops?

618
00:52:41.559 --> 00:52:44.827
They're gonna try
to hang this on somebody.

619
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:47.363
Maybe you.

620
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:49.899
Maybe Boots.

621
00:52:51.269 --> 00:52:52.434
Maybe even me.

622
00:52:53.604 --> 00:52:56.172
Gotta make sure
we don't get burnt.

623
00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:27.503
They ask you
any questions or anything?

624
00:53:27.505 --> 00:53:28.671
Hmm. Sure.

625
00:53:28.673 --> 00:53:32.208
When Mom first caught wind
that they were missin'.

626
00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:35.511
But I-- I was a mess.

627
00:53:35.513 --> 00:53:37.947
I couldn't--
I couldn't say a thing.

628
00:53:40.885 --> 00:53:41.951
But the...

629
00:53:44.322 --> 00:53:48.257
The Bates County guy.
he called yesterday...

630
00:53:49.527 --> 00:53:50.693
wanted to...

631
00:53:51.762 --> 00:53:53.963
ask some questions
of his own. I guess.

632
00:53:54.999 --> 00:53:56.265
Yeah?

633
00:53:56.968 --> 00:53:58.801
Is that...

634
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:01.670
Is that-- Is that okay?

635
00:54:01.672 --> 00:54:03.706
- Should I be worried?
- No.

636
00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.876
Nothing for you to worry about.

637
00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:09.912
- Just. here.
- Wait. wait.

638
00:54:09.914 --> 00:54:11.780
- That's for you to--
- Hold still.

639
00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:19.201
...and I sat there.
stared at it.

640
00:57:19.203 --> 00:57:22.471
but I know I couldn't do it.
ya know?

641
00:57:22.473 --> 00:57:24.206
I just thought about my kids...

642
00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:26.942
and so I'm here today.

643
00:57:26.944 --> 00:57:29.445
Thank you
for sharing. Jack.

644
00:57:29.447 --> 00:57:30.646
Thank you. Jack.

645
00:57:30.648 --> 00:57:32.648
Anybody else like to share?

646
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:36.051
I'd like to share.

647
00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:39.655
Okay. great. Kyle.
Go ahead.

648
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:42.591
I'm Kyle. I'm an alcoholic.

649
00:57:42.593 --> 00:57:44.159
Hey. Kyle.

650
00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:46.995
I had a bad day yesterday...

651
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.034
and I was tempted. um...

652
00:57:53.604 --> 00:57:54.837
I was alone.

653
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.941
My wife went to her mother's.

654
00:57:58.943 --> 00:58:01.009
There was an argument
about work.

655
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:06.515
Things there have been
kinda rough lately.

656
00:58:09.153 --> 00:58:12.254
Ya know. people you trust
can let you down sometimes.

657
00:58:16.894 --> 00:58:17.960
Anyway...

658
00:58:17.962 --> 00:58:20.596
when she left. there it was.

659
00:58:20.598 --> 00:58:24.032
Sittin' there. waiting for me--

660
00:58:26.871 --> 00:58:28.937
Sorry. Go on. Kyle.

661
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:35.143
Hey.

662
00:58:52.096 --> 00:58:54.530
You know. it helps
if you stay the whole time.

663
00:59:04.575 --> 00:59:05.908
You all right?

664
00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:10.212
Sorry about Breanne.

665
00:59:11.949 --> 00:59:13.015
That cunt.

666
00:59:18.656 --> 00:59:20.055
Here we are again.

667
00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:22.958
Two fuckups
in the same parking lot.

668
00:59:25.229 --> 00:59:26.929
You think
we're going to be doing this

669
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:28.697
in 30 years too. hmm?

670
00:59:30.601 --> 00:59:33.802
Like two broken pieces
of pottery...

671
00:59:35.488 --> 00:59:37.171
...sitting in some shitty.
old cabinet.

672
00:59:39.176 --> 00:59:41.209
No idea
what you're talking about.

673
00:59:44.048 --> 00:59:45.681
Why do we do it. Jo?

674
00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:49.952
I'm sorry.

675
00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:52.087
Why?

676
00:59:54.825 --> 00:59:56.658
I really. really am.

677
01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.875
Wait. wait.

678
01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:19.247
I can't.

679
01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.194
- Jo--
- Fuck off.

680
01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:46.968
Kip.

681
01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:49.337
Fuck!

682
01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.311
Kip. honey.
you need to calm down.

683
01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.081
Let's go back inside.

684
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.451
Come back in and talk
to your brother. all right?

685
01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.356
Kip.

686
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.926
Kip.

687
01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:12.394
Kip. wait!

688
01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.064
I don't know
what you got in your head.

689
01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.934
but don't you go doin' nothin'
you can't come back from.

690
01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.068
ya hear me?

691
01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.097
What exactly do you think
you're doing?

692
01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:27.002
I asked you
a fuckin' question. boy.

693
01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:29.004
This one's for you.

694
01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.512
What the fuck you want. Conley?

695
01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.049
Repentance.

696
01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.421
You. uh...

697
01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.424
You want a pop or something?

698
01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.360
I got some extra here.

699
01:03:58.402 --> 01:03:59.367
Here ya go.

700
01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.273
Thanks.

701
01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.108
Let me clean you up a bit.

702
01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.611
Help us take our mind
off things.

703
01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.046
What do you say?

704
01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.150
Come on. I ain't gonna hurt ya.

705
01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:24.860
Fuck!

706
01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.040
- Yeah.
- Jo.

707
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.977
I'm at the mill.
I need your help.

708
01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:20.215
I tried to fix things
and it got... messy.

709
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.017
Please hurry.

710
01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:42.704
Look at that.

711
01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.641
We got quite the man
on our hands.

712
01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:53.949
You were right. ya know.

713
01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:56.351
Your father'd be proud of you.

714
01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.386
Yeah.

715
01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:51.773
Kip?

716
01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:06.388
Kip?

717
01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:22.170
Kip.

718
01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:27.442
Josie.

719
01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.177
Kip. what the fuck is going--

720
01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:54.289
911. what's your emergency?

721
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.857
I'd like to report
an incident...

722
01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:59.861
over at the mill
on Highway Nine.

723
01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:07.428
Kip.

724
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:09.297
Sheriff.

725
01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:14.569
What happened to you?

726
01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:17.038
I'm all right.

727
01:11:20.644 --> 01:11:22.010
I suppose you heard.

728
01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.416
I don't have a whole lot
of information just yet. but...

729
01:11:29.419 --> 01:11:30.485
Sorry--

730
01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.719
I don't need you
to talk. Sheriff.

731
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.355
Understood.

732
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.624
Just listen.

733
01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:39.394
Excuse me?

734
01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:42.497
No doubt
you'll search her truck.

735
01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.867
When you do.
you're gonna find that .308

736
01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:47.368
you've been looking for.

737
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.638
And I'm guessing
that the casings gonna match

738
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.007
the bullets found
in them poor Tisdale boys.

739
01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.445
She was a determined woman.
Sheriff.

740
01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.687
I'm gonna have to bury
my sister.

741
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.055
And when I do. I...

742
01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:12.760
I'd like to bury this whole
Conley business along with her.

743
01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:17.632
I don't think it's going to be
that simple. Kip.

744
01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.569
Yeah.

745
01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:23.671
It is.

746
01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:27.875
Last thing we want
is your wife and kid knowing

747
01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:29.944
that you liked to fuck
the local oxy dealer.

748
01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.581
Right?

749
01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:40.788
You're a good man. Kyle.
You always have been.

750
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:44.559
But that don't mean you don't do
bad things sometimes.

751
01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:48.096
I just don't see a reason
to hang you for it is all.

752
01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.099
Do you?

753
01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:58.840
All right.

754
01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.677
Now. if you'll excuse me.

755
01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.379
I'm gonna
go see my little brother.

756
01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:04.839
- Take her for a minute?
- Sure.

757
01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:17.985
Oh. so cute.

758
01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:19.954
She don't sleep.

759
01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:23.825
She did good today. man.
Real good.

760
01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:25.026
Didn't cry or nothing.

761
01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:26.994
She's a tough cookie.

762
01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:28.963
She takes after her mother
that way.

763
01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.164
Oh. yeah.

764
01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.736
So. uh. how you guys gettin' by?

765
01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:38.739
I mean. she's cute as hell.
but...

766
01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.209
it ain't cheap having a kid.

767
01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:45.079
You. uh.
really put all that away?

768
01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:47.782
Got to.

769
01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.217
Mm.

770
01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:51.486
We get by.

771
01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.822
Eve says that the salon's
doin' real good.

772
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.624
And the little bit extra
from the mill.

773
01:14:57.694 --> 01:14:59.060
Just day by day. brother.

774
01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:00.695
Yeah.

775
01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.276
You're fuckin' late.

776
01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:16.944
Yeah. I-- I'm sorry. I just...

777
01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:20.948
Here.

778
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.117
So that'll hold you. yeah?

779
01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.853
Oh. yeah. Yeah. yeah.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

780
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.656
And?

781
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.994
Well. uh. yeah. yeah.
Kip doesn't--

782
01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.763
Yeah. well. Kip ain't here.
Is he?

783
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.577
The world's a cold.
ruthless bitch.

784
01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.647
You gotta know your place in it.

785
01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:55.683
Yours is there.

786
01:15:58.555 --> 01:15:59.720
Mine's here.

787
01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.091
Now. get the fuck outta here.

788
01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.894
And if Kip sees you.
you're fuckin dead.

789
01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.796

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:23.878
