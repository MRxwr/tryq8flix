1
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:28.778
<i>You're not real.</i>

2
00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.381
<i>Weren't your eyes green?</i>

3
00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:35.819
<i>And your hair?</i>

4
00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:37.619
<i>You weren't what I thought.</i>

5
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.888
<i>A real person would never
say that. That proves it.</i>

6
00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.257
<i>You weren't what I thought.
Weren't your eyes green?</i>

7
00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:44.793
<i>That proves it. A real person
would never say that.</i>

8
00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.829
<i>I get to make it whatever
I want. That proves it.</i>

9
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.932
<i>A real person
would never say that.</i>

10
00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:04.014
<i>The things is.
even after everything.</i>

11
00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:07.248
<i>I wanted to believe.</i>

12
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.785
<i>Duct-taped to a chair.</i>

13
00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:13.988
<i>inches from oblivion.</i>

14
00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:17.126
<i>I still wanted to believe her.</i>

15
00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:23.198
<i>It's a myth that we use
only five percent of our brains.</i>

16
00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.235
<i>Ask anyone who's lost
even the smallest bit.</i>

17
00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.470
<i>No. we use
pretty much all of it.</i>

18
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:32.440
<i>and usually
that's not enough.</i>

19
00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:39.079
<i>We never catch the turtle who sits
on the turtle who sits on the...</i>

20
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.316
<i>Yeah.</i>

21
00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:43.752
<i>It's turtles all the way down.</i>

22
00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:50.058
<i>A lot to learn.</i>

23
00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.393
<i>A moment too late.</i>

24
00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.111
Are you ready?

25
00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:15.114
What did you have for breakfast
this morning. Mr. Herzman?

26
00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:16.415
Who cares about that?

27
00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:18.517
I'm just getting
sound levels.

28
00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:22.056
Ham and eggs.
like every morning.

29
00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:24.926
Okay.

30
00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.961
The trains were hell.

31
00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.430
But even hell has levels.

32
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.000
Some are in the middle
of the car.

33
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.169
and they're probably
not going to make it.

34
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.943
The heat from the bodies...
Their hell is worse.

35
00:02:44.644 --> 00:02:48.579
But my father pushed me
to the edge.

36
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.883
There wasn't a window there.
but there were slats.

37
00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:56.454
and through the slats sometimes
a breath of fresh air.

38
00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:58.090
Heaven.

39
00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.962
We stopped at a station
somewhere.

40
00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.497
Standing still
is worse than moving.

41
00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:10.037
even if you're moving
to something bad.

42
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.407
A bit of light
hit my eye.

43
00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:19.846
so I squeezed closer
to the slat.

44
00:03:20.444 --> 00:03:23.013
Then suddenly...

45
00:03:23.014 --> 00:03:27.251
a beautiful face appears...

46
00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:30.186
with innocent blue eyes.

47
00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:32.090
An angel.

48
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.459
But I didn't believe
in angels.

49
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.066
even then when I was a boy.
certainly not in this place.

50
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.637
<i>The Herzman story had been featured in a
local paper and was picked up nationally.</i>

51
00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:50.075
Before they knew it. they had a book
deal. and there was talk of a movie.

52
00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:52.243
I thought it'd make
an interesting documentary.

53
00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:53.846
History Channel?
That kind of thing?

54
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:55.445
Yeah.

55
00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:58.013
Internet says
you make movies.

56
00:03:58.014 --> 00:04:00.649
Normally.
I prefer fiction.

57
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.518
Why is that?

58
00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.321
It's more believable.

59
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:10.125
<i>I was late. as usual.</i>

60
00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:13.595
<i>hustling to make the 9:40 to
Hudson where the Herzmans lived.</i>

61
00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:16.198
<i>In the city.
you're always in a hurry.</i>

62
00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.003
<i>Gotta get to that meeting.
business lunch. the ATM.</i>

63
00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:23.074
<i>People are just obstacles.
inconveniences.</i>

64
00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:29.481
<i>And every now and then. a face
you can't get out of your mind.</i>

65
00:04:30.447 --> 00:04:31.747
<i>Who is this person.</i>

66
00:04:31.748 --> 00:04:34.617
<i>and how did
our trajectories cross?</i>

67
00:04:34.618 --> 00:04:39.253
<i>What histories does she bring. and what myths
might we create if only given the chance?</i>

68
00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:44.325
<i>And you want to say something.
but you can't find the words.</i>

69
00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:46.963
<i>You're just not that guy.</i>

70
00:04:48.198 --> 00:04:51.700
<i>So she'll always be a face
among faces. a cipher.</i>

71
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.671
<i>You'll never talk on the phone.
recognize her scent.</i>

72
00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:58.072
<i>You won't face each other
over a bistro table.</i>

73
00:04:58.073 --> 00:05:01.444
<i>taste the Malbec. learn
each other's favorite color.</i>

74
00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:07.716
<i>She is. in short.
every girl you'll never know.</i>

75
00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:09.420
<i>never love.</i>

76
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:13.555
<i>Better never
to have seen her at all.</i>

77
00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:16.692
<i>Now you understand
the ancient wisdom...</i>

78
00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:19.096
<i>Rip out the offending eye.</i>

79
00:05:20.062 --> 00:05:25.100
<i>Except I'd captured her
in my camera.</i>

80
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:35.044
<i>And like that.
she was gone.</i>

81
00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:47.687
I was getting some B-roll. and she
was just a face across the platform.

82
00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:50.391
No reason to believe
you'd ever see her again.

83
00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.194
There are physicists who believe
there are universes like ours...

84
00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.295
but with one
or two things changed.

85
00:05:55.296 --> 00:05:58.266
I thought maybe there was
a universe where we might meet.

86
00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:00.434
I didn't think
it'd be this one.

87
00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:02.369
Other universes?

88
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.104
Yeah.

89
00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:05.638
That what you believe?

90
00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.174
I find it comforting.

91
00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:12.113
For simplicity's sake.
let's keep to this universe.

92
00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:18.717
It was a little girl.
maybe five or six.

93
00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:22.223
with pretty blonde curls.

94
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:28.861
She peered at me
through the slat.

95
00:06:28.862 --> 00:06:33.168
a boy only a little
older than she.

96
00:06:34.502 --> 00:06:38.839
What must she have thought
of this train...

97
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.510
and its strange cargo?

98
00:06:42.643 --> 00:06:45.679
We looked at each other.

99
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.379
only inches away.

100
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.219
but it might have been
different continents.

101
00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:57.156
Then she made
a quick motion.

102
00:06:57.157 --> 00:07:01.293
and her small fingers
pushed through the slat.

103
00:07:01.294 --> 00:07:03.795
She dropped something
into my palm.

104
00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:09.668
and a moment later. as if the universe
had known that this moment had ended.

105
00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.637
the train
started up again.

106
00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:15.307
I looked down
at my hand.

107
00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:19.545
and I saw
that she had given me...

108
00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:23.551
the little gold cross
from around her neck.

109
00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:31.422
<i>There is always a moment
when your life changes.</i>

110
00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:33.560
<i>though you may not
realize it at the time.</i>

111
00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:35.861
<i>The words spoken.</i>

112
00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:39.498
<i>the light falling across
someone's face in a certain way.</i>

113
00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:43.701
<i>the moment you realize
you're in love or out of it.</i>

114
00:07:43.702 --> 00:07:47.706
<i>History has turned on its axis.
and you will never be the same.</i>

115
00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:51.443
<i>Right there.</i>

116
00:07:52.844 --> 00:07:56.580
<i>Was she getting a speck out of
her eye or dabbing at a tear?</i>

117
00:07:56.581 --> 00:08:00.885
<i>That touch. however small. turned
into flesh and blood for me...</i>

118
00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:04.388
<i>A soul with a past.
a life with an arc.</i>

119
00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.958
<i>A pretty girl on a train
is one thing.</i>

120
00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:10.163
<i>a crying girl
a whole other matter.</i>

121
00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:14.865
I wasn't sure if it was
the same girl I'd seen before.

122
00:08:14.866 --> 00:08:17.269
She looked different.

123
00:08:43.627 --> 00:08:44.729
Are you okay?

124
00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:52.304
Sorry. You just...
You seemed upset.

125
00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:57.406
You know. trains
can make people sad.

126
00:08:57.407 --> 00:09:01.277
It's like in all those
country-western songs.

127
00:09:01.278 --> 00:09:03.479
- Country.
- Right.

128
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.315
There's always a train.
and there's always someone sad.

129
00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:09.720
No. No one's called it country
and western in 30 years.

130
00:09:11.688 --> 00:09:13.524
- Well...
- Your lens is showing.

131
00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:17.893
It's my job.

132
00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:19.762
If you're a private eye.
you suck at it.

133
00:09:19.763 --> 00:09:22.733
Nothing surreptitious.
I'm shooting a documentary.

134
00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:25.436
Is it on now?

135
00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:28.937
Camera shy?

136
00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:31.840
Who are those people who believe
a photograph captures your soul?

137
00:09:31.841 --> 00:09:33.577
Aborigines.

138
00:09:35.946 --> 00:09:38.312
Pretty sure they're wrong.

139
00:09:38.313 --> 00:09:41.584
What's it about?
Your movie.

140
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:46.388
I guess you could say
it's a love story.

141
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:49.359
I thought documentaries
were nonfiction.

142
00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:52.595
That would be
cynicism?

143
00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:57.766
You think just because something
really happens. it isn't fiction?

144
00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:02.503
I was pretty sure this wasn't your
average girl on the commuter line.

145
00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:04.738
She give you
any personal details?

146
00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:07.809
She had a way of turning
your questions around.

147
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.715
You thought you were talking about her. but
you were really just talking about yourself.

148
00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:16.917
Why were you crying?

149
00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:18.654
You tell me.

150
00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:21.722
I get to make it
whatever I want?

151
00:10:21.723 --> 00:10:23.324
Sure.

152
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:25.728
Okay.

153
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:30.564
Seven years ago. you met
a man on this very train.

154
00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:34.468
You got to talking. but you never
exchanged more than first names.

155
00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:37.070
He gets off at Poughkeepsie.

156
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:41.742
As he steps onto the platform. you realize
you should have gotten off with him.

157
00:10:41.743 --> 00:10:46.347
He was the guy. He was your one
chance to escape the wheel.

158
00:10:46.348 --> 00:10:50.483
But the train's already moving.
You've missed your chance.

159
00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:55.356
So you spend weeks looking through
the Poughkeepsie directory.

160
00:10:55.357 --> 00:10:57.558
but you've only got
his first name.

161
00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:59.161
Which is?

162
00:10:59.162 --> 00:11:00.761
Bob. unfortunately.

163
00:11:00.762 --> 00:11:02.728
If only it were
Zebediah.

164
00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:06.999
You call every one of the 373
Roberts. Bobs and Bobbys.

165
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.002
- I would never call a Bobby.
- With no luck.

166
00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:12.505
But every day for seven years.

167
00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:15.775
you buy your ticket.
you get on the train.

168
00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.745
take it to Poughkeepsie.

169
00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:22.515
and then you turn back
and head home alone.

170
00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:26.452
<i>Next stop will be Westport.
Westport Station in two minutes.</i>

171
00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:27.922
That is such a guy story.

172
00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:29.389
Yeah?

173
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.826
I wouldn't spend that much time tracking
someone down if they murdered my mother.

174
00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:40.699
So you're really
not gonna tell me?

175
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.536
You know. the difference
between trains and planes is.

176
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.038
on a train. if you don't like
the conversation.

177
00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.342
you can change
your seat.

178
00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.346
Or get off
at the next stop.

179
00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:56.482
Shouldn't ask
for your number then?

180
00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:00.353
Let me see your hand.

181
00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.572
You gonna tell
my fortune?

182
00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:03.989
That's easy.

183
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.159
You'll know moments of joy. You'll
lose what you love. You'll die.

184
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.561
Can I get a second opinion?

185
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.630
The other thing
about trains is.

186
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:14.633
you get to see the world
passing in real time.

187
00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:17.103
When you're eight miles up.
you can convince yourself...

188
00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:19.704
you're still the same person
when you get off.

189
00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:44.161
<i>So. a million questions
without a questioner.</i>

190
00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:47.163
<i>a hundred replayed nights.</i>

191
00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:49.600
<i>How do I find myself
in this sweaty bed?</i>

192
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.168
<i>Who is this person
beside me?</i>

193
00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:56.005
<i>Why are there more scars
than I remember wounds?</i>

194
00:12:56.006 --> 00:13:00.043
<i>Right. Memory is flawed.</i>

195
00:13:00.044 --> 00:13:04.683
<i>But isn't memory all that knits our moments
of existence into a sense of self?</i>

196
00:13:05.716 --> 00:13:07.817
<i>Of course. philosophical
questions lose power...</i>

197
00:13:07.818 --> 00:13:09.889
<i>when you're staring
at your own mortality.</i>

198
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.623
<i>It's one thing to know you're
going to die at some point...</i>

199
00:13:13.624 --> 00:13:16.158
<i>in the indeterminate future.</i>

200
00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:20.531
<i>another to watch
the clock wind down.</i>

201
00:13:21.764 --> 00:13:25.970
<i>And. yeah. I'm not
the only dead guy in the room.</i>

202
00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:28.937
So you went back
to work?

203
00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:30.272
I had to finish
the project.

204
00:13:30.273 --> 00:13:32.508
But now you had a name.

205
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:34.042
There were no Lexi's
in Westport.

206
00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:37.581
There were three Alexandras.
but none of them were her.

207
00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:44.052
<i>When we got to the camp.
everything is very simple.</i>

208
00:13:44.053 --> 00:13:48.791
<i>A man points left or right.
and you live or you die.</i>

209
00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:52.862
<i>For my mother
and sisters. death.</i>

210
00:13:52.863 --> 00:13:57.866
<i>I was big enough to work. so my
father and I go to the right.</i>

211
00:13:57.867 --> 00:14:02.103
<i>I still held the little cross
in my hand.</i>

212
00:14:02.104 --> 00:14:07.575
<i>but I saw that they were taking every
little piece of gold they could find...</i>

213
00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:09.777
<i>Rings. bracelets.</i>

214
00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:12.213
<i>You could only keep
the fillings in your teeth.</i>

215
00:14:12.214 --> 00:14:15.150
<i>That they took
when you were dead.</i>

216
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:18.252
<i>I decided then and there...</i>

217
00:14:18.253 --> 00:14:23.758
<i>that I would hold on to the little
cross the girl had given me.</i>

218
00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:25.995
<i>no matter what.</i>

219
00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:29.966
<i>I slipped it under my tongue.</i>

220
00:14:31.935 --> 00:14:34.736
Having a mission.

221
00:14:34.737 --> 00:14:37.203
even if it's
only in your mind.

222
00:14:37.204 --> 00:14:39.040
keeps you alive.

223
00:14:41.676 --> 00:14:43.310
<i>When I wasn't working.</i>

224
00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:46.079
<i>I found myself
wandering the streets.</i>

225
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.019
<i>I would think I saw her
maybe a dozen times a day.</i>

226
00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:58.728
<i>Somehow. I'd always wind up
back at the same place.</i>

227
00:14:59.995 --> 00:15:03.063
<i>I remembered an old photo
I'd seen somewhere.</i>

228
00:15:03.064 --> 00:15:05.031
<i>Watch things in real time.</i>

229
00:15:05.032 --> 00:15:07.802
<i>and it's easy to believe
we're part of the world.</i>

230
00:15:07.803 --> 00:15:10.236
<i>that our motion
is more than random.</i>

231
00:15:10.237 --> 00:15:12.974
<i>our presence
more than accidental.</i>

232
00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:17.012
<i>But a long exposure
reveals the truth.</i>

233
00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:19.779
<i>We're just ghosts.</i>

234
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.552
<i>illusions we perpetrate
in ourselves.</i>

235
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:31.693
So a guy's getting his
morning coffee and paper.

236
00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:37.998
<i>In line in front of him.
he sees this vision.</i>

237
00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:41.002
<i>Gorgeous. I mean. right out
of the swimsuit edition.</i>

238
00:15:41.003 --> 00:15:43.803
<i>And she's buying
a lottery ticket.</i>

239
00:15:43.804 --> 00:15:47.307
He's smitten.
Can't get a word out.

240
00:15:47.308 --> 00:15:50.076
<i>He lets her get away.</i>

241
00:15:50.077 --> 00:15:52.745
The next day. he goes back to the
store and he asks the owner.

242
00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:54.913
"Do you know the girl who
bought the lottery ticket?"

243
00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:58.118
And all the English this guy knows
is. "You buy something or get lost."

244
00:15:58.119 --> 00:15:59.452
<i>Right?</i>

245
00:15:59.453 --> 00:16:02.787
Well. our boy figures people
are creatures of habit.

246
00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:04.956
so he finds himself
the nearest coffee shop.

247
00:16:04.957 --> 00:16:06.992
<i>plants himself where he's
got a view of the store.</i>

248
00:16:06.993 --> 00:16:09.930
figuring sooner or later
she'll come by for her ticket.

249
00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.797
<i>He gets obsessed.</i>

250
00:16:12.798 --> 00:16:15.267
<i>Days turn to weeks.
Seasons change.</i>

251
00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:18.403
<i>He shows up late for work. He's
unavailable for his friends.</i>

252
00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:23.941
But wouldn't you know it. The day he
finally decides to give it all up...

253
00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.109
She shows up.

254
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.979
<i>Turns out
she was out of town.</i>

255
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.783
Let me guess.
He never makes his move.

256
00:16:31.784 --> 00:16:32.984
Why?

257
00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.153
He sees the future.

258
00:16:35.154 --> 00:16:39.090
They'll have their affair. and in
time it'll be no more than that...

259
00:16:39.091 --> 00:16:40.758
<i>An affair.</i>

260
00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:44.128
<i>He can anticipate
the purr of her throat.</i>

261
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:47.764
the scratchy quality
of her voice in the morning.

262
00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:50.834
He closes his eyes.
and he can almost smell her.

263
00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:55.073
It'll be good. but they have
about as much chance...

264
00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:59.911
of making it in the long run as
she does of winning the lottery.

265
00:16:59.912 --> 00:17:03.016
Because good
is never perfect.

266
00:17:03.882 --> 00:17:05.983
<i>In his fevered mind.
he's realized...</i>

267
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:10.354
<i>the unbridgeable distance
between real and ideal.</i>

268
00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:14.258
<i>So he would rather let her walk
away with her sad lottery ticket.</i>

269
00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:18.162
<i>He would rather let her live in
the purity of his imagination...</i>

270
00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:23.134
<i>than succumb to the spectacle of
flesh and blood. scent and sorrow.</i>

271
00:17:23.135 --> 00:17:25.035
<i>He's lost something. sure...</i>

272
00:17:25.036 --> 00:17:29.873
Another conquest. maybe even
an enduring relationship.

273
00:17:29.874 --> 00:17:32.810
But think what he gets
in return.

274
00:17:33.977 --> 00:17:37.047
He will forever be the man who
waited in the snow and rain...

275
00:17:37.048 --> 00:17:39.415
day after day
for the lottery girl.

276
00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:42.886
<i>He will be the one
who walked away...</i>

277
00:17:42.887 --> 00:17:45.321
<i>at the moment
his dream was realized.</i>

278
00:17:45.322 --> 00:17:47.692
He will be mythic.

279
00:17:50.962 --> 00:17:53.163
You want to know
what really happens?

280
00:17:53.164 --> 00:17:54.964
Sure.

281
00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:57.099
He's out of that
coffee shop so fast.

282
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.338
he sloshes his half-caf latte
on his hand. extra hot.

283
00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:04.974
He almost knocks her over. they strike up
a conversation. and they begin dating.

284
00:18:04.975 --> 00:18:08.011
<i>Two kids and a summer home
in Montauk?</i>

285
00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:13.316
Lasted eight months. "It's not
you. it's me." That kind of thing.

286
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.787
What? Don't be smug.
He gave it a shot.

287
00:18:17.788 --> 00:18:19.957
My version
would've lasted forever.

288
00:18:21.124 --> 00:18:22.791
Now I know your secret.

289
00:18:22.792 --> 00:18:24.861
Didn't know I had one.

290
00:18:25.928 --> 00:18:28.865
You'd rather have a great story
than a great love.

291
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:34.804
You didn't think it was odd
running into her like that?

292
00:18:34.805 --> 00:18:37.208
I guess I wasn't
thinking at all.

293
00:18:42.044 --> 00:18:43.445
What?

294
00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:47.249
I haven't quite figured out
if you're a victim or a suspect.

295
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.320
Well. I suppose you could pretty
much say that about anyone.

296
00:18:51.387 --> 00:18:53.222
<i>And the lottery ticket?</i>

297
00:18:54.222 --> 00:18:55.959
She won.

298
00:19:04.098 --> 00:19:06.135
You try to find me?

299
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.374
There are no Lexi's
in Westport.

300
00:19:13.375 --> 00:19:15.876
I didn't say
I lived in Westport.

301
00:19:15.877 --> 00:19:18.313
You gotta give a guy
a fair chance.

302
00:19:18.314 --> 00:19:20.817
I found you. didn't I?

303
00:19:23.219 --> 00:19:25.353
You look different.

304
00:19:25.354 --> 00:19:27.521
Different day.

305
00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:30.260
What color was your hair?

306
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.798
Here's the thing about two
people meeting on a train.

307
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:39.399
If they know they'll
always be strangers.

308
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.969
it frees them.

309
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.139
You can create me any way you
want. and I'll never disappoint.

310
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.376
I could ask you to kill for me. and I
won't know if you'll carry it out.

311
00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:51.879
We have no reason
to lie to each other...

312
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.982
unless the lie
is prettier than the truth.

313
00:19:56.416 --> 00:19:58.050
We're no longer
on the train.

314
00:19:58.051 --> 00:19:59.821
No?

315
00:20:01.623 --> 00:20:03.391
How did you find me?

316
00:20:03.392 --> 00:20:07.830
Don't tell me you're one of those New Age
types who don't believe in accidents.

317
00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:13.969
You're not gonna ask me
to kill someone. are you?

318
00:20:15.403 --> 00:20:18.036
Why don't you
show me what you do.

319
00:20:18.037 --> 00:20:21.106
Can I get you
a pain pill for that?

320
00:20:21.107 --> 00:20:24.043
Actually. the pain
helps me remember.

321
00:20:24.044 --> 00:20:27.046
Sisters at Saint Jude's
would agree with you.

322
00:20:27.047 --> 00:20:28.148
Catholic school?

323
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:29.249
You bet.

324
00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:34.855
Her patron saint.

325
00:20:36.323 --> 00:20:40.927
<i>I held the cross
under my tongue...</i>

326
00:20:40.928 --> 00:20:45.197
<i>until there was
a bloody sore.</i>

327
00:20:45.198 --> 00:20:48.268
<i>I ate with it...
like that.</i>

328
00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:51.403
<i>I slept with it.</i>

329
00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:56.609
<i>Eventually the pain fades
and the callous appears.</i>

330
00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:01.246
<i>My father only made it
a few weeks.</i>

331
00:21:01.247 --> 00:21:04.682
<i>One morning
he refused to work.</i>

332
00:21:04.683 --> 00:21:08.220
<i>and they beat him to death
with their rifles.</i>

333
00:21:09.555 --> 00:21:11.991
<i>Bullets were too expensive.</i>

334
00:21:18.296 --> 00:21:22.235
When I was young. my mother used to
tell me this story when things got bad.

335
00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:28.240
"The world ended when Jesus
hung on the cross." she'd say.

336
00:21:29.507 --> 00:21:32.177
And all of history
is just a dream...

337
00:21:32.178 --> 00:21:36.049
in the last instant
of a Roman centurion's life.

338
00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:41.585
Coffee?

339
00:21:41.586 --> 00:21:44.521
That's when she asked you
to tail Carl Pruitt.

340
00:21:44.522 --> 00:21:46.290
Not at first.

341
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:50.259
I knew she was hiding something.
something from her past.

342
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.397
It wasn't so much
what she said...

343
00:21:53.398 --> 00:21:55.968
It was
the way she said it?

344
00:21:57.002 --> 00:22:00.038
More the way she didn't say
what she didn't say.

345
00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:01.738
You some kind
of cop detective?

346
00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:03.391
Yeah.

347
00:22:03.392 --> 00:22:05.042
You don't look like cop.

348
00:22:05.043 --> 00:22:07.177
Yeah? What's a cop
look like?

349
00:22:07.178 --> 00:22:10.413
Better dressed.

350
00:22:10.414 --> 00:22:13.449
Guy cheating on his wife.
I seen it all right here.

351
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.018
Yeah. I bet you have.

352
00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:17.286
Nothing like stories
from cab driver.

353
00:22:17.287 --> 00:22:21.057
One guy tries to strangle hooker in
backseat. I say. "Not in my cab."

354
00:22:21.058 --> 00:22:22.259
He say.
"I give you big tip."

355
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.459
So what'd you do?

356
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.729
I throw him out. He strangle
on street. his business.

357
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.133
Not in my cab.
People fucking. okay.

358
00:22:31.134 --> 00:22:34.603
A big tip covers it.
Killing?

359
00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:36.706
Yeah. I get it.
Not in your cab.

360
00:22:36.707 --> 00:22:38.543
You can bet you.

361
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.217
That's him.

362
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.721
Want to hear
strangest story ever?

363
00:22:51.722 --> 00:22:53.456
Does it involve dwarves?

364
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:55.058
Dwarves? What?

365
00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:59.328
Somehow they always seem to involve
dwarves. and they're never true.

366
00:22:59.329 --> 00:23:01.696
This happened 100%.

367
00:23:01.697 --> 00:23:04.600
My brother. he's fucking
this girl two years.

368
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:08.071
Met in spinning class. You know.
bicycle doesn't go nowhere?

369
00:23:08.072 --> 00:23:10.338
Only women in these classes.
My brother joins for women.

370
00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:15.077
So he's fucking this girl. One night
she asks. can her friend join in.

371
00:23:15.078 --> 00:23:18.612
My brother is like
winning lottery.

372
00:23:18.613 --> 00:23:20.749
Of course.
More is merrier.

373
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.484
Let me guess.
The friend is a man.

374
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:28.156
Man? You crazy? Is more beautiful
than one my brother is fucking.

375
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:31.225
Big tits. everything.
So they have wild night.

376
00:23:31.226 --> 00:23:33.861
Everything is on menu.
soup till nuts.

377
00:23:33.862 --> 00:23:37.165
My brother thinks he died
straight to heaven.

378
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.302
In the morning. I get call.
He wakes up. everything's gone...

379
00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.237
Girls. wallet. flat-screen.

380
00:23:43.238 --> 00:23:45.072
He calls police.
but nothing to do.

381
00:23:45.073 --> 00:23:49.610
Her cell doesn't work no more. She's gone
from spinning class like she never exists.

382
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:51.345
Let me
get this straight.

383
00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:54.449
She's with him for two years
so she can steal his TV?

384
00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.319
His whole house. Lucky she
left him his underwears.

385
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.687
I tell you
it was crazy story.

386
00:24:00.688 --> 00:24:02.423
He never found her?

387
00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:05.126
Every day he sees her.

388
00:24:05.127 --> 00:24:08.495
On subway.
walking down street.

389
00:24:08.496 --> 00:24:12.332
But never her. One woman
he followed for half an hour.

390
00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:14.202
She called police.

391
00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:19.407
My brother is never same.
Stopped spinning classes even.

392
00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:24.611
<i>So she had you
playing detective?</i>

393
00:24:24.612 --> 00:24:28.183
<i>It wasn't until the next time
I saw her that she asked me.</i>

394
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.785
<i>The time in the camps...</i>

395
00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:37.458
<i>stands outside normal time.</i>

396
00:24:44.464 --> 00:24:47.569
<i>The time in the camps...</i>

397
00:24:48.735 --> 00:24:50.703
<i>The time in the camps...</i>

398
00:24:50.704 --> 00:24:54.508
<i>stands outside normal time.</i>

399
00:24:59.746 --> 00:25:00.981
Hello?

400
00:25:00.982 --> 00:25:03.518
<i>Can you meet me?</i>

401
00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:20.399
Where I grew up everything
was flat. even the cities.

402
00:25:26.472 --> 00:25:28.807
This seems more honest.

403
00:25:28.808 --> 00:25:32.711
Eye to eye with everyone. you can convince
yourself we're not that different.

404
00:25:32.712 --> 00:25:35.747
Step over a homeless guy
to get to your penthouse.

405
00:25:35.748 --> 00:25:36.882
you know better.

406
00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:38.185
Grow up poor?

407
00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:39.486
Shows?

408
00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:43.922
My mother was always getting
mixed up with the wrong guy.

409
00:25:43.923 --> 00:25:46.258
Father got out
before I was born.

410
00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:47.759
Can't say I blame him.

411
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760
You ever try
and find him?

412
00:25:48.761 --> 00:25:51.762
I heard he had
an uncle in the east.

413
00:25:51.763 --> 00:25:53.699
That's why I came
out here originally.

414
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.433
He wasn't much use though.

415
00:25:55.434 --> 00:25:57.435
You still close
to your mother?

416
00:25:57.436 --> 00:26:01.404
I grew up using her
as a model of who not to be.

417
00:26:01.405 --> 00:26:05.675
When I was about seven. she finally
seemed to get her life on track.

418
00:26:05.676 --> 00:26:09.947
Stopped drinking.
met a guy from a wealthy family.

419
00:26:09.948 --> 00:26:11.949
She always wanted me
to be provided for.

420
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.554
so he agreed to put
something aside for me.

421
00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:19.491
<i>It was good for a while.
For a while.</i>

422
00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:24.996
He never laid a hand on me.

423
00:26:24.997 --> 00:26:28.668
<i>but I decided then and there
I would never be a victim.</i>

424
00:26:40.378 --> 00:26:42.746
It's important to keep
promises to yourself.

425
00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:47.352
Isn't it?

426
00:26:49.886 --> 00:26:52.356
<i>This the photo
she showed you?</i>

427
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.264
I knew I was gonna do
what it took to help her.

428
00:27:03.034 --> 00:27:07.336
At first it's. "You know you
like it rough. don't you. babe?"

429
00:27:07.337 --> 00:27:09.639
Makes you feel like you're
always the one at fault.

430
00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.777
If I hadn't done this.
hadn't said that.

431
00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:16.712
You look in the mirror
one morning and realize...

432
00:27:16.713 --> 00:27:18.847
it's not only your
mother's eyes you've got.

433
00:27:18.848 --> 00:27:21.285
it's the bruises
around them.

434
00:27:23.354 --> 00:27:25.988
Is that why
you called me?

435
00:27:25.989 --> 00:27:27.758
I called you...

436
00:27:29.558 --> 00:27:31.459
to get drunk.

437
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.996
<i>That when she told you
she was married?</i>

438
00:27:33.997 --> 00:27:36.465
Not in so many words.

439
00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:39.834
More the way she didn't say
what she didn't say?

440
00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:41.537
<i>So who was she?</i>

441
00:27:42.905 --> 00:27:44.506
The one who
got to you.

442
00:27:44.507 --> 00:27:47.543
What makes you think
there was only one?

443
00:27:47.544 --> 00:27:51.748
Devil takes many forms.
but there's really only one.

444
00:27:52.748 --> 00:27:54.982
You should've been
a priest.

445
00:27:54.983 --> 00:27:58.786
Not an option
for a woman.

446
00:27:58.787 --> 00:28:00.758
I'd make a terrible nun.

447
00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:04.727
There's always one
who sets the standard.

448
00:28:04.728 --> 00:28:08.629
For most guys. it's the girl in
college who barely knew they existed.

449
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.867
There were a couple
of those. I guess.

450
00:28:12.368 --> 00:28:14.502
It's just as well.

451
00:28:14.503 --> 00:28:16.571
If you'd gathered
the courage to talk to her.

452
00:28:16.572 --> 00:28:19.441
you would've noticed
her teeth aren't perfect.

453
00:28:20.074 --> 00:28:22.377
Her eyes
are slightly askew.

454
00:28:22.378 --> 00:28:25.079
You ever notice how
it's always those quirks...

455
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.353
we find the most charming in the beginning
become the most irritating over time?

456
00:28:31.853 --> 00:28:33.655
What about you?

457
00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:40.563
I'm more comfortable
on this side.

458
00:28:41.997 --> 00:28:43.765
As long as there's
no tape in it.

459
00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:45.868
It's digital.
No tape.

460
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:50.903
It was high school.
backseat of his car.

461
00:28:50.904 --> 00:28:53.607
I wish I could be
more original.

462
00:28:55.075 --> 00:28:59.611
He plays it cool.
a little smile on his face.

463
00:29:00.547 --> 00:29:05.487
But in that smile is a world
of expectation and sadness.

464
00:29:07.688 --> 00:29:11.360
The flower is beautiful.
but it dies.

465
00:29:12.727 --> 00:29:15.563
The girl is fertile.
but she will age.

466
00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:24.739
They won't find each other in an old age
home at the sunny edge of the world.

467
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.509
Won't wind up in L.A.

468
00:29:28.543 --> 00:29:32.679
This is their moment.
and they better take it.

469
00:29:49.228 --> 00:29:51.863
<i>If there's anything
you need to tell me...</i>

470
00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:53.965
<i>about your relationship
with this young woman.</i>

471
00:29:53.966 --> 00:29:56.001
<i>now would be the time.</i>

472
00:29:56.002 --> 00:29:57.971
<i>I needed to know
if it was possible to know...</i>

473
00:29:57.972 --> 00:30:00.572
<i>I needed to know if it was
possible to know someone...</i>

474
00:30:00.573 --> 00:30:03.677
<i>- I love you.
- Really know someone.</i>

475
00:30:05.044 --> 00:30:07.111
I always have.

476
00:30:07.112 --> 00:30:09.814
<i>I wanted to know
what was real...</i>

477
00:30:09.815 --> 00:30:12.952
Our souls were born together
at the beginning of time.

478
00:30:12.953 --> 00:30:16.555
<i>And what was just some kind
of image of her in my head.</i>

479
00:30:16.556 --> 00:30:18.656
<i>I love you. I love you.
I always have.</i>

480
00:30:18.657 --> 00:30:20.893
<i>Our souls were born together
at the beginning of time.</i>

481
00:30:20.894 --> 00:30:22.493
<i>I love you.
I always have.</i>

482
00:30:22.494 --> 00:30:26.664
<i>I always have. Our souls were born
together at the beginning of time.</i>

483
00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:29.533
<i>Our souls were born together
at the beginning of time.</i>

484
00:30:29.534 --> 00:30:32.471
<i>I love you.
I love you.</i>

485
00:30:34.773 --> 00:30:37.843
<i>Our souls were born together
at the beginning of time.</i>

486
00:30:44.783 --> 00:30:49.153
It wasn't in college.
We met at the museum.

487
00:30:49.154 --> 00:30:51.054
Impressionists?

488
00:30:51.055 --> 00:30:53.492
How'd you know?

489
00:30:54.693 --> 00:30:57.996
You always find the best women
in the impressionist wing.

490
00:30:57.997 --> 00:30:59.831
We went out
a couple of times.

491
00:31:00.665 --> 00:31:02.532
She invites me
back to her place.

492
00:31:02.533 --> 00:31:04.300
and we're sitting
on the couch.

493
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:07.136
When she gets up
to throw a log in the fire.

494
00:31:07.137 --> 00:31:10.609
I notice a slight
stiffness in her step.

495
00:31:11.275 --> 00:31:15.011
Somehow that tiny
sign of age...

496
00:31:15.012 --> 00:31:17.582
made her real for me.

497
00:31:18.249 --> 00:31:22.020
She was perfected
by her imperfections.

498
00:31:23.288 --> 00:31:26.223
And in that moment.
I can see the future.

499
00:31:26.224 --> 00:31:28.692
We will move together
into the bright haze.

500
00:31:28.693 --> 00:31:31.962
fighting age and decay.
losing gloriously.

501
00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:36.867
I will come to love her cancer
scars. her arthritic knee.

502
00:31:36.868 --> 00:31:40.236
And I know that sex and love
are just animal things.

503
00:31:40.237 --> 00:31:43.608
the genes liking
what's good for them.

504
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.809
But maybe there's
another possibility.

505
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.712
If love is more
than the sum of its parts.

506
00:31:50.713 --> 00:31:54.784
maybe we are more
than the sum of our parts.

507
00:31:56.653 --> 00:31:59.254
But there's
another future.

508
00:31:59.255 --> 00:32:02.726
She will leave me.
or I'll leave her.

509
00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:06.630
I'll feel the pain
but only for a while.

510
00:32:07.763 --> 00:32:11.067
And I know that if I ran
into her a year later.

511
00:32:11.068 --> 00:32:14.604
she won't be someone that I could
imagine falling in love with.

512
00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:17.108
In fact. I'll question
that I ever did at all.

513
00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:20.809
So which future did you choose?

514
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:24.613
Sometimes the scorpion
stings you.

515
00:32:24.614 --> 00:32:26.850
even if it means
he'll drown too.

516
00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:34.124
When I was little. my mother
told me about the saints.

517
00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:38.893
Saint Jude
was always my favorite.

518
00:32:38.894 --> 00:32:41.964
Patron saint of lost causes.

519
00:32:49.405 --> 00:32:51.741
Why did you
really call me?

520
00:32:56.779 --> 00:32:58.779
<i>I agreed to help her out
with Pruitt.</i>

521
00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.716
<i>but there was a condition.</i>

522
00:33:02.385 --> 00:33:06.055
<i>She still hadn't told me why she was
crying that day I met her on the train.</i>

523
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:12.893
He was a brave man once.

524
00:33:12.894 --> 00:33:15.697
He was in Cuba on business
during the revolution.

525
00:33:15.698 --> 00:33:20.034
Somehow he managed to convince
both sides he was with them.

526
00:33:20.035 --> 00:33:23.903
He infiltrated the guerrillas
on behalf of the government.

527
00:33:23.904 --> 00:33:27.175
told the revolutionaries he was
gathering intelligence for them.

528
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.679
Both sides suspected
he was C.I.A.

529
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.984
I think eventually even he
didn't know what the truth was.

530
00:33:36.183 --> 00:33:40.055
One time he was able to warn
a village about a coming attack.

531
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:44.792
About a dozen families
escaped.

532
00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:53.768
Do you have chocolate?

533
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.939
<i>I need you to do this
for me. Danny.</i>

534
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.843
What will following him
with my camera give you?

535
00:34:03.844 --> 00:34:05.113
Ammunition.

536
00:34:06.713 --> 00:34:08.914
Not everybody
has a double life.

537
00:34:08.915 --> 00:34:11.250
Not everybody
has a secret.

538
00:34:11.251 --> 00:34:13.655
That's where
you're wrong.

539
00:34:14.987 --> 00:34:18.123
You assumed the elderly
gentleman was her great uncle?

540
00:34:18.124 --> 00:34:22.227
I imagine he was just some
old-timer she used as a prop.

541
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.897
She was very good
with stories.

542
00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:27.734
That's when you agreed
to follow Carl Pruitt.

543
00:34:27.735 --> 00:34:29.903
<i>He was a criminal
defense lawyer.</i>

544
00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:33.305
<i>I knew he'd have
some unsavory associations.</i>

545
00:34:33.306 --> 00:34:35.208
<i>but I didn't think
much of it.</i>

546
00:34:35.209 --> 00:34:37.175
<i>You were led to believe
this ammunition...</i>

547
00:34:37.176 --> 00:34:39.845
<i>was for a potential
divorce proceeding?</i>

548
00:34:39.846 --> 00:34:42.180
<i>She never actually
mentioned divorce.</i>

549
00:34:42.181 --> 00:34:43.280
<i>Right.</i>

550
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:46.252
The way she didn't say
what she didn't say.

551
00:34:50.022 --> 00:34:53.226
<i>About a week in.
it started to get interesting.</i>

552
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.296
<i>That was the first time
you saw James Fenetree?</i>

553
00:34:58.297 --> 00:35:03.501
Well. we weren't formally
introduced. but. yeah. that's him.

554
00:35:03.502 --> 00:35:06.038
Of course
we already know that.

555
00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:13.845
<i>For the record.
I didn't leave her.</i>

556
00:35:13.846 --> 00:35:17.047
So. sometimes the scorpion
gets stung too.

557
00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:21.185
You replay the last weeks
and days looking for a reason.

558
00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:24.990
Did you say something wrong.
commit some callous act?

559
00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:29.025
Can it really be so fragile?

560
00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:31.097
Or you can move on.

561
00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:34.198
Envy those couples who've
been together so long...

562
00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:36.500
they can't remember why.

563
00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:40.139
In the land of the one-eyed.
envy the blind.

564
00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:49.346
<i>With the Americans approaching.
they were in a hurry...</i>

565
00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:51.482
<i>to finish up with us.</i>

566
00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:53.785
<i>Finally it would be
my turn.</i>

567
00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:58.089
<i>I thought back to the
little girl by the train.</i>

568
00:35:59.022 --> 00:36:03.959
<i>In a place where evil
seemed so big...</i>

569
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.361
<i>Also so small.</i>

570
00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:08.098
<i>so everyday...</i>

571
00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:11.901
<i>I believed...</i>

572
00:36:11.902 --> 00:36:16.939
<i>that this one little act
of kindness saved my life.</i>

573
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.843
<i>I had to know that
there was something else.</i>

574
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:24.816
<i>some people existed
who could be good and kind.</i>

575
00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:39.163
<i>You didn't notice anything odd about the
picture she showed you of Carl Pruitt?</i>

576
00:36:40.062 --> 00:36:41.596
Not exactly
a family portrait.

577
00:36:41.597 --> 00:36:44.066
That's taken
with a telephoto lens.

578
00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:47.201
Well. she doesn't like
getting her photograph taken.

579
00:36:47.202 --> 00:36:50.206
Right.
The aborigines.

580
00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:54.141
I guess I took
a lot on faith.

581
00:36:54.142 --> 00:36:57.346
Well. I thought all you
movie people were atheists.

582
00:36:57.347 --> 00:36:59.816
Only when it comes to God.

583
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.920
<i>In the morning.
so much excitement.</i>

584
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:06.989
<i>The camp guards
have disappeared.</i>

585
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.591
<i>People are running around.</i>

586
00:37:08.592 --> 00:37:11.360
<i>The Americans
have liberated the camp.</i>

587
00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:13.962
<i>They had
hot food for us...</i>

588
00:37:13.963 --> 00:37:18.100
<i>Just some broth
with a little meat.</i>

589
00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:23.169
<i>But it was so long since I had
had anything so hot and good.</i>

590
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:28.276
<i>I ate it so quickly that the little
cross came loose. and I almost choked.</i>

591
00:37:28.277 --> 00:37:30.912
<i>Just think about it...</i>

592
00:37:30.913 --> 00:37:35.249
<i>If after all I'd been through
I had choked...</i>

593
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.186
<i>on this kind gift.</i>

594
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.957
<i>I took it out of my mouth...</i>

595
00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:46.362
<i>and hung it round my neck.</i>

596
00:37:48.063 --> 00:37:51.000
<i>A Jewish boy wearing a cross?</i>

597
00:37:51.632 --> 00:37:54.200
<i>I got tired of explaining.</i>

598
00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:57.205
<i>So if they thought
I'd converted. let them.</i>

599
00:38:01.944 --> 00:38:04.477
<i>I'd seen Pruitt go into
the building a couple of times.</i>

600
00:38:04.478 --> 00:38:06.479
<i>so I decided
to get a better look.</i>

601
00:38:34.675 --> 00:38:36.275
Ever seen him before?

602
00:38:36.276 --> 00:38:37.744
His name's Spider.

603
00:38:37.745 --> 00:38:39.512
Of course.

604
00:38:39.513 --> 00:38:42.215
Carl represented him
a few times.

605
00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:45.518
He's required to do a certain
amount of pro bono work.

606
00:38:45.519 --> 00:38:46.619
And Spider?

607
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.055
He's a provider.
Drugs. girls. you name it.

608
00:38:50.056 --> 00:38:52.326
Carl likes to get paid
one way or another.

609
00:39:14.014 --> 00:39:16.216
Are you asking
for the time?

610
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.087
Do I need
some kind of wrist band?

611
00:39:21.587 --> 00:39:24.023
It ain't part of the club.

612
00:39:25.224 --> 00:39:27.558
<i>I wasn't getting past
this guy anyway.</i>

613
00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:29.595
<i>so I figured
I'd come back another night.</i>

614
00:39:29.596 --> 00:39:31.396
<i>He had to take a break
sooner or later.</i>

615
00:39:31.397 --> 00:39:34.099
<i>You didn't think you might be
getting in over your head?</i>

616
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.336
Ever try and jump off
a moving train?

617
00:39:38.303 --> 00:39:40.304
If there's anything
you need to tell me...

618
00:39:40.305 --> 00:39:42.673
about your relationship
with this young woman.

619
00:39:42.674 --> 00:39:44.509
now would be the time.

620
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.077
I thought I wasn't
a suspect.

621
00:39:46.078 --> 00:39:50.114
Yet you're willing to walk into a
potentially dangerous situation...

622
00:39:50.115 --> 00:39:52.650
armed with
a video camera.

623
00:39:52.651 --> 00:39:55.286
I guess I wanted to know
what was real...

624
00:39:55.287 --> 00:39:59.524
and what was just some kind
of image of her in my head.

625
00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:04.695
I needed to know if it was
possible to know someone.

626
00:40:04.696 --> 00:40:07.467
really know someone.

627
00:40:09.568 --> 00:40:13.137
It seemed very important.

628
00:40:24.681 --> 00:40:29.153
My wife died last year.
Thirty years.

629
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:36.225
I got the call I'm usually the one making.
Car accident.

630
00:40:36.226 --> 00:40:39.462
Funny thing is. she wasn't even
supposed to go out that night.

631
00:40:39.463 --> 00:40:42.498
but she did go out.

632
00:40:42.499 --> 00:40:47.172
She was going out to see
the guy she was screwing.

633
00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:52.576
For weeks I bounced
between anger. hurt. loss.

634
00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:58.646
The hardest thing was jumping
from one feeling to the next.

635
00:40:58.647 --> 00:41:01.182
I couldn't get
a foothold.

636
00:41:01.183 --> 00:41:05.387
So finally I decided
to pick one emotion.

637
00:41:05.388 --> 00:41:07.789
I tried to remember
who she was...

638
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.793
and why I loved her.

639
00:41:10.794 --> 00:41:14.530
And then when the dark
feelings would rise.

640
00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:15.731
I would...

641
00:41:15.732 --> 00:41:19.668
What do you call it when
you turn lead into gold?

642
00:41:19.669 --> 00:41:21.436
Alchemy.

643
00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:26.541
I'd take everything about her.
even the things I hated.

644
00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:29.577
and I'd tell her in my mind
how that made me love her...

645
00:41:29.578 --> 00:41:34.118
because that's what made her
who she was. even the flaws.

646
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:40.190
I see it every day.

647
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:45.192
Love a person half your life.
then wake up one morning...

648
00:41:45.193 --> 00:41:48.795
and you can't find a single
thing about them not to hate.

649
00:41:48.796 --> 00:41:51.565
I've seen women carved
to ribbons by men...

650
00:41:51.566 --> 00:41:55.505
who two days ago would have jumped
in front of a truck to save.

651
00:41:56.838 --> 00:41:59.174
I wasn't gonna let
that happen.

652
00:42:00.242 --> 00:42:03.213
I wasn't gonna turn
gold to lead.

653
00:42:04.445 --> 00:42:06.115
Did it work?

654
00:42:06.648 --> 00:42:08.250
Sometimes.

655
00:42:12.421 --> 00:42:14.689
You know. there's a tab
on the camera menu.

656
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.591
you can turn off
the tally light?

657
00:42:16.592 --> 00:42:20.262
That way the suspect doesn't
know he's being recorded.

658
00:42:21.795 --> 00:42:25.567
You're good.
You share. I share.

659
00:42:29.536 --> 00:42:31.204
Was it true?

660
00:42:31.205 --> 00:42:35.510
Didn't Jesus say.
"What is truth"?

661
00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:39.613
Actually.
I think it was Pilate.

662
00:42:39.614 --> 00:42:44.586
<i>Eventually I made my way
to New York.</i>

663
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.956
<i>I found work with a relative
who sold small gifts.</i>

664
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:52.492
<i>religious trinkets
from the church.</i>

665
00:42:52.493 --> 00:42:55.294
<i>He always made fun
of me anyway.</i>

666
00:42:55.295 --> 00:42:58.631
<i>"The goy." he called me
because of the cross.</i>

667
00:42:58.632 --> 00:43:01.735
<i>"Go out and sell the saints."</i>

668
00:43:01.736 --> 00:43:06.640
<i>So every day I went to the cart
out on Coney Island.</i>

669
00:43:07.673 --> 00:43:12.377
<i>I couldn't believe how happy
all the people were...</i>

670
00:43:12.378 --> 00:43:15.982
<i>just for nothing.
for some cotton candy...</i>

671
00:43:15.983 --> 00:43:19.320
<i>and a few silly rides.</i>

672
00:43:19.986 --> 00:43:23.922
<i>This happiness
was more foreign to me...</i>

673
00:43:23.923 --> 00:43:26.360
<i>than the new language.</i>

674
00:43:28.028 --> 00:43:30.929
<i>One day
I'm pushing my cart...</i>

675
00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:36.268
<i>when this pretty young woman approaches
to buy something for her niece.</i>

676
00:43:36.269 --> 00:43:41.007
<i>I hear she has an accent.
so we start talking German.</i>

677
00:43:41.008 --> 00:43:45.578
<i>I never talked
about my experience...</i>

678
00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:49.414
with a Gentile.
certainly not a German.

679
00:43:49.415 --> 00:43:53.684
But she was so kind.
so gentle.

680
00:43:53.685 --> 00:43:56.720
I let her know
I was a Jew.

681
00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:59.359
She could figure out
the rest.

682
00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:04.863
So much was different
between us.

683
00:44:04.864 --> 00:44:07.832
and yet it was so easy
to talk to her.

684
00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:10.570
I never forget her smile.

685
00:44:12.337 --> 00:44:15.073
Finally she buys
a trinket.

686
00:44:15.074 --> 00:44:18.575
and I reach down
to put it in a bag.

687
00:44:18.576 --> 00:44:21.312
and the cross comes out
from under my shirt.

688
00:44:21.313 --> 00:44:24.283
Her eyes get very big...

689
00:44:25.051 --> 00:44:28.586
like two blue pools
of water.

690
00:44:28.587 --> 00:44:32.021
"Where did you get this?"
she asks.

691
00:44:32.022 --> 00:44:35.358
I don't want to tell her
the whole story.

692
00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:38.594
but of course
she already knew.

693
00:44:38.595 --> 00:44:43.368
"Why is a Jewish boy
wearing a cross?"

694
00:44:46.403 --> 00:44:48.971
<i>It seemed like forever.</i>

695
00:44:48.972 --> 00:44:52.510
<i>Neither of us
said a thing.</i>

696
00:44:53.345 --> 00:44:55.779
<i>Then there are tears
in her eyes.</i>

697
00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:01.854
<i>"I was punished when I told
my parents I had lost it."</i>

698
00:45:04.356 --> 00:45:07.123
I had found my savior.

699
00:45:07.124 --> 00:45:12.060
the little girl whose kindness had
seen me through impossible times.

700
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:15.430
I left the cart right there
on the boardwalk.

701
00:45:15.431 --> 00:45:18.401
and we walked for hours.
just talking...

702
00:45:18.402 --> 00:45:22.440
Two people so different.

703
00:45:23.507 --> 00:45:26.109
It was like we'd known
each other our whole lives.

704
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.546
which. of course. we had...

705
00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.350
in our imaginations.

706
00:45:34.451 --> 00:45:38.053
<i>Seeing the worst
that people are capable of.</i>

707
00:45:38.054 --> 00:45:42.592
<i>I had also seen in her
the best.</i>

708
00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:49.698
<i>Now that I'd found her.
I promised her. promised myself.</i>

709
00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:52.636
<i>I would never
lose her again.</i>

710
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.872
<i>And I've never
broken that promise.</i>

711
00:45:58.908 --> 00:46:02.009
I was wrong.

712
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.081
You don't want to choose between
a great love and a great story.

713
00:46:06.082 --> 00:46:09.684
You think that's
what this is about?

714
00:46:09.685 --> 00:46:12.654
I woke up one morning.

715
00:46:12.655 --> 00:46:15.623
and I saw my mom standing
over the kitchen sink.

716
00:46:15.624 --> 00:46:19.463
<i>and suddenly
I knew what hell was.</i>

717
00:46:21.196 --> 00:46:24.568
You see the world.
but you're not in it.

718
00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:27.938
People walk by your grave.

719
00:46:29.439 --> 00:46:32.743
laughing. alive.
forgetting you.

720
00:46:33.975 --> 00:46:36.545
But still you remain.

721
00:46:36.546 --> 00:46:39.682
a bead of awareness
in a universe of uncaring.

722
00:46:40.949 --> 00:46:43.485
But what if
there's a way out?

723
00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:50.426
What if there's a bridge
to just one moment.

724
00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.697
a story.
a sentence of our lives?

725
00:46:56.565 --> 00:46:59.402
Do we become
a part of that story?

726
00:47:01.635 --> 00:47:04.472
Does that become
our eternity?

727
00:47:14.148 --> 00:47:16.885
<i>I don't know why I didn't
tell her about the Herzmans.</i>

728
00:47:18.219 --> 00:47:20.687
I wonder
if it saved my life.

729
00:47:23.022 --> 00:47:25.124
<i>She took the cab
down with me.</i>

730
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:29.697
<i>The idea was I'd collect the footage
and we'd meet later in a diner.</i>

731
00:47:38.205 --> 00:47:39.973
You should have
fought for her.

732
00:47:41.508 --> 00:47:44.010
You thought it was her
imperfections that you loved.

733
00:47:44.011 --> 00:47:47.816
but it's really
just the story.

734
00:47:48.682 --> 00:47:50.550
Makes you
into a nicer guy...

735
00:47:50.551 --> 00:47:53.455
than the one who would've
left her for someone younger.

736
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.956
The great lost love
has its appeal.

737
00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:58.859
even to a girl like me.

738
00:47:59.959 --> 00:48:01.226
Stories don't age and die.

739
00:48:01.227 --> 00:48:03.463
You can tell them
over and over.

740
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.767
Problem is.
they always end the same.

741
00:50:00.677 --> 00:50:03.714
Seriously. man. what the
fuck were you thinking?

742
00:50:05.916 --> 00:50:07.283
Fair question.

743
00:50:07.284 --> 00:50:09.720
I mean.
what did you expect?

744
00:50:10.354 --> 00:50:12.053
Damned if I know.

745
00:50:12.054 --> 00:50:13.354
Damned if you don't.

746
00:50:13.355 --> 00:50:16.191
Good one.

747
00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:18.862
Yeah? Well.

748
00:50:23.266 --> 00:50:25.168
take it to the grave.

749
00:50:27.002 --> 00:50:28.437
What am I doing here?

750
00:50:28.438 --> 00:50:32.240
Hey. man. you chugged
in here on your own steam.

751
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:35.078
It was
a rhetorical question.

752
00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:38.749
I was asking myself.

753
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.953
I know what
"rhetorical" means.

754
00:50:46.855 --> 00:50:48.758
No disrespect.

755
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.061
You know what I like
about vampire stories?

756
00:50:54.062 --> 00:50:56.231
The good ones. anyway.

757
00:50:57.432 --> 00:50:59.835
I couldn't begin to guess.

758
00:51:01.336 --> 00:51:05.742
The victim has to invite
the vampire in.

759
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.148
I think I might
have misjudged you.

760
00:51:15.149 --> 00:51:17.220
It's a common mistake.

761
00:51:19.954 --> 00:51:22.255
Did you really think
you could have her?

762
00:51:22.256 --> 00:51:25.460
Think she'd ever
show you her real self?

763
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:27.728
I guess I wasn't thinking.

764
00:51:27.729 --> 00:51:30.764
That's where
you're wrong. partner.

765
00:51:30.765 --> 00:51:32.901
You think too much.

766
00:51:33.936 --> 00:51:37.806
Girl like Lexi.
she isn't about thought.

767
00:51:38.773 --> 00:51:41.307
She tell you
what floats her boat?

768
00:51:41.308 --> 00:51:45.377
Tell you to grab her hair.

769
00:51:45.378 --> 00:51:48.247
push her face
into the pillows?

770
00:51:48.248 --> 00:51:50.051
Tell you
she likes it rough?

771
00:51:57.858 --> 00:51:59.426
I just had
a funny thought.

772
00:51:59.427 --> 00:52:02.028
Wouldn't think you'd be
in a laughing mood.

773
00:52:02.029 --> 00:52:05.032
About a patron saint
for lost causes.

774
00:52:05.766 --> 00:52:07.334
Yeah. that's
one of her raps.

775
00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:11.171
Unlike you. I don't imagine I'm
the first man she's told that to.

776
00:52:11.172 --> 00:52:14.810
Probably not the first to wear
this around his neck either.

777
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:20.212
You always believe women when
they tell you you're their first?

778
00:52:20.213 --> 00:52:22.782
Actually
I never believe that.

779
00:52:22.783 --> 00:52:27.288
Well.
there's hope for you yet.

780
00:52:34.995 --> 00:52:37.862
You know. of course.
that's a scorpion.

781
00:52:37.863 --> 00:52:40.933
And your name's Spider.
Why do you...

782
00:52:40.934 --> 00:52:43.303
Why have you got
a scorpion tattoo?

783
00:52:44.805 --> 00:52:46.572
You do have a right
to remain silent.

784
00:52:46.573 --> 00:52:50.211
Hey. I'm just saying.
Just saying.

785
00:52:53.312 --> 00:52:57.218
In the end. does all that
smarts really pay off?

786
00:52:58.484 --> 00:53:03.021
I mean. look where I am.
Look where you sit.

787
00:53:04.056 --> 00:53:05.455
Doesn't that strike you
as funny?

788
00:53:05.456 --> 00:53:07.491
Well. not funny.

789
00:53:07.492 --> 00:53:10.764
I have this theory
about smarts...

790
00:53:12.931 --> 00:53:15.234
That it gets in the way
of seeing things.

791
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:20.907
What? Did you think
she cared?

792
00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.142
Just what I thought.

793
00:53:24.143 --> 00:53:27.146
Only a smart guy could be
that fucking stupid.

794
00:53:36.322 --> 00:53:40.526
Here's another smart guy.
See how fucking smart?

795
00:53:51.903 --> 00:53:55.438
So. want to hear the plan?

796
00:53:55.439 --> 00:53:59.876
Our girl asks you to get some dirt on old
Carl over there. which isn't hard to do.

797
00:53:59.877 --> 00:54:02.278
He's much more interested
in pain than women.

798
00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:03.547
What's the difference?

799
00:54:03.548 --> 00:54:06.650
But you wind up
falling for her.

800
00:54:06.651 --> 00:54:10.321
Decide you
have to have her.

801
00:54:13.357 --> 00:54:15.394
She brings that out
in a man.

802
00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:20.265
Let me guess.

803
00:54:22.299 --> 00:54:23.968
I kill him.

804
00:54:33.242 --> 00:54:35.880
See? Those smarts again.

805
00:54:37.681 --> 00:54:41.219
Why do I kill him if she's
going to leave him anyway?

806
00:54:42.686 --> 00:54:44.989
Hang on a minute.

807
00:55:00.336 --> 00:55:05.708
Because he put a fucking
nail through your hand.

808
00:55:08.711 --> 00:55:11.012
Of course. I'd been
following Pruitt.

809
00:55:11.013 --> 00:55:14.116
collecting all this footage.
so it had a certain logic.

810
00:55:18.187 --> 00:55:19.922
Spider.

811
00:55:21.489 --> 00:55:23.058
Scorpion.

812
00:55:23.658 --> 00:55:26.195
Whatever your name is.
Arachnid!

813
00:55:29.364 --> 00:55:31.566
You like pain
or something?

814
00:55:31.567 --> 00:55:34.535
Look. I know smarts
has its limitations.

815
00:55:34.536 --> 00:55:38.305
but dumb won't get you
very far either.

816
00:55:38.306 --> 00:55:39.340
Seriously?

817
00:55:39.341 --> 00:55:41.409
You really think
you're gonna end up...

818
00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:44.045
on a paradise island
with her?

819
00:55:44.046 --> 00:55:45.981
You really don't know
what's what. do you?

820
00:55:45.982 --> 00:55:47.250
- She's not real.
- No?

821
00:55:47.253 --> 00:55:51.119
She only shows you
what she needs to.

822
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.288
See. a man like you will
never get what she's about.

823
00:55:55.289 --> 00:55:58.058
Upper West Side pussy.

824
00:55:58.059 --> 00:56:01.194
Think I don't know you?

825
00:56:01.195 --> 00:56:06.100
You walk the line. afraid
to give the littlest offense.

826
00:56:06.101 --> 00:56:09.536
Tell them what they wanna hear.
fuck on their schedule.

827
00:56:09.537 --> 00:56:12.605
tiptoeing nine paces
behind them.

828
00:56:12.606 --> 00:56:14.141
You're right. hoss.

829
00:56:14.142 --> 00:56:17.278
She'll never be real to you.

830
00:56:22.717 --> 00:56:25.086
Just about done here.

831
00:56:33.028 --> 00:56:35.996
And you thought the nail
was a good idea because?

832
00:56:36.696 --> 00:56:38.332
He pisses me off.

833
00:56:39.165 --> 00:56:41.066
So let me get this straight.

834
00:56:41.067 --> 00:56:44.504
He kills Carl. and then he hammers
a nail into his own hand.

835
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.809
Carl fucks him up with the nail.
but he gets himself free.

836
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:53.311
He does Carl
with the knife.

837
00:56:53.312 --> 00:56:57.284
and Carl has just enough left in him
to put a bullet between his eyes.

838
00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:02.356
What did I say
about improvising?

839
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:05.993
Where is he?
I want to see him.

840
00:57:26.178 --> 00:57:29.681
I've waited a long time.

841
00:57:29.682 --> 00:57:31.485
Who the fuck are you?

842
00:57:36.088 --> 00:57:38.389
Jesus.

843
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:40.159
Now he's dead.

844
00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:43.296
He didn't know you.

845
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:48.232
You have the gun?

846
00:57:48.233 --> 00:57:50.701
Cold as they come.

847
00:57:50.702 --> 00:57:52.338
Why didn't he know you?

848
00:57:57.477 --> 00:58:00.810
No. Let me.

849
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:03.081
You sure. babe?

850
00:58:03.848 --> 00:58:06.284
He's my responsibility.

851
00:58:11.389 --> 00:58:13.392
There's my girl.

852
00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:25.271
Come on. You can do
better than that.

853
00:58:30.407 --> 00:58:33.311
If it makes a difference.
I'm sorry.

854
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:38.417
Can't blame the scorpion
for stinging you.

855
00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:46.456
<i>What was that she said?</i>

856
00:58:46.457 --> 00:58:50.393
<i>About living out an alternative future
in the last instant of your life.</i>

857
00:58:50.394 --> 00:58:52.695
<i>...future in the last
instant of your life.</i>

858
00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:55.699
<i>Is that what all this has been?
Is that what this is?</i>

859
00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.701
<i>Are you always the last
to realize you're already dead?</i>

860
00:58:58.702 --> 00:59:01.406
<i>...always the last to realize
you're already dead all along?</i>

861
00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:05.109
<i>Maybe I should have been
paying more attention.</i>

862
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:11.483
<i>Well. that was the death that
flashed before my eyes anyway.</i>

863
00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:27.430
No. Let me.

864
00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:30.701
There's my girl.

865
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:52.722
For the record.
I never liked it rough.

866
00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.462
He pisses me off.

867
01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.370
You weren't what I thought.

868
01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:10.173
You're exactly
what I thought.

869
01:00:27.321 --> 01:00:29.124
He won't be needing it.

870
01:00:32.995 --> 01:00:34.497
So where will you go?

871
01:00:35.529 --> 01:00:37.364
Someplace warm.

872
01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:40.567
Who will you be
when you get there?

873
01:00:40.669 --> 01:00:44.207
You invented me as much
as I invented myself. Danny.

874
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:49.811
The vampire can't enter
without an invitation.

875
01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:56.351
I knew he didn't come up
with that line himself.

876
01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:00.688
You want me to tell you
it was real for me?

877
01:01:01.554 --> 01:01:04.225
That I loved you
if only for a moment?

878
01:01:05.693 --> 01:01:08.430
That's why you're alive
and Spider's dead.

879
01:01:09.697 --> 01:01:11.465
Okay.

880
01:01:12.032 --> 01:01:13.768
I love you.

881
01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:17.504
I always have.

882
01:01:18.606 --> 01:01:21.576
Our souls were born together
at the beginning of time.

883
01:01:23.443 --> 01:01:26.280
I can't tell you anything
you don't already know.

884
01:01:33.719 --> 01:01:35.555
I believe you.

885
01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:42.395
Will you remember me?

886
01:01:44.464 --> 01:01:45.833
Safe bet.

887
01:01:53.739 --> 01:01:57.742
<i>The thing is.
even after everything.</i>

888
01:01:57.743 --> 01:01:59.747
<i>I wanted to believe.</i>

889
01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:04.483
Duct-taped to a chair.
nail through my hand.

890
01:02:04.484 --> 01:02:06.886
two dead guys on the floor.

891
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:10.555
I still wanted to believe her.

892
01:02:10.556 --> 01:02:13.426
<i>Homo creditus.
Man the believer.</i>

893
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.962
Pretty fucking stupid?

894
01:02:15.963 --> 01:02:17.462
Just overmatched.

895
01:02:17.463 --> 01:02:20.498
They're smarter than us.
You know that.

896
01:02:20.499 --> 01:02:23.535
At least you're not one of
the dead guys on the floor.

897
01:02:23.536 --> 01:02:25.103
Does that make me
a suspect?

898
01:02:25.104 --> 01:02:27.638
I don't think you killed
Carl Pruitt.

899
01:02:27.639 --> 01:02:32.977
And I don't really think that she
ever expected you to take the rap.

900
01:02:32.978 --> 01:02:37.781
My guess is her plan was to get rid of
Pruitt and Spider at the same time.

901
01:02:37.782 --> 01:02:39.917
So why use me?

902
01:02:39.918 --> 01:02:41.953
What Spider lacked
in moral clarity.

903
01:02:41.954 --> 01:02:43.920
he made up for
in street smarts.

904
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:46.656
He knew somebody would have
to take the fall for Pruitt.

905
01:02:46.657 --> 01:02:49.426
Well. she convinced him
it was you...

906
01:02:49.427 --> 01:02:51.661
so he wouldn't know
it was him all along.

907
01:02:51.662 --> 01:02:52.898
But why kill Spider?

908
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.603
I guess she had a short fuse
on this kind of thing.

909
01:03:00.138 --> 01:03:01.806
Tell you
she likes it rough?

910
01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.379
She was never
married to Carl.

911
01:03:08.712 --> 01:03:10.414
He didn't seem to know her.

912
01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:12.115
He knew her.

913
01:03:12.116 --> 01:03:16.621
But I decided then and there
I would never be a victim.

914
01:03:17.422 --> 01:03:19.391
The mother
was married to him.

915
01:03:30.801 --> 01:03:32.169
He killed her.

916
01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:33.405
<i>D.A. went for manslaughter.</i>

917
01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:37.740
Carl claimed she came at him
with a kitchen knife.

918
01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:39.510
He was acquitted.

919
01:03:42.111 --> 01:03:44.980
She never said
she was married to him.

920
01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:46.681
What?

921
01:03:46.682 --> 01:03:48.851
Or that he was the one
who beat her. She just...

922
01:03:48.852 --> 01:03:51.487
<i>You look in the mirror
one morning and realize...</i>

923
01:03:51.488 --> 01:03:54.757
it's not only your mother's eyes you've
got. it's the bruises around them.

924
01:03:54.758 --> 01:03:57.592
She just...

925
01:03:57.593 --> 01:03:59.962
She just let me
fill in the blanks.

926
01:03:59.963 --> 01:04:03.799
Turns out the mother insisted that
Carl set up a blind trust for Lexi...

927
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.668
before she'd marry him.

928
01:04:05.669 --> 01:04:08.605
Carl stipulated the trust
wouldn't go into effect...

929
01:04:08.606 --> 01:04:10.739
until he
and the mother died.

930
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.708
She always wanted me
to be provided for.

931
01:04:12.709 --> 01:04:15.212
so he agreed to put
something aside for me.

932
01:04:15.213 --> 01:04:17.947
<i>She cleaned out the trust
three days ago.</i>

933
01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:25.486
I imagine she hooked up with
Spider as a way to get to Pruitt.

934
01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:28.957
He'd represented him
on a couple of drug beefs.

935
01:04:30.025 --> 01:04:33.997
Once Spider laid a hand
on her. his fate was set.

936
01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:47.175
You knew all along.

937
01:04:47.176 --> 01:04:49.577
Be nice if we could see
the rest of the room.

938
01:04:49.578 --> 01:04:52.146
Well. I'll be more careful
next time I drop my camera.

939
01:04:52.147 --> 01:04:55.717
<i>You will get me the footage
that you've been collecting?</i>

940
01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:57.920
So I'm free to go?

941
01:05:03.158 --> 01:05:05.792
I am curious though.

942
01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:10.163
Earlier you mentioned something
about that couple. the Herzmans.

943
01:05:10.164 --> 01:05:12.232
Something you
never told her.

944
01:05:12.233 --> 01:05:14.668
I didn't want him
to do this. Never.

945
01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:17.637
I was in the camps.
just as I said.

946
01:05:17.638 --> 01:05:20.940
And I saw many trains
pass by with prisoners.

947
01:05:20.941 --> 01:05:23.210
But I never
even saw Morris.

948
01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:27.047
That day on Coney Island
was the first time we met.

949
01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:30.150
We fell in love
and were married.

950
01:05:30.151 --> 01:05:32.853
The important parts
are true.

951
01:05:32.854 --> 01:05:36.723
But the story of the girl
with the cross? Your angel?

952
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.059
That I made up.

953
01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:42.695
<i>It was just a trinket
he was selling.</i>

954
01:05:42.696 --> 01:05:47.067
I thought it was so funny. you know.
a Jewish boy selling crosses.

955
01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:49.235
I've worn it ever since.

956
01:05:49.236 --> 01:05:51.703
But it's not even real.

957
01:05:51.704 --> 01:05:55.975
Of course it's real.
It's just not real gold.

958
01:05:55.976 --> 01:05:58.979
When the book publishers
did their fact checking.

959
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.948
they found that the dates
and places didn't match.

960
01:06:01.949 --> 01:06:05.586
Morris came clean. but of course
he lost the book and movie deal.

961
01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.988
Why'd he do it?
For the money?

962
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:11.823
Not exactly.

963
01:06:11.824 --> 01:06:16.162
It was a wonderful story.
It made people happy.

964
01:06:16.163 --> 01:06:18.631
But it's not true.

965
01:06:18.632 --> 01:06:21.801
Agh! It made them feel good.

966
01:06:21.802 --> 01:06:24.805
Do you care when you read a novel
that it didn't really happen?

967
01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:29.709
Are you angry at Shakespeare because
Juliet never said those words?

968
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:33.812
Our love is real.
Fifty years.

969
01:06:34.613 --> 01:06:37.016
That part is real.

970
01:06:38.017 --> 01:06:39.851
So what's more important?

971
01:06:39.852 --> 01:06:44.389
I gave them something beautiful.
and now it's gone.

972
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.759
Is there too much beauty
in the world?

973
01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:51.097
Believe me. where I was
there wasn't so much beauty.

974
01:06:52.131 --> 01:06:55.934
A story like this would've
given those poor souls...

975
01:06:55.935 --> 01:06:59.839
more hope
than a hundred gold crosses.

976
01:07:03.376 --> 01:07:06.411
<i>That's why I was on the train
when I saw Lexi the second time.</i>

977
01:07:06.412 --> 01:07:09.950
I was on my way up to do the follow-up
interview with the Herzmans.

978
01:07:13.352 --> 01:07:15.721
You will get me
that footage.

979
01:07:16.755 --> 01:07:20.858
You're welcome to it.
She never let me shoot her.

980
01:07:21.659 --> 01:07:23.695
Maybe she was right
after all.

981
01:07:25.195 --> 01:07:27.632
About it capturing
your soul.

982
01:07:41.279 --> 01:07:47.152
<i>She asked me if I'd choose the
great love or the great story.</i>

983
01:07:49.154 --> 01:07:50.922
<i>But is there a difference
really?</i>

984
01:07:51.855 --> 01:07:54.357
<i>In the end. you aren't
who you think you are.</i>

985
01:07:54.358 --> 01:07:57.026
<i>You're who
I perceive you to be.</i>

986
01:07:57.027 --> 01:08:00.697
<i>In the world of matter. you are
uncontrollable. unpredictable.</i>

987
01:08:00.698 --> 01:08:03.965
<i>a babble of random motion.</i>

988
01:08:03.966 --> 01:08:08.704
<i>I capture you in a net of words. and
you are known. if only for a moment.</i>

989
01:08:08.705 --> 01:08:11.340
<i>We imagine we create words.</i>

990
01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:14.277
<i>But what if they create us?</i>

991
01:08:14.278 --> 01:08:17.780
<i>This is the secret poets know.</i>

992
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:22.117
<i>Words are incantations
weaving magic spells.</i>

993
01:08:22.118 --> 01:08:27.089
<i>If the word initiated
the universe into existence.</i>

994
01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:28.792
<i>what will close it?</i>

995
01:08:31.795 --> 01:08:34.064
<i>Why didn't I tell
Detective Martin?</i>

996
01:08:34.065 --> 01:08:38.134
<i>I guess I was never purely
victim or suspect.</i>

997
01:08:38.135 --> 01:08:41.071
<i>You could say I was
an accomplice of sorts.</i>

998
01:08:44.307 --> 01:08:46.076
Check my heart.

999
01:09:03.259 --> 01:09:07.863
<i>Why did I give her the memory
card. let her keep her soul?</i>

1000
01:09:09.197 --> 01:09:12.134
<i>Why did I go back there.
knowing?</i>

1001
01:09:14.903 --> 01:09:18.709
<i>Sometimes you just have to
find out how the story ends.</i>

1002
01:09:19.976 --> 01:09:24.079
<i>Of course. I did back it up
to my hard drive.</i>

1003
01:10:11.091 --> 01:10:14.092
<i>I really do miss
our conversations. Danny.</i>

1004
01:10:14.093 --> 01:10:17.297
<i>But this time I'm just going
to have to imagine your side.</i>

1005
01:10:18.364 --> 01:10:20.532
<i>In a way.
it's just as well...</i>

1006
01:10:20.533 --> 01:10:23.304
<i>since we can't ever
really know each other. can we?</i>

1007
01:10:24.939 --> 01:10:27.573
<i>Men and women.
people and people.</i>

1008
01:10:27.574 --> 01:10:30.210
<i>we're all alone
in the end.</i>

1009
01:10:30.211 --> 01:10:32.011
<i>But maybe that's okay.</i>

1010
01:10:32.012 --> 01:10:36.515
<i>It's what makes us hope and fear
and sometimes love each other.</i>

1011
01:10:36.516 --> 01:10:38.217
<i>It's what keeps us awake
at night...</i>

1012
01:10:38.218 --> 01:10:43.189
<i>and makes us pull the blankets over our
head against the glare of morning.</i>

1013
01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:46.527
<i>It's the throbbing in your brain at 4:00
a.m. as you look for the bathroom...</i>

1014
01:10:46.528 --> 01:10:50.930
<i>in some stranger's apartment to piss out
the chemicals from the night before.</i>

1015
01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:55.000
<i>It's fingers
scratching across tiles.</i>

1016
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.370
<i>my knees pointed at the ceiling.
my back arched like a cat's.</i>

1017
01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:01.639
<i>Love is a religion.
a denial of death.</i>

1018
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.142
<i>a descent into fiction
and improbability.</i>

1019
01:11:04.143 --> 01:11:07.880
<i>a lighting of candles.
a bridge to the impossible.</i>

1020
01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:11.183
<i>a lunatic babbling
on the uptown I.R.T.</i>

1021
01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:15.920
<i>It is this tenement basement with
its stink of cockroach and death.</i>

1022
01:11:15.921 --> 01:11:17.456
It is Jesus above Rio.

1023
01:11:17.457 --> 01:11:19.491
<i>...denial of death.</i>

1024
01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:22.928
<i>It is sex and it's withering.</i>

1025
01:11:22.929 --> 01:11:25.162
It is blood on the floor.

1026
01:11:25.163 --> 01:11:29.067
<i>You will kill for it
and die for it.</i>

1027
01:11:29.068 --> 01:11:30.636
<i>It is hope
and the death of hope.</i>

1028
01:11:30.637 --> 01:11:35.073
<i>You'll open its shroud and see your
face etched in dirt and sweat.</i>

1029
01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:39.578
<i>It fills you and empties you
in the same heartbeat.</i>

1030
01:11:39.579 --> 01:11:42.045
<i>A bridge to the impossible.</i>

1031
01:11:42.046 --> 01:11:44.683
<i>It is hope
and the death of hope.</i>

1032
01:11:49.187 --> 01:11:51.989
<i>Love without sex
is life without death.</i>

1033
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:56.160
<i>Sex without danger
is God without the devil.</i>

1034
01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:59.398
<i>If you can't risk being damned.
don't imagine you can ever love.</i>

1035
01:12:00.464 --> 01:12:02.199
<i>Love straps your arms
to the cross.</i>

1036
01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.701
<i>drives nails
through your hands and feet.</i>

1037
01:12:04.702 --> 01:12:07.038
<i>Love is the spear
that pierces your side...</i>

1038
01:12:07.039 --> 01:12:10.009
<i>and the blood and the gall
that splashes to the ground.</i>

1039
01:12:11.042 --> 01:12:12.977
<i>It is a rag of vinegar
pressed to your lips...</i>

1040
01:12:12.978 --> 01:12:15.213
<i>and the thorn
pushed into your scalp.</i>

1041
01:12:18.182 --> 01:12:21.685
<i>It is a desert mirage.
an echo in a cave.</i>

1042
01:12:21.686 --> 01:12:24.721
<i>your own words
returning to mock you.</i>

1043
01:12:24.722 --> 01:12:28.091
It's every great painting
you'll ever see...

1044
01:12:28.092 --> 01:12:33.264
and the way we know art from the scratchings
an elephant can make with his trunk.

1045
01:13:18.007 --> 01:13:20.209
Hard center or soft?

1046
01:13:23.546 --> 01:13:25.348
Soft.

1047
01:13:53.574 --> 01:13:56.545
Never much cared
for the hard center.

1048
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.984
Nor I.
