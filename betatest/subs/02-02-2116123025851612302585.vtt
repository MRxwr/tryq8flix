00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:17.751
Get one that's funny
but not too funny.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.405
This doesn't seem to be
a joking matter.

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:25.976
They look like you.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.416
I don't think getting my girl
a card with another family on it

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:31.765
is the right way
to go on this one. kid.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.073
What about this one?

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.948
No. Cats.
Definitely. yeah. cats.

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:43.603
Right. 'cause I'm a dog.
a bad dog.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:49.217
This one?

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:51.350
What's it say on the inside?

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.396
It says cool cats

00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:56.485
and then there's some cats
playing musical instruments.

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:58.357
[laughs]

00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:00.837
-That's stupid.
-I don't get it.

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.100
It's like cool cats. right?

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:05.625
It's a play on the word cats

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:08.280
because they're playing jazz
and back in the day

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.543
guys would refer to friends
or cool people as cats.

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:12.066
So. like cool cats.

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:16.244
Oh. yeah. Kind of like nigga.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.856
No. wait. no. Why would you?
No. No. No. Okay?

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:22.772
-No. Don't say that word.
-Why not?

00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:25.166
Because it's a bad word
for reasons you don't know yet

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:26.776
and if you say it again.
I'll hit you.

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:27.951
No. you won't.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:29.257
[chuckles]

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:30.519
Yes. I will.

00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:34.436
Ni... Ow!

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.655
I told you.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:37.047
Can't hit me. I'm only nine.

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:38.701
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.530
Good. You just learned
a very valuable life lesson.

00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.053
Yeah. cause and effect.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.404
Every action has a reaction

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.493
that you may or may not
be able to control.

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.669
You touch a hot stove.
you might burn your hand.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.844
You run across the street
without looking.

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:52.498
you might get hit by a car.

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:54.369
You say the N word
around black people

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.892
you might get thumped
in the ear.

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:58.112
punched in the kidney. right?
But now you know.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.115
you got to think about what
you do or say before you do it.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.072
Makes sense?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.858
Kind of.

00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:07.687
Hey. listen. Hey. I'm sorry.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:11.212
I shouldn't have done that.
Let me see. Let me see.

00:02:12.518 --> 00:02:15.695
Ow! What did you do that for?

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:17.523
'Cause it looks like you still
kind of want to say it

00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:18.654
and I want you to know
what happens

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:20.526
if you even think
about saying it.

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:22.354
You'll thank me later in life.
I promise.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:24.312
Okay. I won't say.
I won't think about saying it.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.792
Geez! I'm sorry.

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.448
Hey. look. man. I'm sorry. okay?
Let me see.

00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:32.494
-No. no. not this time.
-There you go. boom.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.019
You know. fuck it.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.760
I'll just get this one.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.893
-You want anything?
-No. thanks.

00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:41.503
Here. Put that on your ear.

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.466

00:03:58.667 --> 00:03:59.886
Uh. hey.

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:02.279
Oh. hey. Uh.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.543
tell Katie to call me
when she gets up. yeah?

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:05.761
-I have to go to work.
-[Katie] I'm up.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.072
Thanks for letting us
come over so late.

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:13.900
You are the best.

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:20.167
[tranquil music playing]

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:33.528
[Dr. Jones]
And how does that make you feel?

00:04:35.138 --> 00:04:36.226
I hate when you ask me that.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.014
[Dr. Jones] This is therapy.
Gabe. It's kind of
part of my job.

00:04:41.144 --> 00:04:44.887
I don't know. fine. great.
terrible. empty. I don't know.

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:47.542
I'm single though. right?

00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:48.804
I should be able to do
whatever I want to do.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.415
I should feel great.
You told me that.

00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:54.157
I think I told you that
you need to learn to let go

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:57.509
and be present and enjoy
the moment sometimes. yes. but--

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.772
You know. the threesome.
it wasn't even my idea.

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:00.860
It was theirs and yours.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.601
It was not my idea.

00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:05.038
Being single is just as stupid
as being in a relationship.

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:09.259
Like they rode away
on a scooter. Doc.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.957
Like a regular ass scooter.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.482
Why did you and Millie break up?

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.357
We're just taking a small break
right now.

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:23.448
Define that. a break.

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:28.801
We just. uh. we just...

00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.106
We just got to figure
some things out.

00:05:31.717 --> 00:05:32.761
[Dr. Jones] Okay. can you expand
on that a little bit more?

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.205
Gabe. what makes you happy?

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:48.168
You know anything about dreams.
animal dreams to be exact?

00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:52.651
[Dr. Jones] A little. yeah. Why?

00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:54.217
So. I had this dream
the other day

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.960
and I'm riding my bike
up this trail. right?

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.788
And it's starting to get dark

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.573
and I remember I got to get
to the top before the sun sets

00:06:01.703 --> 00:06:03.183
because pretty soon
it's going to get too dark

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:04.924
to see in a little bit.

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:08.797
And. now. it's time to coast
back down. slowly at first

00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:10.451
and then. all of a sudden.
I started picking up speed.

00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.802
And there's potholes and cracks
and shit everywhere.

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:16.239
And on top of that. right.
my brakes stop working.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.938
So now. here I am.
flying down this uneven path

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:20.853
with people all in the way

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:25.074
and I realize I either got to
just jump off this motherfucker

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:26.467
or I got to ride out
and just see what happens.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:29.818
And I decide to jump.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.865
And then. right before I jump.
I look over

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:35.345
and it's an elephant
running full speed

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:38.392
with a skunk on his back
staring right at me.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.350
Then he puts his trunk out.
trips my bike.

00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:41.787
I go flying in the air.

00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:44.267
about to land on a pile of rocks
and probably die

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:45.921
and then I wake up.
What's that all mean. Doc?

00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:51.274
-Do you have these dreams often?
-No.

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:54.669
[Dr. Jones] Animals in your
dream. all have various
meanings and symbolism.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.279
but let me think on that
a little bit.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.324
I'll get back to you next week.

00:06:57.454 --> 00:06:58.151
Okay.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.808
All right. time's up.
What's my homework?

00:07:02.938 --> 00:07:04.592
[Dr. Jones] Your homework
is to really spend some time

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:07.377
and find the answer
to what I asked you.

00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:08.117
[Gabe] Which is what?

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:11.077
What makes Gabe happy?

00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:13.253
-I don't know.
-[Dr. Jones] I know.

00:07:13.383 --> 00:07:15.255
That's why it's your homework.

00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:18.127
-See you next Wednesday?
-See you next Wednesday.

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:20.739
[elevator dings]

00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:23.655
Nice kicks.

[upbeat music playing on piano]

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.406
Hey. hon. Hi.

00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:39.105
-How was your session?
-[Alec] Fine.

00:07:42.717 --> 00:07:43.588
Good.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:47.592
Good. Glad to hear that.

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:50.725
Well. I hope you're hungry
because Wednesday's--

00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:53.119
Humpty hamburger day. I know.

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:54.163
Well...

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.034
[door opens]

00:07:56.513 --> 00:07:58.994
Hey. there champ!
How's your session. huh?

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.387
[grunting]

00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:02.781
-Fine.
-Fine. yeah.

00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:05.174
It was.
That's what I like to hear. huh.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:07.481
I'm going to go to my room
and work on my homework

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.396
until dinner is ready.
Is that okay?

00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:11.180
Yeah. you don't need to ask
permission to do your homework.

00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:13.095
Just do me a favor
and keep the door open.

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:14.880
[door closes]

00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:20.668
-It smells good in here.
-Hmm.

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:21.582
[Randy] We have any hamburgers.

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.159
[teacher] That's a really
good job. Alec. Keep it up.

00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:39.905
That's really good.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.434
Okay. everybody. tomorrow we're
going to talk about

00:08:47.564 --> 00:08:49.828
how all the slaves were freed
by Harriet Tubman.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:54.180
Have a good lunch. Bye.

00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:03.798
Hey. dick-breath.

00:09:05.408 --> 00:09:06.975
Leave me alone. Jason.

00:09:07.106 --> 00:09:09.064
I'll do whatever I want
dick-breath. my dad's a cop.

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.372
-My name's Alec.
-[Jason] It used to be.

00:09:12.502 --> 00:09:14.679
Then I changed it
to dick-breath

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:18.160
and now.
now. it's shithead.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.945
I'm pretty sure it's still Alec.

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:22.556
Nope. definitely shithead.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:23.731
[Alec] Ow!

00:09:23.862 --> 00:09:25.733

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:26.603

[upbeat music playing]

00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:44.317
[Gabe] Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
That's good. That's good.

00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:46.667
That's what I'm talking about.
Right. well done. everybody.

00:09:46.798 --> 00:09:48.887
You know what the time
is not for you. That's okay.

00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:51.237
Yes. good job.
You're almost there. Let's go.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:54.022
Ah. here we go. Get 'em.

Yeah. big dog. Bang it out.
Come on. We're almost done.

00:09:56.372 --> 00:09:57.896
Okay. Eight...

who wants to be sexy...

Two. one. That's time.
There we go.

00:10:03.423 --> 00:10:05.033
Everybody get some water.
real quick. real quick.

00:10:05.164 --> 00:10:07.688
Let's go. Good job.
Good job. Good job. Well done.

00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:11.387
[sighs]

00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:16.088
You know I started following her
on Instagram.

00:10:16.218 --> 00:10:18.003
She posted a throwback Thursday

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:20.396
and she's had that butt
since she was a teenager.

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.271
Just a perfect butt
like Kim and Chloe.

00:10:26.663 --> 00:10:27.752
It's not fucking fair.

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:30.667
I don't...

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.191
I don't think their butts
are real.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.063
Whatever.

00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:36.499
What do you even know
about butts anyway?

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:42.331
[woman 1] Ouch!

00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:44.029
Why. what's wrong?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:47.554
Oh. it's just my hamstrings
are really tight today.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.644
Do you want to stretch it out
for me?

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.298
Uh. yeah. Sure.

00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:53.734
You know. you don't want to
play around with hammies.

00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:55.518
[woman 1] Right. Thank you.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:58.652
It's just you are so good
at this.

00:10:59.914 --> 00:11:02.482
Yeah. do you. um.
do you do home sessions?

00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:08.749
All right. I think you're good.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.055
[Gabe] Women are full of shit.
Doc.

00:11:11.578 --> 00:11:13.406
I know we're not allowed
to say it now. but it's true.

00:11:13.536 --> 00:11:15.364
Talking about.
"My hamstring's hurt."

00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:17.627
I knew there wasn't nothing
wrong with her damn hamstrings.

00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:19.238
You want to have a seat. Gabe?

00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:22.589
Like. like nobody's happy
in a relationship. Nobody.

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:25.940
Why. why is she getting married
if she's out doing that. huh?

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.507
I'll tell you why
'cause nobody's happy.

00:11:27.637 --> 00:11:29.944
She's not happy.

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:33.382
She's only getting married
'cause that's what society
tells you got to do.

00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:36.646
You go out. you marry somebody
you barely tolerate.

00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:39.606
you have some badass kids
to overcompensate.

00:11:39.736 --> 00:11:42.783
then they grow up move out
the house. they stop calling you

00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:44.567
and now you're stuck
with this person

00:11:44.698 --> 00:11:46.874
who you didn't even like
for the rest of your dying days.

00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:48.354
Oh. wait!
Unless you want to get a divorce

00:11:48.484 --> 00:11:50.312
and then they just
take half your shit.

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:53.011
Oh. and even better. now you get
to watch the kids grow up

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:55.752
and make the same
stupid-ass mistakes you did.

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.189
And then you've just.
you just got to lie to them

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:59.147
and say stuff like.
"It'll get better."

00:11:59.278 --> 00:12:01.106
Really. what you should say is.

00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:03.456
"I never should have
gotten married. or had your ass.

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:05.893
or stayed at my job
as long as I did.

00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:08.026
And now. I'm fat and old
and nobody cares

00:12:08.156 --> 00:12:09.984
and just fucking
everybody's stupid."

00:12:12.595 --> 00:12:13.553
[sighs]

00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:20.299
[Dr. Jones] Are there any solid
examples of love in your life?

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:23.998
Yeah. yeah.
I love Twix ice cream bars.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:25.739
And I'm being serious. Gabe.

00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:34.008
Okay. my parents have been
married for 35 years

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:37.272
and love each other so much.
they sleep in separate bedrooms.

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:40.362
I've never even seen
my parents kiss.

00:12:42.582 --> 00:12:44.236
You know what my mom did
last week

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:45.541
to show my pops
how much she loved him?

00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:48.501
She purposely didn't pay
the cable bill

00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:51.286
just so he missed game five
of the finals.

00:12:52.374 --> 00:12:54.724
How's that for a solid
example of love?

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.510
Do you think you and Millie will
end up this way.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.641
just like your parents?

00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:03.255
[Gabe] 'm just saying
like "Love ain't enough. Doc."

00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.213
And whatever love they had
is long gone.

00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:08.434
My mom should have left my
father years ago and she didn't.

00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:10.131
so now she resents him.

00:13:10.262 --> 00:13:12.394
And my dad.
he's guilty about some shit

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.005
that happened a long time ago.

00:13:14.135 --> 00:13:16.050
so whatever nonsense
my mother puts him through.

00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:17.878
he just thinks he deserves it.

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.314
So. he won't leave either.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.708
Like I said. everybody's stupid.

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:26.626
Is it possible that that's a
reason why you revealed to me

00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:30.369
that you tend to
drive relationships away?

00:13:30.499 --> 00:13:35.809
I'm saying like what if Millie
is really happy with me

00:13:37.637 --> 00:13:40.074
and I'm really happy with her
and everything is great

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:44.122
and she still goes out and
fuck's a trainer from LA Fitness

00:13:44.252 --> 00:13:45.297
and let's my cable get cut off?

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.648
There are plenty of
happy relationships out there.

00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:49.562
You've got to water the garden.

00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:51.259
There...

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.958
It can be fun if you're doing it
with the right person.

00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:56.090
It just takes work.

00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:57.526
What? No!

00:13:57.657 --> 00:13:59.659
I hate when people say
that shit.

00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:01.661
Relationships take work.
No. they don't.

00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:03.489
You know what takes work?

00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:05.143
Work. right?

00:14:05.273 --> 00:14:07.232
I don't wanna go to work
and come home

00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:09.103
and work on some more shit.
No. no. no.

00:14:09.234 --> 00:14:11.410
I want my relationship
to be anti-work.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.064
Fuck work and fuck gardens.

00:14:18.721 --> 00:14:21.637
Gabe. you know. I. um...

00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.383
did a little more research
on your dream.

00:14:29.819 --> 00:14:30.820
Elephants. right?

00:14:33.171 --> 00:14:35.129
"Elephants represent
a part of you

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.305
that may be having a tough time

00:14:37.436 --> 00:14:39.177
letting something go
from the past.

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:42.876
or that you need to be
more patient

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.399
with something or someone.

00:14:45.226 --> 00:14:47.446
Its trunk is also
a phallic symbol

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:49.796
for sexual needs and desires

00:14:49.926 --> 00:14:52.364
yours.
or perhaps someone else's."

00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:57.195
Conversely. the elephant's
introverted personality

00:14:57.325 --> 00:14:59.588
may be a reflection
of your own personality.

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.548
Okay. so what about the
weird-ass skunk on his back?

00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:04.158
[Dr. Jones] A skunk is an
interesting animal actually.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.640
A skunk's natural defense
is to repel

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.076
without causing deadly harm.

00:15:10.904 --> 00:15:15.474
So. the skunk could represent
you driving people away

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:17.345
or turning them off.

00:15:19.347 --> 00:15:21.567
Okay. So why was the elephant
running so fast down the hill?

00:15:21.697 --> 00:15:22.394
I don't know. Gabe.

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.616
Maybe things are moving
a little too quickly for you.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:34.841
Maybe things are
getting out of control

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:38.584
and you don't like not being
in control. so what do you do?

00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:43.502
You self-sabotage so no one else
can do it for you.

00:15:44.894 --> 00:15:45.852
You repel.

00:15:46.983 --> 00:15:48.637
It's a form of control
in and of itself.

00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:52.989
It's like the student
who doesn't study for an exam

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.949
and then he gets an F
and then he convinces himself

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.038
that it's only because
he didn't study

00:15:58.169 --> 00:15:59.344
that he received
a failing grade.

00:16:00.997 --> 00:16:02.434
not because
he didn't know the material.

00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:07.613
Failure to try
because of fear of failure

00:16:09.223 --> 00:16:10.529
is worse than
trying and failing.

00:16:12.487 --> 00:16:13.880
Whatever fears you have.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.622
whatever thoughts
you're holding on to.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.713
you have to find a way
to let them go.

00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:27.415
Okay.

00:16:29.504 --> 00:16:30.505
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:16:36.076 --> 00:16:37.338
Damn. little man.
What happened to your kicks?

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.387
I don't know. I guess
I must have got them dirty

00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:43.301
playing with my friends.

00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:44.563
Huh.

00:16:44.693 --> 00:16:45.999
Soap. water.
a little toothpaste.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.479
-it'll get it right out.
-Really?

00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:48.523
Yeah.

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:50.743
Huh.

00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:53.572
-[Joanne] Good to know.
-Yeah.

00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:56.488
[elevator dings]

00:16:59.012 --> 00:17:00.318
[announcer 1 on TV] They meet
in the center of the ring

00:17:00.448 --> 00:17:03.059
and here we go.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.020
Alvarez. Walker.
I think this fight is gonna...

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.109
It's gonna be done
in the early round.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.807
I think Alvarez is going to take Walker in the early round.

00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:13.679
I know it's a five-round fight.

00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:16.247
but I'm saying this round one
is going to be his round.

00:17:16.377 --> 00:17:17.944
It's classic Alvarez.

00:17:18.074 --> 00:17:20.076
And then round two
is going to be a--

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:22.166
[announcer 2 on TV] I fought Walker. I'm telling you

00:17:22.296 --> 00:17:24.951
he's going to drag this thing
to five.

00:17:25.081 --> 00:17:26.648
He's going to drag it to five.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.737
He's got power in his hands

00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:30.522
and he's going to
knock this boy out.

00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:32.480
[announcer 1]
You may just be right.

00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:35.962
Your fight with Alvarez is what Walker was watching all camp.

00:17:36.092 --> 00:17:38.182
You have the best shot
with Alvarez.

00:17:38.312 --> 00:17:40.880
I know Walker was looking
at your fight

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.491
and thinking
the exact same thing.

00:17:43.622 --> 00:17:47.669
But I believe Alvarez. he is a Brazilian Ju-Jitsu black belt.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.108
He is good at his job and there is no one more comfortable

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.850
in the middle of an octagon
than Alvarez.

00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:56.939
[announcer 2] Walker is going to
be right there in the middle.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.767
every single time.

00:17:58.898 --> 00:18:02.118
He's gonna be able to take
all of Alvarez's shots.

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:04.033
I'm telling you
this is going to go five.

00:18:04.164 --> 00:18:05.731
[announcer 1] And there's a
really great kick by Walker

00:18:05.861 --> 00:18:08.037
and Alvarez is hurt.
Alvarez is hurt.

00:18:08.168 --> 00:18:09.952
He is visibly hurt.

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:11.824
[announcer 2] He's got him
on the cage. He's got him...

00:18:11.954 --> 00:18:13.869
And this is where Walker
is really damaged 'cause...

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.871
[announcer 1] And you can see
Alvarez really trying

00:18:16.002 --> 00:18:17.743
to compensate for that pain.

00:18:17.873 --> 00:18:18.570
[announcer 2]
He feels the--

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.443
[calm music playing]

00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:27.492
Man. I don't know what
you had me doing last time.

00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:28.449
but I'm still sore.

00:18:29.189 --> 00:18:30.930
I could barely lift my guitar.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.105
-Work?
-[Patrick] Yeah.

00:18:33.454 --> 00:18:36.109
What was it?
The super spi... Super spina?

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.502
Supraspinatus.

00:18:37.632 --> 00:18:39.939
-Super spi... Spina...
-Supraspinatus.

00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:41.462
Supraspinatus.

00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:42.594
Uh. it's great.

00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:43.508
[grunts]

00:18:45.423 --> 00:18:46.685
So. how's your business going?
It's good?

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.862
Uh. yeah. Yeah. it's good.

00:18:49.992 --> 00:18:51.516
Just trying to get some
new clients

00:18:51.646 --> 00:18:53.648
and. you know. get the word out.
but. yeah. it's good.

00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:55.215
[Patrick] That's great.
Well. just let me know

00:18:55.346 --> 00:18:56.869
if there's anything else
you need me to do.

00:18:56.999 --> 00:18:57.739
more money or anything.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.959
I got you.

00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:01.787
Oh. no. no.
You've done more than enough.

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:05.051
Yeah. well. anything
for a friend of Millie's.

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:09.229
How is she doing by the way?
She's still taking pictures?

00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:11.753
She's got such a great eye.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.494
Yeah. no.
She's. uh. she's great.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.975
She's started taking
a new photography class.

00:19:16.105 --> 00:19:17.629
Pictures are getting
better and better.

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.195
-[Patrick] Oh. good.
-Yeah. now she's great.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:22.938
So. I just bought
this green earth energy company

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:24.897
that helps turn old straws
and bottle caps

00:19:25.027 --> 00:19:26.638
into cars and houses.

00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:29.467
We're gonna launch it in
Portugal before our next tour.

00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:32.731
I was thinking about
asking Millie to be

00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.689
the artistic director
for the campaign.

00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:38.432
-You think she'd be into that?
-Wow. to...

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:40.956
-Wow. in Portugal.
-Yeah.

00:19:41.087 --> 00:19:42.262
-To go with you?
-Yeah.

00:19:42.393 --> 00:19:43.350
Well. she took all
these pictures.

00:19:43.481 --> 00:19:45.091
I took a year off

00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:48.224
and she and I went backpacking
around the world.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.097
all we had was what was
in our packs. in our pockets.

00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:53.317
Here. check this out.

00:19:55.275 --> 00:19:57.233
-Shot this in Bali.
-Hmm.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:58.757
Have you been to Bali?

00:19:58.887 --> 00:19:59.888
-Uh. no.
-It's amazing.

00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:03.022
And then. um.
well. she caught this one

00:20:03.152 --> 00:20:04.458
when we were on a sailboat
in Jakarta.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.634
Have you ever been to Indonesia?

00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:07.548
No.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.770
You got to travel. Gabe.
See the world. it's incredible.

00:20:13.902 --> 00:20:15.251
Here this one's my favorite.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:19.255
So. we got caught
in a massive storm in Tahiti

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.648
and we weren't able to
leave that tent for two days.

00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:24.826
-Millie.
-Okay. here we go.

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:25.740
-Workout time.
-Oh. sorry.

00:20:25.871 --> 00:20:27.612
-Yep.
-Um...

00:20:27.742 --> 00:20:29.570
-Yep. yep. you got it.
-Oh-ho-ho-ho.

00:20:32.051 --> 00:20:35.010
[Millie] Oh. babe.
You are not gonna believe
some of the shots that I got.

00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:37.404
I finally decided to get that
new R-Adapter for my Leica.

00:20:37.535 --> 00:20:39.450
the one my cousin got me
for my birthday.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.626
It is so dope. especially
when the sun is setting.

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:44.629
-Cool.
-Oh. and guess what else?

00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:49.547
Kai got engaged.
Anthony finally proposed.

00:20:49.677 --> 00:20:52.376
He hired this whole
like flash mob to do it.

00:20:52.506 --> 00:20:54.595
so when they all started
dancing. he joined in

00:20:54.726 --> 00:20:56.510
and then he got down on one knee
and popped the question.

00:20:56.641 --> 00:20:58.512
Kai almost fainted.
it was so cute.

00:20:59.644 --> 00:21:00.384
I got it on video
if you want to see it.

00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:03.430
Okay.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.694
What is it?

00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:08.435
Is Marc trying to steal
another one of your clients?

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:10.916
I told you he's gonna keep doing
that if you don't say something.

00:21:11.046 --> 00:21:11.786
That's nothing.

00:21:13.614 --> 00:21:14.528
[Millie] Okay. you know
I know you too well for that.

00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:17.444
Okay. look. if you wanted
something different.

00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:18.402
I could have made
something different.

00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:20.621
Nope.

00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:22.928
Gabe. what is it?

00:21:26.584 --> 00:21:27.846
Why'd you have to introduce me
to him?

00:21:31.589 --> 00:21:33.765
No. Gabe. Come on.

00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:35.506
-Please.
-I just can't figure it out.

00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:38.334
-I cannot figure it out.
-Okay. look.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.032
we have been over this
a thousand times.

00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:43.688
He's an old friend that I knew
long before you.

00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:45.211
mind you.
and I thought I could help.

00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:46.560
You said you were over this.

00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:48.432
Yeah. well. clearly.
I'm not over it

00:21:48.562 --> 00:21:49.998
'cause this is what not over
it looks like.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.045
I mean. what.
like what were you thinking?

00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:55.961
Right. like how could I make
some not awkward shit

00:21:56.091 --> 00:21:57.397
as awkward as possible?

00:21:57.528 --> 00:21:58.964
Oh. I know. light bulb.

00:21:59.094 --> 00:22:01.096
I'll introduce the guy
I'm currently dating

00:22:01.227 --> 00:22:04.230
to my rich. successful.
ex-fiancé.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.579
right. who's the rock star.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.363
And then they can do business
together.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.061
Yeah. that's genius.

00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:10.279
Gabe will like that.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.978
Yeah. that's exactly what it is.

00:22:13.108 --> 00:22:14.762
I spend all of my time trying to
figure out how to piss you off.

00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:16.285
Come on.

00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:18.200
I did it for you.
You were trying to

00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:19.375
get your personal training
business off the ground.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:20.507
and you needed the money.

00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:23.249
-To the a-hole.
-What?

00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:24.816
What are you talking about?

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:27.383
He does free concerts
all over the world.

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:29.211
He donates half of his money
to not-for-profits

00:22:29.342 --> 00:22:30.735
that go directly to women.
children. and Africa.

00:22:30.865 --> 00:22:32.780
Yeah. tax write-off.

00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:35.087
White celebrities always do that
shit when they wanna look cool.

00:22:35.217 --> 00:22:37.916
Go off. adopt a little African
baby. fuck his hair all up.

00:22:38.046 --> 00:22:39.744
take dumb pictures of him.

00:22:39.874 --> 00:22:41.528
That shit ain't cool.
Don't make you a good person.

00:22:42.703 --> 00:22:43.574
You know this is not fair.

00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:47.752
Do I grill you about all the
women you've been with. huh?

00:22:47.882 --> 00:22:48.927
I mean. you really want to open
that can of worms

00:22:49.057 --> 00:22:50.363
'cause I don't think that
you do.

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:51.843
[scoffs]
I'm a little scared to ask

00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:53.584
where you've been
or what you've been doing

00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.499
since we've been on another one
of our little breaks.

00:22:55.629 --> 00:22:56.804
Oh. you want to know
the difference. though.

00:22:56.935 --> 00:22:58.763
I didn't love any of them

00:22:58.893 --> 00:23:00.112
and it's different with you.
too. and you know it.

00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:02.114
Okay. Gabe. Gabe. baby.

00:23:04.812 --> 00:23:05.813
You. you've got to stop.

00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:13.299
I'm not with him. I am...
I'm trying to be with you.

00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:16.171
Patrick and I are just friends.
That is it.

00:23:16.302 --> 00:23:18.609
No. no. You're not just friends.

00:23:18.739 --> 00:23:19.958
That's your ex-fiancé.

00:23:22.003 --> 00:23:23.614
He wants to take you on another
trip around the world somewhere.

00:23:23.744 --> 00:23:25.746
You. him. and the camera.
taking pictures of him.

00:23:25.877 --> 00:23:27.835
fucking serenading a dolphin.

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:29.924
Just tell me this though. right.

00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:32.840
have we ever had sex
to one of his stupid-ass songs?

00:23:32.971 --> 00:23:34.450
-Huh. we probably have--
-Oh. fuck you. Gabe!

00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:35.495
Yeah. it's fucked up.

00:23:36.496 --> 00:23:37.845
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

00:23:37.976 --> 00:23:40.805
I mean you got me on this
twisted ass yo-yo.

00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:42.676
breaking up with me
because you say you need space

00:23:42.807 --> 00:23:45.505
and just when you're done having
space and done pouting about it.

00:23:45.636 --> 00:23:47.725
we start hanging out again.
working to get back together

00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:49.074
and then you pick a fight
with me

00:23:49.204 --> 00:23:50.902
over the same old fucking shit
over again

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:52.730
just so you can break up
with me.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.732
I mean. you know what. light
bulb. you're fucking awkward.

00:23:54.862 --> 00:23:56.342
so don't put your shit on me.
okay?

00:23:56.472 --> 00:23:58.083
I mean say what you want
about Patrick

00:23:58.213 --> 00:24:00.738
but the only person who
makes me feel this low is you.

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:04.524
Nah. nigga.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.484
[door closes]

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:22.629
Alec. hey. Alec.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.979
We need you to come down to
the principal's office with us.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.024
real quick.

00:24:26.154 --> 00:24:27.591
Would that be okay?

00:24:27.721 --> 00:24:29.244
Would you come with us?

00:24:30.332 --> 00:24:33.161
[upbeat music playing]

00:24:55.357 --> 00:24:58.491
What happened. Alec? Hmm?

00:25:00.406 --> 00:25:01.581
Please talk to me.

00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:05.280
What happened at school today.
honey?

00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:08.283
Why did you do that?

00:25:10.764 --> 00:25:11.765
[Randy] You know what.
you don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:13.201
but that's
what Wednesdays are for.

00:25:13.332 --> 00:25:15.073
You can let it all out with. uh.
Dr. Isaacs.

00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:16.074
We're almost there.

00:25:17.858 --> 00:25:19.599
Two. I even got you some
extra time for this session.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.255
so you just take all the time
you need to be good to go. okay?

00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:25.474
Turn around.
Just turn around. okay.

00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:26.780
Turn around.
Everything's going to be okay.

00:25:26.911 --> 00:25:28.216
Just keep facing the way
I'm facing him

00:25:28.347 --> 00:25:29.217
and everything's
going to be fine.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.442
[car door closes]

00:25:42.622 --> 00:25:44.537
I just don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do. Randy.

00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:45.843
There's something
wrong with him.

00:25:45.973 --> 00:25:48.628
There's something wrong
with our son

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.586
and I knew it since he came out.

00:25:50.717 --> 00:25:52.458
No. don't say that.
He's just a little different.

00:25:52.588 --> 00:25:54.460
I was quiet when I was his age.
I'm fine. okay.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.027
I turned out fine.
He's going to be fine.

00:25:56.157 --> 00:25:57.376
He's just.
he's going through a phase.

00:25:57.506 --> 00:25:58.812
he needs a little coaxing
out of his shell.

00:25:58.943 --> 00:26:00.684
but he's strong.
my boy's a strong boy.

00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:01.597
-[Joanne] My mother was right.
-[Randy] Hmm?

00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:03.382
This is all my fault.

00:26:03.512 --> 00:26:04.949
You mother's not right
about anything. Joanne. ever.

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:06.472
-Oh. Randy!
-I'm sorry.

00:26:08.953 --> 00:26:10.955
You know he could have killed
that child. Do you know that?

00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:12.434
Do you understand that
he could have killed him?

00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:15.002
I mean. this is how
serial killers get started

00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:16.308
and there are always
warning signs.

00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:17.918
big glaring warning signs.

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:20.399
What if this is it?
What if Alec is a serial killer?

00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:22.357
What would we do then?

00:26:22.488 --> 00:26:25.012
We will love him just the same
as long as he doesn't kill us.

00:26:25.143 --> 00:26:26.405
-[Joanne] Randy!
-I'm sorry.

00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:30.670
Look. just relax. Relax.

00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:33.891
I tell you what. let's go
to the farmers' market.

00:26:34.021 --> 00:26:35.980
Is there one today?

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.895
We're gonna find one. I'm gonna
find a fucking farmers' market.

00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:43.770
[suspenseful music playing]

00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:58.829
How are you feeling today?

00:27:02.049 --> 00:27:03.268
It's fair to say you seem down.

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:06.750
Well. 10 points for you.

00:27:08.926 --> 00:27:10.362
Have you seen my wallet?
Did I leave it here?

00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:11.450
I did. I left it out.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.846
Would you like to talk about it?

00:27:15.976 --> 00:27:16.847
What's to talk about?

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:20.459
Things are just fucked up
with Millie.

00:27:22.069 --> 00:27:23.679
We'll just let it go
at this point.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.594
Um. yeah. That's a wrap.

00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:26.900
But where the fuck is my wallet?

00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:33.472
[Dr. Jones] Why don't you
tell me what happened?

00:27:34.995 --> 00:27:35.735
Are you married. Doc?

00:27:38.172 --> 00:27:41.480
Well. I'm not here to talk
about my life. Gabe.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.742
Okay. that's not what
you pay me for.

00:27:42.873 --> 00:27:44.613
I'm here to talk about yours.

00:27:44.744 --> 00:27:47.703
Okay. well. my life sucks.
fade out. the end.

00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.662
Can we just... Can we talk about
something else?

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:52.273
I don't think your life sucks
from my personal perspective.

00:27:54.014 --> 00:27:56.887
Look. you're alive.
you're physically healthy.

00:27:57.017 --> 00:27:59.672
you have the beginnings
of a successful business.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:02.066

00:46:45.797 --> 00:46:47.842
and I know it was about
your dumb stupid ass.

00:46:47.973 --> 00:46:49.192
Okay. thank you very much.

00:46:49.322 --> 00:46:50.193
Now it's time for you to go.
please.

00:46:50.323 --> 00:46:51.890
Right this way. Uh-huh.

00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:53.109
Are you two still
seeing each other?

00:46:55.415 --> 00:46:57.896
It's complicated. Why?
Just go.

00:46:58.027 --> 00:46:59.854
'Cause I'm pregnant
and it's yours.

00:47:02.422 --> 00:47:04.076
-What?
-Yep. you heard me right.

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.123
Pregnant.

00:47:07.906 --> 00:47:10.474
So. what you gonna do. Gabe?

00:47:10.604 --> 00:47:13.346
You going to be a deadbeat
or are you gonna do what's best
for me and Gabe Jr.?

00:47:14.086 --> 00:47:15.435
Oh. I got to get back to work.

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:19.439
Listen. I'll be back tonight.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.094
so we can discuss
what the plan is gonna be.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.272
My mom is not going to be
happy with you

00:47:26.403 --> 00:47:27.143
but you're going to love her.

00:47:28.622 --> 00:47:30.146
Okay. I'll see you later.

00:47:36.195 --> 00:47:38.328
[door opens then closes]

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:43.420
Everything okay?

00:47:49.904 --> 00:47:50.993
Whiskey.

00:47:52.777 --> 00:47:54.300
Hey. isn't that the stuff
you were just talking about?

00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:55.562
Makes you make bad decisions.

00:47:59.175 --> 00:47:59.914
Is it any good?

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:01.960
[groans]

00:48:04.354 --> 00:48:05.311
Can I have some?

00:48:20.239 --> 00:48:21.327
[coughs]

00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:22.198
See.

00:48:23.199 --> 00:48:24.200
[sighs]

00:48:26.115 --> 00:48:29.335
If it-- if it's nasty and it
makes you make bad decisions

00:48:29.466 --> 00:48:31.381
then. um. why do you drink it?

00:48:32.686 --> 00:48:33.948
That is a good question.

00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:37.039
[sighs]

00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:40.868
Oh. fuck this shit.

00:48:47.745 --> 00:48:48.920
Oh. shit! Come on.

00:48:50.313 --> 00:48:51.357
What are you gonna do with that?

00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:52.141
Hit shit.

00:48:53.316 --> 00:48:57.885
[upbeat music playing]

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:07.678
-You're gonna hurt yourself.
-[Gabe] Just keep them coming.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.597
[panting]

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:15.338
Feel better yet?

00:49:16.774 --> 00:49:19.037
-Not really.
-[Alec] Can I try?

00:49:20.952 --> 00:49:22.475
I thought you said
you didn't like baseball.

00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:24.173
I said I didn't like the bullies
that play in the team

00:49:24.303 --> 00:49:25.739
and throwing and catching.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.654
Never said anything
about hitting.

00:49:27.785 --> 00:49:29.917
You know omission
is a form of a lie. right?

00:49:30.048 --> 00:49:30.875
Your parents ever
teach you that?

00:49:32.572 --> 00:49:34.661
So. like when you don't tell
your real girlfriend

00:49:34.792 --> 00:49:35.880
that you got another girl
pregnant.

00:49:36.837 --> 00:49:37.969
Is that like a lie?

00:49:39.057 --> 00:49:41.059
[sighs]

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.539
If my son is anything like you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:43.453
[Alec] Nobody's like me.

00:49:44.802 --> 00:49:47.109
But you just have to talk
to him. not at him.

00:49:47.979 --> 00:49:49.198
That's why I ignore my parents.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.332
That's why I go to my room
and play video games.

00:49:55.682 --> 00:49:58.816
[panting]

00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:07.825
Take that off.

00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:09.000
What are you wearing that for
anyway?

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:09.740
Put that on.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.180
Oh. yeah.

00:50:20.316 --> 00:50:22.013
How do I do this?

00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.580
You just see it and hit it.
It's pretty simple actually.

00:50:27.845 --> 00:50:29.629
-Ready?
-No.

00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:34.895
No. you got to--
you got to swing at it.

00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:36.593
I told you I wasn't ready.

00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:37.942
Well. if you stay ready.
you don't have to get ready.

00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:40.553
-Ready?
-Sure.

00:50:40.684 --> 00:50:41.641
[Gabe] Okay.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.777
I quit! I'm done.

00:50:46.907 --> 00:50:48.474
No. you can't quit.
I mean. sometimes you miss.

00:50:48.605 --> 00:50:50.259
You just do it again.
It's okay.

00:50:50.389 --> 00:50:52.565
-I don't want to try again.
-No. you have to.

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:54.045
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.

00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.612
-I don't want to do it.
-What the--

00:50:55.742 --> 00:50:57.614
-1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9--
-Hey. hey. hey. hey.

00:50:57.744 --> 00:50:59.224
Boy. what the f--
Hey. boy!

00:50:59.355 --> 00:51:00.878
You'll settle down
in this batting cage.

00:51:01.008 --> 00:51:02.619
-What's wrong with you?
-I can't do it.

00:51:02.749 --> 00:51:04.098
That's 'cause you're
running around yelling numbers

00:51:04.229 --> 00:51:04.882
and not hitting the ball.

00:51:05.012 --> 00:51:06.013
I need a timeout.

00:51:06.144 --> 00:51:07.798
Hey. fuck a timeout.

00:51:07.928 --> 00:51:09.278
You're gonna stand up here

00:51:09.408 --> 00:51:10.496
and you're gonna hit
one of these balls. okay?

00:51:11.715 --> 00:51:12.803
[Alec] Okay.

00:51:13.717 --> 00:51:14.544
[claps] Come on.

00:51:16.763 --> 00:51:17.764
Fucking timeout.

00:51:21.594 --> 00:51:24.423
Now. here we go. all right?

00:51:30.168 --> 00:51:32.997
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't go all Hulk on me.

00:51:33.127 --> 00:51:35.042
Just try again. all right?

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:36.827
You can do this.

00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:49.056
-There you go. There you go.
-Gabe. Gabe. I touched it.

00:51:49.187 --> 00:51:50.144
-Yeah. you see that?
-I did it. Did you see?

00:51:50.275 --> 00:51:52.016
Yeah. Yeah. I saw that.

00:51:52.146 --> 00:51:54.497
Right. now. see look. when life
gets hard. you don't quit.

00:51:54.627 --> 00:51:56.760
You stand in that box
and you figure it out. right?

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:57.761
[Alec] Yeah.

00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:59.676
[both panting]

00:52:04.985 --> 00:52:05.551
[Alec] What's wrong?

00:52:06.378 --> 00:52:07.292
[groans]

00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:10.556
I'm not ready to be a dad. man.

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:12.906
Not like this.

00:52:13.646 --> 00:52:15.126
You'll be a cool dad.

00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:16.562
My dad never does stuff
like this with me.

00:52:18.608 --> 00:52:19.826
[phone vibrates]

00:52:23.439 --> 00:52:24.701
It's Millie.

00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:26.529
Millie.
Is that your real girlfriend?

00:52:27.834 --> 00:52:28.574
I think so.

00:52:30.228 --> 00:52:32.404
-Should I answer?
-Yes.

00:52:33.666 --> 00:52:35.146
Okay. last question.

00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.061
Should I tell her in person
or on the phone?

00:52:39.324 --> 00:52:40.978
-Definitely in person.
-Yeah.

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:42.632
[beeps]

00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:45.548
Hello. Hey.

00:52:47.637 --> 00:52:50.248
Yeah. yeah.
I'm just finishing up
at the batting cages.

00:52:51.945 --> 00:52:53.512
Hey. I need to. um. I need to
talk to you about something.

00:52:54.687 --> 00:52:55.732
I can-- I can swing by.
Are you gonna be there?

00:52:57.864 --> 00:52:59.910
Okay. Okay.
I'll see you in a bit.

00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:07.874
-A card.
-What?

00:53:08.005 --> 00:53:10.312
Get her a card.
Girls like cards. don't they?

00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:17.101
Ow! What did you do that for?

00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:18.885
You'll thank me later in life.
I promise.

00:53:19.016 --> 00:53:20.670
Okay. I won't say.
I won't think about saying it.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.453
Boom.

00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:24.326
Here. put that on your ear.

00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:31.245
[scanner dings]

00:53:31.376 --> 00:53:32.769
Oh. oh. excuse me. sir.
Sorry. can you come back.

00:53:32.899 --> 00:53:34.510
It's just the Bing Bong.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.120
Oh. the Bing Bong
must be broken.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.904
'cause. clearly.
I just paid for this.

00:53:38.035 --> 00:53:39.732
I doubt it. man.

00:53:39.863 --> 00:53:42.692
Let me just-- All right.
if I can-- let me just--

00:53:42.822 --> 00:53:43.823
-What are you doing?
-[man 2] Make sure--

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.477
Get off me. man.
We got money.

00:53:45.608 --> 00:53:46.783
I ain't taking nothing
from this damn store.

00:53:46.913 --> 00:53:48.175
Yeah. I know you do. man.
but I just--

00:53:48.306 --> 00:53:49.046
Come on. I got to--

00:53:50.613 --> 00:53:51.788
Don't-- quit frisking me. dude.

00:53:51.918 --> 00:53:53.920
Hey. man.
let's record this shit. man.

00:53:54.051 --> 00:53:55.966
I just told you I didn't take
nothing from this damn store.

00:53:56.096 --> 00:53:57.054
I'm going to call the cops.

00:53:57.184 --> 00:53:58.272
Call-- call the cops. for what?

00:53:59.622 --> 00:54:01.537
You just saw me buy this.
I didn't do nothing.

00:54:01.667 --> 00:54:03.582
All right. well.
if you didn't do nothing
just let me frisk you. man.

00:54:03.713 --> 00:54:05.279
-Come on.
-No.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:08.631
I promise you.
if you touch me one more time.

00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:09.849
I'm going to smack the shit
out of you.

00:54:15.551 --> 00:54:16.508
[man 2] Ow.

00:54:24.037 --> 00:54:24.821
Did you see?

00:54:28.128 --> 00:54:29.608
Right? Right. I told him.

00:54:30.609 --> 00:54:31.784
Yep. I heard you tell him.

00:54:31.915 --> 00:54:33.482
Cause and effect.

00:54:33.612 --> 00:54:35.919
Totally. Totally understand.

00:54:36.876 --> 00:54:38.312
Called racist profiling.

00:54:39.052 --> 00:54:40.184
We learn about that in school.

00:54:45.232 --> 00:54:45.885
[Gabe] What?

00:54:46.973 --> 00:54:47.626
Where the--

00:54:49.628 --> 00:54:50.760
-Are you serious?
-You want some?

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.414
No. Give me that.

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:54.503
[brakes screeching]

00:54:57.897 --> 00:54:59.682
[Gabe] I'm sorry I slapped you.
kinda.

00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:01.335
But that's not why we're here.

00:55:04.469 --> 00:55:05.383
I'm saying.

00:55:07.254 --> 00:55:10.083
I took this without paying.

00:55:10.997 --> 00:55:11.694
You took it.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.871
That's-- that's why
the Bing Bong. 'cause--

00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:16.438
-'Cause you took it.
-Mm-hm. genius.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.180
Okay. so what do you want to do.
restock it or something?

00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:23.009
No. Just tell me how much it is
so I can pay for it

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.882
-and I can go about my--
-You slapped me for no reason.

00:55:26.012 --> 00:55:27.318
No. no. no.

00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:29.059
Cause and effect
got you slapped. okay?

00:55:29.189 --> 00:55:30.452
But that's not the point.

00:55:30.582 --> 00:55:32.715
Trying to teach him
a valuable lesson.

00:55:32.845 --> 00:55:34.760
Are you guys in like the Big
Brothers. Big Sisters program
or something?

00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:37.067
You know I've-- I've seen that

00:55:37.197 --> 00:55:39.243
but I've never seen
a black adult and a white kid.
It's usually like uh--

00:55:39.373 --> 00:55:41.288
Hey. I don't want you to say
extra words.

00:55:41.419 --> 00:55:42.986
Tell me how much this
fucking candy bar is

00:55:43.116 --> 00:55:44.683
so I can go about my day. okay?

00:55:44.814 --> 00:55:45.989
Well. there's no wrapper on it.
so I can't scan it.

00:55:46.119 --> 00:55:47.947
Scan another one.

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.993
If I scan another one that's
gonna be a separate transaction.

00:55:50.123 --> 00:55:51.037
So. I'm gonna have to
void this one out.

00:55:51.168 --> 00:55:52.909
So?

00:55:53.039 --> 00:55:55.433
So. my manager doesn't like
when I void things out.

00:55:55.564 --> 00:55:56.826
He's going to slap you again.

00:55:56.956 --> 00:55:58.915
Scan another bar.
tell me how much it is.

00:55:59.045 --> 00:56:00.873
He's been having
a very. very bad day.

00:56:01.004 --> 00:56:02.571
Alec!

00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:04.137
Hey. how much is it?

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:20.589
Hand me a napkin out of
the glove compartment.

00:56:23.983 --> 00:56:24.810
This.

00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:27.944
Hand me the card.

00:56:32.426 --> 00:56:33.689
You got a little chocolate
on your hands.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:38.520
There's a little bit
around your thumb.

00:56:41.435 --> 00:56:42.741
There's some on your wrist.

00:56:42.872 --> 00:56:44.003
Just give it. It's fine.
Just give it to me.

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:44.961
Just give it to me.
Thank you.

00:56:48.834 --> 00:56:49.922
So. what are you gonna say?

00:56:52.098 --> 00:56:56.233
Like. I love you.
I'm sorry and a big jerk
or something like that.

00:56:56.363 --> 00:56:57.756
What do you think?

00:56:57.887 --> 00:56:59.715
I don't know.
I've never had girlfriends.

00:57:00.672 --> 00:57:01.543
You're too young anyway.

00:57:02.892 --> 00:57:05.068
Well. there's just one girl.
Sarah.

00:57:06.112 --> 00:57:06.939
She goes to my school.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.681
She's kind of like
my girlfriend.

00:57:10.508 --> 00:57:11.727
Hmm.

00:57:11.857 --> 00:57:14.033
Just I haven't told her yet so.

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.687
Yeah. no. I don't think you can
call her your girlfriend then.

00:57:15.818 --> 00:57:16.993
Oh. but she is my girlfriend.

00:57:18.385 --> 00:57:20.997
She is. yeah.

00:57:22.215 --> 00:57:22.955
All right. Come on.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.222
Wait. I have anything
in my teeth?

00:57:30.833 --> 00:57:32.530
I can't tell.
Your gums are black.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.099
Do all black people
have black gums?

00:57:36.229 --> 00:57:36.926
I don't know.

00:57:38.318 --> 00:57:40.756
-Why?
-Why what?

00:57:40.886 --> 00:57:42.671
Why are my gums black
or why don't I know

00:57:42.801 --> 00:57:45.195
if every black person
in the world has black gums?

00:57:45.325 --> 00:57:47.589
The first one.

00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:49.852
I don't know. black people
and white people are the same.
but different.

00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:52.376
[sighs]

00:58:01.951 --> 00:58:02.604
[Alec] Hi.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.519
Can we come in?

00:58:22.449 --> 00:58:25.975
So. Gabe. who's this?

00:58:26.976 --> 00:58:27.716
I'm Alec.

00:58:29.065 --> 00:58:30.327
You got any lemonade
or something?

00:58:30.457 --> 00:58:31.894
Hi. Alec.

00:58:32.024 --> 00:58:33.591
Whose little white kid
did you steal?

00:58:34.461 --> 00:58:35.288
This is for you.

00:58:40.467 --> 00:58:43.819
And as far as Alec goes. we go
to the same therapist building
on the same days.

00:58:43.949 --> 00:58:45.429
We see each other
on the elevator sometimes

00:58:45.559 --> 00:58:47.561
-after sessions.
-We're best friends.

00:58:47.692 --> 00:58:50.216
He called me the N word earlier.
but in a good way.

00:58:50.347 --> 00:58:51.827
-Really. Gabe? Really?
-It just slipped out.

00:58:54.743 --> 00:58:56.788
-Have you been drinking?
-No.

00:58:56.919 --> 00:58:58.398
[Millie] You just gonna lie
to me now?

00:58:58.529 --> 00:58:59.486
You know I can always smell
alcohol on you.

00:58:59.617 --> 00:59:00.618
you have thin blood.
[sniffs]

00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:01.837
You've been drinking whiskey.

00:59:01.967 --> 00:59:04.448
Okay. a little. earlier.

00:59:04.578 --> 00:59:07.799
He gave me some. too.
It was gross.

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:09.671
I'm having a rough day. okay?
I'm grown.

00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:11.368
I can have a drink
during the day.

00:59:11.498 --> 00:59:14.197
Lapse in judgment
giving him some.
I'll give you that.

00:59:14.327 --> 00:59:16.416
Anyway. Alec came to me
after a session.

00:59:16.547 --> 00:59:19.985
He said he needed a ride home.
I offered him one.
I told him I'd take him.

00:59:20.116 --> 00:59:21.683
I went to what I thought was
his house. but he was confused.

00:59:21.813 --> 00:59:24.033
-Probably 'cause he's drunk.
-He's not drunk.

00:59:24.163 --> 00:59:27.079
We went just like ninjas
and beat the crap out of these
two kids who bully me

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:28.820
-and then played baseball.
-Okay. that's enough. Alec.

00:59:30.517 --> 00:59:33.172
Millie. that's not why
I came here. okay?

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.652
I really got to tell you
something.

00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:35.914
What is it? Because I'm still
a little hung up

00:59:36.045 --> 00:59:37.786
on you getting a 9-year-old
drunk.

00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:39.962
We're not drunk. just warm.
that's what my dad always says.

00:59:40.092 --> 00:59:40.919
[cellphone vibrates]

00:59:41.528 --> 00:59:42.355
[beeps]

00:59:45.707 --> 00:59:48.274
Gabe. what?
Why are you here?

00:59:48.405 --> 00:59:53.584
I. um. I-- I-- I just really
need your help. okay?

00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.368
We got to find out
where he lives.

00:59:55.499 --> 00:59:58.154
find out where his parents are
so we can return him home. okay?

00:59:58.284 --> 01:00:00.460
We?
Now all of a sudden we're a we?

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.637
Yes. we.
I need your help. okay?

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.641
[sighs]

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:10.340
Fine. let me get my purse.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:11.515
We'll get you home. okay?
Don't worry.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:27.574
Gabe.

01:00:29.402 --> 01:00:30.490
What's this for?

01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:31.970
Support.
It's what my friends do.

01:00:34.016 --> 01:00:35.713
Oh. and I also got to tell you
something.

01:00:35.844 --> 01:00:36.888
What?

01:00:39.586 --> 01:00:41.371
Cause and effect.

01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:45.027
You told a lie. so I hit you.
so you wouldn't lie again.

01:00:49.596 --> 01:00:51.337
It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.

01:00:54.253 --> 01:00:57.387
My therapist says
hitting when I'm mad is bad.

01:00:57.517 --> 01:00:58.214
Well. she's right.

01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:01.434
Doing anything when you're mad
is wrong.

01:01:02.522 --> 01:01:03.915
What-- what are you mad about
anyway?

01:01:04.046 --> 01:01:05.874
You're young. you got a
whole life ahead of you.

01:01:07.266 --> 01:01:08.615
Getting mad comes later
in your 30s.

01:01:09.442 --> 01:01:10.661
Today something happened.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.490
What?
What happened at school today?

01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:19.539
So. you know. how there are
three kids who are bullying me?

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:21.411
Yeah. we got revenge
on two of them at the park.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:24.762
So. there's a third.

01:01:26.546 --> 01:01:27.852
Okay. so.

01:01:29.985 --> 01:01:30.768
I burned him.

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:35.251
I lit him on fire
in the bathroom.

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:42.084
This was just a small one.
to make him sweat a little.

01:01:42.214 --> 01:01:44.695
I've been telling the teachers
that Jason was a bully.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.958
They just said.
"Kids will be kids."

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:48.351
And you gotta stand up
to bullies.

01:01:49.482 --> 01:01:50.788
That's what the commercials
always say.

01:01:53.573 --> 01:01:55.314
So. I took a lighter
from my mom's purse.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.491
put a little lighter fluid
from our garage

01:01:58.622 --> 01:02:00.232
in this little syringe

01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:03.018
that my mom used to
flush wax out of her ears.

01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:06.412
[tense music playing]

01:02:06.543 --> 01:02:11.809
Then followed him to the
bathroom and wet his new shoes.

01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:16.683
then lit him on fire.

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:23.342
Is the kid-- is the kid dead?

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:27.694
No.
It just got up to his knees.

01:02:27.825 --> 01:02:29.696
It was funny though.

01:02:29.827 --> 01:02:30.828
He was running around
like a little girl.

01:02:33.178 --> 01:02:35.354
My girlfriend Sarah saw him run
out of the bathroom
and down the hall.

01:02:37.704 --> 01:02:41.317
Then I just smiled at her
and then just went back
to the cafeteria

01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:42.840
and started eating my lunch.

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:45.321
Sometimes things just
had to be burned.

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:47.932
Okay. you guys ready?

01:02:50.674 --> 01:02:51.675
Hey. what color are your gums?

01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:54.896
All right. Let's get me home.

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:03.774
[calm music playing]

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.428
[Millie] Does any of this look
familiar to you. Alec?

01:03:06.777 --> 01:03:09.867
I mean do you live by any. um--
any big landmarks or?

01:03:09.998 --> 01:03:11.956
-Oh. yeah. I am actually.
-[Gabe] Oh. that's great!

01:03:12.087 --> 01:03:13.871
Which one?

01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:15.829
Um. there's a donut shop
around the corner.

01:03:17.266 --> 01:03:19.050
Dude. there are a thousand
donut shops in L.A.

01:03:19.181 --> 01:03:20.182
Oh. I found a good
one up on Vermont.

01:03:20.312 --> 01:03:21.270
It's so good.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.184
[cellphone vibrates]

01:03:22.314 --> 01:03:22.967
[cellphone beeping]

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:26.188
My phone's about to go dead.
you have your charger on you?

01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:27.450
This is your car. Gabe.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.668
Why would I have
a phone charger?

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:30.018
You could just say no.

01:03:30.148 --> 01:03:31.758
That would be
way more efficient.

01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:33.978
Okay. you know what?
You can just--

01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:35.806
[Gabe] All right.
I'm gonna swing by the gym.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.503
I got an extra charger there.
It's right around the corner.

01:03:48.384 --> 01:03:49.602
[sighs]

01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:54.520
-Ah. Gabe.
-Hey. man.

01:03:54.651 --> 01:03:56.958
Congrats. bro. Listen.
I want to hear all about it.

01:03:57.088 --> 01:03:58.785
but I got a new client
coming up.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:03:59.961
-Okay.
-All right.

01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:05.401
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
Heard the news. so awesome bro.
I didn't even know.

01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.968
What are you talking about?

01:04:07.098 --> 01:04:08.665
Dude. your fiancée just told us
the good news.

01:04:08.795 --> 01:04:11.233
You're getting married
and having a baby!

01:04:11.363 --> 01:04:12.321
-Wait. wait. wait.
-Yo. I better be invited

01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:14.758
-to the wedding.
-My fiancée?

01:04:14.888 --> 01:04:17.717
Yeah. she's inside. showing
everybody your baby picture
and her baby picture.

01:04:17.848 --> 01:04:19.458
trying to figure out
what the baby's gonna look like.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.939
[weights clattering
and thudding]

01:04:24.507 --> 01:04:26.596
[Bailey] Can you get me
a blue baby stroller?

01:04:26.726 --> 01:04:28.424
-That's really what I need.
-Uh. Bailey. What are you doing?

01:04:28.554 --> 01:04:30.382
Oh. hey. baby.

01:04:30.513 --> 01:04:33.298
I'm just on the internet looking
for strollers for the baby.

01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:35.735
Oh. can you believe some of
them come with three wheels?

01:04:35.866 --> 01:04:36.736
Yeah. can I talk to you outside
for a second?

01:04:37.824 --> 01:04:40.088
-Can it wait?
-No. it cannot wait.

01:04:40.218 --> 01:04:43.917
Okay. and they say we get
hormonal when we're pregnant.

01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:45.876
[laughs] It was so nice
meeting you. you guys.

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.356
Oh. okay.
What are you doing?

01:04:47.486 --> 01:04:48.835
Why are you grabbing me
like that?

01:04:48.966 --> 01:04:50.837
What are you doing. huh?

01:04:50.968 --> 01:04:52.317
You can't just come up
to my job like that

01:04:52.448 --> 01:04:53.710
telling everybody my business.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.321
You're about to be a father.
Gabe.

01:04:56.452 --> 01:04:58.802
You need to get that idea
wrapped around your head.
sweetheart.

01:04:58.932 --> 01:05:01.805
And those colleagues of yours
need to know what's going on

01:05:01.935 --> 01:05:04.938
because I'm not gonna be at home
raising a baby by my damn self.

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.984
So you might have to start
hiring some more people
around here or something.

01:05:07.115 --> 01:05:08.029
[Gabe] Listen. Bailey!

01:05:08.942 --> 01:05:11.293
How do I even know it's mine?
Hmm?

01:05:13.991 --> 01:05:16.602
Are you?
Are you calling me a whore?

01:05:16.733 --> 01:05:19.083
-No.
-[Bailey] Are you calling me
a whore?

01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:23.305
No. but I'm saying.
I don't talk to you
for like two months. right?

01:05:23.435 --> 01:05:25.046
I tell you I got a girlfriend
and all of a sudden...

01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:26.438
-[Bailey] Wow.
-...you show up

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:28.397
and you're pregnant.
I'm just-- come on!

01:05:29.398 --> 01:05:30.268
Who's that chick?

01:05:31.704 --> 01:05:32.923
Oh. she's Bailey.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.491
How do you know who Bailey is?

01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:36.883
I met her at Gabe's house.

01:05:38.929 --> 01:05:40.409
She and Gabe are going to have
a baby together--

01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.542
What did you just say?

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.196
[Bailey] Just sticking your
thing wherever you feel like it

01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:47.068
but when it comes
to responsibility.

01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:49.548
you can't handle the heat.
So. what?

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.116
I guess I'm just supposed to
just start

01:05:52.247 --> 01:05:54.379
tricking on the street now. huh?

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:58.079
Just sucking dick to put
Gabe Jr. through private school.
Is that what you want?

01:05:58.209 --> 01:06:01.386
You want me to start sucking
dick for our son's school. Gabe?

01:06:01.517 --> 01:06:03.040
-Oh. my God.
-What kind of father are you?

01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:04.389
Look. Bailey.
I'm not about to have

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.087
this dumbass conversation
with you.

01:06:06.217 --> 01:06:07.653
Not here.
Can you please just go?

01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:09.786
-Please.
-Is it?

01:06:10.613 --> 01:06:11.614
Is that Millie?

01:06:11.744 --> 01:06:12.832
He wasn't happy about it.

01:06:14.747 --> 01:06:16.575
That's why we came to your house
and Gabe got you a card.

01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:20.666
I am begging you.
will you please leave.

01:06:20.797 --> 01:06:21.537
-Oh. my God!
-[Gabe]
Right now is not the time.

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:23.060
You brought her here?

01:06:23.191 --> 01:06:25.541
-Really?
-[Gabe] Look. babe. babe.

01:06:25.671 --> 01:06:27.717
Wow. I can't believe you
right now.

01:06:27.847 --> 01:06:29.588
Babe. we'll figure it out.

01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.287
We'll talk about it later.

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:33.157
We'll figure it out. but could
you please just go now.

01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:35.116
Please. for me.

01:06:35.246 --> 01:06:35.942
Could you do that
for me. please?

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:37.466
-Okay.
-[Gabe] Okay.

01:06:39.337 --> 01:06:41.296
But you better tell that bitch
what it is. Gabe.

01:06:41.426 --> 01:06:42.993
-Okay. I will.
-Because I don't want her

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.473
-wrecking our home.
-All right.

01:06:44.603 --> 01:06:45.996
-[Bailey] Okay?
-Okay. I understand.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.825
And on the real.
if I wasn't carrying our child.

01:06:48.955 --> 01:06:50.609
-I would whoop that ass.
-I understand.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.915
-Tell her what I said.
-I will.

01:06:52.045 --> 01:06:53.395
I'll call you later
or something.

01:06:53.525 --> 01:06:54.744
Or something?
Gabe. don't get it twisted.

01:06:54.874 --> 01:06:56.572
I'm gonna start needing some
money soon

01:06:56.702 --> 01:06:59.575
'cause I'm starting maternity
leave any minute now. okay?

01:06:59.705 --> 01:07:01.011
All right. Okay.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.447
Give me a kiss.

01:07:02.578 --> 01:07:03.535
I'll kiss you later.
I'll kiss you later.

01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:11.804
Gabe. who's that?

01:07:11.935 --> 01:07:13.110
-It's just this--
-Is she pregnant?

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.677
[sighs]

01:07:14.807 --> 01:07:16.200
It's not what it looks like.
I promise.

01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:18.202
[car engine revs]

01:07:19.072 --> 01:07:20.073
Vroom. vroom. vroom.

01:07:21.901 --> 01:07:23.338
Hey. good to see you. man.

01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:27.429
Patrick. did I miss a session
or something?

01:07:27.559 --> 01:07:28.343
What are you doing-- what are
you doing here with Mark?

01:07:29.518 --> 01:07:30.127
Hey. Gabe. Um...

01:07:31.998 --> 01:07:34.087
Look it-- it just really
wasn't working out

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:36.568
with you training me.
so I got a new guy.

01:07:38.353 --> 01:07:39.571
This is Mark.

01:07:39.702 --> 01:07:41.182
Hey. did you hear
Gabe's having a baby?

01:07:42.531 --> 01:07:43.358
Congratulations!

01:07:44.446 --> 01:07:45.534
What's with those bands?

01:07:45.664 --> 01:07:46.665
-Let's get in.
-[Mark] Come on.

01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:49.146
Is that Millie?

01:07:50.103 --> 01:07:53.063
Hey. you look amazing!

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:54.369
[Millie chuckles]

01:07:54.499 --> 01:07:55.500
What are you--
what are you doing here?

01:07:56.936 --> 01:07:58.677
Uh...

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:01.245
I actually have no idea
what I'm doing here.
[scoffs]

01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:03.856
Do you have plans right now?

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.208
I-- I got something I've been
dying to talk to you about.

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:09.253
Let's-- let's get some food.
we'll get a drink.

01:08:09.384 --> 01:08:10.472
I'll-- I'll tell
you all about it.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.693
Yeah. Yeah. I could use a drink.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.956
[Patrick] Great.
Hey. Mark. I'm really sorry.

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:19.611
I-- I'm-- I'm gonna have
to reschedule. okay. Um...

01:08:20.308 --> 01:08:22.135
-This is important.
-[Mark] Got you.

01:08:22.266 --> 01:08:24.442
Yeah. I already. already
prepaid the ten. right?

01:08:24.573 --> 01:08:25.487
-[Mark] You're good.
-I'll see you again.

01:08:25.617 --> 01:08:26.531
-[Mark] Gotcha.
-Thanks.

01:08:28.403 --> 01:08:29.186
-Grab your stuff.
-Oh. yeah. Yeah.

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:30.013
Okay.

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.628
[car engine sputtering]

01:08:41.633 --> 01:08:43.244
Well. this is embarrassing.

01:08:43.374 --> 01:08:44.157
This is why
I never drive myself.

01:08:46.203 --> 01:08:47.683
Gabe. do you have a car?

01:08:48.945 --> 01:08:50.816
Would you give me and Millie
a ride to my house?

01:08:50.947 --> 01:08:53.254
Yeah. Gabe.
Could you do that
for Patrick and I?

01:08:56.082 --> 01:08:57.083
[Patrick]
I'd really appreciate it.

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:05.266
Hi. um. hey.
who. who's this kid?

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:11.707
I'm... Wait. Who am I?

01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:15.406
Well. you're Patty Nelson.

01:09:15.537 --> 01:09:17.626
You're like the best
guitarist ever.

01:09:17.756 --> 01:09:19.671
Well. thanks.
I'm flattered you think so.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:23.153
Alec. That's my name. Alec.

01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:25.764
Right on. Alec.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:30.508
Hey. um. maybe it's best if you
turn around and face front.
Might be safer.

01:09:30.639 --> 01:09:33.816
My parents make me sleep
with the door open.
They think that's safer.

01:09:33.946 --> 01:09:35.644
He's going through some changes.

01:09:35.774 --> 01:09:38.037
Yeah. but I'm in therapy
because I burned the kid
at school.

01:09:38.951 --> 01:09:39.952
You burned a kid?

01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:41.606
Okay. Alec. turn around.

01:09:41.737 --> 01:09:43.565
That's Patty Nelson. the legend.

01:09:43.695 --> 01:09:45.567
I know. Just turn around.
Just right now. turn around.

01:09:49.962 --> 01:09:51.399
[screaming]

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:53.444
-Why?
-Alec. stop!

01:09:53.575 --> 01:09:55.838
Alec. calm down!
Alec. calm down.

01:09:55.968 --> 01:09:57.579
Calm down.
We already did this. bro.

01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:59.755
We're not doing this again.
okay? Stop.

01:10:01.452 --> 01:10:03.672
Can I ride the rest of the ride
looking at Mr. Nelson now?

01:10:05.413 --> 01:10:06.239
I'd rather you didn't.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:17.512
So. Gabe. did I hear correctly.
you're gonna have a baby?

01:10:17.642 --> 01:10:20.253
Yeah. Gabe.
did we hear that correctly.
you are going to have a baby?

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.647
It's a little more complicated
than that I suppose.

01:10:22.778 --> 01:10:25.998
What exactly is so complicated?
I mean. sex is pretty simple.

01:10:26.129 --> 01:10:28.566
I mean. you insert A into B. you
drop a load off and then boom.

01:10:28.697 --> 01:10:30.133
nine months later
you have a baby.

01:10:30.263 --> 01:10:32.222
-What's so complicated?
-No. maybe.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.267
maybe right now
is not the best time.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.966
Oh. it isn't? It's not
convenient for you. Gabe?

01:10:37.096 --> 01:10:38.837
What are you gonna save it all
for your next little
therapy session?

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:42.014
I mean. you are unbelievable.

01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:43.886
You can open up to every person
on this planet except for me.

01:10:44.016 --> 01:10:45.496
but you know what. actually.
it's fine.

01:10:45.627 --> 01:10:47.106
Maybe you can explain
to Dr. Jones

01:10:47.237 --> 01:10:48.978
how someone who's too afraid
to be in a healthy

01:10:49.108 --> 01:10:51.154
and loving.
committed relationship.

01:10:51.284 --> 01:10:53.765
thinks it's a better idea to
knock up a random chick instead.

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:55.811
-I mean that'll be.
ooh. that'll be a great session.
-[Gabe sighs].

01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:58.117
Guys. this. uh.
kid is freaking me out.

01:10:58.248 --> 01:11:00.163
I don't think he's blinked
the entire time
he's been staring at me.

01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:01.730
Actually. you know what.
it's good.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.210
Alec should hear all about
his new best friend.

01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:05.821
That way he can grow up
to be just like him.

01:11:05.951 --> 01:11:08.563
Look. no. everybody listen.
if we could just...

01:11:08.693 --> 01:11:12.175
We get Patrick home. then we'll
find out a way to get Alec home.

01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:13.872
I say we drop
the good son off first.

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.700
[Gabe] I'll explain all this
later. babe. I promise.

01:11:15.831 --> 01:11:18.442
We. there you go again
with the "we" stuff.

01:11:18.573 --> 01:11:20.705
We didn't raw dog
the squat-legged chick
back there in the leggings.

01:11:20.836 --> 01:11:22.315
the one you got pregnant.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:24.579
[Patrick] Oh. dude.
You got to wear protection.

01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:26.929
There's diseases out here
that'll make your junk fall
right off.

01:11:27.059 --> 01:11:28.887
My mom calls it
the willy [inaudible].

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:32.325
Got me out here making chicken
tacos. trying to hang out again?

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:34.153
And this whole time
you've got a chick pregnant?

01:11:34.284 --> 01:11:36.373
-And you weren't gonna tell me.
-She does not...

01:11:36.504 --> 01:11:38.070
-I don't even know if it's mine.
-[Millie] You didn't think
I'll find out?

01:11:38.201 --> 01:11:39.376
-Unreal.
-[Dr. Jones]
How does that make you feel?

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:41.291
How does that make you feel?

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:44.337
How does that make you feel?

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:45.426
-How does that make you feel?
-[Millie] Gabe.

01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:46.557
Gabe! Where you going?

01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:54.522
[Gabe panting]

01:11:54.652 --> 01:11:57.655
Gabe! Gabe! You're being
ridiculous. get in the car.

01:11:57.786 --> 01:11:59.352
I can't get in the car.
I can't get in.

01:12:00.963 --> 01:12:02.486
Why not? It's your car.
We can take you
wherever you want to go.

01:12:02.617 --> 01:12:06.011
If I get... If I get back
in the car. I'll kill you all.

01:12:06.142 --> 01:12:07.752
[Millie] Okay. you're not going
to kill anybody.

01:12:07.883 --> 01:12:09.711
You're just having another one
of your anxiety attacks.

01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:11.800
Nope. nope. This was real.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:13.671
I'll kill you all
if I get back in the car.

01:12:13.802 --> 01:12:15.151
-[Millie] Gabe.
Gabe. get in the car.
-No. I can't.

01:12:15.281 --> 01:12:17.370
Gabe! Gabe!

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:18.589
Where the fuck is he going?

01:12:19.895 --> 01:12:20.983
[sighs]

01:12:30.688 --> 01:12:31.689
[scoffs] What a day!

01:12:34.344 --> 01:12:37.042
You know. Gabe was pretty upset
when he heard
he was gonna be a dad.

01:12:39.654 --> 01:12:40.742
What'd he say?

01:12:42.787 --> 01:12:45.442
He said she was like a whiskey
mistake or something like that.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.273
Yeah. pretty sure.

01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:51.361
I know where he's going.

01:12:53.668 --> 01:12:56.714
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm. Wednesday. right?

01:13:06.724 --> 01:13:08.857
[footsteps approaching]

01:13:08.987 --> 01:13:11.512
[panting]

01:13:11.642 --> 01:13:14.732
-Gabe. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:13:16.691 --> 01:13:18.257
Is someone chasing you
or something?

01:13:18.388 --> 01:13:19.998
No. no. I'm fine. I just--

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.391
Are you. are you hurt?

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:22.958
Oh. it's just...
I just can't breathe.

01:13:23.088 --> 01:13:24.046
All right. here. here. here.

01:13:24.176 --> 01:13:24.960
Drink this.

01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:30.487
You don't look... You know what.
I'm going to call somebody.

01:13:30.618 --> 01:13:32.054
No. no. [coughing]
I'm fine.

01:13:32.184 --> 01:13:33.577
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:13:35.013 --> 01:13:36.058
I just can't breathe.

01:13:38.364 --> 01:13:39.801
Okay. look. just.
everything's going to be fine.
Just take a breath.

01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:43.282
[continues panting]

01:13:43.413 --> 01:13:46.851
Look. this day has to be
the worst day of my life.

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:50.463
Okay. just tell me
what happened.

01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:55.164
Okay. well. first of all. right.
I run away from my car.

01:13:55.294 --> 01:13:58.776
I leave my. my ex. Millie.
with her ex-fiancé Patty Nelson.

01:13:58.907 --> 01:14:00.386
I love that guy.

01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:02.345
Yeah. and then. and then
I'd be riding around all day

01:14:02.475 --> 01:14:06.088
with some. some kid
who just might be
the next Hannibal Lecter.

01:14:06.218 --> 01:14:08.830
Oh. oh. and I.
I'm about to be a father.

01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:13.138
Yeah. yeah.
I got some random chick
pregnant.

01:14:13.269 --> 01:14:16.141
I don't even like her.
She shows up to my job.

01:14:16.272 --> 01:14:18.796
I messed with her like
a couple of months ago.

01:14:18.927 --> 01:14:22.931
She's pregnant.
She's keeping 'em and. yeah.
it's just. it's just all bad.

01:14:23.061 --> 01:14:24.541
Okay. just take a.
take a second.

01:14:24.672 --> 01:14:26.151
Hang on a minute.
Just. just take a breath.

01:14:26.282 --> 01:14:27.805
Everything's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.

01:14:27.936 --> 01:14:30.416
No. no. I'm not gonna be fine.

01:14:30.547 --> 01:14:33.245
You keep saying that shit
and it's not true.

01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:36.031
Okay? It just keeps getting
worse and worse.
Everything sucks.

01:14:40.557 --> 01:14:43.255
I'm not ready to be a father.
man. not like this with her.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:51.307
I love Millie and I was really.
really trying to make it work

01:14:51.437 --> 01:14:52.830
and this fucking thing happens.

01:14:54.266 --> 01:14:57.226
Who's this kid that
you were hanging out with?

01:14:57.356 --> 01:14:59.576
[Gabe] It's Alec. He's some kid
who goes to therapy
in the building somewhere.

01:15:03.406 --> 01:15:04.799
Oh. God!

01:15:04.929 --> 01:15:06.670
-Oh. God!
-Why? Why?

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:08.106
-What?
-Everybody. everybody.

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.195
everybody has been looking
for him.

01:15:10.326 --> 01:15:11.980
-What?
-Yeah.

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:13.677
He didn't show up
for his session today.

01:15:13.808 --> 01:15:15.026
so they've been looking all over
for him.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:17.855
He's not missing.
he's in the car.

01:15:17.986 --> 01:15:18.856
All right. Gabe. listen.
I need--

01:15:18.987 --> 01:15:20.815
That motherfucker.

01:15:20.945 --> 01:15:25.123
I need you to.
to bring him upstairs.
so I can. I can see him.

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.995
-Not that you would do anything.
-There's nothing wrong with him.

01:15:27.125 --> 01:15:28.387
There's nothing wrong
with him. okay?

01:15:28.518 --> 01:15:30.215
Except he burns little kids
at school.

01:15:30.346 --> 01:15:32.957
I need to protect the safety
of this child. Can you please

01:15:33.088 --> 01:15:34.567
-bring him up to here?
-Safety? He's fine.

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:36.134
-He's fine. He's fucking fine.
-[Dr. Jones] Okay.

01:15:37.745 --> 01:15:41.400
[upbeat music playing]

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:47.668
[cellphone vibrates then beeps]

01:15:55.893 --> 01:15:57.590
-Gabe. Gabe.
-[Gabe] Come here. Come here.

01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:58.983
[Millie] Gabe. whoa. whoa. whoa!
Easy. easy.

01:15:59.114 --> 01:16:00.158
-[Gabe] Come here.
-[Patrick] Hey. hey. hey.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.203
You've been lying to me.

01:16:02.813 --> 01:16:04.554
You said your grandmother forgot
to pick you up

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:06.730
because she's old
after your session.
But you never went.

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.430
Right. Right.

01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:14.129
And then you took me on this
wild-ass goose chase

01:16:14.259 --> 01:16:16.653
pretending you were locked out.
stealing candy and shit.

01:16:16.784 --> 01:16:19.177
You got people thinking
you're fucking kidnapped.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:21.223
I never should have picked
your ass up in the first place.

01:16:21.353 --> 01:16:22.485
Well. Gabe. Gabe.
I think that's enough.

01:16:22.615 --> 01:16:23.529
[Gabe]
Oh. what do you care. huh?

01:16:25.575 --> 01:16:27.795
Right. you're leaving me anyway
without even hearing my side.

01:16:27.925 --> 01:16:30.275
so you don't have to worry about
what I do anymore.

01:16:30.406 --> 01:16:32.756
Now. listen. you're gonna
tell me where you live.

01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:34.802
You're gonna tell me
what's going on.

01:16:34.932 --> 01:16:37.195
You're gonna tell me right now.
I'm not playing anymore.

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:41.722
Okay. okay. I'm sorry.
I told a fib earlier.
I'm sorry.

01:16:41.852 --> 01:16:45.421
I know where I live.
I just didn't want to
go back to my house.

01:16:45.551 --> 01:16:48.163
My dad will keep
ruffling my hair.

01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:50.208
my mom would keep looking at me
like she's about to cry.

01:16:53.211 --> 01:16:54.256
They don't know me.

01:16:56.214 --> 01:16:59.522
I just want to hang out
with you.
You're my only friend.

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:03.134
I just didn't want to go back
to my house. that's all.

01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:04.222
[Patrick]
I would like to go home.

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:05.441
Dude. shut the fuck up. Patrick.

01:17:07.138 --> 01:17:08.792
[sighs] Listen. it's okay. man.
It's okay.

01:17:11.012 --> 01:17:13.623
We just got to get you home.
man. We got to do that. okay?

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.103
Maybe I could work
something out.

01:17:15.233 --> 01:17:16.539
if you start playing baseball.
I could.

01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:17.932
I could come to your game
or something.

01:17:18.846 --> 01:17:20.717
You're my pal still.
You're my pal.

01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:25.026
-Okay. promise?
-[Gabe] I promise.

01:17:25.156 --> 01:17:28.769
[calm music playing]

01:17:35.645 --> 01:17:36.733
[sighs]

01:17:36.864 --> 01:17:39.257
I live at
11204 Sycamore Boulevard.

01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:41.738
[sighs]

01:17:44.088 --> 01:17:47.788
[ominous music playing]

01:17:52.053 --> 01:17:53.228
Hey. man.

01:17:54.533 --> 01:17:56.361
I'm sorry for that stuff I said
back there.

01:17:56.492 --> 01:17:58.886
I. I didn't mean anything.
You didn't deserve it.

01:17:59.016 --> 01:18:01.453
It's okay.
You are having a bad day.

01:18:02.715 --> 01:18:03.978
[sighs]

01:18:05.327 --> 01:18:06.284
I'm sorry. too.

01:18:08.547 --> 01:18:09.200
I know.

01:18:10.767 --> 01:18:11.550
[Gabe] Can we please talk later?

01:18:14.858 --> 01:18:16.033
I think this is it.

01:18:23.606 --> 01:18:25.956
-Can I help you?
-Yeah. I'm just...

01:18:26.087 --> 01:18:27.915
You guys are probably looking
for Alec. so. I just...

01:18:29.264 --> 01:18:30.308
All right. Hey. freeze! Let me
see your hands right now!

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.440
-Hands! Let me see 'em.
-Who?

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:32.658
-You. Put your hands up?
-Okay.

01:18:32.789 --> 01:18:34.443
-Do not put them down.
-Okay.

01:18:34.573 --> 01:18:36.532
-What the fuck is happening?
-Get on the car. Get on the car.

01:18:36.662 --> 01:18:37.794
-What are you'll doing?
-[Millie] What are you
arresting him for?

01:18:37.925 --> 01:18:39.535
Son. everything's okay.
All right?

01:18:39.665 --> 01:18:40.928
-You're safe.
-I've been safe.
Gabe is my friend. No.

01:18:41.058 --> 01:18:43.017
Okay. wait.
why are you arresting him?

01:18:43.147 --> 01:18:44.409
-[cop 1] I need you people
to back up?
-You break my fucking arm.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.193
-I'm gonna beat that ass...
-Stop resisting.

01:18:45.323 --> 01:18:46.411
I'm not resisting.

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:48.544
Guys. this is a
misunderstanding.

01:18:48.674 --> 01:18:50.198
-[cop 1]
I'm not gonna tell you again.
-Don't talk to her like that.

01:18:50.328 --> 01:18:51.764
-Hey. shut up. Come on.
-[Millie] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:53.375
-Officer. Officer.
-[Patrick] This is a mistake.

01:18:53.505 --> 01:18:54.245
-[Alec] He's my friend!
-Where are you taking him?

01:18:54.376 --> 01:18:55.072
He's not the bad guy.

01:18:55.203 --> 01:18:57.422
Alec. Oh. my God. honey!

01:18:57.553 --> 01:18:59.772
Honey. are you okay?
We've been worried sick.

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:01.818
[Randy] That. that man.
he didn't touch you anywhere.
did he?

01:19:01.949 --> 01:19:03.951
Tell them to let him go. dad.
tell them.

01:19:04.081 --> 01:19:06.475
Yeah. let the police
do their job.
They're the heroes today. chief.

01:19:06.605 --> 01:19:07.911
-Hi. hi. You're his parents?
-[Randy] Hi.

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:09.957
I'm Millie.
I'm Gabe's girlfriend.

01:19:10.087 --> 01:19:12.742
I think this whole thing is a
huge misunderstanding.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.180
Gabe would never hurt Alec.
they're friends.

01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:19.009
Friends? No. a man in his 30s
and my child

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.578
don't need to be friends.
There's no misunderstanding.
Your boyfriend kidnapped my son.

01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:23.709
-Okay. I--
-[Joanne]
Okay. we've been worried sick.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.103
Oh. my word! Oh. my word!

01:19:26.234 --> 01:19:27.844
It's Patty Nelson.
You're Patty Nelson.

01:19:27.975 --> 01:19:29.411
Nelson. can I get
your autograph?

01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:31.108
My friends at work are never
gonna believe this.

01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:32.805
-Give me something to write on.
-It's not the best time.

01:19:33.806 --> 01:19:35.939
And. and who do you think
you are?

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.550
What kind of grown man hangs out
with a 9-year-old all day?

01:19:38.681 --> 01:19:40.074
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:19:40.204 --> 01:19:42.685
Ashamed? What?
You don't even know your son.

01:19:42.815 --> 01:19:44.817
You know. he doesn't even
like hamburgers. stupid.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:46.428
-Come on.
-[Millie] Gabe.
hang in there. okay.

01:19:46.558 --> 01:19:48.299
We're going to. we're going to
get you out of this.

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:49.605
Patrick has plenty of money.
We're going to figure this out.

01:19:49.735 --> 01:19:51.085
Yeah. yeah. No.
Anybody's money but his.

01:19:51.215 --> 01:19:52.825
-Anybody's but his.
-[cop 1] Hey. shut up!

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.827
-Patrick Nelson is the best.
-[cop 2] Get in the car.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.655
-[Gabe] Fuck Patty Nelson.
-[cop 1] Get in the car.

01:19:57.439 --> 01:19:58.919
Ma'am. let's get you inside.

01:19:59.049 --> 01:20:00.137
You and your family don't need
to see this.

01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:04.141
-Everything all right?
-Uh. yeah. We're getting there.
So. what happened?

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.665
Are you involved
in this kidnapping?

01:20:06.796 --> 01:20:08.189
I mean. I know you're not.
but you're his girlfriend.

01:20:08.319 --> 01:20:09.581
What do you know about this?

01:20:09.712 --> 01:20:11.409
What do you mean what do I--

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.977
Alec needed a ride home from
therapy today. so Gabe took him.

01:20:14.108 --> 01:20:16.153
Therapy?
Why does your boy need therapy?

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.418
He's. he's got some
behavioral issues.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.943
He's just figuring out
who he is.

01:20:23.073 --> 01:20:27.208
Um. and that monster
must have grabbed him
after Alec's session.

01:20:27.338 --> 01:20:29.558
Today he's had a particularly
rough day at school.

01:20:29.688 --> 01:20:32.082
He's probably emotional
and. you know.

01:20:32.213 --> 01:20:33.344
that. that man
took advantage of it.

01:20:34.258 --> 01:20:35.781
What happened with
Alec at school?

01:20:38.175 --> 01:20:40.612
In a roundabout way.
he was the cause of an accident
to another student.

01:20:40.743 --> 01:20:43.093
Alec burned a kid
for bullying him.
That's what happened.

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.969
Did this. uh. did this happen
at Burroughs Grade School?

01:20:49.795 --> 01:20:50.666
Yeah. why?

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:55.453
Oh. my God! You little fucker!

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:56.977
-You little fucker!
-[cop 3] Joe. Joe. Joe.

01:20:57.107 --> 01:20:58.935
My son Jason has second-degree
burns on his legs.

01:20:59.066 --> 01:21:00.676
He's in a wheelchair
because of you.

01:21:00.806 --> 01:21:02.243
-You fucking psychopath!
-[cop 3] Okay. Joe.

01:21:02.373 --> 01:21:04.549
He gets to ride in a wheelchair?
Cool!

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.551
Cool. cool?

01:21:06.682 --> 01:21:08.945
Cool? I'm going to kill you.
you little fucker!

01:21:09.076 --> 01:21:11.426
Your fucking kid's a psychopath.
That's what he is.

01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:13.384
You take that back!
Randy. do something.

01:21:13.515 --> 01:21:15.256
-Huh?
-Okay. look. look. look.

01:21:15.386 --> 01:21:17.171
Now we're all going to
forgive Detective Parlow.

01:21:17.301 --> 01:21:18.128
Detective Parlow here
is a little emotional.

01:21:19.173 --> 01:21:21.175
Either they don't know.
don't show.

01:21:22.872 --> 01:21:24.004
or don't care about
what's going on in the hood.

01:21:26.223 --> 01:21:28.356
Do not quote "Boys in the Hood"
to me right now.

01:21:28.486 --> 01:21:29.139
Boy. you got to breathe.

01:21:30.227 --> 01:21:31.489
You got two strikes.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.013
[Patrick]
Look. two life-changing moments

01:21:33.143 --> 01:21:34.971
where you taught me
that I'll never forget.

01:21:35.102 --> 01:21:37.104
One. watching that movie.
Ricky should have
never stopped to pee.

01:21:37.234 --> 01:21:38.192
It was right around the corner
from his house.

01:21:39.236 --> 01:21:41.586
And. two.
nothing should be forced.

01:21:42.848 --> 01:21:45.068
Nothing. I like Gabe.

01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:48.028
He. he's a real nice guy
but he's a mess.

01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:49.551
[Millie]
Patrick. maybe you're right.

01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:53.294
Gabe is a fucking mess.
but he's my fucking mess.

01:21:54.947 --> 01:21:57.254
And right now
he's in a lot of trouble.
And he needs me.

01:21:57.385 --> 01:21:59.082
So. if it's okay with you
I'm going to help him
because I love him.

01:22:02.303 --> 01:22:02.999
Do you think
you could introduce me?

01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.131
Sir. no.

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.263
Autograph.

01:22:06.394 --> 01:22:08.570
[Patrick] Oh. I...

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.398
[Randy] I'd really appreciate it
if you could make it
out to Randy

01:22:10.528 --> 01:22:11.573
-with a Y.

Yeah. I guess so.
I mean. he writes me every week.

zero sense. but. surprisingly.

Alec's mom and dad bailed me out
of jail to say they were sorry.

And then they invited me over
for Salmon Saturday.

since you moved in?

with me.

I really appreciate him
for that.

01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:41.070
And in turn it's made me feel
more secure with us.

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:47.250
And he gave me a key
when he got out of jail.
We're best friends again.

my arm and almost broke it.

flashed before my eyes.

I loved Millie more than anybody
I'd ever loved before.

And then I saw Alec
light that detective on fire

01:25:08.532 --> 01:25:10.969

lost my train of thought.
