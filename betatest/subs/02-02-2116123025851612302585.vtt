00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:17.751
Get one that's funny
but not too funny.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.405
This doesn't seem to be
a joking matter.

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:25.976
They look like you.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.416
I don't think getting my girl
a card with another family on it

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:31.765
is the right way
to go on this one. kid.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.073
What about this one?

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.948
No. Cats.
Definitely. yeah. cats.

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:43.603
Right. 'cause I'm a dog.
a bad dog.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:49.217
This one?

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:51.350
What's it say on the inside?

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.396
It says cool cats

00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:56.485
and then there's some cats
playing musical instruments.

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:58.357
[laughs]

00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:00.837
-That's stupid.
-I don't get it.

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.100
It's like cool cats. right?

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:05.625
It's a play on the word cats

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:08.280
because they're playing jazz
and back in the day

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.543
guys would refer to friends
or cool people as cats.

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:12.066
So. like cool cats.

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:16.244
Oh. yeah. Kind of like nigga.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.856
No. wait. no. Why would you?
No. No. No. Okay?

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:22.772
-No. Don't say that word.
-Why not?

00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:25.166
Because it's a bad word
for reasons you don't know yet

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:26.776
and if you say it again.
I'll hit you.

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:27.951
No. you won't.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:29.257
[chuckles]

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:30.519
Yes. I will.

00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:34.436
Ni... Ow!

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.655
I told you.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:37.047
Can't hit me. I'm only nine.

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:38.701
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.530
Good. You just learned
a very valuable life lesson.

00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.053
Yeah. cause and effect.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.404
Every action has a reaction

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.493
that you may or may not
be able to control.

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.669
You touch a hot stove.
you might burn your hand.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.844
You run across the street
without looking.

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:52.498
you might get hit by a car.

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:54.369
You say the N word
around black people

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.892
you might get thumped
in the ear.

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:58.112
punched in the kidney. right?
But now you know.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.115
you got to think about what
you do or say before you do it.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.072
Makes sense?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.858
Kind of.

00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:07.687
Hey. listen. Hey. I'm sorry.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:11.212
I shouldn't have done that.
Let me see. Let me see.

00:02:12.518 --> 00:02:15.695
Ow! What did you do that for?

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:17.523
'Cause it looks like you still
kind of want to say it

00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:18.654
and I want you to know
what happens

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:20.526
if you even think
about saying it.

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:22.354
You'll thank me later in life.
I promise.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:24.312
Okay. I won't say.
I won't think about saying it.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.792
Geez! I'm sorry.

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.448
Hey. look. man. I'm sorry. okay?
Let me see.

00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:32.494
-No. no. not this time.
-There you go. boom.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.019
You know. fuck it.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.760
I'll just get this one.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.893
-You want anything?
-No. thanks.

00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:41.503
Here. Put that on your ear.

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.466

00:03:58.667 --> 00:03:59.886
Uh. hey.

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:02.279
Oh. hey. Uh.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.543
tell Katie to call me
when she gets up. yeah?

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:05.761
-I have to go to work.
-[Katie] I'm up.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.072
Thanks for letting us
come over so late.

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:13.900
You are the best.

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:20.167
[tranquil music playing]

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:33.528
[Dr. Jones]
And how does that make you feel?

00:04:35.138 --> 00:04:36.226
I hate when you ask me that.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.014
[Dr. Jones] This is therapy.
Gabe. It's kind of
part of my job.

00:04:41.144 --> 00:04:44.887
I don't know. fine. great.
terrible. empty. I don't know.

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:47.542
I'm single though. right?

00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:48.804
I should be able to do
whatever I want to do.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.415
I should feel great.
You told me that.

00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:54.157
I think I told you that
you need to learn to let go

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:57.509
and be present and enjoy
the moment sometimes. yes. but--

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.772
You know. the threesome.
it wasn't even my idea.

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:00.860
It was theirs and yours.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.601
It was not my idea.

00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:05.038
Being single is just as stupid
as being in a relationship.

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:09.259
Like they rode away
on a scooter. Doc.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.957
Like a regular ass scooter.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.482
Why did you and Millie break up?

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.357
We're just taking a small break
right now.

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:23.448
Define that. a break.

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:28.801
We just. uh. we just...

00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.106
We just got to figure
some things out.

00:05:31.717 --> 00:05:32.761
[Dr. Jones] Okay. can you expand
on that a little bit more?

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.205
Gabe. what makes you happy?

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:48.168
You know anything about dreams.
animal dreams to be exact?

00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:52.651
[Dr. Jones] A little. yeah. Why?

00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:54.217
So. I had this dream
the other day

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.960
and I'm riding my bike
up this trail. right?

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.788
And it's starting to get dark

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.573
and I remember I got to get
to the top before the sun sets

00:06:01.703 --> 00:06:03.183
because pretty soon
it's going to get too dark

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:04.924
to see in a little bit.

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:08.797
And. now. it's time to coast
back down. slowly at first

00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:10.451
and then. all of a sudden.
I started picking up speed.

00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.802
And there's potholes and cracks
and shit everywhere.

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:16.239
And on top of that. right.
my brakes stop working.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.938
So now. here I am.
flying down this uneven path

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:20.853
with people all in the way

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:25.074
and I realize I either got to
just jump off this motherfucker

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:26.467
or I got to ride out
and just see what happens.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:29.818
And I decide to jump.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.865
And then. right before I jump.
I look over

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:35.345
and it's an elephant
running full speed

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:38.392
with a skunk on his back
staring right at me.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.350
Then he puts his trunk out.
trips my bike.

00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:41.787
I go flying in the air.

00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:44.267
about to land on a pile of rocks
and probably die

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:45.921
and then I wake up.
What's that all mean. Doc?

00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:51.274
-Do you have these dreams often?
-No.

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:54.669
[Dr. Jones] Animals in your
dream. all have various
meanings and symbolism.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.279
but let me think on that
a little bit.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.324
I'll get back to you next week.

00:06:57.454 --> 00:06:58.151
Okay.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.808
All right. time's up.
What's my homework?

00:07:02.938 --> 00:07:04.592
[Dr. Jones] Your homework
is to really spend some time

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:07.377
and find the answer
to what I asked you.

00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:08.117
[Gabe] Which is what?

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:11.077
What makes Gabe happy?

00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:13.253
-I don't know.
-[Dr. Jones] I know.

00:07:13.383 --> 00:07:15.255
That's why it's your homework.

00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:18.127
-See you next Wednesday?
-See you next Wednesday.

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:20.739
[elevator dings]

00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:23.655
Nice kicks.

[upbeat music playing on piano]

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.406
Hey. hon. Hi.

00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:39.105
-How was your session?
-[Alec] Fine.

00:07:42.717 --> 00:07:43.588
Good.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:47.592
Good. Glad to hear that.

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:50.725
Well. I hope you're hungry
because Wednesday's--

00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:53.119
Humpty hamburger day. I know.

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:54.163
Well...

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.034
[door opens]

00:07:56.513 --> 00:07:58.994
Hey. there champ!
How's your session. huh?

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.387
[grunting]

00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:02.781
-Fine.
-Fine. yeah.

00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:05.174
It was.
That's what I like to hear. huh.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:07.481
I'm going to go to my room
and work on my homework

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.396
until dinner is ready.
Is that okay?

00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:11.180
Yeah. you don't need to ask
permission to do your homework.

00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:13.095
Just do me a favor
and keep the door open.

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:14.880
[door closes]

00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:20.668
-It smells good in here.
-Hmm.

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:21.582
[Randy] We have any hamburgers.

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.159
[teacher] That's a really
good job. Alec. Keep it up.

00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:39.905
That's really good.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.434
Okay. everybody. tomorrow we're
going to talk about

00:08:47.564 --> 00:08:49.828
how all the slaves were freed
by Harriet Tubman.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:54.180
Have a good lunch. Bye.

00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:03.798
Hey. dick-breath.

00:09:05.408 --> 00:09:06.975
Leave me alone. Jason.

00:09:07.106 --> 00:09:09.064
I'll do whatever I want
dick-breath. my dad's a cop.

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.372
-My name's Alec.
-[Jason] It used to be.

00:09:12.502 --> 00:09:14.679
Then I changed it
to dick-breath

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:18.160
and now.
now. it's shithead.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.945
I'm pretty sure it's still Alec.

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:22.556
Nope. definitely shithead.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:23.731
[Alec] Ow!

00:09:23.862 --> 00:09:25.733

[upbeat music playing]

00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:44.317
[Gabe] Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
That's good. That's good.

00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:46.667
That's what I'm talking about.
Right. well done. everybody.

00:09:46.798 --> 00:09:48.887
You know what the time
is not for you. That's okay.

00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:51.237
Yes. good job.

There we go.

Everybody get some water.
real quick. real quick.

00:10:05.164 --> 00:10:07.688
Let's go. Good job.
Good job. Good job. Well done.

00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:11.387
[sighs]

00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:16.088
You know I started following her
on Instagram.

00:10:16.218 --> 00:10:18.003
She posted a throwback Thursday

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:20.396
and she's had that butt
since she was a teenager.

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.271
Just a perfect butt
like Kim and Chloe.

00:10:26.663 --> 00:10:27.752
It's not fucking fair.

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:30.667
I don't...

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.191
I don't think their butts
are real.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.063
Whatever.

00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:36.499
What do you even know
about butts anyway?

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:42.331
[woman 1] Ouch!

00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:44.029
Why. what's wrong?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:47.554
Oh. it's just my hamstrings
are really tight today.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.644
Do you want to stretch it out
for me?

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.298
Uh. yeah. Sure.

00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:53.734
You know. you don't want to
play around with hammies.

00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:55.518
[woman 1] Right. Thank you.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:58.652
It's just you are so good
at this.

00:10:59.914 --> 00:11:02.482
Yeah. do you. um.
do you do home sessions?

00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:08.749
All right. I think you're good.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.055
[Gabe] Women are full of shit.
Doc.

00:11:11.578 --> 00:11:13.406
I know we're not allowed
to say it now. but it's true.

00:11:13.536 --> 00:11:15.364
Talking about.
"My hamstring's hurt."

00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:17.627
I knew there wasn't nothing
wrong with her damn hamstrings.

00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:19.238
You want to have a seat. Gabe?

00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:22.589
Like. like nobody's happy
in a relationship. Nobody.

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:25.940
Why. why is she getting married
if she's out doing that. huh?

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.507
I'll tell you why
'cause nobody's happy.

00:11:27.637 --> 00:11:29.944
She's not happy.

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:33.382
She's only getting married
'cause that's what society
tells you got to do.

00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:36.646
You go out. you marry somebody
you barely tolerate.

00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:39.606
you have some badass kids
to overcompensate.

00:11:39.736 --> 00:11:42.783
then they grow up move out
the house. they stop calling you

00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:44.567
and now you're stuck
with this person

00:11:44.698 --> 00:11:46.874
who you didn't even like
for the rest of your dying days.

00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:48.354
Oh. wait!
Unless you want to get a divorce

00:11:48.484 --> 00:11:50.312
and then they just
take half your shit.

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:53.011
Oh. and even better. now you get
to watch the kids grow up

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:55.752
and make the same
stupid-ass mistakes you did.

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.189
And then you've just.
you just got to lie to them

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:59.147
and say stuff like.
"It'll get better."

00:11:59.278 --> 00:12:01.106
Really. what you should say is.

00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:03.456
"I never should have
gotten married. or had your ass.

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:05.893
or stayed at my job
as long as I did.

00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:08.026
And now. I'm fat and old
and nobody cares

00:12:08.156 --> 00:12:09.984
and just fucking
everybody's stupid."

00:12:12.595 --> 00:12:13.553
[sighs]

00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:20.299
[Dr. Jones] Are there any solid
examples of love in your life?

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:23.998
Yeah. yeah.
I love Twix ice cream bars.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:25.739
And I'm being serious. Gabe.

00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:34.008
Okay. my parents have been
married for 35 years

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:37.272
and love each other so much.
they sleep in separate bedrooms.

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:40.362
I've never even seen
my parents kiss.

00:12:42.582 --> 00:12:44.236
You know what my mom did
last week

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:45.541
to show my pops
how much she loved him?

00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:48.501
She purposely didn't pay
the cable bill

00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:51.286
just so he missed game five
of the finals.

00:12:52.374 --> 00:12:54.724
How's that for a solid
example of love?

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.510
Do you think you and Millie will
end up this way.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.641
just like your parents?

00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:03.255
[Gabe] 'm just saying
like "Love ain't enough. Doc."

00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.213
And whatever love they had
is long gone.

00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:08.434
My mom should have left my
father years ago and she didn't.

00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:10.131
so now she resents him.

00:13:10.262 --> 00:13:12.394
And my dad.
he's guilty about some shit

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.005
that happened a long time ago.

00:13:14.135 --> 00:13:16.050
so whatever nonsense
my mother puts him through.

00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:17.878
he just thinks he deserves it.

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.314
So. he won't leave either.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.708
Like I said. everybody's stupid.

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:26.626
Is it possible that that's a
reason why you revealed to me

00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:30.369
that you tend to
drive relationships away?

00:13:30.499 --> 00:13:35.809
I'm saying like what if Millie
is really happy with me

00:13:37.637 --> 00:13:40.074
and I'm really happy with her
and everything is great

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:44.122
and she still goes out and
fuck's a trainer from LA Fitness

00:13:44.252 --> 00:13:45.297
and let's my cable get cut off?

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.648
There are plenty of
happy relationships out there.

00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:49.562
You've got to water the garden.

00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:51.259
There...

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.958
It can be fun if you're doing it
with the right person.

00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:56.090
It just takes work.

00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:57.526
What? No!

00:13:57.657 --> 00:13:59.659
I hate when people say
that shit.

00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:01.661
Relationships take work.
No. they don't.

00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:03.489
You know what takes work?

00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:05.143
Work. right?

00:14:05.273 --> 00:14:07.232
I don't wanna go to work
and come home

00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:09.103
and work on some more shit.
No. no. no.

00:14:09.234 --> 00:14:11.410
I want my relationship
to be anti-work.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.064
Fuck work and fuck gardens.

00:14:18.721 --> 00:14:21.637
Gabe. you know. I. um...

00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.383
did a little more research
on your dream.

00:14:29.819 --> 00:14:30.820
Elephants. right?

00:14:33.171 --> 00:14:35.129
"Elephants represent
a part of you

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.305
that may be having a tough time

00:14:37.436 --> 00:14:39.177
letting something go
from the past.

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:42.876
or that you need to be
more patient

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.399
with something or someone.

00:14:45.226 --> 00:14:47.446
Its trunk is also
a phallic symbol

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:49.796
for sexual needs and desires

00:14:49.926 --> 00:14:52.364
yours.
or perhaps someone else's."

00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:57.195
Conversely. the elephant's
introverted personality

00:14:57.325 --> 00:14:59.588
may be a reflection
of your own personality.

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.548
Okay. so what about the
weird-ass skunk on his back?

00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:04.158
[Dr. Jones] A skunk is an
interesting animal actually.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.640
A skunk's natural defense
is to repel

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.076
without causing deadly harm.

00:15:10.904 --> 00:15:15.474
So. the skunk could represent
you driving people away

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:17.345
or turning them off.

00:15:19.347 --> 00:15:21.567
Okay. So why was the elephant
running so fast down the hill?

00:15:21.697 --> 00:15:22.394
I don't know. Gabe.

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.616
Maybe things are moving
a little too quickly for you.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:34.841
Maybe things are
getting out of control

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:38.584
and you don't like not being
in control. so what do you do?

00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:43.502
You self-sabotage so no one else
can do it for you.

00:15:44.894 --> 00:15:45.852
You repel.

00:15:46.983 --> 00:15:48.637
It's a form of control
in and of itself.

00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:52.989
It's like the student
who doesn't study for an exam

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.949
and then he gets an F
and then he convinces himself

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.038
that it's only because
he didn't study

00:15:58.169 --> 00:15:59.344
that he received
a failing grade.

00:16:00.997 --> 00:16:02.434
not because
he didn't know the material.

00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:07.613
Failure to try
because of fear of failure

00:16:09.223 --> 00:16:10.529
is worse than
trying and failing.

00:16:12.487 --> 00:16:13.880
Whatever fears you have.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.622
whatever thoughts
you're holding on to.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.713
you have to find a way
to let them go.

00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:27.415
Okay.

00:16:29.504 --> 00:16:30.505
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:16:36.076 --> 00:16:37.338
Damn. little man.
What happened to your kicks?

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.387
I don't know. I guess
I must have got them dirty

00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:43.301
playing with my friends.

00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:44.563
Huh.

00:16:44.693 --> 00:16:45.999
Soap. water.
a little toothpaste.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.479
-it'll get it right out.
-Really?

00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:48.523
Yeah.

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:50.743
Huh.

00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:53.572
-[Joanne] Good to know.
-Yeah.

00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:56.488
[elevator dings]

00:16:59.012 --> 00:17:00.318
[announcer 1 on TV] They meet
in the center of the ring

00:17:00.448 --> 00:17:03.059
and here we go.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.020
Alvarez. Walker.
I think this fight is gonna...

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.109
It's gonna be done
in the early round.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.807
I think Alvarez is going to take Walker in the early round.

00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:13.679
I know it's a five-round fight.

00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:16.247
but I'm saying this round one
is going to be his round.

00:17:16.377 --> 00:17:17.944
It's classic Alvarez.

00:17:18.074 --> 00:17:20.076
And then round two
is going to be a--

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:22.166
[announcer 2 on TV] I fought Walker. I'm telling you

00:17:22.296 --> 00:17:24.951
he's going to drag this thing
to five.

00:17:25.081 --> 00:17:26.648
He's going to drag it to five.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.737
He's got power in his hands

00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:30.522
and he's going to
knock this boy out.

00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:32.480
[announcer 1]
You may just be right.

00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:35.962
Your fight with Alvarez is what Walker was watching all camp.

00:17:36.092 --> 00:17:38.182
You have the best shot
with Alvarez.

00:17:38.312 --> 00:17:40.880
I know Walker was looking
at your fight

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.491
and thinking
the exact same thing.

00:17:43.622 --> 00:17:47.669
But I believe Alvarez. he is a Brazilian Ju-Jitsu black belt.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.108
He is good at his job and there is no one more comfortable

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.850
in the middle of an octagon
than Alvarez.

00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:56.939
[announcer 2] Walker is going to
be right there in the middle.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.767
every single time.

00:17:58.898 --> 00:18:02.118
He's gonna be able to take
all of Alvarez's shots.

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:04.033
I'm telling you
this is going to go five.

00:18:04.164 --> 00:18:05.731
[announcer 1] And there's a
really great kick by Walker

00:18:05.861 --> 00:18:08.037
and Alvarez is hurt.
Alvarez is hurt.

00:18:08.168 --> 00:18:09.952
He is visibly hurt.

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:11.824
[announcer 2] He's got him
on the cage. He's got him...

00:18:11.954 --> 00:18:13.869
And this is where Walker
is really damaged 'cause...

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.871
[announcer 1] And you can see
Alvarez really trying

00:18:16.002 --> 00:18:17.743
to compensate for that pain.

00:18:17.873 --> 00:18:18.570
[announcer 2]
He feels the--

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.443
[calm music playing]

00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:27.492
Man. I don't know what
you had me doing last time.

00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:28.449
but I'm still sore.

00:18:29.189 --> 00:18:30.930
I could barely lift my guitar.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.105
-Work?
-[Patrick] Yeah.

00:18:33.454 --> 00:18:36.109
What was it?
The super spi... Super spina?

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.502
Supraspinatus.

00:18:37.632 --> 00:18:39.939
-Super spi... Spina...
-Supraspinatus.

00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:41.462
Supraspinatus.

00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:42.594
Uh. it's great.

00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:43.508
[grunts]

00:18:45.423 --> 00:18:46.685
So. how's your business going?
It's good?

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.862
Uh. yeah. Yeah. it's good.

00:18:49.992 --> 00:18:51.516
Just trying to get some
new clients

00:18:51.646 --> 00:18:53.648
and. you know. get the word out.
but. yeah. it's good.

00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:55.215
[Patrick] That's great.
Well. just let me know

00:18:55.346 --> 00:18:56.869
if there's anything else
you need me to do.

00:18:56.999 --> 00:18:57.739
more money or anything.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.959
I got you.

00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:01.787
Oh. no. no.
You've done more than enough.

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:05.051
Yeah. well. anything
for a friend of Millie's.

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:09.229
How is she doing by the way?
She's still taking pictures?

00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:11.753
She's got such a great eye.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.494
Yeah. no.
She's. uh. she's great.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.975
She's started taking
a new photography class.

00:19:16.105 --> 00:19:17.629
Pictures are getting
better and better.

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.195
-[Patrick] Oh. good.
-Yeah. now she's great.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:22.938
So. I just bought
this green earth energy company

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:24.897
that helps turn old straws
and bottle caps

00:19:25.027 --> 00:19:26.638
into cars and houses.

00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:29.467
We're gonna launch it in
Portugal before our next tour.

00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:32.731
I was thinking about
asking Millie to be

00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.689
the artistic director
for the campaign.

00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:38.432
-You think she'd be into that?
-Wow. to...

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:40.956
-Wow. in Portugal.
-Yeah.

00:19:41.087 --> 00:19:42.262
-To go with you?
-Yeah.

00:19:42.393 --> 00:19:43.350
Well. she took all
these pictures.

00:19:43.481 --> 00:19:45.091
I took a year off

00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:48.224
and she and I went backpacking
around the world.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.097
all we had was what was
in our packs. in our pockets.

00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:53.317
Here. check this out.

00:19:55.275 --> 00:19:57.233
-Shot this in Bali.
-Hmm.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:58.757
Have you been to Bali?

00:19:58.887 --> 00:19:59.888
-Uh. no.
-It's amazing.

00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:03.022
And then. um.
well. she caught this one

00:20:03.152 --> 00:20:04.458
when we were on a sailboat
in Jakarta.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.634
Have you ever been to Indonesia?

00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:07.548
No.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.770
You got to travel. Gabe.
See the world. it's incredible.

00:20:13.902 --> 00:20:15.251
Here this one's my favorite.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:19.255
So. we got caught
in a massive storm in Tahiti

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.648
and we weren't able to
leave that tent for two days.

00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:24.826
-Millie.
-Okay. here we go.

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:25.740
-Workout time.
-Oh. sorry.

00:20:25.871 --> 00:20:27.612
-Yep.
-Um...

00:20:27.742 --> 00:20:29.570
-Yep. yep. you got it.
-Oh-ho-ho-ho.

00:20:32.051 --> 00:20:35.010
[Millie] Oh. babe.
You are not gonna believe
some of the shots that I got.

00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:37.404
I finally decided to get that
new R-Adapter for my Leica.

00:20:37.535 --> 00:20:39.450
the one my cousin got me
for my birthday.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.626
It is so dope. especially
when the sun is setting.

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:44.629
-Cool.
-Oh. and guess what else?

00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:49.547
Kai got engaged.
Anthony finally proposed.

00:20:49.677 --> 00:20:52.376
He hired this whole
like flash mob to do it.

00:20:52.506 --> 00:20:54.595
so when they all started
dancing. he joined in

00:20:54.726 --> 00:20:56.510
and then he got down on one knee
and popped the question.

00:20:56.641 --> 00:20:58.512
Kai almost fainted.
it was so cute.

00:20:59.644 --> 00:21:00.384
I got it on video
if you want to see it.

00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:03.430
Okay.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.694
What is it?

00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:08.435
Is Marc trying to steal
another one of your clients?

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:10.916
I told you he's gonna keep doing
that if you don't say something.

00:21:11.046 --> 00:21:11.786
That's nothing.

00:21:13.614 --> 00:21:14.528
[Millie] Okay. you know
I know you too well for that.

00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:17.444
Okay. look. if you wanted
something different.

00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:18.402
I could have made
something different.

00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:20.621
Nope.

00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:22.928
Gabe. what is it?

00:21:26.584 --> 00:21:27.846
Why'd you have to introduce me
to him?

00:21:31.589 --> 00:21:33.765
No. Gabe. Come on.

00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:35.506
-Please.
-I just can't figure it out.

00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:38.334
-I cannot figure it out.
-Okay. look.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.032
we have been over this
a thousand times.

00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:43.688
He's an old friend that I knew
long before you.

00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:45.211
mind you.
and I thought I could help.

00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:46.560
You said you were over this.

00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:48.432
Yeah. well. clearly.
I'm not over it

00:21:48.562 --> 00:21:49.998
'cause this is what not over
it looks like.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.045
I mean. what.
like what were you thinking?

00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:55.961
Right. like how could I make
some not awkward shit

00:21:56.091 --> 00:21:57.397
as awkward as possible?

00:21:57.528 --> 00:21:58.964
Oh. I know. light bulb.

00:21:59.094 --> 00:22:01.096
I'll introduce the guy
I'm currently dating

00:22:01.227 --> 00:22:04.230
to my rich. successful.
ex-fiancÃ©.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.579
right. who's the rock star.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.363
And then they can do business
together.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.061
Yeah. that's genius.

00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:10.279
Gabe will like that.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.978
Yeah. that's exactly what it is.

00:22:13.108 --> 00:22:14.762
I spend all of my time trying to
figure out how to piss you off.

00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:16.285
Come on.

00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:18.200
I did it for you.
You were trying to

00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:19.375
get your personal training
business off the ground.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:20.507
and you needed the money.

00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:23.249
-To the a-hole.
-What?

00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:24.816
What are you talking about?

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:27.383
He does free concerts
all over the world.

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:29.211
He donates half of his money
to not-for-profits

00:22:29.342 --> 00:22:30.735
that go directly to women.
children. and Africa.

00:22:30.865 --> 00:22:32.780
Yeah. tax write-off.

00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:35.087
White celebrities always do that
shit when they wanna look cool.

00:22:35.217 --> 00:22:37.916
Go off. adopt a little African
baby. fuck his hair all up.

00:22:38.046 --> 00:22:39.744
take dumb pictures of him.

00:22:39.874 --> 00:22:41.528
That shit ain't cool.
Don't make you a good person.

00:22:42.703 --> 00:22:43.574
You know this is not fair.

00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:47.752
Do I grill you about all the
women you've been with. huh?

00:22:47.882 --> 00:22:48.927
I mean. you really want to open
that can of worms

00:22:49.057 --> 00:22:50.363
'cause I don't think that
you do.

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:51.843
[scoffs]
I'm a little scared to ask

00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:53.584
where you've been
or what you've been doing

00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.499
since we've been on another one
of our little breaks.

00:22:55.629 --> 00:22:56.804
Oh. you want to know
the difference. though.

00:22:56.935 --> 00:22:58.763
I didn't love any of them

00:22:58.893 --> 00:23:00.112
and it's different with you.
too. and you know it.

00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:02.114
Okay. Gabe. Gabe. baby.

00:23:04.812 --> 00:23:05.813
You. you've got to stop.

00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:13.299
I'm not with him. I am...
I'm trying to be with you.

00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:16.171
Patrick and I are just friends.
That is it.

00:23:16.302 --> 00:23:18.609
No. no. You're not just friends.

00:23:18.739 --> 00:23:19.958
That's your ex-fiancÃ©.

00:23:22.003 --> 00:23:23.614
He wants to take you on another
trip around the world somewhere.

00:23:23.744 --> 00:23:25.746
You. him. and the camera.
taking pictures of him.

00:23:25.877 --> 00:23:27.835
fucking serenading a dolphin.

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:29.924
Just tell me this though. right.

00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:32.840
have we ever had sex
to one of his stupid-ass songs?

00:23:32.971 --> 00:23:34.450
-Huh. we probably have--
-Oh. fuck you. Gabe!

00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:35.495
Yeah. it's fucked up.

00:23:36.496 --> 00:23:37.845
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

00:23:37.976 --> 00:23:40.805
I mean you got me on this
twisted ass yo-yo.

00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:42.676
breaking up with me
because you say you need space

00:23:42.807 --> 00:23:45.505
and just when you're done having
space and done pouting about it.

00:23:45.636 --> 00:23:47.725
we start hanging out again.
working to get back together

00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:49.074
and then you pick a fight
with me

00:23:49.204 --> 00:23:50.902
over the same old fucking shit
over again

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:52.730
just so you can break up
with me.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.732
I mean. you know what. light
bulb. you're fucking awkward.

00:23:54.862 --> 00:23:56.342
so don't put your shit on me.
okay?

00:23:56.472 --> 00:23:58.083
I mean say what you want
about Patrick

00:23:58.213 --> 00:24:00.738
but the only person who
makes me feel this low is you.

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:04.524
Nah. nigga.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.484
[door closes]

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:22.629
Alec. hey. Alec.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.979
We need you to come down to
the principal's office with us.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.024
real quick.

00:24:26.154 --> 00:24:27.591
Would that be okay?

00:24:27.721 --> 00:24:29.244
Would you come with us?

00:24:30.332 --> 00:24:33.161
[upbeat music playing]

00:24:55.357 --> 00:24:58.491
What happened. Alec? Hmm?

00:25:00.406 --> 00:25:01.581
Please talk to me.

00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:05.280
What happened at school today.
honey?

00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:08.283
Why did you do that?

00:25:10.764 --> 00:25:11.765
[Randy] You know what.
you don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:13.201
but that's
what Wednesdays are for.

00:25:13.332 --> 00:25:15.073
You can let it all out with. uh.
Dr. Isaacs.

00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:16.074
We're almost there.

00:25:17.858 --> 00:25:19.599
Two. I even got you some
extra time for this session.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.255
so you just take all the time
you need to be good to go. okay?

00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:25.474
Turn around.
Just turn around. okay.

00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:26.780
Turn around.
Everything's going to be okay.

00:25:26.911 --> 00:25:28.216
Just keep facing the way
I'm facing him

00:25:28.347 --> 00:25:29.217
and everything's
going to be fine.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.442
[car door closes]

00:25:42.622 --> 00:25:44.537
I just don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do. Randy.

00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:45.843
There's something
wrong with him.

00:25:45.973 --> 00:25:48.628
There's something wrong
with our son

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.586
and I knew it since he came out.

00:25:50.717 --> 00:25:52.458
No. don't say that.
He's just a little different.

00:25:52.588 --> 00:25:54.460
I was quiet when I was his age.
I'm fine. okay.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.027
I turned out fine.
He's going to be fine.

00:25:56.157 --> 00:25:57.376
He's just.
he's going through a phase.

00:25:57.506 --> 00:25:58.812
he needs a little coaxing
out of his shell.

00:25:58.943 --> 00:26:00.684
but he's strong.
my boy's a strong boy.

00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:01.597
-[Joanne] My mother was right.
-[Randy] Hmm?

00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:03.382
This is all my fault.

00:26:03.512 --> 00:26:04.949
You mother's not right
about anything. Joanne. ever.

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:06.472
-Oh. Randy!
-I'm sorry.

00:26:08.953 --> 00:26:10.955
You know he could have killed
that child. Do you know that?

00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:12.434
Do you understand that
he could have killed him?

00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:15.002
I mean. this is how
serial killers get started

00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:16.308
and there are always
warning signs.

00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:17.918
big glaring warning signs.

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:20.399
What if this is it?
What if Alec is a serial killer?

00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:22.357
What would we do then?

00:26:22.488 --> 00:26:25.012
We will love him just the same
as long as he doesn't kill us.

00:26:25.143 --> 00:26:26.405
-[Joanne] Randy!
-I'm sorry.

00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:30.670
Look. just relax. Relax.

00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:33.891
I tell you what. let's go
to the farmers' market.

00:26:34.021 --> 00:26:35.980
Is there one today?

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.895
We're gonna find one. I'm gonna
find a fucking farmers' market.

00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:43.770
[suspenseful music playing]

00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:58.829
How are you feeling today?

00:27:02.049 --> 00:27:03.268
It's fair to say you seem down.

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:06.750
Well. 10 points for you.

00:27:08.926 --> 00:27:10.362
Have you seen my wallet?
Did I leave it here?

00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:11.450
I did. I left it out.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.846
Would you like to talk about it?

00:27:15.976 --> 00:27:16.847
What's to talk about?

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:20.459
Things are just fucked up
with Millie.

00:27:22.069 --> 00:27:23.679
We'll just let it go
at this point.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.594
Um. yeah. That's a wrap.

00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:26.900
But where the fuck is my wallet?

00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:33.472
[Dr. Jones] Why don't you
tell me what happened?

00:27:34.995 --> 00:27:35.735
Are you married. Doc?

00:27:38.172 --> 00:27:41.480
Well. I'm not here to talk
about my life. Gabe.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.742
Okay. that's not what
you pay me for.

00:27:42.873 --> 00:27:44.613
I'm here to talk about yours.

00:27:44.744 --> 00:27:47.703
Okay. well. my life sucks.
fade out. the end.

00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.662
Can we just... Can we talk about
something else?

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:52.273
I don't think your life sucks
from my personal perspective.

00:27:54.014 --> 00:27:56.887
Look. you're alive.
you're physically healthy.

00:27:57.017 --> 00:27:59.672
you have the beginnings
of a successful business.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:02.066
You have a lot of things that
people work very hard for.

00:28:03.719 --> 00:28:05.896
I can. uh... I can get your
supraspinatus right as fuck.

00:28:11.162 --> 00:28:15.079
[Dr. Jones] Have you given
any more thought
to what makes Gabe happy?

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:17.037
Yeah. yeah.

00:28:17.168 --> 00:28:19.083
Twix ice cream bars. remember?

00:28:20.562 --> 00:28:21.607
Where the fuck is my wallet?

00:28:21.737 --> 00:28:22.564
-Gabe?
-[Gabe] What?

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:31.356
Okay. I got to tell you
something.

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:33.837
Oh. wonderful!
What are you... Okay.

00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:41.627
I'm damn good at my job.

00:28:43.107 --> 00:28:45.587
I graduated top of my class.
I built my own practice.

00:28:45.718 --> 00:28:46.806
Yeah. I don't see
what any of that

00:28:46.937 --> 00:28:48.286
has to do with me.
This is my time.

00:28:48.416 --> 00:28:50.854
It is quite evident to me
that you're full of shit.

00:28:52.116 --> 00:28:54.118
Wow! Wow!

00:28:54.248 --> 00:28:56.381
Yeah. you know. I definitely
don't pay you for that.

00:28:56.511 --> 00:28:59.950
No. You think you pay me
to come in here.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.778
listen to your problems.
and empathize with you.

00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:06.391
And you want a gold star
because you're a black man

00:29:06.521 --> 00:29:09.220
who took the difficult
but necessary step

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.613
to seek treatment
and better himself.

00:29:11.744 --> 00:29:14.790
You want to be commended

00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:17.271
because you think you're
coming in here and opening up.
but you're not.

00:29:18.577 --> 00:29:20.884
What you really pay me for

00:29:22.233 --> 00:29:25.584
is to unlock
a much deeper part of yourself

00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:28.804
that is yearning to come out.
but that's impossible because.

00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:30.067
well. you keep lying
to yourself.

00:29:33.157 --> 00:29:34.810
So. go ahead. Keep it all in.

00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:36.943
Bullshit me all you want.

00:29:37.074 --> 00:29:39.163
I'll gladly keep taking
your money.

00:29:39.293 --> 00:29:41.513
I rather enjoy
eating at Mastro's

00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:45.082
but in the long run
it does you no good.

00:29:45.996 --> 00:29:47.171
Hey. how much does my insurance
pay you?

00:29:47.301 --> 00:29:48.389
A lot.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.609
Yeah. damn. Obamacare. right.

00:29:52.263 --> 00:29:53.307
Whatever. okay.

00:29:53.438 --> 00:29:55.353
I am honest.

00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:57.355
No. no. you're not.

00:29:57.485 --> 00:30:00.010
See. you come here
week after week

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.229
and you say you're tired
of the same game

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.883
you've been playing
your whole adult life.

00:30:06.146 --> 00:30:09.628
Gabe. you have a woman
who's ready

00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:11.673
for what you say
you're ready for.

00:30:13.675 --> 00:30:15.547
but instead of being a man
and putting in the work.

00:30:17.114 --> 00:30:20.378
you waste time
betting and investing

00:30:20.508 --> 00:30:23.947
in senseless relationships
just to prove the point

00:30:24.077 --> 00:30:26.950
that there are no
sustainable relationships.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.865
More failed tests
that you refuse to study for

00:30:31.171 --> 00:30:31.955
and the more you fail.

00:30:33.782 --> 00:30:36.133
the more you weave
this tangled web.

00:30:36.263 --> 00:30:38.091
Yeah. like a retarded
Spider-Man.

00:30:38.222 --> 00:30:40.572
Hey. keep telling your jokes.
You want to know what else?

00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:41.399
-No.
-You're hurt.

00:30:44.184 --> 00:30:44.880
You're afraid.

00:30:48.406 --> 00:30:49.276
Of what?

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.106
Well. you don't want to end up
like your father

00:30:53.237 --> 00:30:54.629
and you definitely
don't want to end up

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.240
with a woman like your mother.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.503
So. there's rock
and a hard place and you.

00:31:01.332 --> 00:31:02.681
You want to know what else?
You're hurt.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.687
You don't even know how to cope
with what's hurting you.

00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:12.647
You're so scared that
if you let your guard down

00:31:12.778 --> 00:31:17.522
and you let someone in and they
see you. they see the real you.

00:31:17.652 --> 00:31:20.873
flaws and all. you're scared
that they will still love you.

00:31:23.528 --> 00:31:25.965
And you don't think
you deserve that love

00:31:26.096 --> 00:31:27.575
because you live in the world

00:31:27.706 --> 00:31:29.925
where you are constantly told
that you don't.

00:31:32.276 --> 00:31:33.190
I'm here to tell you
that you do.

00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:37.498
You deserve that love.

00:31:39.805 --> 00:31:40.762
You deserve to be happy.

00:31:46.812 --> 00:31:47.856
but you have to believe that.

00:31:50.207 --> 00:31:51.121
Time's up.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.038
Yeah. I'm tired of hearing
you talk anyway.

00:31:56.691 --> 00:32:00.304
[tranquil music playing]

00:32:02.132 --> 00:32:04.221
[panting]

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:06.527
[elevator dings]

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:13.230
[calm music playing]

00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:33.032
What's up little man?
What you doing?

00:32:33.163 --> 00:32:33.859
Just sitting.

00:32:35.513 --> 00:32:36.644
Where's your grandmother?

00:32:36.775 --> 00:32:39.125
She forgot to pick me up.
She's old.

00:32:39.256 --> 00:32:43.216
Huh. well.
how you gonna get home?

00:32:45.436 --> 00:32:46.350
I don't know.

00:32:47.351 --> 00:32:48.569
I mean. do you live far
from here?

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.224
I mean. I can give you a ride.

00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:52.617
Nay. I don't want to bother you.
Mister.

00:32:55.489 --> 00:32:57.012
-Yo. what are you doing?
-Hitch-hiking.

00:32:58.231 --> 00:32:59.580
It's what they do in the movies.

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:02.714
Yo. listen. No. nobody does that
anymore. man.

00:33:02.844 --> 00:33:05.412
Look. it's cool. Just... I can
give you a ride home. Yeah?

00:33:05.543 --> 00:33:06.370
-Okay.
-All right. come on.

00:33:11.897 --> 00:33:15.466
[Gabe] No. no. Get in the front
seat. the front seat. the front.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.304
-Oh. I'm Gabe by the way.
-Alec.

00:33:27.434 --> 00:33:28.609
That way you're not roaming
with a stranger.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.263
-Right.
-Put your seat back. relax.

00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:33.832
So. where to?

00:33:33.962 --> 00:33:37.792
Um. go out--
Go up here and make a left.

00:33:48.499 --> 00:33:50.762
Oh. so. uh. how long have you
been in therapy?

00:33:50.892 --> 00:33:52.807
Oh. it's about three
to four months.

00:33:52.938 --> 00:33:54.244
Pretty new.
How about you?

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.247
Two years.

00:33:57.377 --> 00:33:59.205
Two years?
How old are you?

00:33:59.336 --> 00:34:01.425
-Nine.
-Nine?

00:34:01.555 --> 00:34:03.905
Man. when I was nine.
I was running around outside.

00:34:04.036 --> 00:34:06.908
getting bit by mosquitoes.
playing with my friends.

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:09.084
Kids need way more of that
these days. Fuck therapy.

00:34:10.608 --> 00:34:12.784
-Pardon my language.
-It's okay.

00:34:12.914 --> 00:34:14.394
I say that word sometimes.

00:34:14.525 --> 00:34:15.961
Oh. you do?

00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:18.311
Yeah. my parents
don't know though.

00:34:19.443 --> 00:34:21.053
I say a bunch of words.

00:34:22.097 --> 00:34:23.229
They think I'm real quiet.

00:34:24.317 --> 00:34:25.492
I don't know why.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.147
I guess I just don't
talk to them.

00:34:29.322 --> 00:34:30.410
It's about how it usually goes.

00:34:35.067 --> 00:34:37.156
Oh. make a right here.

00:34:42.596 --> 00:34:43.945
Do you have any rap music?

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.426
What do you know
about rap music?

00:34:46.557 --> 00:34:47.688
I like it.

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:49.734
My neighbor Tommy.

00:34:49.864 --> 00:34:51.126
His older brother likes
rap music.

00:34:53.346 --> 00:34:55.174
We used to sneak in his room
and listen to it.

00:34:55.305 --> 00:34:56.915
I think I'll be a great rapper.

00:34:57.785 --> 00:34:59.396
-[laughs] You know how to spit?
-Yeah.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.835
No. No. man. That's... Not spit.

00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:06.098
Spit like. like freestyle.

00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.534
You know. make it up as you go.

00:35:07.665 --> 00:35:10.320
Yeah. oh. yeah. Yeah. yeah.
I'm the best.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.974
-Really?
-Yeah. I'm the best in my class.

00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:14.498
Okay. well. you know what.
let's see what you got.

00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:16.630
[rap music playing]

00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:18.023
Okay. yeah.

00:35:18.153 --> 00:35:19.242
Do something.
do something with that.

00:35:21.418 --> 00:35:25.335
Oh. okay. You got a mic too.
huh? Okay. Yeah.

00:35:25.509 --> 00:35:29.252
âª It's me. Alec
A.L.E.C. ridin' in a carâª

00:35:29.426 --> 00:35:31.515
âª Going real fast
Making it rainâª

00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:32.516
âª Twerk something. yeah âª

00:35:32.646 --> 00:35:35.432
Okay. yeah. No. No. No.

00:35:35.562 --> 00:35:39.218
Stop. Stop it. Stop.
Stop that.

00:35:40.437 --> 00:35:41.438
[Alec] I thought
I was doing good though.

00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:43.004
Nah. you thought wrong.

00:35:43.135 --> 00:35:45.006
Just. you know what?

00:35:45.137 --> 00:35:48.227
When you think about rapping.
just don't. you know.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.186
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:35:54.538 --> 00:35:56.409
-[Alec] Start slowing down.
-[Gabe] Over here?

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.149
[Alec] Right over there. yeah.

00:36:00.674 --> 00:36:03.329
Well. all right. little man.
It's fun hanging with you.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.896
Yeah. okay.

00:36:05.026 --> 00:36:06.376
See you next Wednesday?

00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.247
-Yep. okay.
-Cool.

00:36:08.378 --> 00:36:10.989
Wait. okay. could you just
wait here so I make it in okay?

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:11.816
Yeah. sure.

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:25.960
[cellphone dings]

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:27.658
[sighs]

00:36:41.411 --> 00:36:43.413
Wait. what's wrong? Nobody home?

00:36:44.457 --> 00:36:47.112
Yeah. nobody's there.

00:36:47.242 --> 00:36:50.333
Probably thought my grandma's
gonna take me to her house

00:36:50.463 --> 00:36:51.899
-and. yeah.
-Oh!

00:36:53.423 --> 00:36:54.728
Well. what time do your parents
normally get home?

00:36:54.859 --> 00:36:55.729
Around 6:00.

00:36:57.122 --> 00:36:58.341
That is...
It's just after 3:00.

00:37:00.038 --> 00:37:01.126
I can't leave you out here
for like three hours.

00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:04.216
Are you hungry?

00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:05.826
I'm starving.

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.002
Didn't really get to finish
my lunch at school.

00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:10.091
All right.
Well. I left my wallet at home.

00:37:10.222 --> 00:37:12.616
but I got about 17 bucks.

00:37:13.486 --> 00:37:14.922
Let's see what we can get
with that?

00:37:15.053 --> 00:37:16.271
-Deal?
-Deal.

00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:17.751
All right.

00:37:18.883 --> 00:37:21.189
[car engine revs]

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.629
[upbeat music playing]

00:37:32.026 --> 00:37:33.854
[Gabe] Right. you really
were hungry. huh?

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.769
Told you. I didn't get
to finish my lunch.

00:37:37.423 --> 00:37:38.511
Never fixed your kicks
like I told you either.

00:37:40.078 --> 00:37:41.558
Nah. it's okay.

00:37:41.688 --> 00:37:42.646
I'm going to get some
new ones soon.

00:37:44.604 --> 00:37:46.345
Dad said if I join
a baseball team or something.

00:37:46.476 --> 00:37:47.215
he'll give me some money.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.175
He thinks team sports
will help me out.

00:37:51.872 --> 00:37:53.265
I used to play baseball
when I was a kid.

00:37:54.614 --> 00:37:56.224
I hated defense. but I loved
hitting things with a bat.

00:37:57.748 --> 00:37:59.053
I still go to the batting cages
to this day when I'm stressed.

00:38:00.228 --> 00:38:01.882
-You fast?
-I'm okay.

00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:05.277
You know what?
Be a pitcher.

00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:06.931
You don't have to be fast
to be a pitcher

00:38:07.061 --> 00:38:07.932
and you make more money.

00:38:10.064 --> 00:38:11.239
I don't like throwing
and catching.

00:38:12.327 --> 00:38:13.241
Well. maybe you shouldn't
play baseball.

00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:16.680
I really just want
some new shoes.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:17.768
[cellphone vibrates]

00:38:17.898 --> 00:38:19.291
Oh. crap.

00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:20.423
[cellphone beeps]

00:38:21.598 --> 00:38:22.512
[clicks tongue]

00:38:23.208 --> 00:38:26.994
Wait! Is that Patty Nelson?

00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:28.735
Yeah. that's Patty Nelson.

00:38:28.866 --> 00:38:30.824
You're friends

00:38:38.658 --> 00:38:39.485
How'd you get that bruise?

00:38:40.617 --> 00:38:41.487
Your parents did that to you?

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.708
No way. They believe in timeouts

00:38:44.838 --> 00:38:46.318

on your hips and stuff.

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:47.450

You don't think
I'm going to do it?

-I'll do it. You did it.

00:46:43.751 --> 00:46:45.666
and I saw some love quotes
she posted

00:46:45.797 --> 00:46:47.842
and I know it was about
your dumb stupid ass.

00:46:47.973 --> 00:46:49.192
Okay. thank you very much.

00:46:49.322 --> 00:46:50.193
Now it's time for you to go.
please.

00:46:50.323 --> 00:46:51.890
Right this way. Uh-huh.

00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:53.109
Are you two still
seeing each other?

00:46:55.415 --> 00:46:57.896
It's complicated. Why?
Just go.

00:46:58.027 --> 00:46:59.854
'Cause I'm pregnant
and it's yours.

00:47:02.422 --> 00:47:04.076
-What?
-Yep. you heard me right.

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.123
Pregnant.

00:47:07.906 --> 00:47:10.474
So. what you gonna do. Gabe?

00:47:10.604 --> 00:47:13.346
You going to be a deadbeat
or are you gonna do what's best
for me and Gabe Jr.?

00:47:14.086 --> 00:47:15.435
Oh. I got to get back to work.

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:19.439
Listen. I'll be back tonight.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.094
so we can discuss
what the plan is gonna be.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.272
My mom is not going to be
happy with you

00:47:26.403 --> 00:47:27.143
but you're going to love her.

00:47:28.622 --> 00:47:30.146
Okay. I'll see you later.

00:47:36.195 --> 00:47:38.328
[door opens then closes]

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:43.420
Everything okay?

00:47:49.904 --> 00:47:50.993
Whiskey.

00:47:52.777 --> 00:47:54.300
Hey. isn't that the stuff
you were just talking about?

00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:55.562
Makes you make bad decisions.

00:47:59.175 --> 00:47:59.914
Is it any good?

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:01.960
[groans]

00:48:04.354 --> 00:48:05.311
Can I have some?

00:48:20.239 --> 00:48:21.327
[coughs]

00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:22.198
See.

00:48:23.199 --> 00:48:24.200
[sighs]

00:48:26.115 --> 00:48:29.335
If it-- if it's nasty and it
makes you make bad decisions

00:48:29.466 --> 00:48:31.381
then. um. why do you drink it?

00:48:32.686 --> 00:48:33.948
That is a good question.

00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:37.039
[sighs]

00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:40.868
Oh. fuck this shit.

00:48:47.745 --> 00:48:48.920
Oh. shit! Come on.

00:48:50.313 --> 00:48:51.357
What are you gonna do with that?

00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:52.141
Hit shit.

00:48:53.316 --> 00:48:57.885
[upbeat music playing]

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:07.678
-You're gonna hurt yourself.
-[Gabe] Just keep them coming.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.597
[panting]

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:15.338
Feel better yet?

00:49:16.774 --> 00:49:19.037
-Not really.
-[Alec] Can I try?

00:49:20.952 --> 00:49:22.475
I thought you said
you didn't like baseball.

00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:24.173
I said I didn't like the bullies
that play in the team

00:49:24.303 --> 00:49:25.739
and throwing and catching.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.654
Never said anything
about hitting.

00:49:27.785 --> 00:49:29.917
You know omission
is a form of a lie. right?

00:49:30.048 --> 00:49:30.875
Your parents ever
teach you that?

00:49:32.572 --> 00:49:34.661
So. like when you don't tell
your real girlfriend

00:49:34.792 --> 00:49:35.880
that you got another girl
pregnant.

00:49:36.837 --> 00:49:37.969
Is that like a lie?

00:49:39.057 --> 00:49:41.059
[sighs]

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.539
If my son is anything like you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:43.453
[Alec] Nobody's like me.

00:49:44.802 --> 00:49:47.109
But you just have to talk
to him. not at him.

00:49:47.979 --> 00:49:49.198
That's why I ignore my parents.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.332
That's why I go to my room
and play video games.

00:49:55.682 --> 00:49:58.816
[panting]

00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:07.825
Take that off.

00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:09.000
What are you wearing that for
anyway?

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:09.740
Put that on.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.180
Oh. yeah.

00:50:20.316 --> 00:50:22.013
How do I do this?

00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.580
You just see it and hit it.
It's pretty simple actually.

00:50:27.845 --> 00:50:29.629
-Ready?
-No.

00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:34.895
No. you got to--
you got to swing at it.

00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:36.593
I told you I wasn't ready.

00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:37.942
Well. if you stay ready.
you don't have to get ready.

00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:40.553
-Ready?
-Sure.

00:50:40.684 --> 00:50:41.641
[Gabe] Okay.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.777
I quit! I'm done.

00:50:46.907 --> 00:50:48.474
No. you can't quit.
I mean. sometimes you miss.

00:50:48.605 --> 00:50:50.259
You just do it again.
It's okay.

00:50:50.389 --> 00:50:52.565
-I don't want to try again.
-No. you have to.

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:54.045
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.

00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.612
-I don't want to do it.
-What the--

00:50:55.742 --> 00:50:57.614
-1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9--
-Hey. hey. hey. hey.

00:50:57.744 --> 00:50:59.224
Boy. what the f--
Hey. boy!

00:50:59.355 --> 00:51:00.878
You'll settle down
in this batting cage.

00:51:01.008 --> 00:51:02.619
-What's wrong with you?
-I can't do it.

00:51:02.749 --> 00:51:04.098
That's 'cause you're
running around yelling numbers

00:51:04.229 --> 00:51:04.882
and not hitting the ball.

00:51:05.012 --> 00:51:06.013
I need a timeout.

00:51:06.144 --> 00:51:07.798
Hey. fuck a timeout.

00:51:07.928 --> 00:51:09.278
You're gonna stand up here

00:51:09.408 --> 00:51:10.496
and you're gonna hit
one of these balls. okay?

00:51:11.715 --> 00:51:12.803
[Alec] Okay.

00:51:13.717 --> 00:51:14.544
[claps] Come on.

00:51:16.763 --> 00:51:17.764
Fucking timeout.

00:51:21.594 --> 00:51:24.423
Now. here we go. all right?

00:51:30.168 --> 00:51:32.997
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't go all Hulk on me.

00:51:33.127 --> 00:51:35.042
Just try again. all right?

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:36.827
You can do this.

00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:49.056
-There you go. There you go.
-Gabe. Gabe. I touched it.

00:51:49.187 --> 00:51:50.144
-Yeah. you see that?
-I did it. Did you see?

00:51:50.275 --> 00:51:52.016
Yeah. Yeah. I saw that.

00:51:52.146 --> 00:51:54.497
Right. now. see look. when life
gets hard. you don't quit.

00:51:54.627 --> 00:51:56.760
You stand in that box
and you figure it out. right?

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:57.761
[Alec] Yeah.

00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:59.676
[both panting]

00:52:04.985 --> 00:52:05.551
[Alec] What's wrong?

00:52:06.378 --> 00:52:07.292
[groans]

00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:10.556
I'm not ready to be a dad. man.

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:12.906
Not like this.

00:52:13.646 --> 00:52:15.126
You'll be a cool dad.

00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:16.562
My dad never does stuff
like this with me.

00:52:18.608 --> 00:52:19.826
[phone vibrates]

00:52:23.439 --> 00:52:24.701
It's Millie.

00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:26.529
Millie.
Is that your real girlfriend?

00:52:27.834 --> 00:52:28.574
I think so.

00:52:30.228 --> 00:52:32.404
-Should I answer?
-Yes.

00:52:33.666 --> 00:52:35.146
Okay. last question.

00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.061
Should I tell her in person
or on the phone?

00:52:39.324 --> 00:52:40.978
-Definitely in person.
-Yeah.

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:42.632
[beeps]

00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:45.548
Hello. Hey.

00:52:47.637 --> 00:52:50.248
Yeah. yeah.
I'm just finishing up
at the batting cages.

00:52:51.945 --> 00:52:53.512
Hey. I need to. um. I need to
talk to you about something.

00:52:54.687 --> 00:52:55.732
I can-- I can swing by.
Are you gonna be there?

00:52:57.864 --> 00:52:59.910
Okay. Okay.
I'll see you in a bit.

00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:07.874
-A card.
-What?

00:53:08.005 --> 00:53:10.312
Get her a card.
Girls like cards. don't they?

00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:17.101
Ow! What did you do that for?

00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:18.885
You'll thank me later in life.
I promise.

00:53:19.016 --> 00:53:20.670
Okay. I won't say.
I won't think about saying it.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.453
Boom.

00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:24.326
Here. put that on your ear.

00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:31.245
[scanner dings]

00:53:31.376 --> 00:53:32.769
Oh. oh. excuse me. sir.
Sorry. can you come back.

00:53:32.899 --> 00:53:34.510
It's just the Bing Bong.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.120
Oh. the Bing Bong
must be broken.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.904
'cause. clearly.
I just paid for this.

00:53:38.035 --> 00:53:39.732
I doubt it. man.

00:53:39.863 --> 00:53:42.692
Let me just-- All right.
if I can-- let me just--

00:53:42.822 --> 00:53:43.823
-What are you doing?
-[man 2] Make sure--

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.477
Get off me. man.
We got money.

00:53:45.608 --> 00:53:46.783
I ain't taking nothing
from this damn store.

00:53:46.913 --> 00:53:48.175
Yeah. I know you do. man.
but I just--

00:53:48.306 --> 00:53:49.046
Come on. I got to--

00:53:50.613 --> 00:53:51.788
Don't-- quit frisking me. dude.

00:53:51.918 --> 00:53:53.920
Hey. man.
let's record this shit. man.

00:53:54.051 --> 00:53:55.966
I just told you I didn't take
nothing from this damn store.

00:53:56.096 --> 00:53:57.054
I'm going to call the cops.

00:53:57.184 --> 00:53:58.272
Call-- call the cops. for what?

00:53:59.622 --> 00:54:01.537
You just saw me buy this.
I didn't do nothing.

00:54:01.667 --> 00:54:03.582
All right. well.
if you didn't do nothing
just let me frisk you. man.

00:54:03.713 --> 00:54:05.279
-Come on.
-No.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:08.631
I promise you.
if you touch me one more time.

00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:09.849
I'm going to smack the shit
out of you.

00:54:15.551 --> 00:54:16.508
[man 2] Ow.

00:54:24.037 --> 00:54:24.821
Did you see?

00:54:28.128 --> 00:54:29.608
Right? Right. I told him.

00:54:30.609 --> 00:54:31.784
Yep. I heard you tell him.

00:54:31.915 --> 00:54:33.482
Cause and effect.

00:54:33.612 --> 00:54:35.919
Totally. Totally understand.

00:54:36.876 --> 00:54:38.312
Called racist profiling.

00:54:39.052 --> 00:54:40.184
We learn about that in school.

00:54:45.232 --> 00:54:45.885
[Gabe] What?

00:54:46.973 --> 00:54:47.626
Where the--

00:54:49.628 --> 00:54:50.760
-Are you serious?
-You want some?

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.414
No. Give me that.

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:54.503
[brakes screeching]

00:54:57.897 --> 00:54:59.682
[Gabe] I'm sorry I slapped you.
kinda.

00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:01.335
But that's not why we're here.

00:55:04.469 --> 00:55:05.383
I'm saying.

00:55:07.254 --> 00:55:10.083
I took this without paying.

00:55:10.997 --> 00:55:11.694
You took it.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.871
That's-- that's why
the Bing Bong. 'cause--

00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:16.438
-'Cause you took it.
-Mm-hm. genius.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.180
Okay. so what do you want to do.
restock it or something?

00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:23.009
No. Just tell me how much it is
so I can pay for it

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.882
-and I can go about my--
-You slapped me for no reason.

00:55:26.012 --> 00:55:27.318
No. no. no.

00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:29.059
Cause and effect
got you slapped. okay?

00:55:29.189 --> 00:55:30.452
But that's not the point.

00:55:30.582 --> 00:55:32.715
Trying to teach him
a valuable lesson.

00:55:32.845 --> 00:55:34.760
Are you guys in like the Big
Brothers. Big Sisters program
or something?

00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:37.067
You know I've-- I've seen that

00:55:37.197 --> 00:55:39.243
but I've never seen
a black adult and a white kid.
It's usually like uh--

00:55:39.373 --> 00:55:41.288
Hey. I don't want you to say
extra words.

00:55:41.419 --> 00:55:42.986
Tell me how much this
fucking candy bar is

00:55:43.116 --> 00:55:44.683
so I can go about my day. okay?

00:55:44.814 --> 00:55:45.989
Well. there's no wrapper on it.
so I can't scan it.

00:55:46.119 --> 00:55:47.947
Scan another one.

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.993
If I scan another one that's
gonna be a separate transaction.

00:55:50.123 --> 00:55:51.037
So. I'm gonna have to
void this one out.

00:55:51.168 --> 00:55:52.909
So?

00:55:53.039 --> 00:55:55.433
So. my manager doesn't like
when I void things out.

00:55:55.564 --> 00:55:56.826
He's going to slap you again.

00:55:56.956 --> 00:55:58.915
Scan another bar.
tell me how much it is.

00:55:59.045 --> 00:56:00.873
He's been having
a very. very bad day.

00:56:01.004 --> 00:56:02.571
Alec!

00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:04.137
Hey. how much is it?

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:20.589
Hand me a napkin out of
the glove compartment.

00:56:23.983 --> 00:56:24.810
This.

00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:27.944
Hand me the card.

00:56:32.426 --> 00:56:33.689
You got a little chocolate
on your hands.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:38.520
There's a little bit
around your thumb.

00:56:41.435 --> 00:56:42.741
There's some on your wrist.

00:56:42.872 --> 00:56:44.003
Just give it. It's fine.
Just give it to me.

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:44.961
Just give it to me.
Thank you.

00:56:48.834 --> 00:56:49.922
So. what are you gonna say?

00:56:52.098 --> 00:56:56.233
Like. I love you.
I'm sorry and a big jerk
or something like that.

00:56:56.363 --> 00:56:57.756
What do you think?

00:56:57.887 --> 00:56:59.715
I don't know.
I've never had girlfriends.

00:57:00.672 --> 00:57:01.543
You're too young anyway.

00:57:02.892 --> 00:57:05.068
Well. there's just one girl.
Sarah.

00:57:06.112 --> 00:57:06.939
She goes to my school.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.681
She's kind of like
my girlfriend.

00:57:10.508 --> 00:57:11.727
Hmm.

00:57:11.857 --> 00:57:14.033
Just I haven't told her yet so.

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.687
Yeah. no. I don't think you can
call her your girlfriend then.

00:57:15.818 --> 00:57:16.993
Oh. but she is my girlfriend.

00:57:18.385 --> 00:57:20.997
She is. yeah.

00:57:22.215 --> 00:57:22.955
All right. Come on.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.222
Wait. I have anything
in my teeth?

00:57:30.833 --> 00:57:32.530
I can't tell.
Your gums are black.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.099
Do all black people
have black gums?

00:57:36.229 --> 00:57:36.926
I don't know.

00:57:38.318 --> 00:57:40.756
-Why?
-Why what?

00:57:40.886 --> 00:57:42.671
Why are my gums black
or why don't I know

00:57:42.801 --> 00:57:45.195
if every black person
in the world has black gums?

00:57:45.325 --> 00:57:47.589
The first one.

00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:49.852
I don't know. black people
and white people are the same.
but different.

00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:52.376
[sighs]

00:58:01.951 --> 00:58:02.604
[Alec] Hi.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.519
Can we come in?

00:58:22.449 --> 00:58:25.975
So. Gabe. who's this?

00:58:26.976 --> 00:58:27.716
I'm Alec.

00:58:29.065 --> 00:58:30.327
You got any lemonade
or something?

00:58:30.457 --> 00:58:31.894
Hi. Alec.

00:58:32.024 --> 00:58:33.591
Whose little white kid
did you steal?

00:58:34.461 --> 00:58:35.288
This is for you.

00:58:40.467 --> 00:58:43.819
And as far as Alec goes. we go
to the same therapist building
on the same days.

00:58:43.949 --> 00:58:45.429
We see each other
on the elevator sometimes

00:58:45.559 --> 00:58:47.561
-after sessions.
-We're best friends.

00:58:47.692 --> 00:58:50.216
He called me the N word earlier.
but in a good way.

00:58:50.347 --> 00:58:51.827
-Really. Gabe? Really?
-It just slipped out.

00:58:54.743 --> 00:58:56.788
-Have you been drinking?
-No.

00:58:56.919 --> 00:58:58.398
[Millie] You just gonna lie
to me now?

00:58:58.529 --> 00:58:59.486
You know I can always smell
alcohol on you.

00:58:59.617 --> 00:59:00.618
you have thin blood.
[sniffs]

00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:01.837
You've been drinking whiskey.

00:59:01.967 --> 00:59:04.448
Okay. a little. earlier.

00:59:04.578 --> 00:59:07.799
He gave me some. too.
It was gross.

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:09.671
I'm having a rough day. okay?
I'm grown.

00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:11.368
I can have a drink
during the day.

00:59:11.498 --> 00:59:14.197
Lapse in judgment
giving him some.
I'll give you that.

00:59:14.327 --> 00:59:16.416
Anyway. Alec came to me
after a session.

00:59:16.547 --> 00:59:19.985
He said he needed a ride home.
I offered him one.
I told him I'd take him.

00:59:20.116 --> 00:59:21.683
I went to what I thought was
his house. but he was confused.

00:59:21.813 --> 00:59:24.033
-Probably 'cause he's drunk.
-He's not drunk.

00:59:24.163 --> 00:59:27.079
We went just like ninjas
and beat the crap out of these
two kids who bully me

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:28.820
-and then played baseball.
-Okay. that's enough. Alec.

00:59:30.517 --> 00:59:33.172
Millie. that's not why
I came here. okay?

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.652
I really got to tell you
something.

00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:35.914
What is it? Because I'm still
a little hung up

00:59:36.045 --> 00:59:37.786
on you getting a 9-year-old
drunk.

00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:39.962
We're not drunk. just warm.
that's what my dad always says.

00:59:40.092 --> 00:59:40.919
[cellphone vibrates]

00:59:41.528 --> 00:59:42.355
[beeps]

00:59:45.707 --> 00:59:48.274
Gabe. what?
Why are you here?

00:59:48.405 --> 00:59:53.584
I. um. I-- I-- I just really
need your help. okay?

00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.368
We got to find out
where he lives.

00:59:55.499 --> 00:59:58.154
find out where his parents are
so we can return him home. okay?

00:59:58.284 --> 01:00:00.460
We?
Now all of a sudden we're a we?

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.637
Yes. we.
I need your help. okay?

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.641
[sighs]

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:10.340
Fine. let me get my purse.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:11.515
We'll get you home. okay?
Don't worry.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:27.574
Gabe.

01:00:29.402 --> 01:00:30.490
What's this for?

01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:31.970
Support.
It's what my friends do.

01:00:34.016 --> 01:00:35.713
Oh. and I also got to tell you
something.

01:00:35.844 --> 01:00:36.888
What?

01:00:39.586 --> 01:00:41.371
Cause and effect.

01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:45.027
You told a lie. so I hit you.
so you wouldn't lie again.

01:00:49.596 --> 01:00:51.337
It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.

01:00:54.253 --> 01:00:57.387
My therapist says
hitting when I'm mad is bad.

01:00:57.517 --> 01:00:58.214
Well. she's right.

01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:01.434
Doing anything when you're mad
is wrong.

01:01:02.522 --> 01:01:03.915
What-- what are you mad about
anyway?

01:01:04.046 --> 01:01:05.874
You're young. you got a
whole life ahead of you.

01:01:07.266 --> 01:01:08.615
Getting mad comes later
in your 30s.

01:01:09.442 --> 01:01:10.661
Today something happened.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.490
What?
What happened at school today?

01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:19.539
So. you know. how there are
three kids who are bullying me?

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:21.411
Yeah. we got revenge
on two of them at the park.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:24.762
So. there's a third.

01:01:26.546 --> 01:01:27.852
Okay. so.

01:01:29.985 --> 01:01:30.768
I burned him.

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:35.251
I lit him on fire
in the bathroom.

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:42.084
This was just a small one.
to make him sweat a little.

01:01:42.214 --> 01:01:44.695
I've been telling the teachers
that Jason was a bully.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.958
They just said.
"Kids will be kids."

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:48.351
And you gotta stand up
to bullies.

01:01:49.482 --> 01:01:50.788
That's what the commercials
always say.

01:01:53.573 --> 01:01:55.314
So. I took a lighter
from my mom's purse.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.491
put a little lighter fluid
from our garage

01:01:58.622 --> 01:02:00.232
in this little syringe

01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:03.018
that my mom used to
flush wax out of her ears.

01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:06.412
[tense music playing]

01:02:06.543 --> 01:02:11.809
Then followed him to the
bathroom and wet his new shoes.

01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:16.683
then lit him on fire.

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:23.342
Is the kid-- is the kid dead?

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:27.694
No.
It just got up to his knees.

01:02:27.825 --> 01:02:29.696
It was funny though.

01:02:29.827 --> 01:02:30.828
He was running around
like a little girl.

01:02:33.178 --> 01:02:35.354
My girlfriend Sarah saw him run
out of the bathroom
and down the hall.

01:02:37.704 --> 01:02:41.317
Then I just smiled at her
and then just went back
to the cafeteria

01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:42.840
and started eating my lunch.

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:45.321
Sometimes things just
had to be burned.

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:47.932
Okay. you guys ready?

01:02:50.674 --> 01:02:51.675
Hey. what color are your gums?

01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:54.896
All right. Let's get me home.

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:03.774
[calm music playing]

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.428
[Millie] Does any of this look
familiar to you. Alec?

01:03:06.777 --> 01:03:09.867
I mean do you live by any. um--
any big landmarks or?

01:03:09.998 --> 01:03:11.956
-Oh. yeah. I am actually.
-[Gabe] Oh. that's great!

01:03:12.087 --> 01:03:13.871
Which one?

01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:15.829
Um. there's a donut shop
around the corner.

01:03:17.266 --> 01:03:19.050
Dude. there are a thousand
donut shops in L.A.

01:03:19.181 --> 01:03:20.182
Oh. I found a good
one up on Vermont.

01:03:20.312 --> 01:03:21.270
It's so good.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.184
[cellphone vibrates]

01:03:22.314 --> 01:03:22.967
[cellphone beeping]

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:26.188
My phone's about to go dead.
you have your charger on you?

01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:27.450
This is your car. Gabe.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.668
Why would I have
a phone charger?

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:30.018
You could just say no.

01:03:30.148 --> 01:03:31.758
That would be
way more efficient.

01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:33.978
Okay. you know what?
You can just--

01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:35.806
[Gabe] All right.
I'm gonna swing by the gym.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.503
I got an extra charger there.
It's right around the corner.

01:03:48.384 --> 01:03:49.602
[sighs]

01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:54.520
-Ah. Gabe.
-Hey. man.

01:03:54.651 --> 01:03:56.958
Congrats. bro. Listen.
I want to hear all about it.

01:03:57.088 --> 01:03:58.785
but I got a new client
coming up.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:03:59.961
-Okay.
-All right.

01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:05.401
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
Heard the news. so awesome bro.
I didn't even know.

01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.968
What are you talking about?

01:04:07.098 --> 01:04:08.665
Dude. your fiancÃ©e just told us
the good news.

01:04:08.795 --> 01:04:11.233
You're getting married
and having a baby!

01:04:11.363 --> 01:04:12.321
-Wait. wait. wait.
-Yo. I better be invited

01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:14.758
-to the wedding.
-My fiancÃ©e?

01:04:14.888 --> 01:04:17.717
Yeah. she's inside. showing
everybody your baby picture
and her baby picture.

01:04:17.848 --> 01:04:19.458
trying to figure out
what the baby's gonna look like.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.939
[weights clattering
and thudding]

01:04:24.507 --> 01:04:26.596
[Bailey] Can you get me
a blue baby stroller?

01:04:26.726 --> 01:04:28.424
-That's really what I need.
-Uh. Bailey. What are you doing?

01:04:28.554 --> 01:04:30.382
Oh. hey. baby.

01:04:30.513 --> 01:04:33.298
I'm just on the internet looking
for strollers for the baby.

01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:35.735
Oh. can you believe some of
them come with three wheels?

01:04:35.866 --> 01:04:36.736
Yeah. can I talk to you outside
for a second?

01:04:37.824 --> 01:04:40.088
-Can it wait?
-No. it cannot wait.

01:04:40.218 --> 01:04:43.917
Okay. and they say we get
hormonal when we're pregnant.

01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:45.876
[laughs] It was so nice
meeting you. you guys.

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.356
Oh. okay.
What are you doing?

01:04:47.486 --> 01:04:48.835
Why are you grabbing me
like that?

01:04:48.966 --> 01:04:50.837
What are you doing. huh?

01:04:50.968 --> 01:04:52.317
You can't just come up
to my job like that

01:04:52.448 --> 01:04:53.710
telling everybody my business.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.321
You're about to be a father.
Gabe.

01:04:56.452 --> 01:04:58.802
You need to get that idea
wrapped around your head.
sweetheart.

01:04:58.932 --> 01:05:01.805
And those colleagues of yours
need to know what's going on

01:05:01.935 --> 01:05:04.938
because I'm not gonna be at home
raising a baby by my damn self.

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.984
So you might have to start
hiring some more people
around here or something.

01:05:07.115 --> 01:05:08.029
[Gabe] Listen. Bailey!

01:05:08.942 --> 01:05:11.293
How do I even know it's mine?
Hmm?

01:05:13.991 --> 01:05:16.602
Are you?
Are you calling me a whore?

01:05:16.733 --> 01:05:19.083
-No.
-[Bailey] Are you calling me
a whore?

01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:23.305
No. but I'm saying.
I don't talk to you
for like two months. right?

01:05:23.435 --> 01:05:25.046
I tell you I got a girlfriend
and all of a sudden...

01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:26.438
-[Bailey] Wow.
-...you show up

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:28.397
and you're pregnant.
I'm just-- come on!

01:05:29.398 --> 01:05:30.268
Who's that chick?

01:05:31.704 --> 01:05:32.923
Oh. she's Bailey.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.491
How do you know who Bailey is?

01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:36.883
I met her at Gabe's house.

01:05:38.929 --> 01:05:40.409
She and Gabe are going to have
a baby together--

01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.542
What did you just say?

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.196
[Bailey] Just sticking your
thing wherever you feel like it

01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:47.068
but when it comes
to responsibility.

01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:49.548
you can't handle the heat.
So. what?

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.116
I guess I'm just supposed to
just start

01:05:52.247 --> 01:05:54.379
tricking on the street now. huh?

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:58.079
Just sucking dick to put
Gabe Jr. through private school.
Is that what you want?

01:05:58.209 --> 01:06:01.386
You want me to start sucking
dick for our son's school. Gabe?

01:06:01.517 --> 01:06:03.040
-Oh. my God.
-What kind of father are you?

01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:04.389
Look. Bailey.
I'm not about to have

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.087
this dumbass conversation
with you.

01:06:06.217 --> 01:06:07.653
Not here.
Can you please just go?

01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:09.786
-Please.
-Is it?

01:06:10.613 --> 01:06:11.614
Is that Millie?

01:06:11.744 --> 01:06:12.832
He wasn't happy about it.

01:06:14.747 --> 01:06:16.575
That's why we came to your house
and Gabe got you a card.

01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:20.666
I am begging you.
will you please leave.

01:06:20.797 --> 01:06:21.537
-Oh. my God!
-[Gabe]
Right now is not the time.

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:23.060
You brought her here?

01:06:23.191 --> 01:06:25.541
-Really?
-[Gabe] Look. babe. babe.

01:06:25.671 --> 01:06:27.717
Wow. I can't believe you
right now.

01:06:27.847 --> 01:06:29.588
Babe. we'll figure it out.

01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.287
We'll talk about it later.

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:33.157
We'll figure it out. but could
you please just go now.

01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:35.116
Please. for me.

01:06:35.246 --> 01:06:35.942
Could you do that
for me. please?

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:37.466
-Okay.
-[Gabe] Okay.

01:06:39.337 --> 01:06:41.296
But you better tell that bitch
what it is. Gabe.

01:06:41.426 --> 01:06:42.993
-Okay. I will.
-Because I don't want her

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.473
-wrecking our home.
-All right.

01:06:44.603 --> 01:06:45.996
-[Bailey] Okay?
-Okay. I understand.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.825
And on the real.
if I wasn't carrying our child.

01:06:48.955 --> 01:06:50.609
-I would whoop that ass.
-I understand.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.915
-Tell her what I said.
-I will.

01:06:52.045 --> 01:06:53.395
I'll call you later
or something.

01:06:53.525 --> 01:06:54.744
Or something?
Gabe. don't get it twisted.

01:06:54.874 --> 01:06:56.572
I'm gonna start needing some
money soon

01:06:56.702 --> 01:06:59.575
'cause I'm starting maternity
leave any minute now. okay?

01:06:59.705 --> 01:07:01.011
All right. Okay.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.447
Give me a kiss.

01:07:02.578 --> 01:07:03.535
I'll kiss you later.
I'll kiss you later.

01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:11.804
Gabe. who's that?

01:07:11.935 --> 01:07:13.110
-It's just this--
-Is she pregnant?

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.677
[sighs]

01:07:14.807 --> 01:07:16.200
It's not what it looks like.
I promise.

01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:18.202
[car engine revs]

01:07:19.072 --> 01:07:20.073
Vroom. vroom. vroom.

01:07:21.901 --> 01:07:23.338
Hey. good to see you. man.

01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:27.429
Patrick. did I miss a session
or something?

01:07:27.559 --> 01:07:28.343
What are you doing-- what are
you doing here with Mark?

01:07:29.518 --> 01:07:30.127
Hey. Gabe. Um...

01:07:31.998 --> 01:07:34.087
Look it-- it just really
wasn't working out

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:36.568
with you training me.
so I got a new guy.

01:07:38.353 --> 01:07:39.571
This is Mark.

01:07:39.702 --> 01:07:41.182
Hey. did you hear
Gabe's having a baby?

01:07:42.531 --> 01:07:43.358
Congratulations!

01:07:44.446 --> 01:07:45.534
What's with those bands?

01:07:45.664 --> 01:07:46.665
-Let's get in.
-[Mark] Come on.

01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:49.146
Is that Millie?

01:07:50.103 --> 01:07:53.063
Hey. you look amazing!

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:54.369
[Millie chuckles]

01:07:54.499 --> 01:07:55.500
What are you--
what are you doing here?

01:07:56.936 --> 01:07:58.677
Uh...

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:01.245
I actually have no idea
what I'm doing here.
[scoffs]

01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:03.856
Do you have plans right now?

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.208
I-- I got something I've been
dying to talk to you about.

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:09.253
Let's-- let's get some food.
we'll get a drink.

01:08:09.384 --> 01:08:10.472
I'll-- I'll tell
you all about it.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.693
Yeah. Yeah. I could use a drink.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.956
[Patrick] Great.
Hey. Mark. I'm really sorry.

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:19.611
I-- I'm-- I'm gonna have
to reschedule. okay. Um...

01:08:20.308 --> 01:08:22.135
-This is important.
-[Mark] Got you.

01:08:22.266 --> 01:08:24.442
Yeah. I already. already
prepaid the ten. right?

01:08:24.573 --> 01:08:25.487
-[Mark] You're good.
-I'll see you again.

01:08:25.617 --> 01:08:26.531
-[Mark] Gotcha.
-Thanks.

01:08:28.403 --> 01:08:29.186
-Grab your stuff.
-Oh. yeah. Yeah.

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:30.013
Okay.

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.628
[car engine sputtering]

01:08:41.633 --> 01:08:43.244
Well. this is embarrassing.

01:08:43.374 --> 01:08:44.157
This is why
I never drive myself.

01:08:46.203 --> 01:08:47.683
Gabe. do you have a car?

01:08:48.945 --> 01:08:50.816
Would you give me and Millie
a ride to my house?

01:08:50.947 --> 01:08:53.254
Yeah. Gabe.
Could you do that
for Patrick and I?

01:08:56.082 --> 01:08:57.083
[Patrick]
I'd really appreciate it.

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:05.266
Hi. um. hey.
who. who's this kid?

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:11.707
I'm... Wait. Who am I?

01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:15.406
Well. you're Patty Nelson.

01:09:15.537 --> 01:09:17.626
You're like the best
guitarist ever.

01:09:17.756 --> 01:09:19.671
Well. thanks.
I'm flattered you think so.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:23.153
Alec. That's my name. Alec.

01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:25.764
Right on. Alec.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:30.508
Hey. um. maybe it's best if you
turn around and face front.
Might be safer.

01:09:30.639 --> 01:09:33.816
My parents make me sleep
with the door open.
They think that's safer.

01:09:33.946 --> 01:09:35.644
He's going through some changes.

01:09:35.774 --> 01:09:38.037
Yeah. but I'm in therapy
because I burned the kid
at school.

01:09:38.951 --> 01:09:39.952
You burned a kid?

01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:41.606
Okay. Alec. turn around.

01:09:41.737 --> 01:09:43.565
That's Patty Nelson. the legend.

01:09:43.695 --> 01:09:45.567
I know. Just turn around.
Just right now. turn around.

01:09:49.962 --> 01:09:51.399
[screaming]

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:53.444
-Why?
-Alec. stop!

01:09:53.575 --> 01:09:55.838
Alec. calm down!
Alec. calm down.

01:09:55.968 --> 01:09:57.579
Calm down.
We already did this. bro.

01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:59.755
We're not doing this again.
okay? Stop.

01:10:01.452 --> 01:10:03.672
Can I ride the rest of the ride
looking at Mr. Nelson now?

01:10:05.413 --> 01:10:06.239
I'd rather you didn't.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:17.512
So. Gabe. did I hear correctly.
you're gonna have a baby?

01:10:17.642 --> 01:10:20.253
Yeah. Gabe.
did we hear that correctly.
you are going to have a baby?

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.647
It's a little more complicated
than that I suppose.

01:10:22.778 --> 01:10:25.998
What exactly is so complicated?
I mean. sex is pretty simple.

01:10:26.129 --> 01:10:28.566
I mean. you insert A into B. you
drop a load off and then boom.

01:10:28.697 --> 01:10:30.133
nine months later
you have a baby.

01:10:30.263 --> 01:10:32.222
-What's so complicated?
-No. maybe.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.267
maybe right now
is not the best time.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.966
Oh. it isn't? It's not
convenient for you. Gabe?

01:10:37.096 --> 01:10:38.837
What are you gonna save it all
for your next little
therapy session?

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:42.014
I mean. you are unbelievable.

01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:43.886
You can open up to every person
on this planet except for me.

01:10:44.016 --> 01:10:45.496
but you know what. actually.
it's fine.

01:10:45.627 --> 01:10:47.106
Maybe you can explain
to Dr. Jones

01:10:47.237 --> 01:10:48.978
how someone who's too afraid
to be in a healthy

01:10:49.108 --> 01:10:51.154
and loving.
committed relationship.

01:10:51.284 --> 01:10:53.765
thinks it's a better idea to
knock up a random chick instead.

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:55.811
-I mean that'll be.
ooh. that'll be a great session.
-[Gabe sighs].

01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:58.117
Guys. this. uh.
kid is freaking me out.

01:10:58.248 --> 01:11:00.163
I don't think he's blinked
the entire time
he's been staring at me.

01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:01.730
Actually. you know what.
it's good.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.210
Alec should hear all about
his new best friend.

01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:05.821
That way he can grow up
to be just like him.

01:11:05.951 --> 01:11:08.563
Look. no. everybody listen.
if we could just...

01:11:08.693 --> 01:11:12.175
We get Patrick home. then we'll
find out a way to get Alec home.

01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:13.872
I say we drop
the good son off first.

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.700
[Gabe] I'll explain all this
later. babe. I promise.

01:11:15.831 --> 01:11:18.442
We. there you go again
with the "we" stuff.

01:11:18.573 --> 01:11:20.705
We didn't raw dog
the squat-legged chick
back there in the leggings.

01:11:20.836 --> 01:11:22.315
the one you got pregnant.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:24.579
[Patrick] Oh. dude.
You got to wear protection.

01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:26.929
There's diseases out here
that'll make your junk fall
right off.

01:11:27.059 --> 01:11:28.887
My mom calls it
the willy [inaudible].

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:32.325
Got me out here making chicken
tacos. trying to hang out again?

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:34.153
And this whole time
you've got a chick pregnant?

01:11:34.284 --> 01:11:36.373
-And you weren't gonna tell me.
-She does not...

01:11:36.504 --> 01:11:38.070
-I don't even know if it's mine.
-[Millie] You didn't think
I'll find out?

01:11:38.201 --> 01:11:39.376
-Unreal.
-[Dr. Jones]
How does that make you feel?

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:41.291
How does that make you feel?

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:44.337
How does that make you feel?

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:45.426
-How does that make you feel?
-[Millie] Gabe.

01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:46.557
Gabe! Where you going?

01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:54.522
[Gabe panting]

01:11:54.652 --> 01:11:57.655
Gabe! Gabe! You're being
ridiculous. get in the car.

01:11:57.786 --> 01:11:59.352
I can't get in the car.
I can't get in.

01:12:00.963 --> 01:12:02.486
Why not? It's your car.
We can take you
wherever you want to go.

01:12:02.617 --> 01:12:06.011
If I get... If I get back
in the car. I'll kill you all.

01:12:06.142 --> 01:12:07.752
[Millie] Okay. you're not going
to kill anybody.

01:12:07.883 --> 01:12:09.711
You're just having another one
of your anxiety attacks.

01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:11.800
Nope. nope. This was real.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:13.671
I'll kill you all
if I get back in the car.

01:12:13.802 --> 01:12:15.151
-[Millie] Gabe.
Gabe. get in the car.
-No. I can't.

01:12:15.281 --> 01:12:17.370
Gabe! Gabe!

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:18.589
Where the fuck is he going?

01:12:19.895 --> 01:12:20.983
[sighs]

01:12:30.688 --> 01:12:31.689
[scoffs] What a day!

01:12:34.344 --> 01:12:37.042
You know. Gabe was pretty upset
when he heard
he was gonna be a dad.

01:12:39.654 --> 01:12:40.742
What'd he say?

01:12:42.787 --> 01:12:45.442
He said she was like a whiskey
mistake or something like that.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.273
Yeah. pretty sure.

01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:51.361
I know where he's going.

01:12:53.668 --> 01:12:56.714
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm. Wednesday. right?

01:13:06.724 --> 01:13:08.857
[footsteps approaching]

01:13:08.987 --> 01:13:11.512
[panting]

01:13:11.642 --> 01:13:14.732
-Gabe. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:13:16.691 --> 01:13:18.257
Is someone chasing you
or something?

01:13:18.388 --> 01:13:19.998
No. no. I'm fine. I just--

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.391
Are you. are you hurt?

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:22.958
Oh. it's just...
I just can't breathe.

01:13:23.088 --> 01:13:24.046
All right. here. here. here.

01:13:24.176 --> 01:13:24.960
Drink this.

01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:30.487
You don't look... You know what.
I'm going to call somebody.

01:13:30.618 --> 01:13:32.054
No. no. [coughing]
I'm fine.

01:13:32.184 --> 01:13:33.577
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:13:35.013 --> 01:13:36.058
I just can't breathe.

01:13:38.364 --> 01:13:39.801
Okay. look. just.
everything's going to be fine.
Just take a breath.

01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:43.282
[continues panting]

01:13:43.413 --> 01:13:46.851
Look. this day has to be
the worst day of my life.

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:50.463
Okay. just tell me
what happened.

01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:55.164
Okay. well. first of all. right.
I run away from my car.

01:13:55.294 --> 01:13:58.776
I leave my. my ex. Millie.
with her ex-fiancÃ© Patty Nelson.

01:13:58.907 --> 01:14:00.386
I love that guy.

01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:02.345
Yeah. and then. and then
I'd be riding around all day

01:14:02.475 --> 01:14:06.088
with some. some kid
who just might be
the next Hannibal Lecter.

01:14:06.218 --> 01:14:08.830
Oh. oh. and I.
I'm about to be a father.

01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:13.138
Yeah. yeah.
I got some random chick
pregnant.

01:14:13.269 --> 01:14:16.141
I don't even like her.
She shows up to my job.

01:14:16.272 --> 01:14:18.796
I messed with her like
a couple of months ago.

01:14:18.927 --> 01:14:22.931
She's pregnant.
She's keeping 'em and. yeah.
it's just. it's just all bad.

01:14:23.061 --> 01:14:24.541
Okay. just take a.
take a second.

01:14:24.672 --> 01:14:26.151
Hang on a minute.
Just. just take a breath.

01:14:26.282 --> 01:14:27.805
Everything's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.

01:14:27.936 --> 01:14:30.416
No. no. I'm not gonna be fine.

01:14:30.547 --> 01:14:33.245
You keep saying that shit
and it's not true.

01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:36.031
Okay? It just keeps getting
worse and worse.
Everything sucks.

01:14:40.557 --> 01:14:43.255
I'm not ready to be a father.
man. not like this with her.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:51.307
I love Millie and I was really.
really trying to make it work

01:14:51.437 --> 01:14:52.830
and this fucking thing happens.

01:14:54.266 --> 01:14:57.226
Who's this kid that
you were hanging out with?

01:14:57.356 --> 01:14:59.576
[Gabe] It's Alec. He's some kid
who goes to therapy
in the building somewhere.

01:15:03.406 --> 01:15:04.799
Oh. God!

01:15:04.929 --> 01:15:06.670
-Oh. God!
-Why? Why?

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:08.106
-What?
-Everybody. everybody.

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.195
everybody has been looking
for him.

01:15:10.326 --> 01:15:11.980
-What?
-Yeah.

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:13.677
He didn't show up
for his session today.

01:15:13.808 --> 01:15:15.026
so they've been looking all over
for him.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:17.855
He's not missing.
he's in the car.

01:15:17.986 --> 01:15:18.856
All right. Gabe. listen.
I need--

01:15:18.987 --> 01:15:20.815
That motherfucker.

01:15:20.945 --> 01:15:25.123
I need you to.
to bring him upstairs.
so I can. I can see him.

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.995
-Not that you would do anything.
-There's nothing wrong with him.

01:15:27.125 --> 01:15:28.387
There's nothing wrong
with him. okay?

01:15:28.518 --> 01:15:30.215
Except he burns little kids
at school.

01:15:30.346 --> 01:15:32.957
I need to protect the safety
of this child. Can you please

01:15:33.088 --> 01:15:34.567
-bring him up to here?
-Safety? He's fine.

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:36.134
-He's fine. He's fucking fine.
-[Dr. Jones] Okay.

01:15:37.745 --> 01:15:41.400
[upbeat music playing]

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:47.668
[cellphone vibrates then beeps]

01:15:55.893 --> 01:15:57.590
-Gabe. Gabe.
-[Gabe] Come here. Come here.

01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:58.983
[Millie] Gabe. whoa. whoa. whoa!
Easy. easy.

01:15:59.114 --> 01:16:00.158
-[Gabe] Come here.
-[Patrick] Hey. hey. hey.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.203
You've been lying to me.

01:16:02.813 --> 01:16:04.554
You said your grandmother forgot
to pick you up

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:06.730
because she's old
after your session.
But you never went.

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.430
Right. Right.

01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:14.129
And then you took me on this
wild-ass goose chase

01:16:14.259 --> 01:16:16.653
pretending you were locked out.
stealing candy and shit.

01:16:16.784 --> 01:16:19.177
You got people thinking
you're fucking kidnapped.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:21.223
I never should have picked
your ass up in the first place.

01:16:21.353 --> 01:16:22.485
Well. Gabe. Gabe.
I think that's enough.

01:16:22.615 --> 01:16:23.529
[Gabe]
Oh. what do you care. huh?

01:16:25.575 --> 01:16:27.795
Right. you're leaving me anyway
without even hearing my side.

01:16:27.925 --> 01:16:30.275
so you don't have to worry about
what I do anymore.

01:16:30.406 --> 01:16:32.756
Now. listen. you're gonna
tell me where you live.

01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:34.802
You're gonna tell me
what's going on.

01:16:34.932 --> 01:16:37.195
You're gonna tell me right now.
I'm not playing anymore.

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:41.722
Okay. okay. I'm sorry.
I told a fib earlier.
I'm sorry.

01:16:41.852 --> 01:16:45.421
I know where I live.
I just didn't want to
go back to my house.

01:16:45.551 --> 01:16:48.163
My dad will keep
ruffling my hair.

01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:50.208
my mom would keep looking at me
like she's about to cry.

01:16:53.211 --> 01:16:54.256
They don't know me.

01:16:56.214 --> 01:16:59.522
I just want to hang out
with you.
You're my only friend.

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:03.134
I just didn't want to go back
to my house. that's all.

01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:04.222
[Patrick]
I would like to go home.

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:05.441
Dude. shut the fuck up. Patrick.

01:17:07.138 --> 01:17:08.792
[sighs] Listen. it's okay. man.
It's okay.

01:17:11.012 --> 01:17:13.623
We just got to get you home.
man. We got to do that. okay?

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.103
Maybe I could work
something out.

01:17:15.233 --> 01:17:16.539
if you start playing baseball.
I could.

01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:17.932
I could come to your game
or something.

01:17:18.846 --> 01:17:20.717
You're my pal still.
You're my pal.

01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:25.026
-Okay. promise?
-[Gabe] I promise.

01:17:25.156 --> 01:17:28.769
[calm music playing]

01:17:35.645 --> 01:17:36.733
[sighs]

01:17:36.864 --> 01:17:39.257
I live at
11204 Sycamore Boulevard.

01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:41.738
[sighs]

01:17:44.088 --> 01:17:47.788
[ominous music playing]

01:17:52.053 --> 01:17:53.228
Hey. man.

01:17:54.533 --> 01:17:56.361
I'm sorry for that stuff I said
back there.

01:17:56.492 --> 01:17:58.886
I. I didn't mean anything.
You didn't deserve it.

01:17:59.016 --> 01:18:01.453
It's okay.
You are having a bad day.

01:18:02.715 --> 01:18:03.978
[sighs]

01:18:05.327 --> 01:18:06.284
I'm sorry. too.

01:18:08.547 --> 01:18:09.200
I know.

01:18:10.767 --> 01:18:11.550
[Gabe] Can we please talk later?

01:18:14.858 --> 01:18:16.033
I think this is it.

01:18:23.606 --> 01:18:25.956
-Can I help you?
-Yeah. I'm just...

01:18:26.087 --> 01:18:27.915
You guys are probably looking
for Alec. so. I just...

01:18:29.264 --> 01:18:30.308
All right. Hey. freeze! Let me
see your hands right now!

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.440
-Hands! Let me see 'em.
-Who?

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:32.658
-You. Put your hands up?
-Okay.

01:18:32.789 --> 01:18:34.443
-Do not put them down.
-Okay.

01:18:34.573 --> 01:18:36.532
-What the fuck is happening?
-Get on the car. Get on the car.

01:18:36.662 --> 01:18:37.794
-What are you'll doing?
-[Millie] What are you
arresting him for?

01:18:37.925 --> 01:18:39.535
Son. everything's okay.
All right?

01:18:39.665 --> 01:18:40.928
-You're safe.
-I've been safe.
Gabe is my friend. No.

01:18:41.058 --> 01:18:43.017
Okay. wait.
why are you arresting him?

01:18:43.147 --> 01:18:44.409
-[cop 1] I need you people
to back up?
-You break my fucking arm.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.193
-I'm gonna beat that ass...
-Stop resisting.

01:18:45.323 --> 01:18:46.411
I'm not resisting.

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:48.544
Guys. this is a
misunderstanding.

01:18:48.674 --> 01:18:50.198
-[cop 1]
I'm not gonna tell you again.
-Don't talk to her like that.

01:18:50.328 --> 01:18:51.764
-Hey. shut up. Come on.
-[Millie] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:53.375
-Officer. Officer.
-[Patrick] This is a mistake.

01:18:53.505 --> 01:18:54.245
-[Alec] He's my friend!
-Where are you taking him?

01:18:54.376 --> 01:18:55.072
He's not the bad guy.

01:18:55.203 --> 01:18:57.422
Alec. Oh. my God. honey!

01:18:57.553 --> 01:18:59.772
Honey. are you okay?
We've been worried sick.

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:01.818
[Randy] That. that man.
he didn't touch you anywhere.
did he?

01:19:01.949 --> 01:19:03.951
Tell them to let him go. dad.
tell them.

01:19:04.081 --> 01:19:06.475
Yeah. let the police
do their job.
They're the heroes today. chief.

01:19:06.605 --> 01:19:07.911
-Hi. hi. You're his parents?
-[Randy] Hi.

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:09.957
I'm Millie.
I'm Gabe's girlfriend.

01:19:10.087 --> 01:19:12.742
I think this whole thing is a
huge misunderstanding.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.180
Gabe would never hurt Alec.
they're friends.

01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:19.009
Friends? No. a man in his 30s
and my child

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.578
don't need to be friends.
There's no misunderstanding.
Your boyfriend kidnapped my son.

01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:23.709
-Okay. I--
-[Joanne]
Okay. we've been worried sick.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.103
Oh. my word! Oh. my word!

01:19:26.234 --> 01:19:27.844
It's Patty Nelson.
You're Patty Nelson.

01:19:27.975 --> 01:19:29.411
Nelson. can I get
your autograph?

01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:31.108
My friends at work are never
gonna believe this.

01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:32.805
-Give me something to write on.
-It's not the best time.

01:19:33.806 --> 01:19:35.939
And. and who do you think
you are?

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.550
What kind of grown man hangs out
with a 9-year-old all day?

01:19:38.681 --> 01:19:40.074
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:19:40.204 --> 01:19:42.685
Ashamed? What?
You don't even know your son.

01:19:42.815 --> 01:19:44.817
You know. he doesn't even
like hamburgers. stupid.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:46.428
-Come on.
-[Millie] Gabe.
hang in there. okay.

01:19:46.558 --> 01:19:48.299
We're going to. we're going to
get you out of this.

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:49.605
Patrick has plenty of money.
We're going to figure this out.

01:19:49.735 --> 01:19:51.085
Yeah. yeah. No.
Anybody's money but his.

01:19:51.215 --> 01:19:52.825
-Anybody's but his.
-[cop 1] Hey. shut up!

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.827
-Patrick Nelson is the best.
-[cop 2] Get in the car.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.655
-[Gabe] Fuck Patty Nelson.
-[cop 1] Get in the car.

01:19:57.439 --> 01:19:58.919
Ma'am. let's get you inside.

01:19:59.049 --> 01:20:00.137
You and your family don't need
to see this.

01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:04.141
-Everything all right?
-Uh. yeah. We're getting there.
So. what happened?

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.665
Are you involved
in this kidnapping?

01:20:06.796 --> 01:20:08.189
I mean. I know you're not.
but you're his girlfriend.

01:20:08.319 --> 01:20:09.581
What do you know about this?

01:20:09.712 --> 01:20:11.409
What do you mean what do I--

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.977
Alec needed a ride home from
therapy today. so Gabe took him.

01:20:14.108 --> 01:20:16.153
Therapy?
Why does your boy need therapy?

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.418
He's. he's got some
behavioral issues.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.943
He's just figuring out
who he is.

01:20:23.073 --> 01:20:27.208
Um. and that monster
must have grabbed him
after Alec's session.

01:20:27.338 --> 01:20:29.558
Today he's had a particularly
rough day at school.

01:20:29.688 --> 01:20:32.082
He's probably emotional
and. you know.

01:20:32.213 --> 01:20:33.344
that. that man
took advantage of it.

01:20:34.258 --> 01:20:35.781
What happened with
Alec at school?

01:20:38.175 --> 01:20:40.612
In a roundabout way.
he was the cause of an accident
to another student.

01:20:40.743 --> 01:20:43.093
Alec burned a kid
for bullying him.
That's what happened.

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.969
Did this. uh. did this happen
at Burroughs Grade School?

01:20:49.795 --> 01:20:50.666
Yeah. why?

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:55.453
Oh. my God! You little fucker!

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:56.977
-You little fucker!
-[cop 3] Joe. Joe. Joe.

01:20:57.107 --> 01:20:58.935
My son Jason has second-degree
burns on his legs.

01:20:59.066 --> 01:21:00.676
He's in a wheelchair
because of you.

01:21:00.806 --> 01:21:02.243
-You fucking psychopath!
-[cop 3] Okay. Joe.

01:21:02.373 --> 01:21:04.549
He gets to ride in a wheelchair?
Cool!

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.551
Cool. cool?

01:21:06.682 --> 01:21:08.945
Cool? I'm going to kill you.
you little fucker!

01:21:09.076 --> 01:21:11.426
Your fucking kid's a psychopath.
That's what he is.

01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:13.384
You take that back!
Randy. do something.

01:21:13.515 --> 01:21:15.256
-Huh?
-Okay. look. look. look.

01:21:15.386 --> 01:21:17.171
Now we're all going to
forgive Detective Parlow.

01:21:17.301 --> 01:21:18.128
Detective Parlow here
is a little emotional.

01:21:19.173 --> 01:21:21.175
Either they don't know.
don't show.

01:21:22.872 --> 01:21:24.004
or don't care about
what's going on in the hood.

01:21:26.223 --> 01:21:28.356
Do not quote "Boys in the Hood"
to me right now.

01:21:28.486 --> 01:21:29.139
Boy. you got to breathe.

01:21:30.227 --> 01:21:31.489
You got two strikes.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.013
[Patrick]
Look. two life-changing moments

01:21:33.143 --> 01:21:34.971
where you taught me
that I'll never forget.

01:21:35.102 --> 01:21:37.104
One. watching that movie.
Ricky should have
never stopped to pee.

01:21:37.234 --> 01:21:38.192
It was right around the corner
from his house.

01:21:39.236 --> 01:21:41.586
And. two.
nothing should be forced.

01:21:42.848 --> 01:21:45.068
Nothing. I like Gabe.

01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:48.028
He. he's a real nice guy
but he's a mess.

01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:49.551
[Millie]
Patrick. maybe you're right.

01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:53.294
Gabe is a fucking mess.
but he's my fucking mess.

01:21:54.947 --> 01:21:57.254
And right now
he's in a lot of trouble.
And he needs me.

01:21:57.385 --> 01:21:59.082
So. if it's okay with you
I'm going to help him
because I love him.

01:22:02.303 --> 01:22:02.999
Do you think
you could introduce me?

01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.131
Sir. no.

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.263
Autograph.

01:22:06.394 --> 01:22:08.570
[Patrick] Oh. I...

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.398
[Randy] I'd really appreciate it
if you could make it
out to Randy

01:22:10.528 --> 01:22:11.573
-with a Y.
-[Patrick] Oh. right.

01:22:11.703 --> 01:22:14.097
Wait! Wait! No! No! No!
No!

01:22:14.837 --> 01:22:18.145
Alec! Alec! Alec. No!

01:22:18.275 --> 01:22:19.363
Do not burn that cop.

01:22:22.497 --> 01:22:25.848
-[Joanne]
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!
-[cop 3] Joe. Joe. Joe!

01:22:27.284 --> 01:22:28.416
-He. he. he burned him.
-[cop 3] Come on. Joe.

01:22:28.546 --> 01:22:29.286
-remember your training.
-He fucked up.

01:22:29.417 --> 01:22:31.680
[all scream]

01:22:34.465 --> 01:22:36.641
-[Joanne] Really?
-[Millie] Are you. are you okay?

01:22:37.599 --> 01:22:40.123
Okay. okay.

01:22:40.254 --> 01:22:41.385
[cop 3] Okay. okay.
We got you. man.

01:22:41.516 --> 01:22:45.955
[upbeat music playing]

01:22:48.218 --> 01:22:50.002
[Alec] Dear Gabe. hi.

01:22:51.917 --> 01:22:54.006
I hope you're doing okay.
I'm doing fine.

01:22:55.443 --> 01:22:57.619
I've made a lot of new friends
at my new place.

01:22:57.749 --> 01:22:59.229
It's a place for kids
to get better.

01:23:00.665 --> 01:23:02.798
Sorry that I got arrested.

01:23:02.928 --> 01:23:05.757
It was pretty cool though. huh?

01:23:05.888 --> 01:23:07.194
I'd never been arrested before.

01:23:09.021 --> 01:23:11.285
That day was one of the
best days of my life.

01:23:13.374 --> 01:23:16.377
You're my best friend.
Write me back.

01:23:16.507 --> 01:23:18.988
I'll be here for a little while longer.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:22.426
They think it's good for me
since I have a fire problem.

01:23:22.557 --> 01:23:25.081
but I don't want to set people
on fire like I used to.

01:23:25.212 --> 01:23:27.170
-What's up. Jonny?
-Whatever. dork.

01:23:28.432 --> 01:23:29.390
[Alec] That's the old me.

01:23:30.565 --> 01:23:32.001
The new me is done with fire

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.003
because fire burns people
and things.

01:23:37.049 --> 01:23:39.791
Well. hope to talk you soon.
Love you.

01:23:39.922 --> 01:23:41.619
[Gabe] "Love you. Alec."

01:23:44.361 --> 01:23:46.189
It seems as though Alec still
really cares about you.

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:50.237
Yeah. I guess so.
I mean. he writes me every week.

01:23:51.934 --> 01:23:53.457
I kind of feel bad for him.
I think he's just a kid
trying to fit in.

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:56.243
How long does he have to stay
in the group home?

01:23:56.373 --> 01:23:57.809
Two months.

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.507
He comes home pretty soon.
actually.

01:24:00.551 --> 01:24:02.684
And your court session
the other day.

01:24:02.814 --> 01:24:05.208
What. what.
what happened with that?

01:24:05.339 --> 01:24:09.169
Oh. So. they dropped
all the charges
except for resisting arrest.

01:24:09.299 --> 01:24:11.693
I mean I don't even know
how you get arrested
for resisting arrest.

01:24:11.823 --> 01:24:15.827
That makes like. like
zero sense. but. surprisingly.

01:24:15.958 --> 01:24:19.004
Alec's mom and dad bailed me out
of jail to say they were sorry.

01:24:19.135 --> 01:24:21.006
And then they invited me over
for Salmon Saturday.

01:24:25.228 --> 01:24:26.534
And how about you. Millie?

01:24:26.664 --> 01:24:28.753
Uh. how have things been
since you moved in?

01:24:30.581 --> 01:24:33.541
Well. Gabe's been much more open
with me.

01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:36.370
I really appreciate him
for that.

01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:41.070
And in turn it's made me feel
more secure with us.

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:47.250
And he gave me a key
when he got out of jail.
We're best friends again.

01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:50.514
Yeah. when that cop was.
was punching me in the stomach

01:24:50.645 --> 01:24:53.778
and the other one was twisting
my arm and almost broke it.

01:24:53.909 --> 01:24:56.216
you know. I won't say my life
flashed before my eyes.

01:24:56.346 --> 01:24:58.522
but I realized. in that moment.

01:25:00.785 --> 01:25:02.874
I loved Millie more than anybody
I'd ever loved before.

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:08.402
And then I saw Alec
light that detective on fire

01:25:08.532 --> 01:25:10.969
and sort of
lost my train of thought.

01:25:12.406 --> 01:25:15.626
May I ask what happened
with Bailey and the baby?

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:17.933
[Gabe] Look at this.

01:25:20.414 --> 01:25:21.110
Read that.

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:28.248
"Nigga. I ain't pregnant.
Just fucking with you.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:33.253
Found my bracelet.
it was in my closet.

01:25:33.383 --> 01:25:35.298
Love you. Call me."

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:37.953
Keep scrolling.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.870
"Fuck you then!

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.482
I got a new man and I hope
you and your bitch die

01:25:45.613 --> 01:25:46.570
from chicken pox."

01:25:52.359 --> 01:25:53.664
We got a restraining order.

01:25:53.795 --> 01:25:55.536
Wow!

01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:57.799
Yeah. but Millie and I.
we're doing good.

01:25:57.929 --> 01:25:58.626
[Millie chuckles]

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:02.456
I know. time's up.

01:26:04.545 --> 01:26:06.416
I'll see you. uh.
I'll see you next week.

01:26:06.547 --> 01:26:09.811
Actually. Millie and I are
going on a little trip.

01:26:09.941 --> 01:26:12.466
a little vacation
just. just us two.

01:26:12.596 --> 01:26:14.294
So. we won't be back
for a few Wednesdays.

01:26:14.424 --> 01:26:16.513
but. uh. give you a call?

01:26:16.644 --> 01:26:17.427
I understand.

01:26:19.777 --> 01:26:20.996
Thank you. Dr. Jones.

01:26:21.126 --> 01:26:21.736
