00:10:48.164 --> 00:10:51.512
- Carry yourself like
a man. and number two?

177
00:10:51.512 --> 00:10:54.826
- Keep my mouth shut about
shit I don't know about.

178
00:10:54.826 --> 00:10:57.898
- Things. things you
don't know about.

179
00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:00.004
- Things. things I
don't know about.

180
00:11:00.004 --> 00:11:01.453
- And most importantly?

181
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.697
- Be me all the time.

182
00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:08.529
- Yeah. that's right.
Be you all the time.

183
00:11:09.979 --> 00:11:12.050
People don't like people who
pretend to be somebody else.

184
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.569
Isn't that right. Fred?

185
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.745
Plus it's easier that way.

186
00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:18.194
These people around here.

187
00:11:18.194 --> 00:11:20.680
they either going to
accept you or they're not.

188
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.578
Look at Fred back there.

189
00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:24.338
You ain't nervous at
all. are you Fred?

190
00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:26.824
- Man these clowns know
what these hands can do.

191
00:11:26.824 --> 00:11:28.653
They don't want none
of these problems.

192
00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:30.690
- Keep them hands
to yourself son.

193
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.691
- Yes sir.

194
00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:34.590
- All right.
[bell rings]

195
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.248
Go on in there and do
what y'all got to do.

196
00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:40.044
- Hey D. I got your back.

197
00:11:40.044 --> 00:11:43.357
I'll always have your
back. no matter what.

198
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.845
- I know Fred. I know.

199
00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:51.987
- Hey Darius. I ain't gonna
make it home. [gun fires]

200
00:11:51.987 --> 00:11:53.713
- Mr. Thomas?

201
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:54.541
Are you okay?

202
00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:59.063
- Yeah. yeah I'm. I'm okay.

203
00:11:59.063 --> 00:12:00.547
- Mr. Parsons will see you now.

204
00:12:01.893 --> 00:12:03.861
- Okay. [sighs] cool.

205
00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:13.629
- Mr. Thomas. how are we-

206
00:12:14.837 --> 00:12:16.632
Have we met before Mr. Thomas?

207
00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:18.358
- Uh no. sir.

208
00:12:18.358 --> 00:12:20.636
- Mmm you look
extremely familiar.

209
00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:22.120
I'm sure we've met.

210
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.364
- If we had. you know I
would definitely remember.

211
00:12:24.364 --> 00:12:26.815
- Eh. maybe you just
got one of those faces.

212
00:12:26.815 --> 00:12:28.023
I don't know Darius.

213
00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:31.716
Anyway. the script. not
bad. not bad at all.

214
00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:33.511
Look. we're having an
honest conversation here?

215
00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:36.410
I gotta tell ya. the
script. it's a little dark.

216
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.618
I mean not in a bad way.

217
00:12:37.618 --> 00:12:39.068
But it's pretty clear Darius.

218
00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:40.932
that there's something
trying to cut through.

219
00:12:40.932 --> 00:12:43.763
- It's just all
personal experiences.

220
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.626
- Like the part
about the father?

221
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.734
- Sir. I'm not-
- The father. in the script.

222
00:12:49.734 --> 00:12:51.356
- He dies of a heart attack.

223
00:12:51.356 --> 00:12:52.910
Is that what
happened to your dad?

224
00:12:54.981 --> 00:12:56.327
Is your father still alive?

225
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.195
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm
sure you miss him greatly.

226
00:13:02.195 --> 00:13:03.748
You know what I think. Anthony.

227
00:13:04.714 --> 00:13:06.199
I think that's your real father.

228
00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:08.511
I mean in the script he's the
embalmer at the funeral home

229
00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:10.617
and all that. but it's clear.

230
00:13:10.617 --> 00:13:12.757
Something resonates about him.

231
00:13:12.757 --> 00:13:14.310
I mean he's the
last one to see Glen

232
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.898
get made ready before he goes-

233
00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:17.969
- It's suicide. sir.

234
00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:24.044
My father committed suicide

235
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.322
when I was younger.

236
00:13:30.499 --> 00:13:31.880
He'd been battling
with depression

237
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.226
practically his whole life.

238
00:13:34.572 --> 00:13:38.887
And on my mother's
birthday. he shot himself.

239
00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:42.856
There was no "Goodbye Darius."

240
00:13:44.237 --> 00:13:45.997
no "I love you Darius."

241
00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:47.965
no "Hang in there Darius."

242
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.657
And that script is.

243
00:13:52.003 --> 00:13:54.557
it's that thing that
gets that out of my head.

244
00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:56.974
- So this. what. this
script. it's your life?

245
00:13:56.974 --> 00:13:59.562
- Well. yeah. pretty much.

246
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.015
- Okay okay. tell you
what I'm gonna do.

247
00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:06.052
I'm gonna go ahead and
kick this upstairs.

248
00:14:06.052 --> 00:14:08.261
If they like it. if.

249
00:14:09.434 --> 00:14:10.711
you might just get
to see your name

250
00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:11.989
in the movie credits some day.

251
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:13.507
Right. picture this.

252
00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:15.889
A Darius Thomas Story.

253
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:19.203
directed by Mike Berry.

254
00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:21.412
Yeah?

255
00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:22.827
- Yeah. I mean it
sounds good to me.

256
00:14:22.827 --> 00:14:24.587
You know Mike Berry's my
favorite director in the world.

257
00:14:24.587 --> 00:14:26.451
- Eh. wait till you
meet him in person.

258
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:27.832
Anyway. doesn't matter.

259
00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:29.040
You gotta go home keep writing.

260
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.283
You got a gift okay.

261
00:14:30.283 --> 00:14:32.768
'cause nothing
frustrates me more

262
00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:36.703
than when I send those boys
and girls upstairs a stud

263
00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:38.567
and it turns out to
be a one-trick pony.

264
00:14:38.567 --> 00:14:40.120
- Sir. I just thank you.

265
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.881
I just really appreciate
you actually taking time

266
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:42.743
to meet with me.

267
00:14:42.743 --> 00:14:44.021
That was-

268
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:46.575
- Um. all right.
we're done here.

269
00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:48.232
Uh. don't call us.
we'll call you.

270
00:14:48.232 --> 00:14:50.786
you know all that good kind
of information and stuff.

271
00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:51.960
Come on come on.
- Okay.

272
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.375
- You like the shirt?
You feeling it?

273
00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:54.755
- Yeah. it looks good.
- No. I don't like it.

274
00:14:54.755 --> 00:14:55.998
- My wife bought it.
- All right.

275
00:14:55.998 --> 00:14:57.517
- Come on. how'd you
get here. bus. car?

276
00:14:57.517 --> 00:14:58.449
- [Darius] I took the car.

277
00:14:58.449 --> 00:14:59.933
- Okay. let's go find your car.

278
00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:01.348
Well. I'm not gonna help you
find it. but someone will.

279
00:15:01.348 --> 00:15:04.524
[lively. happy music]

280
00:15:05.663 --> 00:15:07.596
- All right. all right.

281
00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:15.017
Babe. it's happening.

282
00:15:15.017 --> 00:15:17.606
Right. it's happening
it's happening!

283
00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:18.918
Look. nothing's concrete yet.

284
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.609
but he definitely
likes my script.

285
00:15:22.507 --> 00:15:23.577
Well. yeah I'm just.

286
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.166
babe I'm just ready
to turn a corner

287
00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:28.410
and just start a new life
for the both of us. you know?

288
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.966
Right. yeah well look. I'm
on my way to my mom's house

289
00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.726
then I have to work.

290
00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.107
We'll celebrate later okay?

291
00:15:37.522 --> 00:15:40.215
Hey. wear that lingerie I like.

292
00:15:41.802 --> 00:15:43.114
All right. babe.

293
00:15:58.716 --> 00:16:00.683
- Hey Darius.
- Hey Ms. Jones.

294
00:16:00.683 --> 00:16:02.168
- Ain't seen you in a while.

295
00:16:02.168 --> 00:16:04.584
- Yeah. yeah I just been
busy with working. family.

296
00:16:04.584 --> 00:16:05.550
- Well praise the Lord.

297
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.035
- Praise the Lord Ms. Jones.

298
00:16:07.035 --> 00:16:08.484
- You can't praise him if
you're not going to church.

299
00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:09.969
- I go every day in
my heart Ms. Jones.

300
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.798
- The Bible says. "Where
there are two or three

301
00:16:11.798 --> 00:16:14.732
gathered together in His
name. there He is among them."

302
00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:16.078
- Okay. all right well look.

303
00:16:16.078 --> 00:16:17.977
I'm going in to see my mother.

304
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.702
So that makes two of us.

305
00:16:19.702 --> 00:16:21.981
So that'll mean God
will be present right?

306
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:22.843
- Come on here.

307
00:16:24.638 --> 00:16:26.675
God bless you Darius.
- You too Ms.Jones.

308
00:16:26.675 --> 00:16:27.917
- Take care now.

309
00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:28.849
- You look good
in that dress too.

310
00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:30.023
- Well all right. thank you.

311
00:16:34.303 --> 00:16:37.893
[melancholy music]

312
00:16:37.893 --> 00:16:39.722
- Ma. what did I tell you

313
00:16:39.722 --> 00:16:41.138
about leaving that
back door unlocked?

314
00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:44.106
- And hello to you too.

315
00:16:44.106 --> 00:16:46.695
- I'm serious. you can't
be doing that around here.

316
00:16:49.111 --> 00:16:51.493
So. what the doctor say?

317
00:16:52.356 --> 00:16:54.013
- Same thing as before.

318
00:16:55.669 --> 00:16:58.776
- I still think you should
consult with another specialist.

319
00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:00.191
just to get a second opinion.

320
00:17:00.191 --> 00:17:03.056
- Look. I've seen every
specialist from here to Maine.

321
00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.782
They all same the same thing.

322
00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:07.336
- I don't understand why-
- My heart

323
00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:08.993
just ain't strong enough.

324
00:17:08.993 --> 00:17:10.788
- Ma I don't understand
why you just won't check

325
00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:12.169
with another specialist.

326
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:15.310
- If God wants me to see
another doctor I will.

327
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.174
But He ain't spoke
to me about that yet.

328
00:17:17.174 --> 00:17:20.591
- Really Ma? You waiting on
God to tell you what to do?

329
00:17:22.006 --> 00:17:24.905
- It's all in His time
and it's all in His hands.

330
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:29.048
- He might be doing his
part up there. right.

331
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.877
but you have to do
your part down here.

332
00:17:30.877 --> 00:17:32.085
You just can't put it all on Him

333
00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:33.707
to make all your decisions.

334
00:17:33.707 --> 00:17:37.021
- Like I said. He ain't
spoke to me about that yet.

335
00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.651
You need to get to
church on Sunday.

336
00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:49.861
- Ma I ain't going
nowhere near that church.

337
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.346
- I cannot believe
the day has come

338
00:17:51.346 --> 00:17:53.313
that a son of mine
does not believe

339
00:17:53.313 --> 00:17:54.590
in the House of the Lord.

340
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.730
- No. I never said
I didn't believe.

341
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.803
I just. just don't
believe all of it.

342
00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:02.150
It's just a book.

343
00:18:11.918 --> 00:18:13.920
You know Fred
getting out tomorrow.

344
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.164
- Yeah. I heard.

345
00:18:17.544 --> 00:18:19.098
And before you start running
the streets with him.

346
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.376
you'd better make sure he
on the right side of things.

347
00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:22.687

701
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:52.279
[phone ringing]

709
00:37:15.578 --> 00:37:17.235

710
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:20.238

But you gotta talk to me baby

719
00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:49.232

You've been laying around here

724
00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:02.659
Pull yourself together Dee.

725
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:08.493
- [Darius] Whatever.

726
00:38:09.528 --> 00:38:11.565

727
00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:14.050
- [Darius] I'm tired.

728
00:38:19.573 --> 00:38:23.093
[gentle melancholy music]

729
00:38:49.188 --> 00:38:52.640
That was Granddad's chain right?

730
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.228
- Yeah it's my father's chain.

731
00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:58.681
He gave it to me
right before he died.

732
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:02.409
One day I'm gonna
give it to you.

733
00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:05.343
You know what that means?

734
00:39:06.999 --> 00:39:07.828
- No.

735
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:13.316
- [Raymond] It means that
I will always be with you.

736
00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:46.970
- Fuck.

737
00:39:49.076 --> 00:39:50.491
Fuck. fuck. fuck.

738
00:39:52.493 --> 00:39:55.841

739
00:40:07.474 --> 00:40:10.338
- Do you love me son?
- Yeah. of course.

740
00:40:10.338 --> 00:40:12.996
- Would you love me
any less if I was gone?

741
00:40:14.515 --> 00:40:17.794
- No. no I love
you just the same.

742
00:40:17.794 --> 00:40:21.039
[sadly dramatic music]

743
00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:47.859
Dammit Pops. why'd
you leave me here

744
00:40:47.859 --> 00:40:50.586
to deal with this
shit by myself?

745
00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:56.661
I needed you Pops! I needed you!

746
00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:04.116
[Darius sobbing]

747
00:41:15.887 --> 00:41:17.682
- [Vikki] She didn't
have no business

748
00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:19.477
wearing that damn outfit.

749
00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:21.168
- [Shantall] She swore
she was looking cute.

750
00:41:21.168 --> 00:41:22.997
- Girl. whole damn
stomach hanging out.

751
00:41:22.997 --> 00:41:24.585
looking like balled up homework.

752
00:41:25.793 --> 00:41:27.036
- Oh bring some glasses.

753
00:41:30.142 --> 00:41:33.249
- So what's up with Darius?

754
00:41:33.249 --> 00:41:35.182
- Girl. I don't know.

755
00:41:35.182 --> 00:41:37.495
He's going through something
and I don't know what to do.

756
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.255
- [Vikki] What is he saying?

757
00:41:39.255 --> 00:41:40.843
- He ain't saying much.

758
00:41:40.843 --> 00:41:43.017
just that he got
it under control.

759
00:41:43.017 --> 00:41:46.883
But I'm telling you.
he lost his job.

760
00:41:46.883 --> 00:41:48.747
he's sleeping all
day. moody as hell.

761
00:41:50.128 --> 00:41:52.579
And I saw where he was googling
depression in his phone.

762
00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:54.512
- But I'm sure
it'll all be fine.

763
00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:58.032
With love and prayer.
anything can be worked out.

764
00:41:58.032 --> 00:41:58.999
- You think he'd do
something to you?

765
00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:01.104
- No. Darius ain't like that.

766
00:42:01.104 --> 00:42:02.899
He's sweet and loving.

767
00:42:02.899 --> 00:42:04.936
He's just going through
something right now.

768
00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:06.627
- Well I ain't trying
to be negative.

769
00:42:06.627 --> 00:42:09.699
but my aunt's husband
had the same thing.

770
00:42:09.699 --> 00:42:11.598
He came home from work one day.

771
00:42:11.598 --> 00:42:13.392
parked his car in the driveway.

772
00:42:13.392 --> 00:42:15.843
walked in the garage
and hung hisself

773
00:42:15.843 --> 00:42:18.156
in the middle of day.
just hung hisself.

774
00:42:18.156 --> 00:42:21.573
- Oh my God. I feel
so bad for your aunt.

775
00:42:21.573 --> 00:42:23.092
She didn't know he was
going through something?

776
00:42:23.092 --> 00:42:26.647
- No. not at all.
just hung hisself.

777
00:42:26.647 --> 00:42:29.132
- Again. I'm sure
Darius will be fine.

778
00:42:29.132 --> 00:42:31.928
I think he just needs
to find his way back.

779
00:42:31.928 --> 00:42:32.964
- I hope so.

780
00:42:32.964 --> 00:42:34.413
- Look. I like Darius.

781
00:42:35.311 --> 00:42:37.071
I like him a lot.

782
00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:39.695
But if he tripping
like you say he is.

783
00:42:39.695 --> 00:42:42.974
you have to be careful.
for his safety and yours.

784
00:42:42.974 --> 00:42:45.252
And my only concern is
making sure you good.

785
00:42:47.979 --> 00:42:49.256
- [Woman] Um. okay girls.

786
00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:51.120
me and Vikki gonna
get out of here.

787
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.708
- Yeah Shan. call you later.

788
00:43:01.648 --> 00:43:05.755
- So that's what you talk
about with your friends.

789
00:43:05.755 --> 00:43:07.585
about my personal life?

790
00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:08.793
- It's not like that Dee.

791
00:43:08.793 --> 00:43:11.347
- Then how the hell
is it then Shan?

792
00:43:11.347 --> 00:43:13.798
You supposed to be my girl.

793
00:43:13.798 --> 00:43:15.006
Talk about you
wanna get married.

794
00:43:15.006 --> 00:43:16.524
but you think it's okay
to go behind my back

795
00:43:16.524 --> 00:43:19.527
to talk about my business
to everybody in the street?

796
00:43:19.527 --> 00:43:21.115
- They're not everybody
in the street Dee.

797
00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:22.392
Those are my friends.

798
00:43:23.566 --> 00:43:25.257
And I just needed
someone to vent to.

799
00:43:25.257 --> 00:43:26.638
- Needed someone to vent to?

800
00:43:28.329 --> 00:43:30.815
You know. it's so funny

801
00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:32.333
how you want me
to open up to you.

802
00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:35.026
but you go behind my back
and talk about my business.

803
00:43:35.026 --> 00:43:36.752
- What do you want me to do Dee?

804
00:43:36.752 --> 00:43:38.029
You're not telling me nothin'.

805
00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:40.341
You're telling me a little
here a little there.

806
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:41.549
and I don't know what to do.

807
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:43.310
- What. so you can
tell the whole world?

808
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:46.485
Look at me.

809
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:49.834
You know I ain't with that.

810
00:43:53.147 --> 00:43:53.976
Okay.

811
00:44:08.542 --> 00:44:11.131

I told her hell

00:45:00.249 --> 00:45:01.560
- I don't know. I'm just...

00:45:05.116 --> 00:45:06.462
Crazy mental space.

- Ease up? I need to turn

00:45:12.675 --> 00:45:14.366
You can't keep laying

but you moping around
ain't gonna help.

838
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:36.803
You gotta be stronger cuz.

00:45:36.803 --> 00:45:38.114
- Strong like who Fred?

840
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:40.945

That could've been an
accident or something.

845
00:45:46.226 --> 00:45:47.434
- It wasn't no accident.

846
00:45:48.435 --> 00:45:49.643
What you talking about?

847
00:45:51.956 --> 00:45:53.198
He blew his damn brains out

848
00:45:53.198 --> 00:45:54.475
because he was dealing
with the same thing

849
00:45:54.475 --> 00:45:55.960
I'm dealing with right now.

850
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.202
- [Fred] But you don't even
know what you're dealing with.

851
00:45:57.202 --> 00:45:58.445
- It ain't even

852
00:45:58.445 --> 00:46:00.585

853
00:46:00.585 --> 00:46:02.829
And he fought it for years Fred.

tell you how I feel.

858
00:46:11.527 --> 00:46:15.393

- [Darius] How bad was it?

1045
00:55:36.678 --> 00:55:38.024
- I just got a few bruises man.

1046
00:55:38.024 --> 00:55:40.129

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:48.621

1050
00:55:48.621 --> 00:55:50.726
- [Darius] Yo. you know
Poncho gonna be pissed bruh.

1051
00:55:50.726 --> 00:55:53.419

00:56:11.575 --> 00:56:13.749

But these pills. they

1057
00:56:17.753 --> 00:56:19.652
Shan would have my ass if
she knew I wasn't taking 'em.

1058
00:56:19.652 --> 00:56:21.792
- You need to toss that whole
bottle in the trash man.

1059
00:56:21.792 --> 00:56:23.103
You don't need that bruh.

1060
00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:25.416
- Yeah. but I stopped.

1061
00:56:25.416 --> 00:56:27.314
- Damn right you need to stop.

1062
00:56:27.314 --> 00:56:28.557
Them pills is for
people who can't cope

1063
00:56:28.557 --> 00:56:30.145

These streets'll eat you alive

1067
00:56:36.496 --> 00:56:37.980

1070
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:44.849
Not even people talkin'

[gentle nostalgic music]

1074
00:57:14.707 --> 00:57:17.157
- Hey Darius. come here son.

1075
00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:24.924
Come over here.

1076
00:57:35.037 --> 00:57:40.042
Look at you sad 'cause you
ain't starting on the team.

1077
00:57:40.767 --> 00:57:41.699
What now you wanna quit?

1078
00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:49.707
What'd you bat when you
play baseball with Elijah?

1079
00:57:50.915 --> 00:57:51.744
- 287.

1080
00:57:53.642 --> 00:57:56.714
- [Raymond] What'd you average
last winter on the hoop team?

1081
00:57:56.714 --> 00:57:57.888
- 10 and nine.

1082
00:58:00.028 --> 00:58:01.788
- 287 and 10 and nine.

1083
00:58:03.756 --> 00:58:05.861
You was all in.

1084
00:58:05.861 --> 00:58:07.760
But now. just 'cause you
ain't the man this time.

1085
00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.588
you wanna quit.

1086
00:58:10.038 --> 00:58:11.522
Life don't work that way. son.

1087
00:58:12.696 --> 00:58:14.698
You can't just give up
'cause things get rough.

1088
00:58:16.251 --> 00:58:18.943
- I can't be on the bench while
all my friends are starting.

1089
00:58:20.324 --> 00:58:22.119
- Let me tell you
something. Darius.

1090
00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:25.950
Every day I wanna give up
on things. but I can't.

1091
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:28.539
Believe me son.

1092
00:58:30.023 --> 00:58:33.199
I wish I had the chance to do
half the things you get to do.

1093
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:38.066
Can't give up son.
Keep fightin'.

1094
00:58:39.101 --> 00:58:41.897
Keep pushing. Keep believin'.

1095
00:58:46.074 --> 00:58:48.386
I just wish I had
more time with you.

1096
00:58:52.011 --> 00:58:52.839
Darius.

1097
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:57.568
I'm batting zero
son. [gun fires]

1098
00:59:22.524 --> 00:59:24.526
- Hey. how was your day?

1099
00:59:26.217 --> 00:59:28.910
- [Darius] Good. It was good.

1100
00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:32.983
- How are the pills working?

1101
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:35.433
- Good.

1102
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.885
I'm beginning to feel
like myself again.

1103
00:59:38.885 --> 00:59:41.508
- That's funny. because
this pill bottle

1104
00:59:42.751 --> 00:59:44.581
looks mighty full to me.

1105
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.099
- Look Shan-
- Don't open your damn mouth

1106
00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:48.688
to lie Dee. don't say a word.

1107
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:52.968
The doctor told you to
take these pills every day.

1108
00:59:52.968 --> 00:59:54.660
Did he or did he not?

1109
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.351
- Listen-
- Did he or did he not Dee?

1110
00:59:56.351 --> 00:59:58.664
- He did. but them things
were making me jittery.

1111
00:59:58.664 --> 01:00:00.735
- Jittery or depressed.
take your pick.

1112
01:00:03.703 --> 01:00:06.188
- I'm tryin'.
- Tryin' what?

1113
01:00:06.188 --> 01:00:07.431
- Tryin' to call Dr. Franz.

1114
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:08.605
because I looked
through your phone

1115
01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.020
and I don't see her
number nowhere in there.

1116
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.021
Keep lyin' to me.

1117
01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:13.610
- Why are you on my back?

1118
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.335
- Because I love you Dee.
that's why I'm on your back.

1119
01:00:15.335 --> 01:00:17.614
- Well get off. because
I don't like it.

1120
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.615
- You don't like it?

1121
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.928
You don't like it. okay.

1122
01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:24.655
So you don't like it when
someone's trying to help you.

1123
01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:28.486
You don't like it when
someone's telling you the truth?

1124
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:33.008
No. Darius just wants to be
a selfish ass little kid.

1125
01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:36.080
I don't care if
you don't like it.

1126
01:00:37.979 --> 01:00:39.497
How am I supposed to help you

1127
01:00:39.497 --> 01:00:41.465
when you don't even
wanna help yourself?

1128
01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:44.192
Stupid.

1129
01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.575
[melancholy music]

1130
01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:13.359
- Hi. I'd like to make an
appointment with Dr. Franz.

1131
01:01:16.603 --> 01:01:17.432
Okay.

1132
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.264
- Hello Mr. Thomas.
I'm Kathy Franz.

1133
01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:23.852
- Hello Dr. Franz.

1134
01:01:23.852 --> 01:01:26.199
- Please just
Kathy's fine. okay?

1135
01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.548
So. what brings
you to my office?

1136
01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:37.348
- I guess I'm all messed up.

1137
01:01:37.348 --> 01:01:38.936
- You're not all messed up.

1138
01:01:38.936 --> 01:01:41.421
You're just dealing
with life's issues

1139
01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:43.251
the best that you can.

1140
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:47.255
So again. what brings
you to my office?

1141
01:01:49.844 --> 01:01:53.364
- I guess I'm just dealin'
with some things like.

1142
01:01:58.197 --> 01:02:01.200
I don't think I've ever gotten
over the death of my father.

1143
01:02:02.857 --> 01:02:05.204
I keep seeing him
in my dreams. happy.

1144
01:02:05.204 --> 01:02:07.585
but then it just goes
completely wrong.

1145
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:14.040
- The chain on your neck.

1146
01:02:17.803 --> 01:02:18.873
Tell me about that.

1147
01:02:22.014 --> 01:02:23.912
- He gave it to
me before he died.

1148
01:02:25.327 --> 01:02:27.605
And his father did
the same thing.

1149
01:02:27.605 --> 01:02:29.987
I've worn it ever
since I was little.

1150
01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:34.820
- So it's almost as if it
links you to both of them?

1151
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.099
- Yeah.

1152
01:02:39.272 --> 01:02:40.515
Yeah.

1153
01:02:40.515 --> 01:02:43.518
- Wow. Mr. Thomas. I must say.

1154
01:02:43.518 --> 01:02:46.452
you are very in tune
with your feelings.

1155
01:02:46.452 --> 01:02:47.764
And that is a good thing.

1156
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.149
It is going to take some
truths that are hard to face

1157
01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:56.289
in order to deal
with your depression.

1158
01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:57.118
- I just wanna do
whatever I have to do.

1159
01:02:58.015 --> 01:02:59.396
- Good.

1160
01:02:59.396 --> 01:03:01.847
Well. first things first.

1161
01:03:01.847 --> 01:03:03.952
I want you back on the Celexa.

1162
01:03:03.952 --> 01:03:07.438
Now. we'll lower the dose.

1163
01:03:07.438 --> 01:03:09.164
and that with some
time will help you

1164
01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:10.821
with your jitters. agreed?

1165
01:03:13.479 --> 01:03:18.484
Now. next. I want you to
sit and talk with everyone

1166
01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:20.797
in your circle of trust.

1167
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:26.112
Explain to them where
your life is right now

1168
01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:27.804
and how they can help.

1169
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.081
- Well that's easy.

1170
01:03:29.081 --> 01:03:31.635
It's my mother. my
girlfriend Shantell.

1171
01:03:31.635 --> 01:03:33.119
and my cousin Fred.

1172
01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:36.951
But they all see my
situation differently.

1173
01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:41.576
My girlfriend just
wants it to go away.

1174
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:45.752
And she says she understands.
but I don't think she does.

1175
01:03:46.892 --> 01:03:48.652
And my mother wants
me to pray it out

1176
01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:50.550
and my cousin wants
me to thug it out.

1177
01:03:52.552 --> 01:03:57.557
- Well. just try your best to
explain to them individually

1178
01:03:57.557 --> 01:03:59.525
what you need from them.

1179
01:04:01.044 --> 01:04:03.563
There is absolutely no reason

1180
01:04:03.563 --> 01:04:05.600
why you can't have a good life.

1181
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:09.362
both happy and
fulfilled. all right?

1182
01:04:11.123 --> 01:04:13.297
- No problem.
- Great.

1183
01:04:13.297 --> 01:04:15.299
- I look forward to
seeing you next week.

1184
01:04:18.302 --> 01:04:21.133
[uplifting music]

1185
01:04:28.347 --> 01:04:29.831
- The therapist wants
me to meet with everyone

1186
01:04:29.831 --> 01:04:32.627
in my circle to kinda
explain what's going on.

1187
01:04:32.627 --> 01:04:35.112
- Okay. so that everyone that
needs to know knows. right?

1188
01:04:35.112 --> 01:04:38.875
- Yeah. but I just need you
all to know that I just.

1189
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:42.050
I just really needs your words.

1190
01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:43.327
I know you guys love me.

1191
01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:45.709
but other times I
just need silence.

1192
01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:48.643
I think I just need to
process things on my own.

1193
01:04:48.643 --> 01:04:51.784
- But what about Fred? Does he
know you're seeing therapist?

1194
01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:53.337
- No. not yet.

1195
01:04:53.337 --> 01:04:55.753
But come on babe. Fred is Fred.

1196
01:04:55.753 --> 01:04:57.203
He just wants me
to be super thug

1197
01:04:57.203 --> 01:04:58.860
and everything is gonna be okay.

1198
01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.688
- Right.

1199
01:05:01.138 --> 01:05:02.312
- I'm actually supposed to
meet up with him later on

1200
01:05:02.312 --> 01:05:04.452
to kinda explain
what I need from him.

1201
01:05:04.452 --> 01:05:06.799
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1202
01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:09.526
- And the therapist
wants me to meet with her

1203
01:05:09.526 --> 01:05:10.596
at least once a week.

1204
01:05:11.838 --> 01:05:14.634
And I want you to
start coming with me.

1205
01:05:15.773 --> 01:05:18.052
- Whatever you need
baby. I'm here.

1206
01:05:18.052 --> 01:05:19.846
- Yeah. I know.

[gentle music]

1208

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.829
The pain just got too
heavy for me to hold.

I feel like I took
the easy way out.

But life seemed hard.

1391
01:20:20.574 --> 01:20:21.402
- Maybe.

1392

Depends.

everything that
it represents son.

1396
01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.175
