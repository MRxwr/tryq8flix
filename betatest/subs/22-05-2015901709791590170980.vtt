00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:23.250
[screaming]

4
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:35.964
Shh!

5
00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:37.599
Oh. shut your mouth.

6
00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.718
[airplane]

7
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.861
[background chatter]

8
00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.699
[motorcycle honks]

9
00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.760
They're here.

10
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:46.901
What time is it?

11
00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.703
[Tamme] I don't know.
I lost my watch.

12
00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.270
A lot of good you are!

13
00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:58.913
[men outside speaking German]

14
00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.521
[dramatic music]

15
00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:17.965
[explosion]

16
00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.270
[yelling]

17
00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.709
Time for some fun.

18
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.611
[speaking in German]

19
00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:02.009
[Tamme] Look here! A new watch!

20
00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:05.012
And it's got a stopwatch!

21
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.784
I surrender.

22
00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:11.886
- [background chatter]
- [typewriter clacking]

23
00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:15.757
[bell rings]

24
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.391
[bell rings]

25
00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.607
[Pirard] Gentlemen.

26
00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.476
That is the plan.

27
00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.715
Desperate times.
desperate measures.

28
00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:43.885
[muffled explosion]

29
00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:47.454
Lieutenant Maes.

30
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.056
the head
of the Belgian government

31
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.058
selected you to lead
this operation.

32
00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:51.993
Mm.

33
00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.561
Good.

34
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.963
Admiral Godfrey has agreed

35
00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:58.465
to give us
British logistical support.

36
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.635
That was before I knew the plan.

37
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.970
What you need
is psychological support.

38
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:05.039
- [Maes chuckles]
- We understand you have

39
00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.808
different priorities.

40
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.511
but all we're asking for
is the boat and the prisoner.

41
00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.079
[Godfrey] Christ Almighty!

42
00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:13.848
where are you going to find
a crew that's up to this?

43
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.550
[Pirard] We took care of that.

44
00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:17.685
We selected a group

45
00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:20.855
of loyal. well-trained
Belgian soldiers.

46
00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:21.989
I want the bad eggs.

47
00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:23.090
[spits]

48
00:05:23.124 --> 00:05:24.692
That's not what we discussed.

49
00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:25.927
[Godfrey] The British army
have been looking

50
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.695
for these lunatics for months.

51
00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:30.998
Their status on our files
is shoot on sight.

52
00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:32.767
[Pirard] Relax. Admiral.

53
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.503
Nobody even knows
where they are.

54
00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:43.044
[Godfrey] Withholding
the whereabouts of those people

55
00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:45.412
will see you face court martial.

56
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:48.683
My chances of surviving
a firing squad

57
00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.417
are considerably higher

58
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.352
than surviving
this mission. sir.

59
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.657
They might be insane.
but so is this goddamn plan.

60
00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:04.098
Desperate times...
Desperate measures.

61
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.000
[dramatic music]

62
00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:22.415
[Filip] Ask what you like.
but for Christ's sake. relax.

63
00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:24.085
We still need him.

64
00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:25.820
- Anyone fancy an apple?
- [Filip] Later. Tamme.

65
00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.755
- Stan. you?
- Not now.

66
00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.957
- [Werner] Hello?
- [man on radio] <i>Hello. Werner?</i>

67
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:31.559
- Hello.
- [man] <i>Werner. can you hear me?</i>

68
00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:33.060
[Werner] Yes. we...
We have the package.

69
00:06:33.094 --> 00:06:34.528
[man] Sorry. repeat?

70
00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:36.429
I repeat.
we have the package.

71
00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:39.133
[man] <i>Roger that. The mailman
will pick it up at noon.</i>

72
00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.968
<i>Now. make sure Stan</i>

73
00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.436
<i>doesn't damage the package
this time. will you?</i>

74
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.975
Well. uh. he's just asking
the package a few questions.

75
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.543
[man] <i>I'm serious now.</i>

76
00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.780
[screaming]

77
00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:58.019
Six. after shooting
that big. fat bear.

78
00:06:58.052 --> 00:06:59.620
- I've got six.
- The fat guy?

79
00:06:59.654 --> 00:07:00.922
Yeah. the big fat one.

80
00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.523
Don't be stupid. mate.
I shot the fat...

81
00:07:02.556 --> 00:07:04.992
- [click]
- Ah! God damn it!

82
00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:08.195
[Nadine] Come on. you bastard!

83
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:09.931
You said I could go
with you this time!

84
00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:11.699
Was last minute!

85
00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.502
Always the same thing
around here!

86
00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:18.639
These potatoes are sprouting.

87
00:07:18.673 --> 00:07:20.508
Yeah. then do
the shopping yourself!

88
00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.045
I've had it!

89
00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:26.113
[screaming]

90
00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:29.216
There's not a lot he can tell us
with his lungs full of water.

91
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.751
How long now?

92
00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:34.956
One minute sixteen.

93
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.490
That's enough.

94
00:07:37.525 --> 00:07:39.226
[gasping]

95
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.696
[Filip] Hey. actually we're all
pretty friendly around here.

96
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.065
Yeah. we're all very friendly
around here.

97
00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:46.033
Do you want some water?

98
00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.635
Alright. get out.

99
00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:51.672
Hey. just try to answer
our questions. please.

100
00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:53.007
[Stan] This is for you.

101
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.608
Just tell him what he needs...
Look out!

102
00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:01.983
[explosion]

103
00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:05.252
[man] <i>Werner. what's that?</i>

104
00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:06.954
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

105
00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:09.056
- Uh. uh. uh...
- <i>The package is okay. right?</i>

106
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.659
- Uh. I-I hear nothing.
- [man] <i>Werner?</i>

107
00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:14.028
- <i>I just heard a very loud bang...</i>
- Over and out!

108
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.667
Damn it. they'll be coming
to fetch him soon!

109
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.935
[Werner] Stan!

110
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.570
Now he's going to take up
less room.

111
00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:25.272
[military music]

112
00:08:29.043 --> 00:08:30.611
[Jager] Forget it.

113
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:35.850
With all due respect.

114
00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.928
Your son Dieter...

115
00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:50.831
Yep.

116
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:54.268
I see the resemblance.

117
00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:07.715
KILLED IN ACTION

118
00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:12.653
- How?
- [Maes] Shrapnel.

119
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.989
No further information.

120
00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.900
Why are you telling me that?

121
00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:33.007
Do you really thing I'd betray
my country because of that?

122
00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:36.143
This is war.

123
00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:38.879
We've all lost someone.

124
00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:41.982
It's not about who we've lost.

125
00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.253
It's about who
we can still save.

126
00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.264
His name is Franz.

127
00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.234
Yep.

128
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.337
The boy was named
after his grandfather.

129
00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:11.779
[peaceful music]

130
00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:23.824
You alright?

131
00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:25.259
No. I'm not alright.

132
00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:27.862
I'm fed up with just doing
all of the shopping

133
00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:29.730
and prying bullets
out of people.

134
00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:31.866
I want another job.

135
00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:33.968
He just wants to protect
his little girl. that's all.

136
00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:36.270
- Leave me alone.
- Sorry. Hey...

137
00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:40.708
Actually. I found something
that might interest you.

138
00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:42.710
Here...

139
00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.311
What's that?

140
00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:47.681
A B cartridge. I think it said.

141
00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:49.750
I found a whole case of them.

142
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.752
It's just the right caliber.

143
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.421
First a kiss.

144
00:10:57.725 --> 00:10:59.160
[clicking]

145
00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:06.901
Let's see what it can do.

146
00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:10.371
[loud shot]

147
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.242
[Filip] Wow.

148
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.212
Not really ideal for hunting.

149
00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:19.747
[chuckles]

150
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.248
[Van Praag] Come on. then.

151
00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:25.219
Come on. Fons. Come on. Fons!

152
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.188
- Come on!
- [Fons] Oh!

153
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:28.889
[laughter]

154
00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:32.159
Yes! The best lefty
in Europe. huh!

155
00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:34.161
Come on. now. let's hear it!

156
00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:35.763
[Van Praag yells]

157
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.465
Oh. come on!
Is that the best you can do

158
00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.901
playing for the biggest club
in Flanders?

159
00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.170
Come on!

160
00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:46.407
[Tamme] Is that all?

161
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.842
You'd be better off hunting
more and screwing less.

162
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:50.110
[hushes]

163
00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:00.821
[gasping]

164
00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.757
[ominous music]

165
00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:12.466
[tense music]

166
00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:14.001
[labored breathing]

167
00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.377
[woman] Stan?

168
00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:27.081
Stan. there's a German car
parked in the wood.

169
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.954
Darling?

170
00:12:35.557 --> 00:12:36.924
[gunshots]

171
00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:38.392
- [thud]
- [muffled screaming]

172
00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.973
[chuckles]

173
00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:54.942
Your wife. I would presume?

174
00:12:59.614 --> 00:13:00.848
Here...

175
00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:05.520
You can sell it to the Jews.

176
00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:11.925
Where have you hidden them?

177
00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:16.830
[spits]

178
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.036
Gunther?

179
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.540
Fill up the bathtub.

180
00:13:30.578 --> 00:13:32.980
[gasping]

181
00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:54.401
I've been to the post office.

182
00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.937
Still nothing.

183
00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:59.340
You don't suppose
something's happened?

184
00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:00.874
I'm sure
she would have written...

185
00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:02.443
I told you to put that
out of your mind.

186
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.412
The mail is intercepted
at the French border.

187
00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:09.950
[chuckles]

188
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:14.221
I was thinking that little Louis
is probably already walking.

189
00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.593
Sorry.

190
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:22.863
We've got a visitor. Come.

191
00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:34.174
Hey.

192
00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:45.185
Hey.

193
00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:47.622
[Peter] I need
that German's briefcase.

194
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:52.960
Yeah. uh...
Everything's still in it. so...

195
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.362
And the Fritz?
He's got crucial information

196
00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:57.565
about troop movements
in the Ardennes.

197
00:14:57.599 --> 00:14:59.166
Yeah. erm...

198
00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:01.335
The Fritz is still in the bath.

199
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.272
You've got to be joking!

200
00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:10.310
His head
must be around here somewhere.

201
00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:15.983
Jesus. Stan!
This is no laughing matter.

202
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.252
[Stan] I laughed my head off.

203
00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:22.289
Any news?

204
00:15:26.761 --> 00:15:30.063
I have to tell you that this
is a very special mission.

205
00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:33.934
Congo?

206
00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:36.638
Finally getting out
of these fucking woods.

207
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:38.205
I've even got ticks
on my balls.

208
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.407
But Fritz isn't in the Congo.

209
00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:43.444
Forget it.
we're fine right here.

210
00:15:43.878 --> 00:15:46.380
The mission is of vital
strategical importance.

211
00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:47.715
We couldn't give a shit.

212
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:49.249
We kill Krauts.
that's strategic enough.

213
00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.586
- Oh. do whatever you want.
- Hey.

214
00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:53.588
What do these figures
down at the bottom mean?

215
00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:55.322
[Peter] It's what you get paid.

216
00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.625
Hey. Van Praag.
you can buy your football team!

217
00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:59.092
[Van Praag] Great.

218
00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:01.395
Maybe they'll even let you
play again.

219
00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.665
Why not?

220
00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:05.132
As long as I'm wearing this
around my neck. Fons.

221
00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:07.000
it's not going to happen.

222
00:16:11.539 --> 00:16:13.240
Oh. yeah. one more thing.

223
00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.709
I forgot to say that
the mission would result

224
00:16:14.742 --> 00:16:17.311
in a whole bunch
of dead Nazis.

225
00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.046
[horse snorts]

226
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:27.488
And she would be a lot safer.
too. right?

227
00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:29.122
[military music]

228
00:16:35.563 --> 00:16:38.165
[engines roaring]

229
00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:56.718
BELGIAN CONGO

230
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:01.188
[ship horn]

231
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.790
Alright. wake up. gentlemen!
We're there.

232
00:17:02.824 --> 00:17:05.827
Hey. hey. bloody hell. man.
Be reasonable.

233
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.595
Oh. well then.

234
00:17:07.629 --> 00:17:10.030
you shouldn't have got so pissed
then. should you?

235
00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:14.234
Alright. there it is. men!
Take a look.

236
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:23.645
[music swells]

237
00:17:56.878 --> 00:17:59.446
[Tamme] What's up?
You're turning green.

238
00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:02.282
I just don't like water.

239
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.152
- I can't swim.
- [laughs]

240
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.822
Maybe they have water wings!

241
00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:15.697
Men. welcome to Africa.

242
00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:21.268
I told you that it
was a special mission.

243
00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:23.337
Come.

244
00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:35.215
Don't touch anything.

245
00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:38.151
[Klisse] Jesus. it stinks.

246
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:43.223
[Maes] Okay. men.

247
00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:47.294
For those of you who aren't
very good in geography.

248
00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:49.831
we are right here.

249
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.735
And our destination
is here. America.

250
00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.169
The mission's objective:

251
00:18:56.203 --> 00:18:57.905
transporting a cargo
of raw materials

252
00:18:57.939 --> 00:19:00.474
of crucial importance
to the Allies.

253
00:19:01.876 --> 00:19:03.276
Uranium.

254
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.781
- [Werner] Uranium?
- What in God's name is that?

255
00:19:06.814 --> 00:19:09.383
I've heard of it.
it's used to color glass.

256
00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:11.418
And those watch hands
that light up

257
00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:13.320
in the dark are also made
of uranium.

258
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:16.356
Oh. yeah? I'd really like
to have one of those.

259
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.559
You can't see this one
in the dark.

260
00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:20.828
So we're going on
a secret mission

261
00:19:20.862 --> 00:19:22.496
in a German U-boat
so that Roosevelt

262
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.197
can tell the time at night?

263
00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:27.200
It'll be used to build a bomb.

264
00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.505
And not just any bomb.
but one that can raze

265
00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:32.406
a city to the ground.

266
00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:34.842
Destruction radius
of a few kilometers.

267
00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:37.845
The Germans have
their top scientists

268
00:19:37.879 --> 00:19:40.748
working on it.
The Americans can't lag behind.

269
00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.719
The Shinkolobwe mines
owned by the Union here in Congo

270
00:19:44.752 --> 00:19:47.287
are the biggest source
of uranium in the world.

271
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.691
and Roosevelt
has purchased a few tons

272
00:19:49.724 --> 00:19:52.192
in alliance
with the Belgian government.

273
00:19:54.028 --> 00:19:56.296
- We just have to get it there.
- Yup.

274
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:00.501
We've got to pilot
this ourselves?

275
00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:03.303
You'll get three weeks
of training.

276
00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:05.840
Theory and practice.
that's not a lot.

277
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:07.542
So start studying.

278
00:20:07.575 --> 00:20:09.677
'cause this is one exam
you can't afford to fail.

279
00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:12.914
Right. on deck. 15 minutes.

280
00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:17.819
So we're nothing
but a bunch of chauffeurs.

281
00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:20.888
[Filip] Yeah. well.
this is one hell of a limo.

282
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.593
Can you do that somewhere else?
Like behind a curtain?

283
00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:28.428
Don't be such a child.
I'm sweating like a pig.

284
00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:30.031
[Tamme] Yeah. Stan.

285
00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:31.899
It's not like we've never seen
her in the raw before.

286
00:20:37.872 --> 00:20:41.441
I mean. not in a sexual way
or anything. right?

287
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.812
No. like when she was washing
in that stream.

288
00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:47.414
Totally. totally innocent. Stan.

289
00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:48.783
And from far away.

290
00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:50.952
Real far. We couldn't see.

291
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:53.286
We could only see
with binoculars.

292
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.655
[Nadine] You perverts!

293
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:02.764
[dramatic music]

294
00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:14.776
Hey. blimey. Where'd you get
this bloody thing?

295
00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:15.977
Confidential.

296
00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:19.346
Right. Well...

297
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.316
Right. come on you! One Kraut.

298
00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:25.052
As ordered.

299
00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:26.319
Thank you.

300
00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:28.656
What's this?

301
00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:33.426
Franz Jager. a German captain.
He's going to train us.

302
00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:35.997
If you think I'm going
to America with a Nazi.

303
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.598
then you need to think again.

304
00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:39.901
It's just for training.
I'm the captain.

305
00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:43.037
He was the commander of a U-boat
from '14 to '18.

306
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.073
He knows U-boats
inside and out. Stan!

307
00:21:47.608 --> 00:21:49.476
You thinking what I'm thinking?

308
00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:52.479
But there aren't
any bathtubs on board.

309
00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:01.488
[Jager]
Good morning. gentlemen.

310
00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:03.423
I've been instructed
to teach you

311
00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:06.493
how to operate this U-boat
in three weeks.

312
00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:09.063
Well. this is impossible.

313
00:22:12.133 --> 00:22:15.736
It's tantamount to suicide.

314
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:19.774
It takes highly intelligent
German officers

315
00:22:19.807 --> 00:22:21.509
at least 12 months.

316
00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:24.612
But since I will not be going
with you.

317
00:22:24.912 --> 00:22:27.014
I sincerely don't give a shit.

318
00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:30.818
And so. we have the front
of the boat. the bow.

319
00:22:30.852 --> 00:22:33.154
This is the front torpedo room.

320
00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:35.923
We have four torpedo tubes.

321
00:22:36.724 --> 00:22:40.695
Torpedoes. Very heavy.
Over 1.000 kilograms each.

322
00:22:41.128 --> 00:22:43.430
But this is no concern to you

323
00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:45.800
because you will not shoot
a torpedo.

324
00:22:46.234 --> 00:22:48.669
[Maes] Men. this is
a transport mission.

325
00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:50.470
not an attack mission.

326
00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:52.640
Oh. yeah? And if we have
to defend ourselves. what then?

327
00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:53.908
We dive then.

328
00:22:55.176 --> 00:22:59.647
Toilet. captain's cabin.
officers' beds.

329
00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:02.415
Officers' mess.

330
00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:03.951
[Werner] Woah!

331
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:06.354
Here. the radio room.

332
00:23:06.687 --> 00:23:08.890
This is a 200-watt transmitter.

333
00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:14.061
[Jager] Command room.
this is the heart of the boat.

334
00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:16.163
From here. the captain decides
about everything

335
00:23:16.197 --> 00:23:17.832
except the tides.

336
00:23:18.498 --> 00:23:21.102
From here. he decides
about life and death.

337
00:23:25.573 --> 00:23:27.141
Sleeping quarters.

338
00:23:27.174 --> 00:23:29.510
You share them in two shifts.

339
00:23:29.543 --> 00:23:32.546
As you can see. we have plenty
of space on board.

340
00:23:33.648 --> 00:23:35.016
The galley.

341
00:23:35.783 --> 00:23:37.685
Second important room.

342
00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:40.054
Keep the cook your friend.

343
00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:42.723
You might as well get started
on the potatoes.

344
00:23:42.757 --> 00:23:45.059
[Van Praag laughs] Woo!

345
00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:47.828
[Jager] The machine room.

346
00:23:47.862 --> 00:23:49.597
[Klisse] Diesel?

347
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.799
[Jager] Diesel on the surface.
electric underwater.

348
00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:53.567
[Tamme] Twelve hundred
horsepower at least!

349
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:55.903
[Jager] Three thousand
two hundred. actually.

350
00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:59.040
Motorenwerke Mannheim.
best machines ever built.

351
00:23:59.073 --> 00:24:00.841
This puts my dad's tractor
to shame!

352
00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:02.176
[Werner] Still far to go?

353
00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:05.880
[Jager] This is
the aft torpedo room.

354
00:24:05.913 --> 00:24:07.615
the last room on the boat.

355
00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:09.183
Here we have
two electric engines.

356
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.954
One torpedo.
and one torpedo tube.

357
00:24:14.055 --> 00:24:18.192
Well. these are the basics.

358
00:24:18.693 --> 00:24:22.196
As you can see.
this is a highly complex

359
00:24:22.229 --> 00:24:24.131
and sophisticated machine.

360
00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:26.901
- One wrong move and...
- [rumbling]

361
00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:28.903
Jesus!

362
00:24:29.437 --> 00:24:32.940
And so. you men had better
brace yourself.

363
00:24:32.974 --> 00:24:34.909
You've got three weeks
to learn it.

364
00:24:39.814 --> 00:24:41.849
[Maes] Okay. job assignments.

365
00:24:42.216 --> 00:24:44.819
Stan. as first officer.
you ensure my orders

366
00:24:44.852 --> 00:24:45.886
are carried out.

367
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.922
Tamme. Klisse. the engines.

368
00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:49.957
Werner. radio and sonar.

369
00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:51.726
Filip and Fons. steering.

370
00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:55.529
Van Praag. trim tanks. Okay?
Come on. time for class.

371
00:24:55.563 --> 00:24:57.098
And me? I don't have a job.

372
00:24:58.099 --> 00:25:00.201
[sighs] Why don't you tell her?

373
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:02.069
What?

374
00:25:02.536 --> 00:25:04.538
I've made some arrangements.

375
00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:09.143
Um. when they deliver
the uranium.

376
00:25:09.643 --> 00:25:12.880
you'll be taken to a nearby
plantation by the delivery boat.

377
00:25:13.214 --> 00:25:14.682
It'll be safer there.

378
00:25:14.715 --> 00:25:16.017
You can't just leave me
in Africa.

379
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.318
if you think I'm going to...

380
00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:19.053
You're not going
in this bloody coffin.

381
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.692
[Jager]
An U-boat crew has to work

382
00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:27.028
like a well-oiled machine.
together.

383
00:25:27.628 --> 00:25:30.598
You all know the phrase
"one for all. all for one?"

384
00:25:31.332 --> 00:25:33.734
On an U-boat.
this is not just a phrase.

385
00:25:35.036 --> 00:25:36.170
This is reality.

386
00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:38.139
[dramatic music]

387
00:25:38.172 --> 00:25:41.208
Pulley... Pulley system.
Pulley system pulley.

388
00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:42.676
This wheel here.

389
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.311
- it aims the hydrophone.
- The hydrophone.

390
00:25:45.813 --> 00:25:48.949
This here is
the main transmitter control.

391
00:25:48.983 --> 00:25:50.718
and this button here...

392
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:53.054
Changes the frequency
to broadband communication.

393
00:25:54.755 --> 00:25:56.657
And that's the receiver.

394
00:26:04.165 --> 00:26:05.699
[chatter]

395
00:26:05.733 --> 00:26:07.635
[muttering in German]

396
00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:10.871
Guys. this manual is just
too complicated.

397
00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:13.074
It's too complicated.
and in German!

398
00:26:17.011 --> 00:26:18.612
[music swells]

399
00:26:18.646 --> 00:26:20.781
- [clank]
- [air hisses]

400
00:26:24.118 --> 00:26:25.352
[clanking]

401
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.334
[laughing]

402
00:26:41.235 --> 00:26:42.870
[both] Yeah!

403
00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:50.177
To dive. the air is blown out
of the ballast tanks

404
00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:51.912
which fill the water.

405
00:26:51.946 --> 00:26:54.181
And to surface.
it's the opposite.

406
00:26:54.215 --> 00:26:55.950
The water is pumped out

407
00:26:55.983 --> 00:26:58.786
and it fills with air
under high pressure. Got it?

408
00:27:00.321 --> 00:27:03.390
And if you're underwater
and you have to do a number two.

409
00:27:03.424 --> 00:27:04.959
and you flush it.

410
00:27:04.992 --> 00:27:06.727
does the shit go
to the ballast tank

411
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.995
or straight into the sea?

412
00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:09.763
- What?
- That's stupid.

413
00:27:09.797 --> 00:27:12.166
No. that's not
a stupid question.

414
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.269
If you don't send it out
in the water. it could...

415
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.340
Is there something wrong
with your stomach? Oh?

416
00:27:28.048 --> 00:27:30.217
- You going in?
- No.

417
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:33.320
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Suit yourself.

418
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:40.928
[Filip] Short. short.
short. long...

419
00:27:41.962 --> 00:27:45.933
Shot. short. short
and long...

420
00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:47.334
[laughs]

421
00:27:47.368 --> 00:27:49.370
And what does that mean?

422
00:27:49.403 --> 00:27:50.838
You...

423
00:27:51.172 --> 00:27:53.841
Have really beautiful...

424
00:27:55.976 --> 00:27:57.044
tits.

425
00:27:57.077 --> 00:27:58.812
[both laugh]

426
00:27:59.947 --> 00:28:01.182
You're an idiot.

427
00:28:01.682 --> 00:28:03.918
Is that all you learned
in class?

428
00:28:05.319 --> 00:28:06.921
The only thing I remember.

429
00:28:09.323 --> 00:28:11.091
It's our last night together.

430
00:28:14.228 --> 00:28:16.330
Maybe I can make him
change his mind.

431
00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:19.033
No. he won't budge.

432
00:28:21.802 --> 00:28:23.971
He also got Mama
to leave without me.

433
00:28:30.077 --> 00:28:31.478
- Hey?
- Hm?

434
00:28:31.912 --> 00:28:34.481
At least we can say
goodbye properly.

435
00:28:34.516 --> 00:28:36.784
Yeah. that's true.

436
00:29:03.244 --> 00:29:04.878
[ship horn]

437
00:29:16.957 --> 00:29:18.959
[Tyrone] Jenga. toss the rope!

438
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.472
What. you got something
against blacks?

439
00:29:31.506 --> 00:29:33.173
I just don't want
the banana man touching me.

440
00:29:33.207 --> 00:29:34.241
you know?

441
00:29:34.275 --> 00:29:35.809
It doesn't stick.

442
00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:37.144
I don't want to talk about it.

443
00:29:43.384 --> 00:29:45.319
[clicking]

444
00:29:49.524 --> 00:29:50.958
[music plays]

445
00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:53.494
Alright. come on. men.
Let's get started. come!

446
00:29:53.528 --> 00:29:55.863
[upbeat music]

447
00:30:13.013 --> 00:30:15.949
- [Werner] I just need a minute.
- Easy. careful with it.

448
00:30:31.198 --> 00:30:34.301
That chocolate ape is just being
too lazy to make two trips.

449
00:30:34.335 --> 00:30:35.369
That's all.

450
00:30:37.404 --> 00:30:38.839
[beeping]

451
00:30:53.555 --> 00:30:56.123
[Tyrone] <i>They are still here
at the same coordinates.</i>

452
00:30:57.559 --> 00:30:59.326
[man] <i>We're approaching
from the west.</i>

453
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.161
<i>You must not allow them
to submerge</i>

454
00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:02.530
<i>until we have arrived.</i>

455
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:04.231
What's up?

456
00:31:04.264 --> 00:31:05.899
- It's a German radio message.
- What?

457
00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:08.202
- Here?
- Well. it's VHF

458
00:31:08.235 --> 00:31:11.105
- and that's line of sight.
- Huh?

459
00:31:11.138 --> 00:31:13.440
Well. these radio waves
can't pass through trees

460
00:31:13.474 --> 00:31:15.175
or over mountains. so this ship

461
00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:17.545
is less than 100 kilometers
from here.

462
00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:19.880
Alright. find the signal again.

463
00:31:25.152 --> 00:31:26.286
- Maes!
- [Maes] What?

464
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.354
There are ships!

465
00:31:27.388 --> 00:31:28.623
- Where?
- There!

466
00:31:34.161 --> 00:31:36.930
Damn it! We got to get
out of here.

467
00:31:36.964 --> 00:31:38.432
To America or what?

468
00:31:38.465 --> 00:31:40.535
But they're coming our way.
we have no choice.

469
00:31:40.568 --> 00:31:42.369
Oh. but all that we've had
is theory!

470
00:31:42.403 --> 00:31:43.937
Practice starts now. Go!

471
00:31:43.971 --> 00:31:45.038
Come on. men. hurry up!

472
00:31:45.072 --> 00:31:47.441
Come on. come on!

473
00:31:50.678 --> 00:31:52.112
[Jager] What's happening?
What's all the commotion?

474
00:31:52.146 --> 00:31:53.947
We're leaving now!

475
00:31:54.248 --> 00:31:55.617
We're going to America!

476
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.619
Not knowing how to dive?
And where do I go?

477
00:31:57.652 --> 00:31:59.219
You're coming with us.

478
00:31:59.253 --> 00:32:01.188
- But that wasn't the deal!
- [Maes] New deal!

479
00:32:01.488 --> 00:32:03.023
For God's sake.
think for a moment!

480
00:32:03.323 --> 00:32:05.492
You have zero percent chance
of survival.

481
00:32:05.527 --> 00:32:08.362
It's suicide. and I think
you know that very well.

482
00:32:08.395 --> 00:32:10.197
I don't have any alternative.

483
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.533
[yelling]

484
00:32:13.701 --> 00:32:15.102
What?

485
00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:18.138
[Tyrone] <i>They've seen you.</i>

486
00:32:18.172 --> 00:32:20.140
<i>The boat is preparing
to leave. over!</i>

487
00:32:20.174 --> 00:32:22.109
[man] <i>Okay. understood.</i>

488
00:32:22.142 --> 00:32:24.478
<i>We are in range now.
twenty minutes. Out.</i>

489
00:32:24.846 --> 00:32:26.548
[Tyrone] <i>Okay. understood.</i>

490
00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:33.086
Yes. understood.

491
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.556
- Everything is on board.
- Hey!

492
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.157
Oh. shit!

493
00:32:40.027 --> 00:32:41.261
Dammit!

494
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.731
[gunshot]

495
00:32:50.204 --> 00:32:52.272
Bloody hell! Look!
The Kraut killed him!

496
00:32:54.642 --> 00:32:57.377
I didn't mean to do it.
That was not my intention!

497
00:33:00.347 --> 00:33:01.749
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

498
00:33:01.783 --> 00:33:03.651
What in the hell
are you doing. Stan?

499
00:33:03.685 --> 00:33:05.085
We still need him!

500
00:33:05.653 --> 00:33:07.522
Who else is going
to pilot the boat?

501
00:33:10.457 --> 00:33:11.559
Jeez!

502
00:33:15.128 --> 00:33:16.396
Get us out of here.

503
00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:20.334
Come on!

504
00:33:26.206 --> 00:33:28.075
Keep moving!

505
00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:33.347
I'll have to hold onto this
for the old man.

506
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.218
Can I come along. or are you
still sending me off

507
00:33:38.252 --> 00:33:39.621
with the collaborator?

508
00:33:39.654 --> 00:33:41.355
Stop moaning. Is that it?
Is everyone below?

509
00:33:41.388 --> 00:33:42.790
[both] No.

510
00:33:48.328 --> 00:33:50.163
[Fons]
That nigger isn't coming?

511
00:33:50.197 --> 00:33:51.733
No. Fons. we dumping him
in the sea.

512
00:33:51.766 --> 00:33:53.467
- Take him aft.
- [Nadine] Let's go.

513
00:33:53.501 --> 00:33:55.202
[Stan] Start the engines!

514
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.171
- [clanking]
- [air hisses]

515
00:34:04.478 --> 00:34:05.412
Engines ready!

516
00:34:07.649 --> 00:34:09.383
Let's go!

517
00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.825
Rudder 3-10.
Set course to 3-10.

518
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.695
Starboard main rudder. 20.

519
00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:27.769
I want both machines
to proceed slowly.

520
00:34:27.802 --> 00:34:29.537
Both engines slow ahead.

521
00:34:30.538 --> 00:34:32.205
[dramatic music]

522
00:35:02.604 --> 00:35:04.338
We don't have enough pressure!

523
00:35:07.174 --> 00:35:08.442
- The main valve's half open!
- What?

524
00:35:08.475 --> 00:35:10.344
The main valve's only half open!

525
00:35:10.377 --> 00:35:11.613
Well. then go open it!

526
00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:12.880
Give me a break!

527
00:35:13.548 --> 00:35:15.850
You mind if I get through. mate?

528
00:35:17.819 --> 00:35:20.153
I don't see anything changing!

529
00:35:20.187 --> 00:35:21.321
Yeah. hang on!

530
00:35:24.892 --> 00:35:26.360
[air hisses]

531
00:35:28.495 --> 00:35:29.831
[Klisse] It's starting to rise!

532
00:35:29.864 --> 00:35:31.633
The levers are starting to move!

533
00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:34.702
Tamme! We've got reinforcements!

534
00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:36.470
Jenga machinist.

535
00:35:36.504 --> 00:35:37.705
[laughs]

536
00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:39.641
- <i>Qui. qui!</i>
- Welcome aboard!

537
00:35:50.785 --> 00:35:52.152
[Filip] Well?

538
00:35:53.286 --> 00:35:54.722
[Stan] They're still far away.

539
00:35:54.756 --> 00:35:56.758
but it's best
if we stay out of sight.

540
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:59.159
Take us down.

541
00:36:02.764 --> 00:36:04.632
Alright. everyone.
Prepare to dive.

542
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:06.868
Set your depth to 30 meters.

543
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:08.235
Huh?

544
00:36:09.704 --> 00:36:11.806
Front open ten. back open five.

545
00:36:13.574 --> 00:36:15.543
- Five degrees down bubble.
- Yeah.

546
00:36:16.911 --> 00:36:19.379
- Five down.
- Down.

547
00:36:20.414 --> 00:36:21.549
Yeah.

548
00:36:22.116 --> 00:36:24.351
Flood it. Open main valve.

549
00:36:24.952 --> 00:36:26.286
[air hisses]

550
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.858
You. open main vents.

551
00:36:35.462 --> 00:36:36.698
[air hisses]

552
00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:43.705
Cut the diesel.
switch to electric.

553
00:36:43.738 --> 00:36:45.338
Both engines slow ahead.

554
00:36:45.372 --> 00:36:46.808
[rumbling]

555
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:53.681
Switching over!

556
00:36:55.883 --> 00:36:57.417
[dramatic music]

557
00:37:13.568 --> 00:37:14.769
[water dripping]

558
00:37:15.636 --> 00:37:17.805
[submarine creaking]

559
00:37:32.687 --> 00:37:33.921
[clang]

560
00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:56.778
We're under the water.

561
00:37:56.811 --> 00:37:58.679
Just like Jules Verne.

562
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.415
The boat is very special. Jenga.

563
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.052
Under water.
not on it. under it.

564
00:38:07.555 --> 00:38:08.956
[laughs]

565
00:38:19.767 --> 00:38:20.935
[clang]

566
00:38:35.616 --> 00:38:37.518
Take them off. I need my hands.

567
00:38:39.754 --> 00:38:41.656
I'll take them off
when I trust you.

568
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.391
Right after you stop breathing.

569
00:38:47.728 --> 00:38:49.664
What guarantee do I have
that you won't kill me

570
00:38:49.697 --> 00:38:51.532
as soon as we dock in New York?

571
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.769
What guarantee do I have
you won't kill everyone

572
00:38:54.802 --> 00:38:56.737
before we even get there?

573
00:38:57.738 --> 00:38:59.372
About the same amount.

574
00:38:59.807 --> 00:39:00.975
[Werner] Stan?

575
00:39:01.742 --> 00:39:02.944
Stan?

576
00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:10.585
Listen. Listen to this.

577
00:39:11.152 --> 00:39:13.120
It's a strange droning noise.

578
00:39:18.893 --> 00:39:20.094
They're looking for us.

579
00:39:28.903 --> 00:39:31.371
As long as we stay under.
there's no problem.

580
00:39:45.953 --> 00:39:47.154
[sighs]

581
00:39:47.188 --> 00:39:48.723
[tense music]

582
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:11.746
[Tamme] Now. which was it?

583
00:40:17.218 --> 00:40:18.819
I don't remember anymore.

584
00:40:34.035 --> 00:40:35.736
[Tamme] Oh. my God!

585
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:39.840
A leak in the crapper!

586
00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:43.577
Damn it. you idiots. Do I have
to do everything myself?

587
00:40:45.846 --> 00:40:48.950
You incompetent fool!
Are you trying to kill us?

588
00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:51.652
F7. B5.

589
00:40:52.553 --> 00:40:57.758
L6. C3. B1!

590
00:40:58.926 --> 00:41:00.661
Is that so hard to remember?

591
00:41:00.695 --> 00:41:02.964
I'm going to shove your C3
and your B5

592
00:41:02.997 --> 00:41:04.265
down your bloody throat!

593
00:41:04.298 --> 00:41:06.767
Listen. Do you know
which compartment

594
00:41:06.801 --> 00:41:08.202
lies right under the toilet?

595
00:41:08.235 --> 00:41:10.738
The battery compartment.
Batteries and water.

596
00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:12.907
this is a very bad combination!

597
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.545
Let him go.

598
00:41:21.682 --> 00:41:23.150
Ha! If pigs had wings...

599
00:41:29.957 --> 00:41:30.992
Shit!

600
00:41:34.595 --> 00:41:36.797
Chlorine gas.
Blow the ballast tanks!

601
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:38.766
Ascend! Hurry. go. go!

602
00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:41.035
Is the plane gone? Hey!

603
00:41:41.068 --> 00:41:42.837
If we don't vent this boat
in thirty seconds.

604
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.138
we'll be gone!

605
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.108
[dramatic music]

606
00:41:51.746 --> 00:41:52.913
[coughing]

607
00:41:54.582 --> 00:41:55.783
[plane engine]

608
00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:03.624
Use the flak!

609
00:42:05.726 --> 00:42:07.595
Damn it. he's banking away!

610
00:42:10.064 --> 00:42:11.799
Why isn't he attacking?

611
00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:13.601
He won't risk an attack

612
00:42:13.634 --> 00:42:15.169
while we're aiming
the flak at him.

613
00:42:15.202 --> 00:42:18.205
He'll circle us. Out of reach
until we're diving.

614
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.941
A diving submarine
is target practice

615
00:42:20.975 --> 00:42:22.276
for the Luftwaffe.

616
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:23.644
Well. then we won't dive.

617
00:42:24.145 --> 00:42:26.247
He has to run short
of fuel sometime.

618
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.082
[Jager]
He's already on the radio.

619
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.718
More are coming.

620
00:42:38.292 --> 00:42:39.693
[dramatic music]

621
00:42:47.068 --> 00:42:48.202
[Filip] Hurry!

622
00:43:00.948 --> 00:43:02.149
[Jager]
Close the hatch! Flood it!

623
00:43:02.183 --> 00:43:04.251
Dive. dive. dive!
Hurry up. men!

624
00:43:13.961 --> 00:43:15.129
Oh. shit!

625
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:24.672
[explosion]

626
00:43:27.341 --> 00:43:28.876
Bloody hell. he got him!

627
00:43:34.915 --> 00:43:36.183
Stan!

628
00:43:37.051 --> 00:43:38.252
Stan!

629
00:43:40.154 --> 00:43:41.322
Stan!

630
00:43:47.461 --> 00:43:48.829
[soft music]

631
00:43:55.236 --> 00:43:56.704
Lucky bastard.

632
00:44:11.352 --> 00:44:13.053
You sleep here. right?

633
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:15.689
Huh? Go ahead.

634
00:44:19.126 --> 00:44:20.327
Go ahead.

635
00:44:23.497 --> 00:44:25.266
[Fons] That's not going
to happen.

636
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.436
Who said that this darkie
was going to sleep in here?

637
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.472
[Klisse] Yeah. well. Jenga
has worked ten times harder

638
00:44:31.506 --> 00:44:32.806
than you. fatso.

639
00:44:35.042 --> 00:44:37.378
- Go sleep in the torpedo room.
- Come off it. Fons.

640
00:44:47.855 --> 00:44:49.223
Get going.

641
00:44:52.459 --> 00:44:54.261
Yes. sir.

642
00:44:59.767 --> 00:45:00.968
And take your fish with you.

643
00:45:08.475 --> 00:45:10.411
[officer singing a lullaby]

644
00:45:13.914 --> 00:45:15.149
[Stan] No!

645
00:45:18.485 --> 00:45:22.156
Uncle Kriechbaum is going
to give you a bath. huh?

646
00:45:22.557 --> 00:45:25.759
Splishy. splashy!
Get your little tootsies wet.

647
00:45:26.794 --> 00:45:29.096
Look how happy he is. [laughs]

648
00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:34.536
Please don't hurt him.

649
00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:38.339
I think daddy's going
to save you now.

650
00:45:40.874 --> 00:45:42.276
Isn't he?

651
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:45.212
They're upstairs
behind the fireplace.

652
00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:46.747
Go look.

653
00:45:49.316 --> 00:45:56.023
In nature. sometimes the size
of a particular population

654
00:45:56.056 --> 00:45:57.858
has to be corrected

655
00:45:58.125 --> 00:46:04.164
so that a natural equilibrium
can be reestablished.

656
00:46:04.898 --> 00:46:08.035
And that is what
we take care of.

657
00:46:08.637 --> 00:46:14.141
We are merely restoring
balance in nature

658
00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:16.110
once again.

659
00:46:16.877 --> 00:46:18.045
[chuckles]

660
00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:23.551
And it is so important
for him

661
00:46:23.984 --> 00:46:27.955
that he learns about balance.

662
00:46:29.256 --> 00:46:30.224
So long!

663
00:46:30.257 --> 00:46:32.226
No! No. no. please!

664
00:46:32.259 --> 00:46:35.129
No. don't go!
Don't leave him like that!

665
00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:36.864
Please no!

666
00:46:43.203 --> 00:46:44.872
- [door slams]
- No!

667
00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:47.274
- [water splashes]
- No! No!

668
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.847
No! No! No. please!

669
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:57.351
No! No! No!

670
00:46:59.086 --> 00:47:00.954
Please. help!

671
00:47:01.355 --> 00:47:02.856
[yells]

672
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.831

[adventurous music]

674
00:48:28.342 --> 00:48:30.077
[Jager] This cannot be right.

675
00:48:34.582 --> 00:48:36.984
What are you doing
fifty degrees off course?

676
00:48:38.452 --> 00:48:41.054
Coming back
from ninety degrees.

677
00:48:41.088 --> 00:48:42.189
What?

678
00:48:42.857 --> 00:48:46.160
What? What can I do about it.
you wiener schnitzel?

679
00:48:46.193 --> 00:48:48.128
This is supposed
to be Filip's job!

680
00:48:48.162 --> 00:48:49.430
[sighs]

681
00:49:11.151 --> 00:49:12.386
[clears throat]

682
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.056
Your little shepherd's nap
just cost us eight hours!

683
00:49:21.729 --> 00:49:23.464
What are you up to?

684
00:49:26.033 --> 00:49:28.469
Checking the shafts.
They need some oiling.

685
00:49:39.647 --> 00:49:41.982
Woah. woah. Stan!
No. go easy. stop!

686
00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:44.084
Calm down!

687
00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:46.253
No! No!

688
00:49:46.788 --> 00:49:48.322
Open tube five!

689
00:49:53.427 --> 00:49:55.128
[grunting]

690
00:49:59.299 --> 00:50:01.803
Ah. a Chinese volunteer
for the torpedo test?

691
00:50:01.836 --> 00:50:03.470
Just help me!

692
00:50:03.505 --> 00:50:05.372
Sorry. I only listen
to my captain!

693
00:50:05.405 --> 00:50:06.608
So help me. then!

694
00:50:07.809 --> 00:50:08.710
[grunts]

695
00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:14.582
You've made your point.
now let me live my own life!

696
00:50:14.616 --> 00:50:16.416
He should keep his paws
off your body!

697
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.285
It's my body
and it's my business!

698
00:50:18.318 --> 00:50:20.053
You're still much too young
for all that!

699
00:50:20.087 --> 00:50:21.589
How old do I have to be

700
00:50:21.623 --> 00:50:23.357
before Mr. Almighty
give his permission? Forty?

701
00:50:23.725 --> 00:50:25.560
When you're married.
then you can do what you want.

702
00:50:25.593 --> 00:50:27.261
For now.
you must do what I say!

703
00:50:27.695 --> 00:50:29.564
Hm. Okay. I agree.

704
00:50:31.398 --> 00:50:33.233
Well. a captain
can marry people.

705
00:50:34.836 --> 00:50:36.069
Come.

706
00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:43.277
Captain? We're having a wedding.

707
00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:48.181
Come on. guys.

708
00:50:49.617 --> 00:50:52.687
Come on. gentlemen.
The bride is waiting.

709
00:51:04.231 --> 00:51:06.233
No Bible. so this
will have to do.

710
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.705
I don't think
this is a good idea.

711
00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:16.143
Put your hands
on the... Bible.

712
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.514
Nadine. do you want to take

713
00:51:19.547 --> 00:51:21.883
this man. Filip.
as your lawfully wedded husband?

714
00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:22.850
I do.

715
00:51:24.418 --> 00:51:26.888
And Filip. do you want to take
this woman. Nadine.

716
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:28.790
as your lawfully wedded wife?

717
00:51:33.761 --> 00:51:35.697
- I...
- Jager!

718
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.364
No! Ignore him!

719
00:51:41.468 --> 00:51:44.304
[Jager]
Damn it. Let's get in!

720
00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:46.608
Now! Move. move. move!

721
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:48.576
Move! Hurry up!

722
00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.377
They might have
an U-boat escort.

723
00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.679
[grunting]

724
00:51:52.446 --> 00:51:53.815
Come on. move!

725
00:52:02.389 --> 00:52:03.725
- [Filip] Hey.
- Go away.

726
00:52:05.927 --> 00:52:07.394
You know...

727
00:52:07.427 --> 00:52:09.429
We can hardly hold
a wedding party

728
00:52:09.463 --> 00:52:11.365
with an enemy ship in the area.

729
00:52:11.398 --> 00:52:12.867
You could've said
"I do" ten times

730
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.334
before Stan spotted it.

731
00:52:14.368 --> 00:52:15.435
But he was breathing down
our necks.

732
00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:16.771
So what?

733
00:52:20.474 --> 00:52:23.310
Isn't it much better to wait
until we're in America?

734
00:52:24.846 --> 00:52:26.881
I love you. you know that.

735
00:52:27.615 --> 00:52:29.349
But Stan...

736
00:52:29.383 --> 00:52:31.552
- It's just not easy for him.
- He's just a bastard.

737
00:52:35.657 --> 00:52:37.859
Mama would react
completely differently.

738
00:52:41.596 --> 00:52:44.766
You have no idea how much
I am looking forward to the day

739
00:52:45.066 --> 00:52:47.401
that I will see her again.

740
00:52:49.436 --> 00:52:52.573
The day I can introduce you
to her as...

741
00:52:52.607 --> 00:52:54.374
as my husband.

742
00:52:58.813 --> 00:53:00.447
She'll be so proud.

743
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.192
Hey. what's the matter?

744
00:53:16.764 --> 00:53:17.932
Hey...

745
00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:45.893
Hey?

746
00:53:48.963 --> 00:53:50.765
Your mother. she...

747
00:53:52.466 --> 00:53:53.735
What?

748
00:54:00.407 --> 00:54:01.909
She's dead. Nadine.

749
00:54:03.477 --> 00:54:05.580
Your mother is dead. I saw her.

750
00:54:08.616 --> 00:54:10.417
Louis. too.

751
00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:12.754
But what are you saying?
They're safe in France.

752
00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:14.622
No...

753
00:54:17.959 --> 00:54:19.326
What?

754
00:54:20.628 --> 00:54:22.362
Stan has...

755
00:54:22.395 --> 00:54:24.464
Well. he's tried to tell you
a hundred different times

756
00:54:24.498 --> 00:54:25.900
the truth. but...

757
00:54:25.933 --> 00:54:28.435
How do you as a father.
tell your daughter

758
00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.973
that her mother's dead
and her brother's dead. too?

759
00:54:34.108 --> 00:54:36.611
He couldn't bear to see you
falling to pieces

760
00:54:36.644 --> 00:54:37.879
in front of him.

761
00:54:39.379 --> 00:54:40.782
I'm sorry.

762
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:43.584
I'm sorry.

763
00:54:45.418 --> 00:54:46.821
[torpedo whistles]

764
00:54:47.655 --> 00:54:48.890
Torpedo!

765
00:54:50.591 --> 00:54:52.593
Alarm. goddamn it!

766
00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.696
Torpedo. course 2-2-3.

To your stations!
Fifteen down bubble!

Move! Come on!

769
00:55:01.368 --> 00:55:03.070
- Go. go. go. go!
- Shit!

770
00:55:03.104 --> 00:55:05.773
Go. go! Dive. dive!

771
00:55:12.713 --> 00:55:13.748
Prepare for impact!

772
00:55:21.689 --> 00:55:23.423
Two hundred meters!

773
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:31.599
Fifty meters!

774
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:33.100

They missed!

778
00:55:48.683 --> 00:55:50.383
- Hey. they missed!
- [cheers]

779
00:55:50.417 --> 00:55:51.919
[Jager] Be quiet! Silence!

780
00:55:53.988 --> 00:55:55.857
Both engines to full stop.

781
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.625
Silent mode. I repeat.

782
00:56:02.597 --> 00:56:04.565

[tense music]

784
00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:34.662
[whispers] Adjust 20 starboard.

785
00:56:46.007 --> 00:56:47.074
[whispers] Well?

786
00:56:47.508 --> 00:56:49.010
[whispers] Nothing just yet.

787
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.181
[whispers] Can't find him.

788
00:56:54.982 --> 00:56:57.484
[whispers]
He's somewhere behind us.

789
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.855
Come with me.

790
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:03.925
Klisse.

791
00:57:09.864 --> 00:57:12.066
You have the manual
with the technical plans

792
00:57:12.099 --> 00:57:13.601
of the torpedoes?

793
00:57:13.634 --> 00:57:15.169
Uh. yes. it's in the...

794
00:57:15.202 --> 00:57:17.939
Good. good. go.
Get it. Addendum C.

But be careful.

798
00:57:26.714 --> 00:57:28.983
Only the wires four and five.
Don't touch the others.

802
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.088
What is that?
Shut the damn thing off!

- [Klisse] We're working on it!
- [Van Praag] Come on!

808
00:59:08.517 --> 00:59:09.950

[Werner] One. eight. zero.
right behind us.

817
00:59:34.909 --> 00:59:36.710
It's now or never.

818
00:59:37.111 --> 00:59:39.013
Is the aft torpedo loaded?

819
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.816
- [Van Praag] Done!
- [Klisse] Okay. okay!

835
01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:30.264
I need that damn torpedo.

01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:45.980
Go!

01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:07.868
Brace for impact.

[Stan] What happened?

850
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:50.110
We were too close.

851
01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:52.279
They did not cut the minimum
safety distance mechanism.

852
01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:55.416
We did.

Drink up. mate.

01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:00.374
- There's no other option.
- Yeah. I know.

01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.176
What?

877
01:04:08.048 --> 01:04:10.618
What? Are you crazy?
Don't ask me!

01:04:10.652 --> 01:04:12.286
You're the only one of us
with any experience!

Yeah. with cows and with pigs!

880

[Filip] Shh. Fons!

881
01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:19.026
If you don't do it.
he's going to die. Fons.

882
01:04:19.493 --> 01:04:22.162
You can't ask me to do that.
I won't do that!

883
01:04:25.299 --> 01:04:26.568
Give me any Kraut you want.

884
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:28.503
and I'll saw off his leg
or an arm.

885
01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.270

But not Van Praag. Not that guy!

887
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.409
I could never look him
in the eye again.

888
01:04:35.442 --> 01:04:38.312
I could never do that to him!
Sorry. guys.

889

- Come on. Fons. You can do it.
- [Fons] I just can't do it.

No. man. Come on.
drink some more. drink.

894
01:05:03.971 --> 01:05:05.640
You need to drink.
for your own good.

895
01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:08.108
What do you mean?
What are you going to do?

896
01:05:08.142 --> 01:05:10.444
No! Just hold him down.

898
01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:15.315
Stop!

899
01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:23.725
[Fons] Uh. can you just
tie of his leg

900
01:05:23.758 --> 01:05:25.392
- above the knee?
- Yeah.

901
01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:27.529
[Fons]
The rest. hold him down.

902
01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:29.163
Then start sawing at his knee.

903
01:05:29.196 --> 01:05:30.532
- [Filip] Like this? Here?
- [Fons] Yep.

904
01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:31.965
[Filip] Come on.

905
01:05:31.999 --> 01:05:33.367
[Jager]
We need to fix this boat.

906
01:05:34.134 --> 01:05:35.603
Jenga. Tamme.

907
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:37.672
[Filip] Alright. fine. Go on!

908
01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:39.674
- Hold him for me!
- [Nadine] Yeah. okay.

909
01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.411
Come on. guys.

910
01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:46.013
Is everyone ready?

911
01:05:46.046 --> 01:05:47.715
- [Stan] Come on. guys.
- Let's do it.

912
01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:50.284
[tense music]

913
01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:52.419
[Stan] Come on. come on!

914
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.689
- [sawing]
- [screaming]

915
01:05:59.493 --> 01:06:01.462
[Stan] Come on. now.
you can do it!

916
01:06:05.533 --> 01:06:07.000
[hammering]

917
01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:13.273
[thunder]

918
01:07:03.858 --> 01:07:06.193
Just so you can work better
on the engines.

919
01:07:10.163 --> 01:07:11.733
I understand.

920
01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:23.243
It had to be done.
You saved his life.

921
01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:29.316
He'll never play football again.

922
01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:33.655
Another talent wasted.

923
01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.392
All the big clubs
were after him.

924
01:07:40.494 --> 01:07:42.162
He could've picked any team.

925
01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:45.733
Yes.

926
01:07:50.304 --> 01:07:52.139
You played football?

927
01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:58.211
No. Always been a soldier
as long as I can remember.

928
01:08:04.786 --> 01:08:06.420
And a soldier doesn't pick
his own team.

929
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:23.705
[submarine horn]

930
01:08:24.539 --> 01:08:25.640
[Jager] Oh. shit!

931
01:08:27.942 --> 01:08:29.777
Werner. the radio!

932
01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.715
[heavy rainfall]

933
01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.450
[thunder]

934
01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.421
- German destroyer.
- Can we get away?

935
01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:42.890
Not fast enough!

936
01:08:42.924 --> 01:08:44.659
- We've only got one engine.
- What do we do?

937
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.260
If we move now
just half a meter

938
01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:48.529
without identifying ourselves.

939
01:08:48.563 --> 01:08:50.397
they'll open fire
with the deck gun.

940
01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:53.735
Stan! Stan!

941
01:08:54.869 --> 01:08:55.903
Come.

942
01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:04.579
[Schultz]
<i>This is Captain Max Schultz.</i>

943
01:09:04.612 --> 01:09:06.614
<i>Identify yourselves. over!</i>

944
01:09:06.648 --> 01:09:07.582
Go on.

945
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.184
This is Captain Franz Jager.

946
01:09:11.218 --> 01:09:13.688
U-235. 8th fleet.
What's up. over?

947
01:09:14.622 --> 01:09:16.390
<i>Eighth fleet?</i>

948
01:09:16.423 --> 01:09:18.392
<i>You're miles
out of your zone. over!</i>

949
01:09:19.927 --> 01:09:21.696
We had a little rendezvous
with a mine

950
01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.364
and want to repair
the damage. over.

951
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.834
<i>A mine?</i>

952
01:09:26.868 --> 01:09:29.737
<i>We'll send you some mechanics.
perhaps they can help you. over.</i>

953
01:09:30.605 --> 01:09:33.306
Thank you. but that
won't be necessary.

954
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.943
We've got everything here
well under control. over.

955
01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:40.380
<i>It's no trouble.
We'd be glad to help you.</i>

956
01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:43.450
<i>We're waiting for orders.
anyway. over.</i>

957
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:47.354
Okay. come over. We've got
some whiskey for you. out.

958
01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:51.391
What do you think
you're doing. you bastard?

959
01:09:52.093 --> 01:09:54.796
They're suspicious if we don't
let them on board.

960
01:09:54.829 --> 01:09:57.364
And if they're suspicious.
they open fire.

961
01:09:58.566 --> 01:10:00.702
You have to surrender.

962
01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:03.236
We can't surrender.

963
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:05.305
You guys. goddamn it.
they've lowered a boat!

964
01:10:08.676 --> 01:10:10.812
Okay. you take your mate
with you.

965
01:10:10.845 --> 01:10:12.980
Nadine. off to the toilet.

966
01:10:13.014 --> 01:10:16.283
Fons. go back there!

967
01:10:18.653 --> 01:10:20.454
You do the talking.

968
01:10:23.858 --> 01:10:25.392
[dramatic music]

969
01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:33.534
[booming thuds]

970
01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:37.839
[clanging]

971
01:10:37.872 --> 01:10:39.272
[vault door opens]

972
01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:02.462
Well. comrades...

973
01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:03.965
You chose some real shit weather
for your little visit.

974
01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:05.465
don't you think?

975
01:11:05.499 --> 01:11:07.502
You can say that again.

976
01:11:11.773 --> 01:11:12.807
Comrades.

977
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:18.311
So you had a collision
with a mine?

978
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.448
Yeah. we have some damage.
but you know how it is.

979
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.351
It's an U-boat. there's always
something to repair.

980
01:11:24.384 --> 01:11:25.686
But that can wait.

981
01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.354
Not the whiskey.

982
01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:29.557
- This way.
- That's a good idea.

983
01:11:31.692 --> 01:11:33.895
Apparently. there's
a rogue U-boat in the area.

984
01:11:37.598 --> 01:11:40.367
On the way to the States
with a cargo of uranium.

985
01:11:41.401 --> 01:11:43.070
We have to keep our eyes open.

986
01:11:44.572 --> 01:11:46.007
Uranium. you say?

987
01:11:46.373 --> 01:11:47.742
[Schultz] Yeah.

988
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:51.512
I don't even know
what it is.

989
01:11:51.846 --> 01:11:53.948
It seems to be something
very important.

990
01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:55.583
[Jager] Very important?

991
01:11:58.152 --> 01:11:59.954
Whatever the case.

992
01:11:59.987 --> 01:12:02.723
that is something that's way
above our paygrade. right?

993
01:12:03.724 --> 01:12:06.894
[all laugh]

994
01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:12.767
- Come on. the whiskey's waiting.
- [Schultz] Lead the way.

995
01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:26.346
[background chatter]

996
01:12:33.855 --> 01:12:35.656
[Van Praag groans]

997
01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:43.396
- Fons.
- Shh.

998
01:12:45.833 --> 01:12:47.434
Are we there yet?

999
01:12:47.467 --> 01:12:49.402
Shh. there's
some Germans on board.

1000
01:12:49.904 --> 01:12:51.572
Oh. I've got an itch.

1001
01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.908
I got to scratch
my right foot.

1002
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:54.942
it itches like hell.

1003
01:12:56.644 --> 01:12:58.012
Scratch it for me.

1004
01:12:58.045 --> 01:12:59.647
It's like it's crawling
with ants.

1005
01:13:08.656 --> 01:13:09.690
[Fons] Like that?

1006
01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.860
That's nice.

1007
01:13:17.698 --> 01:13:20.067
- [Jager] <i>Prost!</i> Cheers.
- [Schultz] <i>Prost.</i>

1008
01:13:25.239 --> 01:13:27.541
Some damn good whiskey. Jager.

1009
01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:28.643
Well. I told you so.

1010
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.145
How long have you been here?

1011
01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:32.880
For quite some time now.

1012
01:13:32.914 --> 01:13:34.682
We're just waiting
for our new orders.

1013
01:13:34.715 --> 01:13:36.050
- but. uh...
- [screaming]

1014
01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:38.085
That's... That's alright.
this is Gerhardt.

1015
01:13:38.119 --> 01:13:40.755
He's... He's just coming around.

1016
01:13:40.788 --> 01:13:42.455
[screaming continues]

1017
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:44.692
Quiet!

1018
01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:47.194
For God's sake. shut up!

1019
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:49.864
[cries]

1020
01:13:50.665 --> 01:13:53.668
He had an accident.
We had to operate.

1021
01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:56.469
I can take a look. I guess.

1022
01:13:56.504 --> 01:13:58.471
Don't worry about it.
he's in excellent hands.

1023
01:13:58.506 --> 01:14:00.541
Mayer was a medic.
perhaps he can help.

1024
01:14:01.876 --> 01:14:03.177
Go take a look.

1025
01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:08.481
[Jager] How about
another round. huh?

1026
01:14:10.685 --> 01:14:12.720
Be quiet. Come on!

1027
01:14:13.821 --> 01:14:15.189
[cries]

1028
01:14:27.268 --> 01:14:29.670
You had to amputate both legs?

1029
01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:32.006
<i>Ja. ja.</i>

1030
01:14:32.039 --> 01:14:33.574
[cries]

1031
01:14:33.607 --> 01:14:35.576
How and when did it happen?

1032
01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:38.713
Eh... <i>ja.</i>

1033
01:14:41.182 --> 01:14:43.718
[speaking German]

1034
01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:45.920
<i>Ja.</i>

1035
01:14:49.023 --> 01:14:50.791
The only thing
I can do is...

1036
01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:53.027
Give him some morphine.

1037
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:54.862
<i>Ja.</i>

1038
01:14:54.895 --> 01:14:56.564
I'll go get it and come back.

1039
01:14:57.164 --> 01:14:59.533
I want my legs back!

1040
01:14:59.767 --> 01:15:01.302
Where did my legs go?

1041
01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:04.672
Alarm! Alarm!
These men aren't Germans!

1042
01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:07.141
They aren't Germans!

1043
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.554
[Filip] No. no. no. no!

1044
01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:26.193
[crying]

1045
01:15:30.164 --> 01:15:33.534
No! No! No!

1046
01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:36.737
No!

1047
01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:40.574
No! No! No!

1048
01:16:03.831 --> 01:16:05.132
[thud]

1049
01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:58.686
I've uh. witnessed
a scientific experiment

1050
01:16:58.719 --> 01:17:00.221
once on a Jew.

1051
01:17:01.722 --> 01:17:04.825
The man was strapped
in a tub of ice water.

1052
01:17:05.893 --> 01:17:07.194
Zero degrees.

1053
01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:12.199
When he was about
to die after

1054
01:17:13.434 --> 01:17:15.936
five hours
of horrendous agony.

1055
01:17:17.438 --> 01:17:19.707
they reheated his body

1056
01:17:20.674 --> 01:17:25.212
by irrigating boiling water
into his stomach.

1057
01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:31.285
his intestines...
and his bladder.

1058
01:17:34.188 --> 01:17:35.422
Your cargo...

1059
01:17:36.123 --> 01:17:37.158
uranium...

1060
01:17:37.691 --> 01:17:40.694
I've heard rumors about it.

1061
01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:42.830
In the rumors it was referred to

1062
01:17:42.863 --> 01:17:44.832
as a weapon
of mass destruction.

1063
01:17:48.736 --> 01:17:50.838
I've seen what they can do
with an ordinary tub

1064
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:52.273
of cold water.

1065
01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:54.875
Imagine what they can do

1066
01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:56.744
with a weapon
of mass destruction.

1067
01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.152
I've closed my eyes once.

1068
01:18:07.021 --> 01:18:09.390
But I won't make this mistake
a second time.

1069
01:18:11.492 --> 01:18:16.096
God help us if Hitler
is first to make this weapon.

1070
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:24.004
So...

1071
01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:28.876
Let's get this boat
out of here.

1072
01:18:37.084 --> 01:18:40.454
[submarine signaling]

1073
01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:42.790
Shit. they're getting impatient.
