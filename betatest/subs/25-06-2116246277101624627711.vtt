00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:12.230
Mr. Lansky. why are
the American authorities after you?

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:14.433
Well. apparently some
newspaper man wrote

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.235
that I had $300 million.

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:17.870
Is it true?

00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:22.474
I wish I had a million dollars.

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:24.609
They accuse me
of making a president.

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:26.646
Now. I don't know Mr. Nixon
any more

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.915
than what I've read
in the newspapers.

00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:32.451
They claim I have 50%
of Lebanon casinos.

00:01:32.484 --> 00:01:34.386
50% of Monte Carlo.

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:37.322
Now how ridiculous
can we really get?

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:38.691
Mr. Lansky.
is there such a thing

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.525
as organized crime?

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:47.867
I have no knowledge
on the subject.

00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:01.346
Listen
Eva. I'm in Florida. honey.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.381
Daddy's here for work.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.984
What do they have here?

00:02:05.017 --> 00:02:08.755
They have oranges and gators
and Mickey Mouse.

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:10.790
Next time we can go
and I promise.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.694
Okay Eva.
can you put your momma on?

00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:20.398
Christie. Christie.
Christie please?

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.735
I know that the check bounced.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:23.803
Okay. but that's OK.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:24.904
That's why I'm in Miami.

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:27.039
I'm going to do some book
signings.

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:27.907
Yeah. sure they gotta.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.643
They are putting me
in a fancy hotel.

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:31.778
they gonna give me the...

00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:37.549
Christie. I know
my responsibilities. alright?

00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:42.454
Look Christie. I'm trying
my best. alright?

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:43.522
Trying my best.

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:20.552
David Stone.

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:21.888
Mr. Lansky. it's a pleasure.

00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:23.055
How was your trip?

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:24.924
Fine. thanks. umm.

00:04:24.957 --> 00:04:25.925
Hope you don't mind.
I got a coffee.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.793
You mind sitting down there?

00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:30.830
Huh. yeah sure.

00:04:30.863 --> 00:04:32.064
Thank you.

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:38.638
Hello. Mr. Lansky. how are you?

00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:40.740
Fine. Daphne.

00:04:40.773 --> 00:04:42.041
How's your mother feel?

00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:44.877
Ah. good days and bad. you know.

00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:45.778
It is a mission.

00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:47.213
Yeah. I know all about that.

00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:48.613
What can I get for you. honey?

00:04:48.648 --> 00:04:50.816
We'll do a couple of them
sandwiches.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.053
Bills sliced and fatty cut
and an assortment of pickles.

00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:55.922
So. the usual.

00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:57.223
I'll pick out the best ones.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:58.523
OK.

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:02.695
I'd like you to remove that.

00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:06.531
Ok.

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.502
You're from Pittsburgh.

00:05:10.535 --> 00:05:13.940
You graduated on scholarship
with honors from Princeton.

00:05:13.973 --> 00:05:16.842
You were on the crime beat
at the Fort Wayne News Sentinel

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:18.945
before you started
writing books.

00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:21.546
You've got a wife. Christina.
and two young children.

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:23.548
Eva and Jack.

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.519
I make it a point of knowing
who I associate myself with.

00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:30.957
Mr. Stone.
old business habits never die.

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.762
It's a complicated thing.
isn't it. marriage. children.

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:47.505
I've been reading some articles
about you.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.809
Forget all that.

00:05:49.842 --> 00:05:51.777
I'm here to tell you
the real story.

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:54.814
All right. well. that's great.
cause I'm-

00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:56.548
I'm here to write
the real story.

00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:59.752
Four packs a day. 60 years.

00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:02.688
I finally work up the courage
to quit.

00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:04.256
A week later.
I go to see my doctor.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.158
He tells me I'm dying.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.730
As a writer. I thought you would
appreciate the irony in that.

00:06:10.763 --> 00:06:12.832
I do. I'm just I'm very sorry
to hear that.

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:15.801
My circumstances offer me
the privilege

00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:18.070
to pick who I want
to tell my story.

00:06:18.104 --> 00:06:20.006
Your book on Kennedy paid
you well?

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.573
Well. I did OK.

00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:25.878
It's been a few years since
lady luck visited you.

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.913
Yeah well history doesn't
always repeat itself.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.317
When I was a young boy.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.586
I spent my days
at the public library.

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.022
I read everything

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:40.159
and I have a particular interest
in history.

00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:44.130
People see the same thing
from different perspectives.

00:06:44.163 --> 00:06:46.832
and that fascinates me.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.734
But what do you want from this?

00:06:48.768 --> 00:06:52.738
Why does David still want to
write a book about Meyer Lansky?

00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:54.273
Oh.

00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:02.882
Everything that I've read
in history about you says

00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:03.983
you're a complicated man

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:06.952
and maybe I like stories about
complicated people.

00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:11.791
And I think that your story.
the real story.

00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:12.992
I don't think
he's been told yet.

00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:14.627
and I don't think
it's about one man.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.162
I think
it's about the 20th century.

00:07:19.098 --> 00:07:20.900
That was quite a speech.

00:07:20.933 --> 00:07:22.635
but you didn't answer
the question.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.871
I need the money.

00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:30.276
Ah. there it is. the truth.

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:32.945
When I die.
the book is yours to sell.

00:07:32.978 --> 00:07:36.148
Until then. you won't show
the manuscript to no one.

00:07:36.182 --> 00:07:39.218
Anything I choose to tell you
is off the record

00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:42.321
until I give you permission
to put it in the book.

00:07:42.354 --> 00:07:45.024
Without my approval. what you
have is a work of fiction.

00:07:45.057 --> 00:07:47.293
- I won't incriminate myself.
- OK.

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:49.361
Any conversations
you have about me

00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:51.097
outside of our meetings.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.665
- I want to know.
- Sure.

00:07:52.698 --> 00:07:58.003
Betray me
and there will be consequences.

00:07:58.037 --> 00:07:59.738
Are these terms
are agreeable to you?

00:08:01.807 --> 00:08:03.142
Yes sir.

00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:08.647
I hope our collaboration
will be a successful one.

00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:38.277
<i>Hello?</i>

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.179
Hey. Christie. it's me.

00:08:40.212 --> 00:08:43.048
<i>Hey.
it's ok baby. mommy's got you.</i>

00:08:43.082 --> 00:08:45.184
You OK?

00:08:45.217 --> 00:08:46.919
You don't sound. OK?

00:08:46.952 --> 00:08:48.354
<i>No. I'm not.</i>

00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:50.389
<i>Jack's got a 103 and he's not
holding his spoon down.</i>

00:08:50.422 --> 00:08:51.724
Take him to a doctor.

00:08:51.757 --> 00:08:54.960
<i>Excuse me?
I took him to the doctor.</i>

00:08:54.994 --> 00:08:56.762
<i>Listen. I can't do this. OK?
Not now.</i>

00:08:56.795 --> 00:09:00.366
Christie. I gotta chance
to write a new book. alright?

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.734
And it could be-

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:02.468
<i>Oh. David. no.</i>

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:04.737
Could be something really good.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.705
<i>Oh David.
I called your publisher.</i>

00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:08.474
<i>They had no idea
you were even in Miami.</i>

00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:10.743
<i>which means
you are lying to me.</i>

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:12.077
<i>I can't go through this.
I've got to go.</i>

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:31.830
You said you read some
stories about me in the papers.

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:34.733
My reputation has a habit
of preceding me.

00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:37.236
When they don't know you
they put labels on you.

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.905
Master Stock Manipulator.

00:09:39.939 --> 00:09:43.943
America's most successful
casino operator in history.

00:09:43.976 --> 00:09:45.511
Mob's accountant.

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:48.047
The feds even leaked the story
to the press

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.750
about me having
$300 million squirreled away.

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:54.820
If you find out
who's out there guessing.

00:09:54.853 --> 00:09:56.288
please be sure to let me know.

00:09:56.322 --> 00:09:57.456
- Yeah.
- You don't get to keep it.

00:09:57.489 --> 00:09:59.258
call me
and I'll give you a piece.

00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:00.826
Fair enough.

00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:02.861
The labels are the accurate?

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:05.331
It's your book.
You decide.

00:10:05.364 --> 00:10:06.465
OK. alright.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.201
Okay.

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:13.038
You strike me as a rather
obsequious guy. David.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.841
Quick to please.

00:10:15.874 --> 00:10:17.309
Never thought of myself
that way.

00:10:17.343 --> 00:10:18.877
- You're seperated.
- Hmm.

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:20.512
What did your wife
think about that?

00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:23.415
Did she find you that way?

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:24.950
We're here to talk about you.

00:10:24.984 --> 00:10:26.352
We are not here
to talk about me. Mr. Lansky.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:29.455
No. no. no. We have to talk
about you and me.

00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:33.959
- You know. I was married also.
- Yeah?

00:10:33.993 --> 00:10:35.394
Yeah. twice.

00:10:38.197 --> 00:10:39.298
You know. what they say.

00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:41.000
can't live with them.
can't shoot them.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.272
So where do we start?

00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:48.340
Let's start
when you were a child.

00:10:48.374 --> 00:10:50.843
Russia.

00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:52.945
The only thing
I remember about Russia.

00:10:52.978 --> 00:10:56.081
is one day me and my uncle
crossing a path

00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:57.850
and some Cossacks
ordered my uncle

00:10:57.883 --> 00:10:59.585
to open his potato sack.

00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:01.987
And toss a potato up
in the air.

00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:03.055
My Uncle obeyed.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.593
Tossed a potato into the air.

00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:11.897
and the Cossack takes out this
fucking sword and swoosh.

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:16.602
He wasn't aiming
for the potatoe.

00:11:16.636 --> 00:11:19.571
He was aiming
for my uncle's hands.

00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:21.040
Cut it right off.

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:22.141
Tough guys.

00:11:22.174 --> 00:11:25.311
But swords.
we didn't have a sword.

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:26.812
That was the difference.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.848
I never forgot that.

00:11:31.317 --> 00:11:35.187
I promised myself I'd never
be that helpless again.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.091
The next time I'll be the one
holding the knife.

00:11:39.124 --> 00:11:41.293
That's the only thing Russia
ever gave me.

00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:43.028
when I swore that day.

00:11:45.297 --> 00:11:48.167
Made me stronger.
it sharpened me.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.642
I wish I knew where that
cocksucker was today.

00:11:55.675 --> 00:11:58.944
I'll show them
what a tough guy he is.

00:11:58.977 --> 00:12:01.447
The real story starts
in America.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:10.322
By the time I was
10. I was sharp as a shiv.

00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:14.593
My mind was my escape
and more than anything. numbers.

00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:16.995
Numbers gave my world
some order.

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:19.298
And if a kid with that kind
of interest in numbers.

00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:22.635
there was nothing as thrilling
is a dice game.

00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:24.303
I would watch them play.

00:12:24.336 --> 00:12:27.206
But oh boy. my old man found out
that was how

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:29.308
I was spending my time.

00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:30.677
My father?

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.911
Everything he did.
he did for us.

00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:35.247
He was an honest man
earning an honest living.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.148
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:38.484
He wasn't living his life.

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:40.386
His life was living him.

00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:41.553
I guess that's what we do.

00:12:41.587 --> 00:12:45.391
We measure ourselves
against our fathers.

00:12:45.424 --> 00:12:47.326
And you?
What was your's like?

00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:51.196
My father died when I was young.

00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:54.533
That must have been hard.

00:12:58.404 --> 00:13:01.940
So being an honest man.
Being an honest father.

00:13:01.974 --> 00:13:04.143
Yeah.

00:13:04.176 --> 00:13:05.310
Is that beneath you?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.350
What I know is that
life wouldn't wait for me.

00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:21.493
It all happened
so fast. I put down the nickel

00:13:21.527 --> 00:13:23.595
my mother gave me
to pick up some bread.

00:13:26.633 --> 00:13:29.968
In a matter of seconds.
my nickel was gone.

00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:32.438
Can you imagine having to tell
my mother and father

00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:34.139
why we couldn't eat
that night?

00:13:34.173 --> 00:13:37.677
He took your money
and you just felt ashamed.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.211
It was rage.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.615
You ever feel that. David?

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.720
A rage so strong
it changes the path you're on?

00:13:47.754 --> 00:13:49.555
Never felt anything like that.

00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:51.724
There are people
in this world who will try to

00:13:51.758 --> 00:13:55.327
make you believe that
they are better than you.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.430
that they can win
at your expense.

00:13:58.464 --> 00:14:03.335
Rage is a tool we use to look
those people in the eye

00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:04.737
and prove them wrong.

00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:06.405
That's what drove you to win
at dice?

00:14:06.438 --> 00:14:09.608
It did much more than drive me
to win.

00:14:09.642 --> 00:14:11.543
It drove me to control the game.

00:14:15.648 --> 00:14:18.417
I
calculated the odds and payoffs.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.620
Watched how the probabilities
ebbed and flowed.

00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:23.622
but something didn't make sense.

00:14:23.656 --> 00:14:26.191
I knew something was going on.

00:14:26.225 --> 00:14:29.328
something invisible
that no one else could see.

00:14:29.361 --> 00:14:31.096
And then I saw it.

00:14:37.837 --> 00:14:41.808
A blink of the eye.
a scratch of the air.

00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:45.210
I figured out what these guys
were doing.

00:14:45.244 --> 00:14:46.746
they rigged the game.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:48.815
It was the outsider.

00:14:48.848 --> 00:14:51.550
He was the one
controlling the game.

00:14:54.186 --> 00:14:55.655
And isn't that what we all want.
David?

00:14:56.823 --> 00:14:59.591
The only one is in gambling.
as in life.

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.460
are those who control the game.

00:15:36.428 --> 00:15:40.767
I think that you have the smile
of a beauty queen. right?

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.269
I do know I don't think that
they stick out.

00:15:44.303 --> 00:15:48.307
I don't think that
there's a huge gap. but.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.575
if you think they're going to
straighten out.

00:15:49.608 --> 00:15:51.644
then what's the point
of getting braces. right?

00:15:51.678 --> 00:15:53.445
<i>Mom's right.</i>

00:15:53.478 --> 00:15:55.113
Right about what?

00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:56.515
<i>We can't afford it.</i>

00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:59.484
<i>That's why you don't want me
to get braces.</i>

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:03.823
She say that?
Put your mama on. Eva? Hmm?

00:16:03.856 --> 00:16:05.490
<i>She said she can't talk.</i>

00:16:05.524 --> 00:16:07.259
What ya mean she can't talk?

00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:09.528
If she can't talk
or she won't talk?

00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:12.665
<i>She said she's
not talking to you. daddy.</i>

00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:14.132
Give mama a message. alright?

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:15.500
- Can you do that?
- <i>Okay.</i>

00:16:15.534 --> 00:16:17.837
And you tell her that the reason
that Daddy's in Miami

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.806
is because of a man
called Meyer Lansky.

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:20.873
<i>Meyor Lasky?</i>

00:16:20.907 --> 00:16:22.675
It's okay. she know who that is.

00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:25.912
And you tell her that
Mr. Lansky

00:16:25.945 --> 00:16:29.314
hired daddy personally to
write a book about his life.

00:16:29.348 --> 00:16:30.683
And every publisher
is going to want it

00:16:30.717 --> 00:16:32.384
and it's going to be best
selling when it is.

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:36.355
daddy is gonna set your smile.
alright?

00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:37.255
<i>OK.</i>

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:40.325
Because that's what daddies do.
Yeah?

00:16:40.359 --> 00:16:42.695
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- OK.

00:16:42.729 --> 00:16:44.931
Don't you worry
about your thing.

00:16:44.964 --> 00:16:46.398
Alright. you go tell her.

00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:47.432
<i>I love you. daddy.</i>

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.533
Alright. bye.

00:16:55.507 --> 00:16:56.541
Sorry.

00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:03.548
You look like hell.

00:17:03.582 --> 00:17:06.151
Yeah. I didn't get much sleep.

00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:11.223
Problems at home?

00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:15.695
OK. umm.

00:17:19.832 --> 00:17:20.499
Ok. today...

00:17:20.532 --> 00:17:22.635
These problems you're having.

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:25.705
I hope they're not interfering
with your ability to work.

00:17:25.738 --> 00:17:29.541
I'm here. I'm fine.

00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:30.677
Good.

00:17:34.647 --> 00:17:36.214
I want to talk
about Bugsy Siegel.

00:17:36.248 --> 00:17:38.651
It's Ben Siegel.

00:17:38.685 --> 00:17:40.787
Say that name again.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.690
Ben Siegel. Bugsy.

00:17:43.723 --> 00:17:45.992
He and Lansky had bootlegging
and gambling racket

00:17:46.025 --> 00:17:48.326
known as
the Bugs and Meyer Gang.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.462
There were more than partners.

00:17:50.495 --> 00:17:51.931
They were like brothers.

00:17:51.964 --> 00:17:53.700
Lansky handle the numbers.

00:17:53.733 --> 00:17:55.534
Bugsy was the muscle.

00:17:55.567 --> 00:17:56.535
All right. Ben.

00:17:56.568 --> 00:17:58.838
Come on.

00:17:58.871 --> 00:18:01.007
I think he gets to a point.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.541
The only thing
Bugsy enjoyed more than killing

00:18:02.574 --> 00:18:04.811
was the ladies.

00:18:04.844 --> 00:18:06.611
Or maybe it was the other way
around.

00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:19.257
Luciano is looking for somebody

00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:20.927
to run as his transportation
for him.

00:18:23.328 --> 00:18:26.799
We offer Lucky
a deal on his distribution

00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:29.969
too favorable to turn down.

00:18:30.002 --> 00:18:32.270
Maybe we take a loss on it.

00:18:34.473 --> 00:18:36.475
A loss?
How's that makes sense?

00:18:36.508 --> 00:18:39.846
We'll be getting in on the
ground up with Lucky Luciano

00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:41.981
and it will supply liquor
for our own operation

00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:43.548
at the same time.

00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:46.551
Profit margins are justified
tenfold.

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:50.522
I did the math for you.

00:18:50.555 --> 00:18:51.623
Yeah. I'm sure you did.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.029
What do you think of that guy.
Ramsie?

00:18:57.063 --> 00:18:58.698
He's friendly.

00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:00.633
Gets along with the clientele.
why?

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:03.368
He should lose the ring.

00:19:03.401 --> 00:19:05.671
It's distracting.

00:19:05.705 --> 00:19:07.506
Sends the wrong message.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.011
Rosen why are you
so fucking happy?

00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:15.681
Our
operation was expanding fast.

00:19:15.715 --> 00:19:18.017
We had to keep
our books clean.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.353
keep the authorities
off the money trail.

00:19:21.386 --> 00:19:24.523
If you're on a leaky boat.
you plug the holes.

00:19:24.556 --> 00:19:26.859
You over by 200.

00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:28.426
It was a good day
at the track.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.697
Yeah?
Explain the numbers to me.

00:19:34.399 --> 00:19:41.908
Uh. I had 9.320 on the seven
at...

00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:45.645
573 against the favorite.

00:19:45.678 --> 00:19:48.613
But you heard Reenam Roll
was a winner.

00:19:48.648 --> 00:19:51.583
So you. what?
You to sweeten the pot?

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:56.055
You got to admit it.
He is good.

00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:59.524
Yeah. well. I couldn't lose.

00:19:59.558 --> 00:20:03.062
What did I tell you?
Trust your memory.

00:20:03.095 --> 00:20:07.800
I know. I just got a lot
of numbers to remember.

00:20:07.834 --> 00:20:12.071
You know. how many gambling
rooms I run in this town?

00:20:12.104 --> 00:20:16.676
The fact that you don't know
puts us at an advantage.

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:18.510
You also got no idea
how much money

00:20:18.543 --> 00:20:22.081
comes through that door
each day. do you?

00:20:22.114 --> 00:20:23.481
You know what?

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:26.853
The only one who knows is me

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:31.824
and I keep that number
in my head.

00:20:31.858 --> 00:20:35.795
But you do know the percentage
of our bets don't you?

00:20:35.828 --> 00:20:39.598
- 10%.
- 10% win or lose?

00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:42.935
That's what sustains
this business. Jimmy.

00:20:42.969 --> 00:20:45.071
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

00:20:45.104 --> 00:20:47.640
Who else is gambling
with our money. maybe?

00:20:47.673 --> 00:20:50.710
I swear. Bugsy.
I don't know nothing.

00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:55.681
Did you just call me Bugsy.

00:20:59.517 --> 00:21:03.455
Everybody calls you that.
at least when you're not around.

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:11.163
Well. now I'm confused.

00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:13.766
Am I not standing here?

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:15.500
What am I?

00:21:15.533 --> 00:21:17.737
Am I a figment
of your imagination?

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.971
No.

00:21:19.005 --> 00:21:20.773
No. no. because that's
what you just said.

00:21:20.806 --> 00:21:24.010
That's what people call me
when I'm not around.

00:21:24.043 --> 00:21:26.511
But I'm right here.

00:21:26.544 --> 00:21:30.116
Meyer. do you see me?

00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:31.817
I see you. Bennie.

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:36.188
I'm going to ask you
one more time. Jimmy.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.895
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:46.198
- No. I...
- Don't lie to me.

00:21:52.238 --> 00:21:54.506
Don't forget to breathe.

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:56.742
They say breathing is good.

00:21:56.776 --> 00:21:58.010
Okay.

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:03.548
Now. don't you want me to know?

00:22:05.818 --> 00:22:13.960
I-I-I may have heard something
about a dealer

00:22:13.993 --> 00:22:16.528
at your Roma at Allen.

00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:18.631
I don't remember his name.

00:22:18.664 --> 00:22:20.032
Well. let me jog your memory.
huh?

00:22:22.668 --> 00:22:26.604
Ow! Rosen. his name is Rosen.

00:22:26.639 --> 00:22:28.573
Now what exactly
did he tell you?

00:22:28.606 --> 00:22:30.876
He was tipping off some players.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.611
I don't know anything else.
I swear.

00:22:36.182 --> 00:22:38.684
Sit up.

00:22:38.718 --> 00:22:39.952
Thank you. Jimmy.

00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:44.256
It's very helpful for us.
you know.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:49.028
Oh. at least you die
with a clean conscience. right?

00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:50.562
Who?

00:22:50.595 --> 00:22:52.965
You.

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:56.702
God dammit. not in my ear.

00:23:04.043 --> 00:23:07.013
First time me and you
met and here comes little Meyer

00:23:07.046 --> 00:23:10.249
walking through the snow
like the wandering Jew.

00:23:10.282 --> 00:23:11.817
And my guys. I mean.

00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.119
there must've been like
six of us or something. huh?

00:23:13.152 --> 00:23:13.919
Seven.

00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:15.154
We ask him
to empty his pockets.

00:23:15.187 --> 00:23:16.856
if he wants to cross the street.

00:23:16.889 --> 00:23:20.259
Ask?
I don't recall any asking.

00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:23.561
We politely instructed him
to remove the contents

00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:25.331
of his pockets.

00:23:25.364 --> 00:23:27.199
Charlie Lucky Luciano.

00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:29.567
father of modern
organized crime.

00:23:29.601 --> 00:23:31.203
He created the governing body
of the Mafia

00:23:31.237 --> 00:23:32.304
known as The Commission

00:23:32.338 --> 00:23:34.840
and the National
Crime Syndicate.

00:23:34.874 --> 00:23:38.110
Confederation of Italian. Jewish
and Irish Gangsters.

00:23:38.144 --> 00:23:40.246
And you know
what he said to us?

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:43.783
"Go fuck yourselves.
you guinea bastards."

00:23:43.816 --> 00:23:47.086
That's right and the balls
on this one. huh?

00:23:48.954 --> 00:23:51.657
This kid would fought all six
of us before giving up a penny.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.758
So what do I do?

00:23:52.792 --> 00:23:54.627
I let them go.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.063
Kid as us fearlessness as that
deserves to be rewarded.

00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:00.598
How many times I've gotta hear
this story. huh. Lucky?

00:24:00.633 --> 00:24:03.702
Eh. this story is like wine.
Benny.

00:24:03.736 --> 00:24:05.738
Get's better with age.

00:24:05.771 --> 00:24:07.006
I prefer whiskey.

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:09.875
The point is.

00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:15.047
You and me. Meyer. Italian. Jew.
none of that matters.

00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:17.983
What matters is the way
we see the world.

00:24:18.017 --> 00:24:20.186
We fight our way in
from the outside.

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:21.787
That's right.

00:24:21.821 --> 00:24:25.825
This distribution business
you proposing.

00:24:25.858 --> 00:24:27.592
we got ourselves a deal.

00:24:29.762 --> 00:24:32.031
I'll drink to that.

00:24:40.106 --> 00:24:42.808
See that half-Checz girl?

00:24:42.842 --> 00:24:45.377
You know. she's jotting
everything down.

00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:49.782
Who's coming. who's going.
who's talking to who?

00:24:49.815 --> 00:24:54.820
That all goes to lucky.
It's the attention to detail.

00:24:54.854 --> 00:24:59.158
That's what makes a Lucky.
Lucky.

00:24:59.191 --> 00:25:02.194
I'm paying attention
to a different detail.

00:25:02.228 --> 00:25:03.729
Be right back.

00:25:15.341 --> 00:25:16.709
Have a seat.

00:25:19.411 --> 00:25:20.746
This is my friend. Meyer.

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:24.183
Meyer. please meet
Anne and Louise.

00:25:24.216 --> 00:25:25.317
Hello.

00:25:29.722 --> 00:25:30.923
Now tell me something.
what are two lovely ladies

00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:33.893
like yourself doing
in a place like this?

00:25:33.926 --> 00:25:36.428
The sign outside said
it was a drugstore.

00:25:36.462 --> 00:25:38.030
I needed some toothpaste.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.268
So what are you guys.

00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:44.403
professional gamblers
or something?

00:25:44.436 --> 00:25:48.474
Oh! Us? No. No. no. no.

00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:51.410
Then what line
of business are you in?

00:25:51.443 --> 00:25:53.112
Truck rentals.

00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:55.781
Truck rentals?
What does that mean?

00:25:55.814 --> 00:25:58.384
Means we rent trucks.

00:25:58.417 --> 00:26:00.386
Anne. look.

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:03.956
It's the big cheese gangster
from the newsreels.

00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:06.125
They say he murdered
his own cousin.

00:26:07.193 --> 00:26:08.894
Louise.

00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:12.398
Hey.
how's about I go over there tell them to

00:26:12.431 --> 00:26:14.900
come give you a good old kiss
on the lips.

00:26:14.934 --> 00:26:16.702
Very funny.

00:26:18.304 --> 00:26:19.705
OK.

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:27.246
What the hell?
Is he really doing it?

00:26:29.348 --> 00:26:33.118
Oh. my God.
he's looking right at us.

00:26:33.152 --> 00:26:35.120
Let's get out of here.

00:26:35.154 --> 00:26:37.022
I'm not going anywhere.

00:26:39.158 --> 00:26:42.061
The man is a killer
and these guys are his friends.

00:26:45.297 --> 00:26:46.999
They seem harmless.

00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:51.270
Suit. yourself.

00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:03.282
So you're in the truck
rental business?

00:27:09.521 --> 00:27:10.889
Cold?

00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:18.831
You need a coat.

00:27:21.133 --> 00:27:23.235
Are you going to buy me one?

00:27:30.276 --> 00:27:31.443
Fur.

00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:36.181
Mink.

00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:44.456
Leather trim
down to the knees.

00:27:48.628 --> 00:27:50.796
And what will you do
with the rest?

00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:55.167
Of this?

00:27:57.136 --> 00:28:01.307
This I'm going to keep
for our future.

00:28:29.068 --> 00:28:30.369
Not too cold.

00:28:33.972 --> 00:28:35.341
It's refreshing.

00:28:35.374 --> 00:28:39.511
Oh. it's cold.

00:28:39.545 --> 00:28:41.413
Alright. crazy.
Would you like 'em?

00:28:43.182 --> 00:28:44.917
Sure. why not.

00:28:47.086 --> 00:28:50.489
Thank you. I'm Maureen.

00:28:50.522 --> 00:28:51.890
I'm David.

00:28:56.261 --> 00:28:58.297
You're a writer.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.933
Yeah? How do you know that?

00:29:00.966 --> 00:29:02.368
I hear you taping at night?

00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:03.502
Yeah?

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:05.404
Yeah.

00:29:05.437 --> 00:29:07.439
And the walls are pretty thin.

00:29:10.342 --> 00:29:12.511
Spy novels?

00:29:12.544 --> 00:29:14.113
I'm just doing research.

00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:15.581
On women in swimming pools?

00:29:18.317 --> 00:29:21.120
It's good you quick.
very quick.

00:29:24.123 --> 00:29:27.426
What about you?
Are you on vacation?

00:29:27.459 --> 00:29:28.927
Something like that.

00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:36.368
Doctor. are you telling us that
Buddy will have to wear a brace

00:29:36.402 --> 00:29:37.670
the rest of his life?

00:29:41.507 --> 00:29:43.643
If you'd like. I'd be happy
to recommend specialists

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:45.310
who are developing
a new treatment

00:29:45.344 --> 00:29:46.445
for cerebral palsy.

00:29:46.478 --> 00:29:48.280
Answer the goddamn question.

00:29:51.483 --> 00:29:53.986
My professional opinion is.
you a...

00:30:04.997 --> 00:30:06.465
The doctor said
there was no chance

00:30:06.498 --> 00:30:08.434
he would ever be normal.

00:30:08.467 --> 00:30:11.203
And you couldn't accept that?

00:30:11.236 --> 00:30:14.473
I wasn't about to let my son
become weak and vulnerable.

00:30:14.506 --> 00:30:15.507
No.

00:30:17.075 --> 00:30:19.211
And if I could help it.

00:30:19.244 --> 00:30:21.146
Why did that bother you so much?

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.347
Why do you think?

00:30:29.656 --> 00:30:33.760
Would it not bother you to see
your own son go through his life

00:30:33.793 --> 00:30:35.327
at such a disadvantage?

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.164
I couldn't accept the odds.

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:42.401
The odds?

00:30:42.434 --> 00:30:44.603
It was a mathematical
equation.

00:30:44.637 --> 00:30:48.307
the proportion of those
afflicted versus those cured.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.075
the rate at which
those afflicted

00:30:50.108 --> 00:30:51.678
were able to walk again.

00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:53.111
I ran the numbers to my head.

00:30:53.145 --> 00:30:54.379
I made the calculations.

00:30:54.413 --> 00:30:56.649
You thought
you could beat the odds?

00:30:56.683 --> 00:30:57.616
Yes.

00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:02.020
What about faith?

00:31:02.054 --> 00:31:03.055
Faith?

00:31:03.088 --> 00:31:04.156
Mm hmm.

00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:05.290
Maybe God wanted him
to be like that.

00:31:05.324 --> 00:31:06.458
Who?

00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:15.467
Hello. God. hello.
hell fucking lo.

00:31:15.501 --> 00:31:17.503
I ain't hearing anybody
answer me.

00:31:17.536 --> 00:31:20.339
Maybe he's got nothing
he wants to tell you.

00:31:20.372 --> 00:31:24.009
And he made that clear.
didn't he?

00:31:27.647 --> 00:31:30.349
You OK?

00:31:30.382 --> 00:31:31.383
Let's do this.

00:31:43.295 --> 00:31:45.765
Come on you.

00:31:45.798 --> 00:31:46.666
Shut up. Rosen..

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.780
Get down. come on. get down.

00:32:00.813 --> 00:32:04.316
Please. don't do anything
to him. please!

00:32:04.349 --> 00:32:06.485
Hey. hey. woah. woah. woah.
enough.

00:32:06.518 --> 00:32:08.153
Hey. what the fuck
is she doing here?

00:32:08.186 --> 00:32:09.121
Well you told me
to bring her down.

00:32:09.154 --> 00:32:12.090
Please. please. he's a good man.

00:32:12.124 --> 00:32:12.792
He's a father.

00:32:12.825 --> 00:32:14.861
We have four children. please.

00:32:14.894 --> 00:32:16.128
Oh God.

00:32:16.161 --> 00:32:17.563
Get up.

00:32:17.596 --> 00:32:20.465
Here. this is for you.

00:32:20.499 --> 00:32:24.637
Your husband has been stealing
from me for years. Mrs. Rosen.

00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:27.472
A nickel at a time.
money that adds up.

00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:32.210
Mrs. Rosen. you knew about this.
didn't you?

00:32:36.315 --> 00:32:37.282
It's OK.

00:32:42.689 --> 00:32:45.390
This is a warning.

00:32:45.424 --> 00:32:49.762
But if you ever mention what you
see here today to anyone.

00:32:49.796 --> 00:32:54.634
You'll be putting your life
and your children's in danger.

00:32:57.536 --> 00:33:01.306
You understand?

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.574
Get her out of here.

00:33:05.477 --> 00:33:07.346
May I help you with anything.
Mrs. Rosen?

00:33:07.379 --> 00:33:09.181
Come on. deal with it.

00:33:11.951 --> 00:33:13.653
Don't worry about him.
he's okay.

00:33:16.956 --> 00:33:18.858
Where were you?

00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:22.829
She was a mess. boss.
I was trying to be delicate.

00:33:22.862 --> 00:33:28.701
Never let your emotions dictate
your actions ever again.

00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:27.225
So you left them fatherless?

00:34:27.259 --> 00:34:28.427
Three children.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.664
He left them fatherless.

00:34:31.698 --> 00:34:33.900
Is that what you tell yourself.
so you can sleep at night?

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:35.534
No. I don't have to tell myself
anything

00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:38.403
when I go to sleep at night.

00:34:38.437 --> 00:34:40.539
It's the way we live.
It's business.

00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:44.911
What do you want.
a fucking fairy tale. David?

00:34:44.944 --> 00:34:46.846
Go home and write a fairy tale.

00:34:48.014 --> 00:34:49.916
<i>I want
you to write a book about me.</i>

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.551
<i>Would that be
of interest to you?</i>

00:34:52.584 --> 00:34:55.722
<i>Yeah.
I'd be very interested in that.</i>

00:34:55.755 --> 00:34:58.590
<i>Good.
I'll need you to come to Miami.</i>

00:34:58.623 --> 00:35:01.027
<i>There's a coffee shop not far
from where I live.</i>

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.295
<i>Take down this address.</i>

00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:05.363
Okay?

00:35:05.397 --> 00:35:06.999
We need more resources.

00:35:07.033 --> 00:35:10.970
Even after sell him Frank?
15 years.

00:35:11.003 --> 00:35:12.571
You got all the surveillance
you asked for.

00:35:12.604 --> 00:35:14.006
What else are you expecting
to find here?

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.744
The $300 million that
Lansky has stashed away.

00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:19.846
This guy. Stone. can really
open the door for us.

00:35:19.879 --> 00:35:21.781
Opening the door?

00:35:21.814 --> 00:35:24.316
There are no more doors to open.
Frank.

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:28.386
tax evasion. contempt of court.
they threw it all away.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.757
And no indictment.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.658
Lansky's impenetrable.

00:35:32.692 --> 00:35:34.961
But that stuff was 10 years ago.

00:35:34.994 --> 00:35:37.063
And where's he been
for the last 10 years?

00:35:37.096 --> 00:35:40.298
Federal prison?
No.

00:35:40.332 --> 00:35:43.335
Collins Avenue walking that
little shiatsu of his

00:35:43.368 --> 00:35:45.638
up and down the boardwalk
with a smug face.

00:35:45.671 --> 00:35:47.006
It's an embarrassment. frankly.

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:47.707
We can fix that.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.509
Oh. yeah and how's that. Greg?

00:35:50.542 --> 00:35:52.511
Even if that money is out there
somewhere.

00:35:52.544 --> 00:35:53.913
we don't have the budget
to keep digging holes

00:35:53.946 --> 00:35:55.882
to know where to
try to find it.

00:35:55.915 --> 00:35:58.617
We're talking about the most
notorious gangster

00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:00.019
in American history.

00:36:00.052 --> 00:36:02.554
We're just asking
for a little rope.

00:36:02.587 --> 00:36:05.658
A little rope. so you two can
hang yourselves. huh?

00:36:05.691 --> 00:36:09.061
Andre. Just consider it.

00:36:27.747 --> 00:36:29.715
Hey. hey.

00:36:29.749 --> 00:36:31.449
Hi.

00:36:31.483 --> 00:36:35.121
I was. um. I was
in the neighborhood.

00:36:35.154 --> 00:36:37.924
Come in. come in. yeah.

00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:46.364
So I was about to take a break.
so we need some glasses.

00:36:46.398 --> 00:36:48.400
I've only got these glasses
so let me fix something.

00:36:48.433 --> 00:36:49.434
One second.

00:36:57.442 --> 00:36:59.444
How is the book going?

00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:00.146
- The book?
- Yeah.

00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:02.915
Uh. struggling.

00:37:02.949 --> 00:37:05.517
I'm guessing that's a good
thing. you know?

00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:12.390
Is this the guy you are writing
the book about?

00:37:12.424 --> 00:37:13.458
Yeah.

00:37:16.996 --> 00:37:18.631
Meyer Lansky?

00:37:18.664 --> 00:37:22.001
That's him. Here. sit down.

00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:23.435
Should I know who that is?

00:37:23.468 --> 00:37:26.072
Uh. he ran a lot of Casinos.

00:37:26.105 --> 00:37:28.908
So. if you're into gambling.
I guess. but. um.

00:37:28.941 --> 00:37:30.643
Hey. I'm so sorry
about the mess.

00:37:30.676 --> 00:37:32.510
Oh stop. I don't care.

00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:39.484
That's my daughter.
She's really cheeky.

00:37:39.517 --> 00:37:41.053
And looks a lot like me.

00:37:41.087 --> 00:37:43.923
Oh. she's pretty cute.

00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:48.995
Yeah. and I got a picture
of my son somewhere.

00:37:49.028 --> 00:37:51.063
but of 18 months.

00:37:51.097 --> 00:37:52.497
He looks like a bug.

00:37:55.034 --> 00:37:58.070
But uh. here you go.
and don't worry. you know?

00:37:58.104 --> 00:37:59.604
- Yeah. I noticed.
- Yeah. okay.

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:08.948
To your huh.
to a vacation in paradise.

00:38:13.986 --> 00:38:14.954
Sorry.

00:38:18.556 --> 00:38:19.759
You were saying?

00:38:22.795 --> 00:38:24.063
To umm...

00:38:26.032 --> 00:38:28.935
To a vacation in paradise.
I guess.

00:38:39.577 --> 00:38:40.612
Are you sure?

00:38:40.646 --> 00:38:41.681
Yeah.

00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:53.591
Well you were unfaithful
to your wife.

00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:55.661
is that why you broke up?

00:38:59.699 --> 00:39:02.234
Then what was it?

00:39:02.268 --> 00:39:04.637
I tried to give her
a good life

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:08.274
and tried to make her happy.
but it wasn't enough.

00:39:08.307 --> 00:39:12.712
Happy on whose terms?
Your's or her's?

00:39:15.114 --> 00:39:18.050
I was as unfaithful
as they come.

00:39:18.084 --> 00:39:21.187
The way I see it. you do
what you can and feel alive.

00:39:24.056 --> 00:39:26.726
It's time I told you about the
years leading up to the war.

00:39:29.862 --> 00:39:32.031
I though you quit.

00:39:32.064 --> 00:39:35.234
You keep it pack as a reminder.

00:39:35.267 --> 00:39:37.636
You want to conquer
your weaknesses.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.604
keep them in plain sight.

00:39:41.307 --> 00:39:42.908
Speaking of which. how was...

00:39:44.844 --> 00:39:45.978
Who?

00:39:46.012 --> 00:39:49.148
You still have lipstick
on your neck.

00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:51.117
Don't you shower?
Jesus.

00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:55.821
So. Lucky was in jail.

00:39:55.855 --> 00:39:57.555
I wanted to get him
out of prison.

00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:01.293
How fast can we put together
an army of men?

00:40:01.327 --> 00:40:03.129
Fast?

00:40:03.162 --> 00:40:05.998
For what?

00:40:06.032 --> 00:40:07.733
I want to put the fear of God
into them.

00:40:11.137 --> 00:40:12.138
Heil Hitler.

00:40:12.171 --> 00:40:13.605
Heil Hitler.

00:40:15.307 --> 00:40:17.643
My

00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:20.079
We call upon our legislators
to evict.

00:40:20.112 --> 00:40:28.054
Jew is as alien in body.
mind and soul

00:40:28.087 --> 00:40:30.588
and it is more dangerous to us
than all the others

00:40:30.622 --> 00:40:33.793
by reason of its
parasitic nature.

00:40:33.826 --> 00:40:34.727
Heil Hitler.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.095
Heil Hitler.

00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:43.936
This is a private function.

00:40:55.981 --> 00:40:58.317
My name is Sasha Klein.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:02.021
My parents come
from Ludmir. Poland.

00:41:02.054 --> 00:41:04.390
I'm Jew.

00:41:04.423 --> 00:41:07.026
You got something
to say to me?

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:08.294
Say it now.

00:41:08.327 --> 00:41:10.629
Jewish scum!

00:42:01.814 --> 00:42:04.984
I would rather have killed them
all.

00:42:05.017 --> 00:42:05.985
Why?

00:42:10.923 --> 00:42:15.928
To show the world that as long
as my Meyer Lansky was around.

00:42:18.898 --> 00:42:21.133
they could never do that to us.
again.

00:42:25.838 --> 00:42:26.972
Never.

00:42:31.277 --> 00:42:35.948
Rabbi Weiss calls the act
shameful and deplorable.

00:42:35.981 --> 00:42:37.483
The rabbi says
there is no difference

00:42:37.516 --> 00:42:40.719
between these so-called
Jewish gangsters

00:42:40.753 --> 00:42:42.721
and the Nazi hoodlums
they attacked.

00:42:48.994 --> 00:42:51.197
Kosch refuses to take my money.

00:42:54.934 --> 00:42:56.835
People look away from me
and the kids

00:42:56.869 --> 00:42:58.470
when we walk down the sidewalk.

00:43:02.308 --> 00:43:03.909
Now they all know.

00:43:22.394 --> 00:43:24.530
Paul. come.

00:43:24.563 --> 00:43:25.831
Come.

00:43:28.234 --> 00:43:29.768
Buddy. you too.

00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:35.174
Leave your father alone.

00:43:35.207 --> 00:43:37.042
He's got some thinking to do.

00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:38.143
Buddy.

00:43:43.983 --> 00:43:45.351
Listen to your mother.

00:44:04.436 --> 00:44:06.205
Mr. Lansky.

00:44:06.238 --> 00:44:08.007
I'm Lieutenant Haffenden
of the P3 division

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.342
of Naval Intelligence.

00:44:10.376 --> 00:44:13.078
As I'm sure you know.
the Germans are sabotaging.

00:44:13.112 --> 00:44:16.181
and destroying our ships
all over the North Atlantic.

00:44:16.215 --> 00:44:19.285
I've read the papers.
It's terrible.

00:44:19.318 --> 00:44:22.221
The enemy is here on our shore.

00:44:22.254 --> 00:44:23.055
It's only a matter of time

00:44:23.088 --> 00:44:25.257
before there's an attack
on our soil.

00:44:25.291 --> 00:44:27.259
We need to ferret out
German spies.

00:44:27.293 --> 00:44:30.195
Like you. who's got a problem
with the Sicilians.

00:44:30.229 --> 00:44:33.432
Because the Sicilians got
a problem with people like you.

00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:34.833
the authorities.

00:44:34.867 --> 00:44:36.268
The Mafia controls
the waterfront.

00:44:36.302 --> 00:44:39.171
Are you suggesting that
I'm affiliated with the Mafia?

00:44:39.204 --> 00:44:42.041
I'm a businessman. Lieutenant.

00:44:42.074 --> 00:44:44.176
Of course.

00:44:44.209 --> 00:44:47.079
I'll find your spies.

00:44:47.112 --> 00:44:49.148
but you got to do me a favor
first.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.599
Mr. Luciano. State Department
has agreed to arrange

00:45:07.634 --> 00:45:09.268
for your release from prison.

00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:13.272
Twenty four years left
on my sentence.

00:45:13.305 --> 00:45:15.841
14 of whom even eligible
for parole.

00:45:17.476 --> 00:45:20.079
Meyer.

00:45:20.112 --> 00:45:22.816
I know you would do the same
thing for me.

00:45:27.687 --> 00:45:29.421
What can I do to help?

00:45:31.623 --> 00:45:34.426
They need you to set up
a meeting with Joe Socks.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.961
Joe Socks.

00:45:35.994 --> 00:45:39.531
Joe Lanza. local 16975.

00:45:39.565 --> 00:45:42.334
United Seafood Workers Union.

00:45:42.368 --> 00:45:45.137
I'll arrange for your boys
to get their union cards

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.005
and you can begin
your operation.

00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:50.142
I was the connection between
the U.S. and the waterfront.

00:45:50.175 --> 00:45:52.611
There were German spies working
amongst us.

00:45:52.645 --> 00:45:55.280
I extracted whatever
intelligence I could from them

00:45:55.314 --> 00:45:57.182
on behalf of the feds.

00:45:57.216 --> 00:45:59.251
The fate of the country
depended on us.

00:45:59.284 --> 00:46:01.353
and they're looking
to lock me up?

00:46:01.387 --> 00:46:03.155
God bless America.

00:46:07.092 --> 00:46:09.027
I had my
men on a dock hunting Germans

00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:10.496
up and down the shore.

00:46:15.033 --> 00:46:17.136
We root them out
and have ourselves

00:46:17.169 --> 00:46:19.037
a friendly conversation

00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:21.674
in the language them cocksuckers
understood only too well.

00:46:26.612 --> 00:46:28.480
You got an address?

00:46:28.514 --> 00:46:31.684
224 Main Street.

00:46:40.058 --> 00:46:40.959
Freeze. don't move.

00:46:40.993 --> 00:46:42.394
Don't move. you're under arrest.

00:46:43.663 --> 00:46:46.666
We busted up the
whole German intelligence network.

00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:48.967
Blew the cover
on a group of spies

00:46:49.001 --> 00:46:52.471
moving artillery. bombs
and cash.

00:46:52.504 --> 00:46:55.675
They were planning an enormous
attack on American soil.

00:46:55.708 --> 00:46:57.476
but we stopped it.

00:46:58.678 --> 00:46:59.846
So. why would you defend
a country

00:46:59.879 --> 00:47:02.514
whose government is devoted
to putting you behind bars?

00:47:02.548 --> 00:47:05.484
I'm an American and a Jew.

00:47:05.517 --> 00:47:08.721
The Germans wanted to destroy
both of those things.

00:47:08.755 --> 00:47:11.490
So I wanted to destroy
the Germans.

00:47:11.523 --> 00:47:13.325
- And I did.
- OK. But why?

00:47:13.358 --> 00:47:15.561
Why was it never
in the in the press?

00:47:15.594 --> 00:47:18.530
They could never own up to
the fact that somebody like me

00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:22.000
could be capable of doing
any good in this world?

00:47:22.034 --> 00:47:25.037
See. I believe this world
is made of shades of gray.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.206
It's never black or white.

00:47:27.239 --> 00:47:30.008
So. you never felt compelled to
just set the record straight

00:47:30.042 --> 00:47:32.211
and say. Meyer Lansky. patriot.

00:47:32.244 --> 00:47:34.179
I think you found the title
of your book.

00:47:34.213 --> 00:47:36.482
I'm asking the question.

00:47:36.515 --> 00:47:39.051
I never felt the need back then.

00:47:39.084 --> 00:47:40.452
Why?

00:47:40.486 --> 00:47:44.323
It was currency between me
and the United States.

00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:46.793
I assume that if I did favors
for the government.

00:47:46.826 --> 00:47:48.594
they would always honor
my loyalty.

00:47:48.627 --> 00:47:49.729
And did they?

00:47:49.762 --> 00:47:52.164
We haven't gotten to that part
of the story here David.

00:47:52.197 --> 00:47:53.198
OK?

00:47:53.232 --> 00:47:56.168
The United States.

00:47:56.201 --> 00:47:59.438
are not who you think they are.
David.

00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:02.441
You're the wandering Jew
just like Lucky said. right?

00:48:02.474 --> 00:48:05.745
That's me. the outsider
invited in from the cold

00:48:05.778 --> 00:48:08.514
to warm my feet by the fire.

00:48:08.547 --> 00:48:10.215
And then sent them
my way again.

00:48:10.249 --> 00:48:11.250
Yeah.

00:48:14.152 --> 00:48:16.656
You know how that feels.
don't you?

00:48:16.689 --> 00:48:18.290
Of what? What?

00:48:18.323 --> 00:48:20.259
To be an outsider.

00:48:20.292 --> 00:48:21.560
Your father didn't die. David.

00:48:21.593 --> 00:48:23.428
he walked out on you
and your family

00:48:23.462 --> 00:48:26.532
and you felt like an outsider
ever since in this world.

00:48:30.168 --> 00:48:31.503
Yeah.

00:48:33.138 --> 00:48:34.641
Look at us here.

00:48:34.674 --> 00:48:38.110
Couple of outsiders sitting here
in a diner.

00:48:46.719 --> 00:48:47.586
Don't fucking lie.

00:48:48.453 --> 00:48:49.388
That's bullshit.

00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:50.790
No.

00:48:50.823 --> 00:48:52.825
Maureen. I am gonna ask you
one more fucking time.

00:48:52.859 --> 00:48:54.159
who fucking snitched?

00:48:54.192 --> 00:48:55.494
I don't fucking know.

00:48:55.527 --> 00:48:56.261
I swear on my fucking.
I have no idea.

00:48:56.295 --> 00:48:57.563
- That's bullshit.
- You okay?

00:48:57.596 --> 00:48:58.497
Who the fuck is that?

00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:59.131
David. please don't.
we're just talking.

00:48:59.164 --> 00:49:00.033
Don't fucking lie.

00:49:00.065 --> 00:49:01.634
I swear my fucking life.
I have no idea.

00:49:01.668 --> 00:49:02.568
- You're shaking.
- I'm not shaky.

00:49:02.601 --> 00:49:03.535
Hey. take a hike. pal.

00:49:03.569 --> 00:49:06.204
Hey. I've got a John fucking
Wayne here. huh?

00:49:06.238 --> 00:49:08.875
Let me ask you a question. John.

00:49:08.908 --> 00:49:09.842
Are you fucking her?

00:49:09.876 --> 00:49:12.411
Jesus. Ray.

00:49:12.444 --> 00:49:13.345
I don't think it is any
of your business. buddy.

00:49:13.378 --> 00:49:15.882
I'll tell you
why is my fucking business

00:49:15.915 --> 00:49:17.616
because she's got
a big fucking mouth.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.585
- Fuck you.
- And if I can't trust her.

00:49:19.618 --> 00:49:21.286
I can't trust any of her
fuck buddies either.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.822
Don't disrespect her. okay?

00:49:24.691 --> 00:49:26.325
You put your fucking bag down.
pal.

00:49:26.358 --> 00:49:27.827
Ray. please don't do this.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.161
Yeah. put your fucking bag-

00:49:30.495 --> 00:49:32.264
God dammit.

00:49:32.297 --> 00:49:33.733
You're a fucking asshole Ray.

00:49:33.766 --> 00:49:34.834
It's your fucking warning.

00:49:34.867 --> 00:49:36.234
Keep your mouth shut.

00:49:40.606 --> 00:49:43.442
He was busted for selling drugs.

00:49:43.475 --> 00:49:44.610
Someone set him up.

00:49:48.948 --> 00:49:51.216
I told a girlfriend of mine
I was in Miami.

00:49:51.249 --> 00:49:52.517
She told him where I was.

00:49:54.687 --> 00:49:57.657
So he showed up wanting to know
if I know who set him up.

00:49:59.792 --> 00:50:01.126
Do you?

00:50:03.362 --> 00:50:04.396
No.

00:50:09.769 --> 00:50:12.604
We all make mistakes.

00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:13.773
Ray was one of mine.

00:50:20.545 --> 00:50:22.849
Life is just full of shades
of grey.

00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:47.439
She likes it rough. huh?

00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:51.911
Who did that to you?

00:50:51.944 --> 00:50:52.879
It's nothing.

00:50:52.912 --> 00:50:53.946
Either you're going to tell me
who did this

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.414
or I'm going to find out.

00:50:58.483 --> 00:51:02.454
All right. well. okay you know.
the woman that I've been...

00:51:02.487 --> 00:51:05.925
Fucking?
I think that's the word for it.

00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:09.896
Yeah. OK. well. I had to break
up a fight between her

00:51:09.929 --> 00:51:12.564
and her ex.

00:51:12.597 --> 00:51:14.667
I see.

00:51:14.701 --> 00:51:18.370
Well. I wish you luck with all
your future sparring endeavors.

00:51:18.403 --> 00:51:19.772
Thank you. nice.

00:51:19.806 --> 00:51:22.709
My pleasure.
Next time hit him first.

00:51:22.742 --> 00:51:24.644
Always hit him first.

00:51:26.578 --> 00:51:30.549
Mr. Lansky.
you chose the losing side.

00:51:30.582 --> 00:51:36.856
I'm a businessman.
I don't choose sides.

00:51:36.889 --> 00:51:38.825
We chose opportunities.

00:51:38.858 --> 00:51:41.894
Which is why I think we can make
a deal.

00:51:41.928 --> 00:51:43.963
Salvatore Maranzano.

00:51:43.996 --> 00:51:47.299
possible bosses
of organized crime in New York.

00:51:47.332 --> 00:51:49.769
Bootlegging. racketeering.
narcotics.

00:51:49.802 --> 00:51:51.570
He called himself Little Caesar.

00:51:54.406 --> 00:51:56.876
I want to invest
in your corporate joints.

00:51:56.909 --> 00:52:03.683
See. the thing is. I built my
business from the ground up

00:52:03.716 --> 00:52:07.319
and I prefer to keep it under
the same roof.

00:52:10.522 --> 00:52:14.326
And frankly. Mr. Maranzano.
I don't need your money.

00:52:17.897 --> 00:52:23.468
Yeah. I don't give a shit.
how's that look?

00:52:23.502 --> 00:52:24.971
What if I offer you
an opportunity

00:52:25.004 --> 00:52:28.373
to take Luciano's seat
in the council?

00:52:28.406 --> 00:52:30.375
How you propose doing that?

00:52:30.408 --> 00:52:33.612
You take Luciano out
and the seat's yours.

00:52:33.646 --> 00:52:34.981
He'll never see it coming
from you.

00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.053
You walk out now

00:52:41.087 --> 00:52:42.755
or we'll take you down
with the restaurant.

00:52:47.927 --> 00:52:53.532
I have known Luciano
for a long time.

00:52:53.565 --> 00:52:56.769
since we were children.

00:52:56.803 --> 00:52:59.071
He's much more than an associate
to me.

00:52:59.105 --> 00:53:01.808
I respect that.

00:53:01.841 --> 00:53:05.510
But there can only be one boss.
and that's me.

00:53:05.544 --> 00:53:07.780
It's about business.

00:53:07.814 --> 00:53:09.715
I think you should make
the right decision here

00:53:09.749 --> 00:53:11.416
and do the right thing.

00:53:11.449 --> 00:53:12.551
We've got a search warrant.

00:53:13.653 --> 00:53:15.087
Hey. nobody move.

00:53:15.121 --> 00:53:16.454
Nobody move!
Hey!

00:53:16.488 --> 00:53:17.589
What's all the commotion?

00:53:17.622 --> 00:53:18.791
Go check it out. Marco.

00:53:21.828 --> 00:53:25.998
Woah. woah. woah. calm down.
Put down your guns.

00:53:26.032 --> 00:53:28.433
My boss is inside.
you go talk to him.

00:53:28.466 --> 00:53:29.702
He knows your Captain.
It's going to be OK.

00:53:29.735 --> 00:53:31.469
Everything's all right.
Hey.

00:53:36.142 --> 00:53:38.678
What took you so long?

00:53:38.711 --> 00:53:39.712
Lot of stairs.

00:53:41.013 --> 00:53:43.716
Double crossing prick.

00:53:43.749 --> 00:53:44.951
Make him feel it. Benny.

00:53:44.984 --> 00:53:46.484
No.

00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:47.385
- Come here.
- No.

00:53:51.556 --> 00:53:53.092
Look at me. look at me
when you fucking die.

00:53:53.125 --> 00:53:54.994
you double crossing
sack of shit.

00:53:58.563 --> 00:53:59.866
Oh. that's it.

00:54:02.702 --> 00:54:03.836
Here you go.

00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:15.181
They're going to come after us
now.

00:54:15.214 --> 00:54:17.183
all of them with everything
they've got.

00:54:17.216 --> 00:54:20.653
We'll already be in control
by then.

00:54:20.686 --> 00:54:22.655
I'm grateful for your loyalty.
Meyer.

00:54:25.691 --> 00:54:28.094
I want a seat at the council.
Charlie.

00:54:28.127 --> 00:54:29.695
It's a new era.

00:54:29.729 --> 00:54:31.664
what matters is
how I run my business.

00:54:31.697 --> 00:54:33.431
not the fact that I'm a Jew.

00:54:33.465 --> 00:54:35.001
You know. if it were up to me...

00:54:35.034 --> 00:54:36.802
We'll be your executors.

00:54:36.836 --> 00:54:39.005
seen the numbers
we're doing in Saratoga.

00:54:39.038 --> 00:54:41.674
No one runs an operation
like I do.

00:54:41.707 --> 00:54:46.478
I got the best carpet joints.
Upstate. Jersey. Florida.

00:54:46.511 --> 00:54:48.613
No. you don't gotta justify it
to me. Meyer.

00:54:48.648 --> 00:54:50.850
Plus. I got the muscle to back
all of 'em.

00:54:50.883 --> 00:54:55.121
And the revenue.
the revenue speaks for itself.

00:54:55.154 --> 00:55:01.559
I run it like a business
and Ford Motors. Coca-Cola.

00:55:01.593 --> 00:55:03.663
You know. like U.S. Steel.

00:55:07.733 --> 00:55:11.170
I'll tell you what.

00:55:11.203 --> 00:55:12.972
I'll do what I can
to convince the council

00:55:13.005 --> 00:55:14.506
that you deserve a spot.

00:55:14.539 --> 00:55:15.507
Hmm.

00:55:17.777 --> 00:55:18.711
What about Benny?

00:55:18.744 --> 00:55:20.980
Benny.

00:55:21.013 --> 00:55:23.115
Benny's handling California
for us?

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.124
Why are you still awake?

00:55:32.158 --> 00:55:34.694
How the hell
am I supposed to sleep?

00:55:34.727 --> 00:55:36.095
Do you know what time it is?

00:55:36.128 --> 00:55:38.230
Yeah. says the man who comes
and goes at all hours.

00:55:38.264 --> 00:55:40.700
Mind your business.

00:55:40.733 --> 00:55:41.901
Was out working.

00:55:41.934 --> 00:55:43.703
Oh work.

00:55:43.736 --> 00:55:45.537
It's always work with you.

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.707
Take a look around you.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.142
All this shit.

00:55:50.176 --> 00:55:52.845
Where do you think
it comes from. huh?

00:55:52.878 --> 00:55:55.781
Maybe try showing
a little gratitude for once.

00:55:55.815 --> 00:55:58.184
Gratitude?

00:55:58.217 --> 00:56:02.520
The hell with gratitude.
you're a criminal.

00:56:02.554 --> 00:56:03.122
Come on.

00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:15.067
What happened to you?

00:56:15.101 --> 00:56:16.669
You're pathetic.

00:56:20.339 --> 00:56:24.310
You think the neighbors
don't talk to you because of me?

00:56:24.343 --> 00:56:27.246
I see in your eyes
what you do at night.

00:56:27.279 --> 00:56:30.716
Who do you think you are
coming into our home

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.818
pretending to be a good man.
huh?

00:56:32.852 --> 00:56:34.954
A father?

00:56:34.987 --> 00:56:37.622
You think you're helping him?

00:56:38.324 --> 00:56:40.960
Shut your mouth!

00:56:40.993 --> 00:56:43.062
It's your fault.

00:56:43.095 --> 00:56:45.765
It's your fault he's a cripple.

00:56:45.798 --> 00:56:48.000
It's because of you.
it's all because of you!

00:56:52.705 --> 00:56:56.008
It's called "judgement".
it's punishment

00:56:56.042 --> 00:56:57.076
for what you've done

00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:59.712
and how you live your life.
Meyer.

00:57:07.086 --> 00:57:08.354
God is watching.

00:57:08.387 --> 00:57:12.792
He's watching.
he's watching you. I know he is.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.939
You believe that?

00:57:26.972 --> 00:57:28.140
Believe what?

00:57:28.174 --> 00:57:33.212
We get judged and punished
for the way we live our lives.

00:57:33.245 --> 00:57:37.615
The choices we make
that's what defines us.

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:39.885
I don't question the choices
I make.

00:57:39.919 --> 00:57:41.220
Never?

00:57:41.253 --> 00:57:43.222
I get the feeling sometimes
you don't question

00:57:43.255 --> 00:57:45.691
the choices you make either.

00:57:45.724 --> 00:57:47.660
Okay. let's talk
about those choices.

00:57:49.695 --> 00:57:51.630
Tell me about Murder. Inc.

00:57:51.664 --> 00:57:53.833
After Maranzano.

00:57:53.866 --> 00:57:57.369
we needed the muscle
to consolidate our power.

00:57:57.403 --> 00:57:59.604
I had the right people to do it.

00:58:01.373 --> 00:58:02.607
Bingo.

00:58:04.944 --> 00:58:07.813
A group of
nice Jewish and Italian boys.

00:58:07.847 --> 00:58:10.716
you know. the kind a girl wants
to bring home to her mother.

00:58:10.749 --> 00:58:12.818
Always willing to lend a hand.

00:58:15.921 --> 00:58:19.758
"Murder. Inc.".
that's what they called them.

00:58:19.792 --> 00:58:23.662
There was Abe "Kid Twist" Reles.
"Tick-Tock" Tannenbaum.

00:58:23.696 --> 00:58:27.399
Louis "Lepke" Buchalter.
an army of enforcers.

00:58:27.433 --> 00:58:30.769
hired assassins.
a thousand hits between 'em.

00:58:30.803 --> 00:58:33.772
they put contract killers
on payroll.

00:58:33.806 --> 00:58:35.441
There were no rules
on how to kill.

00:58:35.474 --> 00:58:39.945
As long as you got it done.
you got paid.

00:58:39.979 --> 00:58:43.749
Most were shot. stabbed.
strangled. drowned. burned.

00:58:43.782 --> 00:58:48.254
buried alive. left to bleed dry.
all of 'em unrepentant.

00:58:48.287 --> 00:58:50.823
cold-blooded killers.

00:58:50.856 --> 00:58:53.692
And Lansky was their general.

00:58:53.726 --> 00:58:56.362
Through sheer determination
and fearlessness.

00:58:56.395 --> 00:58:59.031
Lansky finally got
what he wanted.

00:58:59.064 --> 00:59:01.734
a seat at the table
sitting right beside guys like

00:59:01.767 --> 00:59:06.305
Joe Bonnano. Frank Costello.
Al Capone. Italian...

00:59:06.338 --> 00:59:08.340
- Meyer.
- To Meyer.

00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:10.476
Jewish and Irish
mob bosses from across America.

00:59:10.509 --> 00:59:12.878
together. they formed
the largest organization

00:59:12.912 --> 00:59:15.047
of crime the world
has ever known.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.882
the National Crime Syndicate.

00:59:30.396 --> 00:59:32.097
I don't know understand

00:59:32.131 --> 00:59:33.265
when they're investigating
Lansky.

00:59:33.299 --> 00:59:35.801
no one bothered to look
at the old files.

00:59:35.834 --> 00:59:38.804
Hey. we're talking 40 years
of transcripts. depositions.

00:59:38.837 --> 00:59:40.806
surveillance reports.

00:59:40.839 --> 00:59:42.474
That's a lot of material.

00:59:42.508 --> 00:59:45.911
Frank. look at this.

00:59:45.945 --> 00:59:47.213
It says he's still alive.

00:59:50.449 --> 00:59:54.820
Mr. Sims. I'm Special Agent
Frank Rivers with the FBI.

00:59:58.824 --> 01:00:01.093
I'd like to talk to you
about your association

01:00:01.126 --> 01:00:02.328
with Meyer Lansky.

01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:05.064
Never heard of him.

01:00:05.097 --> 01:00:07.533
I can make your life in here
a whole lot easier. you know.

01:00:07.566 --> 01:00:09.835
I'm gonna die in here.

01:00:09.868 --> 01:00:11.437
The hell are you gonna do
for me?

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:13.105
Get me fresh soup?

01:00:13.138 --> 01:00:16.375
Well. Lansky sent you on a job
and you got caught

01:00:16.408 --> 01:00:19.078
and right now he's uh...

01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.013
he's having
a pretty comfortable life.

01:00:21.046 --> 01:00:22.414
and you're stuck in here.

01:00:22.448 --> 01:00:24.350
You gonna pop him for me.
are you?

01:00:24.383 --> 01:00:25.851
I can put him away.

01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:27.486
Make it so his life's
not a whole lot different

01:00:27.519 --> 01:00:29.421
from yours.

01:00:29.455 --> 01:00:31.890
I'm looking for his money.

01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:34.960
He started stashing it away
back in the Murder. Inc. days.

01:00:34.994 --> 01:00:37.096
So who was keeping the books
back then?

01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:39.231
- No money.
- What do you mean no money?

01:00:39.265 --> 01:00:41.267
There's no money in murder.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:47.072
It wasn't a sustainable business
not like a casino.

01:00:47.106 --> 01:00:48.207
There was money.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.942
Maybe he just didn't tell you
about it.

01:00:49.975 --> 01:00:52.011
he was stuffing the walls
with it.

01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:58.150
Then go ask the walls.

01:00:58.183 --> 01:01:01.287
You listen to me.
you piece of shit.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.190
The only reason you're in here
is because of that asshole.

01:01:05.224 --> 01:01:07.993
Well. now you can suffer
the rest of your time in here

01:01:08.027 --> 01:01:09.461
because of him. too.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:13.399
Geneva.

01:01:13.432 --> 01:01:15.601
Geneva?

01:01:15.635 --> 01:01:19.171
He had a money manager
in Geneva.

01:01:41.493 --> 01:01:42.928
What are you doing with that?

01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:49.335
What are you doing with it?

01:01:53.038 --> 01:01:54.540
FBI.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:00.212
Just tell...
just tell me. tell me.

01:02:00.245 --> 01:02:01.380
Tell me. it's okay.

01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:03.215
What... what is it?

01:02:03.248 --> 01:02:05.184
Ray turned state's
evidence.

01:02:05.217 --> 01:02:07.986
he made a deal with the Feds.
they reduced his sentence.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.221
And he named me
as one of his partners

01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:10.456
in his drug operation.

01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:12.324
So the Feds came to me
and they said that

01:02:12.358 --> 01:02:14.360
I would go to prison
if I didn't cooperate.

01:02:14.393 --> 01:02:15.594
Okay.

01:02:18.163 --> 01:02:19.164
So how?

01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:20.499
It's "cooperate"
that's the word that they used?

01:02:20.532 --> 01:02:22.201
Get close to you.

01:02:24.403 --> 01:02:28.207
Okay. and then?

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.876
Feed them information
from your files.

01:02:33.579 --> 01:02:37.684
Listen. David. everything
that's been happening between us

01:02:37.717 --> 01:02:39.652
is real.

01:02:39.686 --> 01:02:42.020
- You have to trust me.
- Trust you. trust you?

01:02:42.054 --> 01:02:43.122
I know that sounds ridiculous.

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:44.990
I have a family.

01:02:53.733 --> 01:02:57.369
What did... did you...

01:02:57.403 --> 01:02:58.036
What'd you give 'em?

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.372
Everything I could remember.

01:03:00.406 --> 01:03:05.978
The name of associates
and accomplices.

01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:07.446
They wanted me to write
everything down

01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:09.148
and give it to them
and that's what I did.

01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:11.483
Okay. what else did they want?

01:03:11.517 --> 01:03:13.653
What else they wanted
apart from names?

01:03:13.686 --> 01:03:15.421
They said you might have
information on money

01:03:15.454 --> 01:03:17.022
that Lansky laundered years ago.

01:03:17.055 --> 01:03:19.091
Money.

01:03:29.168 --> 01:03:31.937
Oh.

01:04:32.197 --> 01:04:34.032
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>

01:04:34.066 --> 01:04:35.534
<i>What are you doing with it?</i>

01:04:38.337 --> 01:04:41.406
<i>FBI.</i>

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.642
<i>I'll tell you everything.</i>

01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:19.211
Okay. here we are again.

01:05:39.197 --> 01:05:41.233
Morning.

01:05:41.266 --> 01:05:43.302
Can I help you?

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:45.638
Special Agent Frank Rivers.
with the FBI.

01:05:45.672 --> 01:05:48.273
We're looking for a guest
of the hotel. Miss Duffy.

01:05:48.307 --> 01:05:50.475
She's in room 1-4-6.

01:05:50.509 --> 01:05:52.244
Miss Duffy's not here.

01:05:52.277 --> 01:05:54.146
Well. I'd like to look
in her room if I could.

01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:55.147
Suit yourself.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.349
But you're not going to find
anything there.

01:05:57.382 --> 01:05:59.886
- Room's empty.
- Empty?

01:05:59.919 --> 01:06:01.854
Miss Duffy checked out
late last night.

01:06:05.524 --> 01:06:07.727
How did you evade the Feds.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.696
like how did you
and your business associates

01:06:09.729 --> 01:06:12.598
become so successful under
the scrutiny of the government?

01:06:12.632 --> 01:06:15.334
- Why are you whispering?
- Hmm.

01:06:15.367 --> 01:06:18.370
I can hardly hear you.

01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:23.275
How did you and your associates
like that were very successful

01:06:23.308 --> 01:06:24.576
under the scrutiny
of the government?

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:25.912
How did you do that?

01:06:25.945 --> 01:06:28.513
The way any legitimate
company does.

01:06:28.547 --> 01:06:32.484
We were making more money
than some Fortune 500 companies.

01:06:32.517 --> 01:06:35.554
We got assets to manage
and we had the best talent

01:06:35.587 --> 01:06:36.889
to manage them.

01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:38.590
You okay. David?

01:06:38.624 --> 01:06:41.526
You seem a little white
around the gills this morning.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.695
It was one of those nights.

01:06:42.729 --> 01:06:43.595
Not another one.

01:06:46.498 --> 01:06:49.534
Okay. so um. how'd you go about
doing all of that.

01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:51.570
changing your
business practices?

01:06:51.603 --> 01:06:53.572
'Cause I think that's what
everyone wants to know.

01:06:53.605 --> 01:06:56.676
I taught my associates that
there are benefits.

01:06:56.709 --> 01:07:01.346
cost benefit of keeping a guy
that owes you money alive

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.183
instead of goons. I said.
we ought to send accountants.

01:07:05.217 --> 01:07:08.921
Additional sum for
the cash reserve and profit

01:07:08.955 --> 01:07:13.191
should be passed along
to be put in the credit column

01:07:13.225 --> 01:07:14.459
of the ledger.

01:07:14.493 --> 01:07:15.862
There's a reason
I dropped out of school

01:07:15.895 --> 01:07:17.596
when I was 12.

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:18.530
Let him talk.

01:07:18.563 --> 01:07:19.498
That guy made more money

01:07:19.531 --> 01:07:21.400
for Luciano
than all your tweeds combined.

01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:22.467
- Come on.
- Uh.

01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:23.636
Any questions?

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.338
In the early days.
a man owed you money.

01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:29.709
you would send goons
to break his body apart.

01:07:29.742 --> 01:07:32.745
and if he couldn't pay.
he'd find an unfortunate end.

01:07:32.779 --> 01:07:35.715
Now. rather than kill the guy.
we ordered him.

01:07:35.748 --> 01:07:37.582
crunch the numbers.

01:07:37.616 --> 01:07:39.819
make sure his business
turns a profit.

01:07:39.852 --> 01:07:43.255
Now. Joe Schmo belongs to us.

01:07:43.288 --> 01:07:44.556
We own him.

01:07:53.598 --> 01:07:55.467
Why don't we go for a walk.
David?

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.637
You look like
you could use some air.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.271
Come.

01:08:03.308 --> 01:08:07.412
Optimizing our resources.
restructuring our operations.

01:08:07.446 --> 01:08:10.016
This was a new world
for our associates.

01:08:10.049 --> 01:08:12.584
I think it was Henry Ford
that said that.

01:08:12.617 --> 01:08:15.554
"Business that makes nothing
but money is a poor business."

01:08:15.587 --> 01:08:18.390
Gambling and casinos
are to entertainment.

01:08:18.423 --> 01:08:21.728
what Ford's automobile
was to transportation.

01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:22.862
For some business.

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:24.463
it's to realize
as the toss of the dice.

01:08:24.496 --> 01:08:25.865
We catered to that need.

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:28.300
Okay. you wake up
in the morning.

01:08:28.333 --> 01:08:31.037
there's car in your driveway.
you didn't make a product.

01:08:33.405 --> 01:08:36.475
Henry Ford's product
wasn't the car.

01:08:36.508 --> 01:08:39.611
It was the freedom
the car gave to people.

01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:41.948
Freedom is what people wanted.

01:08:41.981 --> 01:08:44.784
Our product wasn't gambling
or the casinos.

01:08:44.817 --> 01:08:47.385
It was the world of excitement
and thrills.

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:49.354
We built have resorts
in this country.

01:08:49.387 --> 01:08:53.291
created thousands of jobs.
supported families.

01:08:53.325 --> 01:08:54.994
It was a product.

01:08:55.027 --> 01:08:56.662
That's why
it's all legalized now.

01:08:56.696 --> 01:08:59.766
why the government
has its finger in the pie.

01:08:59.799 --> 01:09:02.802
It was too valuable a product
to leave to criminals.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:13.880
David. where's your car?

01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:15.547
It's over there.

01:09:19.118 --> 01:09:21.386
This fucker is following us.

01:09:21.419 --> 01:09:24.824
Can you fucking believe it?

01:09:24.857 --> 01:09:27.459
See if you could turn off
some place.

01:09:27.492 --> 01:09:29.361
make the first turn off you can.

01:09:33.431 --> 01:09:33.900
Here?

01:09:33.933 --> 01:09:35.600
Right over here.

01:09:37.637 --> 01:09:39.071
Son of a bitch.

01:09:58.958 --> 01:10:01.794
Right. so who is that?

01:10:01.828 --> 01:10:03.796
I thought maybe
you could tell me.

01:10:06.098 --> 01:10:08.333
I... I don't know.

01:10:17.409 --> 01:10:20.847
When you lose your money.
you lose nothing.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.083
When you lose your health.
you lose something.

01:10:24.116 --> 01:10:27.086
When you lose your character.
you lose everything.

01:10:29.487 --> 01:10:31.389
Remember that.

01:11:11.697 --> 01:11:14.000
Hey. woman in the room.
you seen her?

01:11:14.033 --> 01:11:16.903
- She checked out.
- She checked out?

01:11:16.936 --> 01:11:18.004
What's going on here?

01:11:18.037 --> 01:11:19.105
I don't want any trouble.

01:11:21.107 --> 01:11:22.842
I'm not giving you any trouble.

01:11:22.875 --> 01:11:26.913
The Do Not Disturb sign has been
on your door for a week.

01:11:26.946 --> 01:11:28.714
Okay. well. let's keep it
that way. alright?

01:11:28.748 --> 01:11:31.684
I'll pay you extra.
you let no one in my room.

01:11:31.717 --> 01:11:32.818
Fine.

01:11:53.139 --> 01:11:56.242
Let's talk about the shitstorm
of trouble you're in. Mr. Stone.

01:11:56.275 --> 01:11:57.810
Show him the pictures. Greg.

01:11:59.577 --> 01:12:00.947
This must have been fun. huh?

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:04.016
Get a little taste of that.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:05.550
You have fun taking these?

01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:06.352
Did you have fun taking them?

01:12:06.385 --> 01:12:07.219
Meyer Lansky has
over $300 million.

01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:07.653
Why are you...
why are showing me this?

01:12:07.687 --> 01:12:08.821
Listen to me.

01:12:08.854 --> 01:12:12.058
Lansky has over $300 million
squirreled away somewhere.

01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:12.892
The government wants it

01:12:12.925 --> 01:12:14.994
and we want your help
finding it.

01:12:15.027 --> 01:12:17.730
I can't. I can't... I...

01:12:17.763 --> 01:12:20.132
Now we could let it slip
to Mr. Lansky that

01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:24.003
you've been sharing his secrets
with an FBI informant.

01:12:24.036 --> 01:12:26.238
That's not gonna go well
for you.

01:12:26.272 --> 01:12:30.076
Look. we don't wanna go down
that road if we don't have to.

01:12:30.109 --> 01:12:32.510
We know you're just a writer
who was looking for a story

01:12:32.544 --> 01:12:34.013
who had the misfortune
to stumble into

01:12:34.046 --> 01:12:37.984
a decades-long investigation
into Lansky and Associates.

01:12:38.017 --> 01:12:41.988
So we're willing to offer you
a financial incentive.

01:12:42.021 --> 01:12:44.090
we'll make you a paid informant.

01:12:44.123 --> 01:12:46.692
We'll give you $150.000.

01:12:46.726 --> 01:12:48.861
Now that'll go a long way
to take care of your family

01:12:48.894 --> 01:12:49.428
- and your money problems.
- I don't have any...

01:12:49.462 --> 01:12:50.595
I don't need your money.

01:12:50.628 --> 01:12:52.665
David. we've been listening.

01:12:52.698 --> 01:12:55.600
You help us
or Lansky gets to you first.

01:12:55.634 --> 01:12:57.870
Now we can offer you
and your family protection

01:12:57.903 --> 01:12:59.537
and the money.

01:12:59.571 --> 01:13:02.108
The way I see it.
you don't have a choice.

01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:04.076
I'm gonna give you
my number here.

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.712
You call us from a payphone
when you got something.

01:13:08.948 --> 01:13:10.582
Do the right thing here. David.

01:13:30.602 --> 01:13:33.239
You heard the joke about
this rabbi who got hit by a car.

01:13:33.272 --> 01:13:35.908
falls down.
the emergency ambulance comes.

01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:39.011
rabbi's laying on the floor.
the emergency worker runs over.

01:13:39.045 --> 01:13:41.881
says. "Rabbi. Rabbi.
are you okay?"

01:13:41.914 --> 01:13:45.017
The rabbi looks up at him
and he says. "I make a living."

01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:49.655
Okay. go ahead.

01:13:49.688 --> 01:13:51.657
A little levity here.
you know.

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:56.028
Money. must have been pouring in
by now. right?

01:13:56.062 --> 01:13:57.263
That's right.

01:14:01.734 --> 01:14:05.704
The gaming
business in Cuba is no good.

01:14:05.738 --> 01:14:09.008
it's a free-for-all.
no regulations.

01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:13.646
These men are making millions.

01:14:15.681 --> 01:14:19.218
Gambling in Cuba will soon be
under our control again.

01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:22.188
And President Batista
wants you to oversee it.

01:14:22.221 --> 01:14:23.656
Mr. Lansky.

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:26.692
All of it.

01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:29.662
I appreciate the opportunity.

01:14:29.695 --> 01:14:33.265
I always felt Cuba.
a land of enterprise.

01:14:35.167 --> 01:14:38.003
In America.
you might be an outlaw.

01:14:38.037 --> 01:14:41.407
but in Cuba
you are on the inside.

01:14:50.282 --> 01:14:52.218
You were making what.
10 million?

01:14:52.251 --> 01:14:56.021
Turned to 20.
and then 30 million.

01:14:56.055 --> 01:14:57.790
I was the biggest
casino operator

01:14:57.823 --> 01:14:59.825
this country had ever seen.

01:14:59.859 --> 01:15:02.261
You were legitimate. yeah.
you were above board.

01:15:02.294 --> 01:15:04.964
You had your license.
machines weren't rigged.

01:15:04.997 --> 01:15:06.398
Never.

01:15:06.432 --> 01:15:08.701
But they still consider you
part of the underworld.

01:15:10.936 --> 01:15:13.873
We weren't the underworld.

01:15:13.906 --> 01:15:16.675
We were the overworld.

01:15:25.718 --> 01:15:28.087
Go back to sleep.

01:15:33.359 --> 01:15:36.896
When Batista gave
Lansky control over Cuba's casinos.

01:15:36.929 --> 01:15:39.298
Lansky turned the country
into an international playground

01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:41.867
for gamblers
and pleasure-seekers.

01:15:41.901 --> 01:15:44.236
Criminal empire
outside the U.S..

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:46.805
it couldn't be touched
by law enforcement.

01:15:46.839 --> 01:15:48.774
The National Crime Syndicate
now owned

01:15:48.807 --> 01:15:51.343
the biggest gambling corporation
in the world.

01:15:51.377 --> 01:15:52.912
And Lansky was the CEO.

01:15:56.849 --> 01:15:58.317
Hey kid.

01:16:00.386 --> 01:16:03.722
How you doin'. huh?

01:16:03.756 --> 01:16:05.357
How was the trip?

01:16:05.391 --> 01:16:06.792
Fine.

01:16:09.528 --> 01:16:11.030
How you doin'. beautiful?

01:16:11.063 --> 01:16:12.131
Huh?

01:16:12.164 --> 01:16:13.299
Come on. let's go.

01:16:13.332 --> 01:16:14.466
You wanna go to the room?

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.301
Let's head in.

01:16:15.334 --> 01:16:16.869
Come on.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:53.439
You put the nickel in.

01:16:53.472 --> 01:16:54.807
Just try.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.876
Right here?

01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.412
Pull that lever hard.

01:17:00.446 --> 01:17:06.485
State-of-the-art slot and blend.
silent bells. double jackpots

01:17:06.518 --> 01:17:09.555
and then the guys rig 'em
so they better our odds.

01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:11.357
Haven't I talked to you
about that?

01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:12.524
About what?

01:17:14.893 --> 01:17:16.562
I don't want
the machines rigged.

01:17:16.595 --> 01:17:19.898
Every casino in this town
rigs their machines.

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:23.135
I'm not every casino.

01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:24.336
Yes. sir.

01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:29.275
Come on. go again.

01:17:37.283 --> 01:17:39.285
I'll be right back. Buddy.

01:17:39.318 --> 01:17:40.853
Keep at it.

01:17:40.886 --> 01:17:42.855
You. watch the kid.

01:17:58.037 --> 01:17:59.938
Mr. Yariv.

01:17:59.972 --> 01:18:02.241
Mr. Lansky.
thank you for seeing me.

01:18:02.274 --> 01:18:04.176
Welcome to the Colonial.
Mr. Yariv.

01:18:05.511 --> 01:18:07.313
Please.

01:18:07.346 --> 01:18:09.348
Thank you.

01:18:09.381 --> 01:18:11.984
How can I help you?

01:18:12.017 --> 01:18:15.387
Mr. Lansky. I'm here on behalf
of Golda Meir.

01:18:15.421 --> 01:18:18.023
As you know. our people
have been slaughtered in Germany

01:18:18.057 --> 01:18:19.258
and across Europe.

01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:20.492
The Jewish settlement
in Palestine

01:18:20.526 --> 01:18:21.960
has been hard at work.

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:22.995
You need money?

01:18:23.028 --> 01:18:24.296
Yes.

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.465
To purchase weapons.

01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:28.467
We are fighting for
the future state of Israel

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.170
and for the survival of
the Jewish people. Mr. Lansky.

01:18:31.203 --> 01:18:34.940
Fighting. as in killing.

01:18:43.048 --> 01:18:46.118
We will do whatever it takes.
Mr. Lansky.

01:18:48.954 --> 01:18:52.391
You tell Miss Meir that

01:18:52.424 --> 01:18:55.894
she has Meyer Lansky's support.

01:18:55.928 --> 01:18:58.897
I'd be happy to contribute
in any way.

01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:01.934
And I'm sure my colleagues here
share my feelings

01:19:01.967 --> 01:19:03.369
for the state of Israel.

01:19:05.037 --> 01:19:08.006
Well. how much do you have
on you.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.677
It's the weekend take.

01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:12.077
Give it to him.

01:19:22.988 --> 01:19:25.658
Mr. Yariv here
is taking donations

01:19:25.692 --> 01:19:27.259
for the state of Israel.

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:28.661
I am Italian.

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:54.520
I'll make arrangements for more.

01:19:54.553 --> 01:19:57.122
On behalf of Golda Meir
and the Israeli people.

01:19:57.156 --> 01:19:59.057
we are grateful.

01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:00.660
And we will not soon forget.

01:20:12.004 --> 01:20:14.306
If you need any weapons
or ammunition.

01:20:14.339 --> 01:20:16.074
you let me know.

01:20:16.108 --> 01:20:17.677
We hope you enjoy your stay
with us.

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:20.078
Oh. I'm not staying
at the Colonial.

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.582
Next time. I hope.

01:20:38.564 --> 01:20:41.233
We're hearing things. Meyer.
about Ben.

01:20:42.802 --> 01:20:45.270
What kind of things?

01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:47.606
That he's out of control.
kicking heads in.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.108
dating movie stars.

01:20:50.142 --> 01:20:52.578
He's lost his focus. Meyer.

01:20:52.611 --> 01:20:55.214
We gave him California.
we gave him Vegas.

01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:58.050
all's we get in return is grief.

01:20:58.083 --> 01:20:59.786
I'll talk to him.

01:20:59.819 --> 01:21:01.688
Envelopes are coming back
lighter.

01:21:03.055 --> 01:21:06.291
Listen.
Lucky ain't happy. Meyer.

01:21:08.393 --> 01:21:13.065
You know. it ain't easy for us
coming to you like this

01:21:13.098 --> 01:21:15.100
not gonna shout Ben.

01:21:15.133 --> 01:21:19.238
I said I'll talk to him.

01:21:31.718 --> 01:21:35.420
So what are you gonna do
with your winnings. huh?

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:40.292
Buy mom a new fur coat.
just like you always do.

01:21:40.325 --> 01:21:43.595
Your mother... your mother.
she's got plenty of fur coats.

01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:46.733
I'm gonna be just like you.

01:21:46.766 --> 01:21:49.334
I'm gonna get my wife
fur coats. too.

01:21:54.774 --> 01:21:57.209
Or you can be whatever
you wanna be.

01:21:59.846 --> 01:22:02.047
You don't wanna be like me.

01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:11.390
Why?

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:17.229
You just don't.

01:22:27.172 --> 01:22:32.177
I love you. you know that.
right?

01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:34.413
I love you. too.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.831
I never wanted my children
to follow in my footsteps.

01:22:51.864 --> 01:22:53.766
You know. I think about it
all the time.

01:22:57.837 --> 01:23:01.841
My kids see me as a...
a man who tries his best

01:23:01.874 --> 01:23:04.509
or... or some failure?

01:23:04.543 --> 01:23:06.913
It's complicated.

01:23:06.946 --> 01:23:09.816
Marriage. children.
you did your best.

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.186
I trust you. David.

01:23:14.219 --> 01:23:16.188
You're gonna write
a hell of a book.

01:23:22.662 --> 01:23:24.196
Vegas.

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:26.498
Vegas. Flamingo.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:32.337
We built that
town. a paradise.

01:23:32.371 --> 01:23:35.307
but for us it turned out to be
our worst nightmare.

01:23:54.559 --> 01:23:55.762
- Yeah.
- Benny.

01:23:55.795 --> 01:23:57.529
<i>Meyer. that you?</i>

01:23:59.899 --> 01:24:01.266
What time is it?

01:24:01.299 --> 01:24:03.703
It's a quarter after 2:00 there.

01:24:03.736 --> 01:24:04.904
Look. why don't you
hop on a flight

01:24:04.937 --> 01:24:06.639
and head out here?

01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:09.241
Oh. hey pal. listen.
I'd love to.

01:24:09.274 --> 01:24:10.777
but you know. Ginny's
got friends in town. right?

01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:13.445
So probably not for me.

01:24:15.313 --> 01:24:18.751
Hey. I gotta tell you.
the women in this town. man.

01:24:20.352 --> 01:24:21.888
Meyer. you'd go crazy.

01:24:21.921 --> 01:24:23.956
I'm happy things are good
for you. Ben.

01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:26.391
but unfortunately. we have to
talk about something

01:24:26.425 --> 01:24:28.226
not so pleasant.

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:29.327
Well. what is it?

01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:30.897
It's our investors.

01:24:32.497 --> 01:24:33.833
- They're not happy.
- What do you mean?

01:24:33.866 --> 01:24:35.467
Is there...
did they tell you that?

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.703
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

01:24:36.736 --> 01:24:41.473
The materials are overpriced.
the construction is delayed.

01:24:41.506 --> 01:24:43.810
<i>Do you know how
many people are undertaking this town?</i>

01:24:43.843 --> 01:24:45.945
I can't screw in a light bulb
without a city official

01:24:45.978 --> 01:24:47.880
and he's goddamn maid
coming for a handout.

01:24:47.914 --> 01:24:49.949
- That's the deal.
- <i>The accounting is sloppy. Ben</i>

01:24:49.982 --> 01:24:51.851
and sloppy accounting
leads to concern.

01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:53.251
Do me a favor.

01:24:53.285 --> 01:24:55.454
Remind them that
we own 66% of this casino.

01:24:55.487 --> 01:24:57.757
which means we get to decide
who gets to be concerned.

01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:00.625
66% of nothing is nothing.

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.628
We have to put money back in
to cover the cash flow problem.

01:25:07.066 --> 01:25:09.601
Were you planning on talking
to me about this?

01:25:09.635 --> 01:25:11.536
Of course.

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:12.939
Of course. I mean
what'd you think

01:25:12.972 --> 01:25:16.408
I wasn't gonna have that
conversation with you?

01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:19.544
How much are we talking about.
Ben?

01:25:19.578 --> 01:25:20.680
Half a million.

01:25:22.547 --> 01:25:24.984
Maybe another three
just to get us

01:25:25.017 --> 01:25:26.485
through a few months.

01:25:29.956 --> 01:25:31.556
I'll turn it around. Meyer.

01:25:32.925 --> 01:25:35.795
I know you will. Ben.

01:25:35.828 --> 01:25:37.697
That's what I told Lucky.

01:25:40.733 --> 01:25:43.870
I'm not gonna let you down.
I swear.

01:25:43.903 --> 01:25:45.270
I know. Ben.

01:25:54.013 --> 01:25:56.481
You're listening to my calls?

01:25:56.515 --> 01:25:57.650
He's a bum.

01:26:00.119 --> 01:26:03.355
He's a bum and you know it.

01:26:03.388 --> 01:26:05.323
It's not your concern. Anne.

01:26:05.357 --> 01:26:07.093
He's gonna get you killed.

01:26:07.126 --> 01:26:09.628
They'll kill you both.

01:26:09.662 --> 01:26:10.797
Bang. bang.

01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:14.934
Goodbye. Meyer Lansky.

01:26:14.967 --> 01:26:16.601
May he rest in peace.

01:26:18.104 --> 01:26:21.406
Father.

01:26:21.439 --> 01:26:23.375
Husband.

01:26:23.408 --> 01:26:24.710
Murderer.

01:26:24.744 --> 01:26:27.947
- Stay out of this.
- How about I jump. huh?

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:28.915
Right off this balcony
and save you all that trouble.

01:26:28.948 --> 01:26:31.717
Don't be ridiculous.

01:26:31.751 --> 01:26:32.919
Come on.

01:26:32.952 --> 01:26:35.520
Would make your day.

01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:38.825
Don't pretend like you care
for my well-being.

01:26:40.525 --> 01:26:44.563
All you care for is your money.

01:26:44.596 --> 01:26:47.566
It's your money.
money. money. money. money.

01:26:47.599 --> 01:26:48.466
- Your money.
- Enough!

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.870
No!

01:26:50.903 --> 01:26:53.605
You murderer. you're a murderer!

01:26:53.639 --> 01:26:55.107
Get off!
Liar!

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.380
Get off me!

01:27:02.414 --> 01:27:04.016
No!

01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:06.018
Hey. call an ambulance.

01:27:06.052 --> 01:27:07.552
- No. Meyer!
- It's my wife.

01:27:07.586 --> 01:27:09.088
- No. Meyer.
- She's hysterical.

01:27:09.121 --> 01:27:10.455
No!

01:27:10.488 --> 01:27:13.592
Meyer!

01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:15.761
Just get a doctor here now!

01:28:02.041 --> 01:28:03.743
Well. God damn.

01:28:06.178 --> 01:28:08.681
Meyer. oy.

01:28:09.815 --> 01:28:10.582
Look at this place.

01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:12.550
Nice. hmm.

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:15.688
Are you kidding me?

01:28:15.721 --> 01:28:17.589
You're the king
of the goddamn domain.

01:28:17.622 --> 01:28:20.059
I'll tell you something. too.

01:28:20.092 --> 01:28:22.728
It'll be little different
down here.

01:28:22.762 --> 01:28:23.528
How's your flight?

01:28:23.561 --> 01:28:26.999
Ah. forget about that.

01:28:27.033 --> 01:28:29.769
Real question is. what do
we got lined up for tonight?

01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:31.938
Hmm.

01:28:31.971 --> 01:28:33.839
Oh. boy.

01:28:38.144 --> 01:28:39.679
Things have changed. Ben.

01:28:39.712 --> 01:28:42.882
Look around you.

01:28:42.915 --> 01:28:47.086
There's too much money at stake
to be fucking around.

01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:48.553
We're not kids anymore.

01:28:48.586 --> 01:28:49.689
Yeah.

01:28:51.824 --> 01:28:53.192
You're right.

01:28:53.225 --> 01:28:54.961
I can't keep defending you.

01:28:57.163 --> 01:28:59.198
Especially if you don't show
any results.

01:28:59.231 --> 01:29:00.700
Is that what you doin'?

01:29:01.968 --> 01:29:03.135
You're defending me?

01:29:03.169 --> 01:29:03.936
Meyer I used to know.

01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:05.705
he would've stood up
for his pal.

01:29:13.713 --> 01:29:18.184
You know. there was never
an option for me.

01:29:19.952 --> 01:29:22.955
Wasn't gonna be a tailor's son.
make 8 bucks a week?

01:29:25.925 --> 01:29:27.159
But you could have
done anything.

01:29:29.962 --> 01:29:32.131
And I looked up to you
my whole life for that.

01:29:39.038 --> 01:29:41.007
And following you.

01:29:46.278 --> 01:29:48.580
I don't know. Meyer.

01:29:48.613 --> 01:29:50.182
I don't know
if it was worth my soul.

01:29:54.086 --> 01:29:56.088
'Cause I don't know
how to get that back.

01:30:15.775 --> 01:30:22.248
I'm aware that I was called here
today to bear witness

01:30:22.281 --> 01:30:29.789
to your decision
to kill my friend. Ben Siegel.

01:30:29.822 --> 01:30:32.324
And he saved my life
on more than one occasion.

01:30:35.161 --> 01:30:40.966
I cannot sit here and watch you
condemn him to death.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.903
But he's been robbin' from us.
Meyer.

01:30:43.936 --> 01:30:47.773
I'm aware of
Benny's shortcomings.

01:30:47.807 --> 01:30:55.147
I'm also aware that many of us
would not be sitting here today

01:30:55.181 --> 01:30:58.150
if it weren't for Benny's
past loyalty

01:30:58.184 --> 01:31:02.088
and his willingness
to stick out his neck.

01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:08.227
If it's about money.

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:10.930
I've agreed to make amends
for his past mistakes.

01:31:12.998 --> 01:31:19.004
If it's about honor.
I ask you

01:31:19.038 --> 01:31:22.975
where is the honor in killing
a friend?

01:31:32.885 --> 01:31:35.054
Why don't you step outside.
Meyer?

01:31:57.009 --> 01:32:00.346
In the matter of Bugsy Siegel...

01:32:00.379 --> 01:32:02.114
Ay.

01:32:02.148 --> 01:32:03.716
Ay.

01:32:03.749 --> 01:32:04.683
Ay.

01:32:04.717 --> 01:32:06.085
Ay.

01:32:06.118 --> 01:32:07.353
Ay.

01:32:07.386 --> 01:32:08.320
Ay.

01:32:12.391 --> 01:32:13.726
Ay.

01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:59.338
Hello.

01:32:59.371 --> 01:33:01.307
<i>Daddy.</i>

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.241
Eva?

01:33:02.274 --> 01:33:04.910
<i>Yes.</i>

01:33:04.944 --> 01:33:07.279
Eva. what are you...
what are you doing up?

01:33:07.313 --> 01:33:08.981
What time is it?

01:33:09.014 --> 01:33:11.917
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

01:33:11.951 --> 01:33:13.152
"I couldn't sleep."

01:33:13.185 --> 01:33:14.987
Honey. you gotta get to sleep.

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.455
Got school tomorrow.

01:33:16.488 --> 01:33:20.192
<i>But tomorrow is Saturday.</i>

01:33:20.226 --> 01:33:22.528
Okay.

01:33:22.561 --> 01:33:24.430
Where's your mama?

01:33:24.463 --> 01:33:27.499
<i>She went out.</i>

01:33:27.533 --> 01:33:29.535
She went out. out where?

01:33:29.568 --> 01:33:31.337
<i>With some man.</i>

01:33:35.541 --> 01:33:37.076
You know. these things.

01:33:38.577 --> 01:33:41.747
It's... that's what's
gonna happen. you know.

01:33:45.384 --> 01:33:49.255
<i>Daddy.
do you still love mommy?</i>

01:33:52.057 --> 01:33:54.159
Honey. I love you.

01:33:56.996 --> 01:33:58.998
I love you.

01:34:00.432 --> 01:34:03.235
Mrs. Lansky.

01:34:03.269 --> 01:34:04.903
Who is it?

01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:08.274
It's Frank Rivers.
ma'am. we spoke on the phone.

01:34:08.307 --> 01:34:10.242
Oh. yes.

01:34:10.276 --> 01:34:12.144
I remember.

01:34:12.177 --> 01:34:13.812
Sit down.

01:34:13.846 --> 01:34:15.180
Thank you.

01:34:20.252 --> 01:34:22.554
You know. there's no way in hell
you're going to find

01:34:22.588 --> 01:34:25.090
that bastard's money.

01:34:25.124 --> 01:34:26.292
Why is that?

01:34:27.926 --> 01:34:31.196
My ex-husband. Meyer.

01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:34.500
he never let a dime
out of his sight.

01:34:39.238 --> 01:34:43.075
If I were you.
I would look to Cuba.

01:34:43.108 --> 01:34:47.046
That is where Meyer made
his first real money.

01:34:47.079 --> 01:34:49.848
I thought he lost everything
when Castro took over.

01:34:49.882 --> 01:34:52.451
You think he would
give all that money

01:34:52.484 --> 01:34:54.153
to a communist.

01:34:55.487 --> 01:34:59.391
Uh. that Batista.
he trusted no one. only Meyer.

01:35:01.927 --> 01:35:03.996
He gave Meyer
what Meyer wanted.

01:35:05.931 --> 01:35:08.033
And what was that?

01:35:08.067 --> 01:35:11.437
To turn that country
into the Monte Carlo

01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:13.038
of the Caribbean.

01:35:16.608 --> 01:35:20.312
If only it had lasted.

01:35:20.346 --> 01:35:21.947
Pfft.

01:35:27.019 --> 01:35:29.154
Here's one of his diets.

01:35:29.188 --> 01:35:31.523
Matiz Sardine. Jello.
and Irish stew.

01:35:31.557 --> 01:35:33.492
- Blegh.
- Ugh.

01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:37.496
Hey. there's a Lansky associate
in Geneva.

01:35:37.529 --> 01:35:39.298
That might be our guy.

01:35:39.331 --> 01:35:42.101
Let's get Stone to run it
by Lansky.

01:35:42.134 --> 01:35:44.970
I got it. of course.

01:35:45.003 --> 01:35:48.507
Hey David.
I got a message for you.

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.275
From Mr. Lansky.

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.098
What... what do you want?

01:36:13.132 --> 01:36:15.267
I'm beginning to think
you're not taking me seriously.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.301
Hey. he's not even here.

01:36:16.335 --> 01:36:17.670
I've got nothing.

01:36:17.704 --> 01:36:18.638
Man. I think we're done.

01:36:18.671 --> 01:36:19.938
I think the book is done.

01:36:19.972 --> 01:36:20.906
- I think...
- Listen to me.

01:36:20.939 --> 01:36:22.541
We're looking for an associate
of Lansky's.

01:36:22.574 --> 01:36:25.277
He goes by the name "Pinkus".

01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:26.713
He's 81. alright?

01:36:26.746 --> 01:36:28.947
He's mind's not that sharp.

01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:31.016
I think that some of the stuff
he's been saying is...

01:36:31.049 --> 01:36:32.317
it's a little incoherent.

01:36:32.351 --> 01:36:34.721
Trust me.
he'll remember this name.

01:36:34.754 --> 01:36:38.190
Find out who he is. okay?

01:36:38.223 --> 01:36:39.558
You've got a pen.
I'll write it down.

01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:42.662
Pink-ass.
that you could remember.

01:36:51.671 --> 01:36:53.038
<i>Hello. David.</i>

01:36:53.071 --> 01:36:54.506
<i>Come in. come in.</i>

01:36:56.442 --> 01:36:58.977
<i>I didn't feel like
going out today.</i>

01:36:59.011 --> 01:37:00.212
<i>You want coffee?</i>

01:37:00.245 --> 01:37:01.280
<i>No. thanks. I'm fine.</i>

01:37:06.051 --> 01:37:07.386
Is that your father?

01:37:15.394 --> 01:37:17.463
When Israel turned me down.

01:37:17.496 --> 01:37:19.565
all I could think about was
how embarrassed

01:37:19.598 --> 01:37:21.033
he would have been.

01:37:22.802 --> 01:37:25.604
I was always ashamed of him.

01:37:25.638 --> 01:37:28.273
In my mind. he was weak.

01:37:28.307 --> 01:37:30.476
Busting his balls
earning pennies.

01:37:32.177 --> 01:37:35.682
He felt the same about me.
shame

01:37:35.715 --> 01:37:38.183
for having a gangster
for a son.

01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:48.126
I didn't go to his funeral.
my own father.

01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:53.098
I don't have the power
to change my past.

01:37:53.131 --> 01:37:56.201
I do have the power to change
the perception of it.

01:37:57.704 --> 01:38:00.773
Do as I ask
and you will be rewarded.

01:38:03.242 --> 01:38:05.344
You would do what I ask.

01:38:05.377 --> 01:38:06.545
<i>Let's sit on the porch.</i>

01:38:06.578 --> 01:38:07.079
Turn it back now.

01:38:07.112 --> 01:38:08.180
Switch over to two.

01:38:14.687 --> 01:38:16.054
What's going on?

01:38:16.088 --> 01:38:18.590
We lost. he knows
we're listening to him.

01:38:18.624 --> 01:38:19.759
Goddammit.

01:38:24.363 --> 01:38:26.565
There's a name that came up
in my research.

01:38:26.598 --> 01:38:28.066
someone named "Pinkus".

01:38:31.804 --> 01:38:33.372
Huh?

01:38:33.405 --> 01:38:35.274
Someone named "Pinkus".

01:38:38.443 --> 01:38:42.614
You mean Sal Rosenstein.
tough son of a bitch.

01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:45.852
his entire family died
at Takhel.

01:38:45.885 --> 01:38:48.554
After the war.
he moved to Switzerland.

01:38:48.587 --> 01:38:51.189
did some banking for me.

01:38:51.223 --> 01:38:53.525
Pinkus was my nickname for him.

01:38:58.597 --> 01:39:02.702
Wanted Pinkus' identity.
get a pen.

01:39:02.735 --> 01:39:04.837
Saul Rosenstein.

01:39:06.706 --> 01:39:08.273
Yeah. yeah.

01:39:08.307 --> 01:39:09.474
Put the money
in my wife's account

01:39:09.508 --> 01:39:10.810
and make sure they're safe.

01:39:10.843 --> 01:39:12.511
And let my family alone.

01:39:23.856 --> 01:39:25.858
We found him.

01:39:25.892 --> 01:39:27.760
Who. Rosenstein?

01:39:27.794 --> 01:39:29.796
Yeah. he was in Geneva.

01:39:29.829 --> 01:39:30.730
Where is he now?

01:39:30.763 --> 01:39:32.297
He died 48 hours ago.

01:39:49.749 --> 01:39:51.918
Yeah. what the...

01:39:51.951 --> 01:39:54.319
<i>It's Rivers. Saul
Rosenstein was killed in a car accident</i>

01:39:54.353 --> 01:39:56.789
- <i>48 hours ago.</i>
- Say again.

01:39:56.823 --> 01:39:58.557
<i>I'm saying
that Lansky had him killed.</i>

01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:00.292
<i>This is not a coincidence.</i>

01:40:00.325 --> 01:40:02.361
<i>I would advise you
to stop talking to Lansky.</i>

01:40:15.775 --> 01:40:17.576
Mr. Rivers.
as soon as you called.

01:40:17.609 --> 01:40:20.212
we started running a query
into our database.

01:40:20.245 --> 01:40:22.314
It appears Mr. Rosenstein
moved his money

01:40:22.347 --> 01:40:24.751
primarily to one place. Israel.

01:40:24.784 --> 01:40:27.185
Rosenstein was Mossad.

01:40:27.219 --> 01:40:29.254
<i>We've got a paper trail
of laundered money</i>

01:40:29.287 --> 01:40:32.659
going in and out of Geneva
into Israel to a bank

01:40:32.692 --> 01:40:34.292
called "Mekif".

01:40:34.326 --> 01:40:35.928
And you think that money
was Lansky's?

01:40:35.962 --> 01:40:38.196
I think it's why Lansky wanted
to get into Israel.

01:40:38.230 --> 01:40:39.398
His money's there.

01:40:45.303 --> 01:40:48.273
Mr. Rivers.
welcome to Israel.

01:40:48.306 --> 01:40:50.208
We've been expecting you.

01:40:50.242 --> 01:40:52.277
I will be taking you down
to the vault.

01:40:56.949 --> 01:40:59.284
Here it is.

01:40:59.317 --> 01:41:00.687
Thank you.

01:41:18.303 --> 01:41:19.571
Son of a bitch.

01:41:19.604 --> 01:41:21.273
And God said to Abraham.

01:41:21.306 --> 01:41:26.244
"Abraham. take your son.
your only son whom you love.

01:41:26.278 --> 01:41:29.716
Isaac. and sacrifice him
upon one of the mountains

01:41:29.749 --> 01:41:31.550
that I will tell you."

01:41:31.583 --> 01:41:35.922
And Abraham went forth
with Isaac to do just that.

01:41:35.955 --> 01:41:39.324
But perhaps what God
really wanted was for Abraham

01:41:39.357 --> 01:41:42.427
to say. no.

01:41:42.461 --> 01:41:46.264
We praise God now for those
who have departed this world

01:41:46.298 --> 01:41:49.802
as we stand for the Kaddish.
let us all stand.

01:42:08.821 --> 01:42:10.757
Mr. Lansky. Mr. Lansky.

01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:12.959
David.

01:42:12.992 --> 01:42:14.359
Prayer for the dead. right?

01:42:14.392 --> 01:42:15.061
Kaddish.

01:42:15.094 --> 01:42:16.561
Is that for your father?

01:42:16.595 --> 01:42:18.831
Or was it for Saul Rosenstein?

01:42:18.865 --> 01:42:23.770
Remember Saul Rosenstein.
your friend Pinkus is dead

01:42:23.803 --> 01:42:24.971
and he died in a car accident.

01:42:26.438 --> 01:42:27.740
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:28.941
Three days ago.

01:42:32.511 --> 01:42:34.747
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with it?

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:36.381
I just think
it's a bit coincidental.

01:42:36.414 --> 01:42:37.616
we were just talking about him

01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:41.353
and then something terrible
happens to him.

01:42:42.989 --> 01:42:44.991
Maybe he's dead

01:42:45.024 --> 01:42:47.693
or maybe they just think
he's dead.

01:42:47.727 --> 01:42:49.361
Just tell me the truth.

01:42:49.394 --> 01:42:51.697
You mean like the truth that
you're speaking to the Feds?

01:42:54.767 --> 01:42:57.335
You betrayed me. David.
you broke my heart.

01:42:57.369 --> 01:42:59.672
you made a deal with me
and you broke your word.

01:42:59.705 --> 01:43:01.040
Yeah. I did talk to them.

01:43:01.073 --> 01:43:03.542
I did. yeah.

01:43:03.575 --> 01:43:06.378
You know why I did it?

01:43:06.411 --> 01:43:08.014
You call it "self-preservation".
I think.

01:43:08.047 --> 01:43:10.950
Right. I had to do
what I had to do for my family.

01:43:10.983 --> 01:43:12.317
Stand by.

01:43:14.153 --> 01:43:15.855
I forgive you. David.

01:43:17.556 --> 01:43:19.959
If you wanna hear
the rest of the story...

01:43:19.992 --> 01:43:22.061
Why'd you forgive me?

01:43:22.094 --> 01:43:23.696
'Cause I like you.

01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:28.067
You liked Sal Rosenstein. too.

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.367
Not really.

01:43:34.006 --> 01:43:37.542
And now you come to
Israel. for what reason?

01:43:37.576 --> 01:43:39.745
You want to become
an Israeli citizen. Mr. Lansky?

01:43:39.779 --> 01:43:42.114
I do.

01:43:42.148 --> 01:43:47.053
My association with Israel
stands many years back.

01:43:47.086 --> 01:43:49.155
I was born a Jew.

01:43:49.188 --> 01:43:52.024
I have all my life
lived as a Jew.

01:43:52.058 --> 01:43:55.127
I never changed my faith.

01:43:55.161 --> 01:43:57.596
My grandparents are buried here.

01:43:57.629 --> 01:44:00.700
<i>Why are the
American authorities after you?</i>

01:44:00.733 --> 01:44:03.970
<i>They claim I have
50% of Lebanon casinos.</i>

01:44:04.003 --> 01:44:05.938
<i>50% of Monte Carlo.</i>

01:44:05.972 --> 01:44:10.408
<i>Mr. Lansky.
is there such a thing as organized crime?</i>

01:44:10.442 --> 01:44:12.945
<i>I have no knowledge
on the subject</i>

01:44:12.979 --> 01:44:15.614
<i>and I'd like to live
the remainder of my days</i>

01:44:15.648 --> 01:44:16.949
<i>in Israel.</i>

01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:29.862
I got a tip from a friend.
Golda Meir's lobbying Nixon

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:32.899
to supply Israel
with F-4 fighter bombers.

01:44:32.932 --> 01:44:34.566
What's that got to do with me?

01:44:34.599 --> 01:44:37.036
The prime minister was told that
in order for that deal

01:44:37.069 --> 01:44:38.204
to go through.

01:44:38.237 --> 01:44:40.640
she'd have to see to that
you leave Israel

01:44:40.673 --> 01:44:42.474
and return to the U.S.

01:44:42.507 --> 01:44:45.711
State Department
is revoking your passport.

01:44:45.745 --> 01:44:47.880
You need to surrender
at the embassy.

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:52.184
The Law of Return says
every Jew has the right

01:44:52.218 --> 01:44:56.088
to citizenship in Israel.

01:44:56.122 --> 01:44:58.456
There's nothing I can do.

01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:59.624
I'm sorry.

01:44:59.659 --> 01:45:02.594
After everything I did
for this country.

01:45:02.627 --> 01:45:06.132
after all I gave them
when they begged me for money.

01:45:06.165 --> 01:45:07.199
for weapons.

01:45:07.233 --> 01:45:08.734
Doesn't she remember?

01:45:08.768 --> 01:45:12.038
This is how they repay me.
making me the only Jew

01:45:12.071 --> 01:45:15.141
in history to be banned
from his country.

01:45:15.174 --> 01:45:16.541
How dare she?

01:45:16.574 --> 01:45:18.144
How dare she?

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:22.748
They've already arranged
for your return to the U.S.

01:45:22.782 --> 01:45:24.150
They're charging you
with contempt of court...

01:45:24.183 --> 01:45:25.483
Oh my God.

01:45:25.517 --> 01:45:27.053
And conspiracy related
to your ownership

01:45:27.086 --> 01:45:28.788
at the Flamingo Hotel.

01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:30.256
I won't go back there.

01:45:30.289 --> 01:45:33.092
I want you to help me
find a place.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:35.194
a country that will take me.

01:45:35.227 --> 01:45:36.162
I have money.

01:45:36.195 --> 01:45:38.097
Name the price.

01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:40.066
I don't want your money. Meyer.

01:45:40.099 --> 01:45:42.068
I believe your people
have betrayed you.

01:45:45.071 --> 01:45:46.604
I'll say.

01:45:54.246 --> 01:45:57.016
And after all that. they were
never able to indict you.

01:45:58.250 --> 01:46:01.654
The charges against me.
contempt of court.

01:46:01.687 --> 01:46:04.690
conspiracy. they were dropped.

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:11.030
You can go back to Israel.

01:46:13.265 --> 01:46:17.169
The wandering Jew.
just like Lucky said.

01:46:24.609 --> 01:46:27.146
Have we arrived at the end
of my story?

01:46:39.058 --> 01:46:40.726
What about the money?

01:46:49.268 --> 01:46:50.568
Hmm.

01:46:52.004 --> 01:46:54.572
Come for a ride.

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:37.917
Buddy.

01:48:29.034 --> 01:48:30.769
Gangster?

01:48:34.773 --> 01:48:39.879
I'm an angel
with a dirty face.

01:48:49.488 --> 01:48:53.025
I think we're finished. David.

01:48:53.058 --> 01:48:54.693
Go home.

01:48:57.730 --> 01:48:59.365
To your family.

01:49:01.333 --> 01:49:03.435
Remember me.

01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:56.255
When all is said
and done. how do we measure ourselves?

01:49:58.791 --> 01:50:01.026
If Lansky taught me anything.
it's that

01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.461
there's only one measure
in this world

01:50:02.494 --> 01:50:04.063
that truly matters.

01:50:06.265 --> 01:50:07.800
We measure ourselves
through the eyes

01:50:07.833 --> 01:50:09.835
of the ones we love.

01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:22.314
Somewhere
on the stretch of highway

01:50:22.348 --> 01:50:25.384
between Miami and home.
it all made sense.

01:50:25.417 --> 01:50:28.487
Lansky spent his life
trying to control the game.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:31.190
but in the end.
he knew there was one game

01:50:31.223 --> 01:50:35.094
that no one gets to control.
life itself.

01:50:35.127 --> 01:50:37.396
And you can try
to beat the odds.

01:50:37.429 --> 01:50:40.366
But the house always wins.

01:50:40.399 --> 01:50:41.867
Maybe all you need
every now and then

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:43.502
is a winning streak.

01:50:50.476 --> 01:50:52.111
You wanted to see me?

01:50:52.144 --> 01:50:53.479
Yeah. come on in. Frank.

01:51:00.085 --> 01:51:02.254
We're shutting
the investigation down.

01:51:02.288 --> 01:51:04.123
Wait. what?

01:51:04.156 --> 01:51:05.124
Why?

01:51:05.157 --> 01:51:06.492
It's over. Frank.

01:51:10.429 --> 01:51:11.463
Who's killing it?

01:51:11.497 --> 01:51:13.299
The CIA?

01:51:21.073 --> 01:51:23.976
Before your time. sonny boy.

01:53:07.773 --> 01:53:12.773
