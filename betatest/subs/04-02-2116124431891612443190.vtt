00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.389
(dramatic organ music)

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.163
- Clip it right here. nurse.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.910
Good.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.050
Syringe.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.780
- Shouldn't we wait?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.063
- I said. syringe.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.723
- She may be right Doctor.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.580
- Ladies. this is not a debate.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.370
Someone hand me a damn syringe.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.140
- I just don't see the rush.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140
He's just a baby.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.563
This could kill him.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.320
- I just don't see the rush.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.770
He's just a baby.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.490
This could kill him.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.560
Ladies. do you have any
idea what we're doing here?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.003
We are making history.

00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:01.680
- History?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170
- Yes.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.520
Consider this. a growth hormone

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.500
that cannot be detected by any drug test.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.603
This child is the chosen one.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.880
He is destined to be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.860
the single greatest athlete

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.173
this country has ever created.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.083
I mean. seen.

00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:28.120
- It seems like quite a price to pay

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.970
to become a professional athlete.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.280
- He's not just any athlete.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.970
He's the biggest. strongest. and fastest.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.143
the most durable of all time.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.150
Think about A-Rod.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.260
Paul Marrow and Brawn.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.050
What if the drugs they had taken

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.050
could not have been detected.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.863
Good God. (laughing)

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.360
This child and all the others we make.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.650
will grow up to be the
highest paid athletes

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.380
in the entire world.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.690
And within a few decades.
they will be defying

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.953
every major sporting event there is.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.930
- That's impossible.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.983
- Nothing's impossible.
William Shatner had a career.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.120
- I feel faint.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.000
- Relax. this will be over soon.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.093
And you will become a believer.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.143
- Easy Doctor. you're giving him too much.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.253
- I have an idea.

00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:36.517
Why don't you shut your
pie hole and stabilize him.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.563
He's growing too fast.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.113
He's really big.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.260
They grow up so fast.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.911
- Oh my God. what should
we do. what's happening?

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.964
(gasping)

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:53.583
- It can't be.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.948
Baby Frankenstein!

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:59.726
- [Doctor] My God. what have I done?

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:02.279
- You've injected him with
enough growth hormones

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.204
to create a dinosaur.

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.187
- Oh God. what is happening?

00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:07.954
What should we do?

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:08.787
- Run!

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.590
- Calm down.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.603
You will stop.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:18.993
Calm down.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.980
You must do as you're told.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.400
You do as I say.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.053
I am your creator.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.817
I'm also your father.

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:36.632
(soothing choral music)

00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:37.465
- Papa?

00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:41.032
Papa.

00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:41.865
Papa.

00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.083
Papa.

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:45.000
Papa. papa!

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.752
Papa?

00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:07.059
Mama?

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.726
- Baby Frankenstein!

00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:12.514
- Get back. get back!

00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:13.347
- Mama.

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:40.149
This is where you're supposed to scream

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.210
and I cover my ears in pain.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.740
- I know Brad. I'm trying.
but nothing's coming out.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.390
- Cut. cut. cut.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.360
The hell is going on?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.260
- I don't know. ask your scream queen.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.210
- What do you mean?

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.600
- She won't scream.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.980
- Oh no. creative choice?

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.080
You don't have creative
choice. not in this contract.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.480
I'm paying you to scream.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.090
- It's not that I won't scream.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.923
It's that I can't scream.

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.050
There's something hurt in my throat.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.470
Can I see the set medic?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.750
- Set medic?

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.210
On this budget. I don't
even have a set nurse.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.050
You want a producer?

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.000
I got about eight of those.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.103
- I'll go for a smoke.

00:05:22.564 --> 00:05:26.481
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:28.964
- Mick?

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:36.086
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:37.580
- What do you think. Doctor?

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.300
- It's not the throat.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.540
but definitely the vocal chords.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.010
- What causes that?

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.207
- You don't scream your
brains out for 50 films

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:47.100
and not expect something to give.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.520
- How bad is it?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.263
- I've seen worse. singers mostly.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.790
She needs to limit her
conversations for a few weeks.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.623
- Weeks?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.560
- What about her screaming?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.270
- Absolutely not.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.020
- But Doc. she's the scream queen.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.160
- For a few weeks. she's just
Angie Newborn. regular gal.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.450
- But the picture. it's
not gonna wait that long.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.400
- If you don't rest those vocal chords.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.460
you will cause permanent damage.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.500
You may not be able to
speak. much less scream.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.070
- I'll talk to Griff.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.410
I mean. you already screamed

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.070
like 20 times on Baby Frankenstein.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.960
I'll get Griff to.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.950
you know. let you go through the motions.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.560
and then we'll see about maybe dubbing in

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.500
one of those screams that
we recorded earlier. okay?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.110
What if she doesn't use
her vocal cords at all?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.513
- No talking at all?

00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:39.150
- Shh. you might want to start right now.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.930
- She can try gargling with this.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.050
And take these steroids that
I'm prescribing for her.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.050
I can estimate a full recovery
in maybe less than a month.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.410
- [Mick] You see. it won't be so bad.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.110
- This might help too.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.100
I hear nothing but good things

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.740
from my patients that seek some
good old fashioned R and R.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.360
- That sounds great.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.110
Angie. look. I don't think
you got much of a choice.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.113
The picture wraps in a few
days. you can leave then.

00:08:11.332 --> 00:08:14.999
(text message notification)

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.460
What do you mean. you're
not leaving without me?

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.000
I can't get away.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.823
I mean who's gonna watch the office?

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:28.220
Hey. will you stop with the text thing?

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.220
- [Doctor] Get used to the pad. darling.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.003
- Yeah. I know you're my only client.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.070
I guess I could do my work
by phone and internet.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.540
- No phone service and no internet.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.260
- What. how does the place run?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
- They have a short wave radio.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.180
They contact the coast.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.590
There are no cell towers near the island.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.290
- I guess I'll go.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.246
But you're footing the bill.

00:08:59.246 --> 00:09:00.079
- What else is new?

00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:01.180
- You know what?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.820
I could probably use the time
to finish writing my script.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.840
It's called Scream Test.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.240
I'm gonna produce and direct it.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.720
If you're good in the next few weeks.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.543
I'm gonna let you star in it.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.750
Ha ha ha.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.633
I can direct more than
traffic. thank you very much.

00:09:22.497 --> 00:09:25.747
(uptempo island music)

00:09:33.145 --> 00:09:34.248
(belching)

00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:36.635
I think I'm gonna be sick.

00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:40.218
- Come on Mick. didn't
you pack your balls?

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.807
- Hey. I wouldn't be putting
your hand in the water.

00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:26.890
We got alligators. coral snakes.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.223
we got snapping turtles.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.303
there to hurt you.

00:10:30.303 --> 00:10:32.083
- We're gonna need a bigger boat.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.460
How much farther?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.580
- When I'm not doing the tours.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.070
I take this island trip every Friday.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.670
Don't worry. we're almost there.

00:11:00.678 --> 00:11:02.340
- Before your eyes pop out of your head.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.600
can I get you anything else. Mister Phil?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.663
I got beds to make.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.603
- Can't get over it.

00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:09.843
you make the beds. you
serve the meals. bartend.

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.002
Doesn't Otis do anything
to help around here?

00:11:13.002 --> 00:11:13.870
- Otis. he helps out.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.620
but he's more of a handyman
than anything else.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.540
Plus his people skills
aren't as good as mine.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.580
He does make sure everything
is up and running.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.730
- So just the two of you work this place?

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.640
- You've seen Marla.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.170
She helps out with the paperwork.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.610
- I hope they pay you well.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.893
- Beats the alternative.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.460
- Phil. you old dog.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.220
I knew I'd find you out here.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.310
- You certainly do have
my routine down Carter.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.350
twice daily. 10 and four.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.540
- How about a game of chess?

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.060
- In a few minutes.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.550
My mind is just not
quite into it right now.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.050
- Well. whenever you're ready.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.607
- I got a week's worth of mail.

00:11:55.607 --> 00:11:58.300
and I brought the supplies
the Doctor wanted.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.980
and I left them with Otis.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.780
- And more important.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.530
I see that you brought
our two newest guests.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.740
It is a pleasure to
meet you. Miss Newborn.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.853
I am a big fan.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.560
So I'm Marla. Marla Covington.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.360
I'm the island nurse
and also the therapist.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.233
- You got anything for nausea?

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.820
- Yes. I believe we do.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.320
I'll bring it to your room
after we get you all checked in.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.360
- Aw. thank you so much.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.303
We're both looking so
forward to our stay here.

00:12:26.303 --> 00:12:27.730
Aren't we. Angie?

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.440
- [Marla] Dan. would you be a sweetheart

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.680
and show Miss Newborn and
Mister Thompson to their rooms?

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.513
- Sure thing.

00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:34.720
- You are such a dear.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.470
If you could take their
luggage to rooms four and five.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.700
- You're not gonna
forget about this stuff.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.540
- [Marla] No. sir.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.760
It's just in the back.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.408
If you head towards your rooms.
so I'll be right behind you.

00:12:47.408 --> 00:12:48.507
- Thank you.

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:49.523
Thank you so much.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.603
Thank you.

00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:54.463
- Are you still taking a week off?

00:12:55.586 --> 00:12:56.423
- Been thinking about it.

00:12:58.275 --> 00:13:00.130
- You want me to throw some
of your stuff into the boat?

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.180
- I don't know. I'm such a
big fan of Angie Newborn.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.410
- The lady?

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.650
- If I stay. I could get a few pictures.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.700
and if she autographs them.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.890
they become super valuable when she dies.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.613
- Well now. that sounds
like a creepy thought.

00:13:16.346 --> 00:13:18.220
All right. I'd better go
give them their luggage.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.670
- Wait. let me get the
pills for Mister Thompson.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.503
- Oh. thank you.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.403
- Here's your pills.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.783
- You are a lifesaver.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.080
Hey. want to bring Miss
Newborn's bags in here?

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.140
I'll make sure that she gets them.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.623
- No. Marla gave me her keys.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.837
See ya.
- See ya later baby.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.453
- My word.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.080
You look just like that movie
star. doesn't she. Phil?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.060
- Nah. don't recognize her.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.700
- Thanks. I needed that.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.430
- I didn't realize you were gonna be here.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.543
Matter of fact. I got all your films.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.480
- Angie Newborn.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.263
- Why don't you come over
here and have a seat?

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.540
Okay.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.380
It's fine. it's fine.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.070
I'm just toying with him.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.620
Matter of fact. two more moves.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.813
And he's done.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.653
Oh. I stand corrected.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.393
Checkmate.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.040
- I am so glad I came here to relax.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.846
- So. what exactly?

00:14:46.846 --> 00:14:48.650
- Save your voice. sweetheart.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.513
Detective Phil here is a detective

00:14:51.513 --> 00:14:53.370
from the Miami Police Department.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.710
- My Doctor recommended this place

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.790
because it's out of the
way and nobody cares.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.510
You don't care. do you Carter?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.670
Besides. your story's
much more interesting.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.820
Why don't you talk about yourself?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.970
- There's not much to tell about me.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.733
I like it here. and I'm rich.

00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:11.120
- Us?

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.120
- Well. now that you're here.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.150
there's four patients and four
workers. including the Doc.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.807
- And my manager Mick is here. too.

00:15:17.807 --> 00:15:20.240
- [Carter] And what
does he recovering from?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.073
- Poverty.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.910
- Thanks.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.630
So. are you still planning
to take a few days off?

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.690
- I was thinking about it.
but with Angie Newborn here.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.230
I thought I could stay and
get to know her a little bit.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.900
I haven't seen my family
in almost three months.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.370
It'd be the perfect time to visit.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.420
- Well. whatever you
decide. just let me know.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.580
I'm happy to cover for you.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.413
- Thanks Doc.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.143
(crickets chirping)

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.740
- Oh Mister Thompson.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.799
so nice to see you got your color back.

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:05.790
- Oh yes. thank you so much to you.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.685
- Did Dan bring everything to your rooms?

00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:09.360
- Absolutely.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.180
- Have you seen him recently?

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.830
- Dan? He said he was leaving.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.400
- Shit. already?

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.782
I gotta run. I gotta get to the boat.

00:16:17.782 --> 00:16:18.770
- You're not staying?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.620
- He has my keys.

00:16:23.346 --> 00:16:26.013
(ominous music)

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.300
- You've outdone yourself again. Millie.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.550
- Thank you. Mister Phil.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.330
- Should I set your place. Doctor?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.500
- No. thank you Millie.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.750
I'm actually looking for Marla.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.680
Has anyone seen her?

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.160
- Yeah. I saw a couple hours ago.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.860
She was running to catch the boat.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.880
- I guess that means
family was more important

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.350
than spending time with you. Miss Newborn.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.970
- What do you mean by that?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.260
- Marla told me she was torn between

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.460
going home for a week

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.920
or staying and hanging with Miss Newborn.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.810
- Is there a problem?

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.280
- No. no. not at all.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.010
Miss Newborn. perhaps
you could sign a copy

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.350
of one of your films for her.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.960
We have quite a few in the library.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.100
and Marla's hung some of
your posters in my room.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.933
- DVDs?

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.530
- VHS. but the box is easier to write on.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.363
- Oh yeah.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.460
Hey listen. I brought a
couple of DVDs with me.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.370
They're back in my room.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:15.633
I'll get Angie to sign one for you.

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:17.850
and you can give it to
Marla when she gets back.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.030
- That would be wonderful.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.580
She'll be so excited.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.123
Well. it's been a long day.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.140
Until the morning then.

00:17:28.143 --> 00:17:29.473
- Is there anything I can get you?

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.313
Yeah. me too.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.233
Okay.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.357
I'll see you in the morning.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.763
(soft jazz music)

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.823
- Otis. what are you doing over there?

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.700
- I'm just keeping an eye on Millie. Doc.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.940
Like you told me to.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.890
- Uh huh.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.030
- She don't mind.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.430
- She doesn't. huh?

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.150
- We have an arrangement.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.770
She lets me watch if I
do a few of her chores.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.573
- Oh. she does. does she?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.220
Is that all she lets you do?

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.053
- Yes sir.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.123
- Well.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.040
don't stay out too late.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.413
- Almost done here. Doc.

00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:46.040
(knocking on door)

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.873
- Come on in.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.240
Good morning. Miss Newborn.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.740
Why don't you please sit down?

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.223
So everything okay so far?

00:20:05.128 --> 00:20:07.513
Oh. this is for you.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.393
Good. I'm glad to see you have your own.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.990
Have you been using it?

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.480
Your Doctor and I agree
that the best medicine

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.003
is to rest your voice while you're here.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.650
I cannot stress enough how important it is

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.170
to rest those vocal chords

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.423
so that we can see if there's any change.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.763
Oh yes. thank you so much.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.243
This'll mean a lot to her.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.740
Yes. starting immediately.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.250
Everyone knows why you're here.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.170
and there's very few
people on this island.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.200
So. let's say you're ordering
something off the menu.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.150
Just point at what you want.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.843
Let's see how long you can
go without saying a word.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.970
Yes. remember to gargle with the solution

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.773
and take your steroids.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.613
Very good.

00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:12.810
We'll meet here again in a few days.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:13.870
In the meantime.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.220
let me know if we can do
anything else for you.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.253
- Otis?

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:26.155
- What is it. Millie?

00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:27.005
- There's no gas.

00:21:27.928 --> 00:21:29.270
- It's a gas grill.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.030
Probably the pilot light.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.127
- Smells pretty strong for a pilot light.

00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:34.800
You don't smell it?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.633
- Up here.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.020
Did you turn everything off?

00:21:40.415 --> 00:21:41.710
Then just let it air out.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.505
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:44.338
- But I've got to start cooking.

00:21:44.338 --> 00:21:45.740
- And I have to finish cleaning the pool.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.153
- Well. I can't cook if
the stove don't work.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.433
- Here.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.980
- Matches?

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.210
You sure it's safe?

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.793
- It might pop a bit.
but yeah. it'll be fine.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.290
- How hard is it to do?

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.280
- Millie. It's a pilot light.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.110
It's not brain surgery. all right?

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.010
Just strike the little match.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.610
and then stick it in the
hole that says pilot light.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.310
- Fine.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.260
Thanks for nothing.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.340
- So Hilda. are you rehabbing or training?

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.173
- Training.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.130
- Can I ask you a personal question?

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.570
- Third Olympics. medal in 2012.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.000
injured my shoulder in 2016.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.903
and figured I'd give it one more try.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.380
In France. I am treated like a movie star.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.833
When I stop swimming
they'll forget who I am.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.810
I am proud of my body.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.393
- And rightfully so. my dear.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.332
If I had your body I'd be proud of it too.

00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:48.445
(explosion)

00:22:48.445 --> 00:22:49.359
What the hell was that?

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:50.733
- It sounded like it came from the pool.

00:22:52.635 --> 00:22:56.135
(tense orchestral music)

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.033
- I'm gonna be sick.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.463
- I'll go get the doctor.

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:09.929
- Get off of it.

00:23:16.073 --> 00:23:17.663
- What the hell happened?

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.510
- Hey. is Doc in the office?

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.390
Doc. it's Millie.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.520
- What about Millie?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.710
- There's been an accident. come quick.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.940
- What happened?

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.135
- An explosion. come quick.

00:23:31.135 --> 00:23:33.635
- Whoa. I'm right behind you.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.583
What happened?

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.210
- It was some sort of explosion.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.470
When we arrived. her body was on fire.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.963
- She was smoldering when we got here.

00:23:56.096 --> 00:23:57.446
- I told her to be careful.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.450
- What do you mean?

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.283
- She was complaining
about the smell earlier.

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:06.495
I thought it was the pilot light.

00:24:06.495 --> 00:24:07.950
- This is more than a pilot light.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.690
- I told her to let it air out.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.810
- Well. why didn't you take care of it?

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.073
- This isn't my fault.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.670
Listen. I was up on the
deck. cleaning the pool.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.250
Now what. you wanted me
to take care of this?

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.713
Then you'd be out a handy
man instead of a cook.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.290
- Who do you call to
take care of the body?

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.640
- I'll notify the mainland
on the short wave.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.890
but we're cut off until
Dan gets back on Friday.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:30.900
- You telling me there's no way

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.517
to get Millie's body off the island?

00:24:32.517 --> 00:24:34.200
- Not until Friday.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.480
- What if she was hurt?

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.955
What if she needed medical attention?

00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:40.470
- We never set up a contingency plan

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.700
for something like this.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.190
- Why the hell not?

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.540
- Detective. in my 15 years here.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.544
this is the first major incident.

00:24:49.544 --> 00:24:50.794
- Wow. Nothing?

00:24:51.855 --> 00:24:53.143
Impressive.

00:24:53.143 --> 00:24:54.960
- Everything up until now
has been bumps and bruises.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.520
and we can handle those in house.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.680
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.490
- You mean there's no place
to put the body until Friday?

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.820
- Yes.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.793
Yes. of course.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.013
We have an infirmary.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.670
- [Phil] Help me with the body.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.290
- I was told you like vodka.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.779
So here's a bottle. and I
brought you some mixers.

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:25.117
You want anything else.

00:25:25.117 --> 00:25:27.070
you can find it behind the bar.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.370
- What. so you expect for
us to serve ourselves?

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.000
- The bartender is dead.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.770
You don't want it. I'll take it back.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:35.670
- [Phil] Leave it.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.020
- Some ice would be nice.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.283
- It's in the kitchen.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.683
- You're right. so much
for rest and relaxation.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.273
- Hey. this reminds me of
that scene in Death House.

00:25:55.878 --> 00:25:57.910
You were in that.
weren't you Miss Newborn?

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.180
- Yeah. don't you remember?

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.630
That's the one where somebody
rigs the oven to blow up.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.450
You played the deranged housekeeper

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.150
who sought revenge on
the owners of the house.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.313
because centuries ago. it
used to belong to your family.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.700
1995. that's the first time
we worked together. right?

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.693
You know. seems like only yesterday.

00:26:21.652 --> 00:26:22.690
(knocking on door)

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.523
- Come in.

00:26:26.034 --> 00:26:27.500
- I'm sorry for the intrusion. Doc.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.000
- Oh. no intrusion at all. Detective.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.930
What's on your mind?

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:31.763
- Well.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.590
I didn't know you were such a horror fan.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.100
- Oh no. no. not horror.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.990
Miss Newborn's horror.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.650
Apparently she has a
way with sex and blood.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.440
Marla's words. and her posters.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.810
- So these are all Angie's films?

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.643
- Yes.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.440
- Listen. I just wanted to apologize

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.970
for raising my voice.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.530
- There's no need to apologize. Detective.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.630
I understand your frustration.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.150
This resort has always been
known in a positive way

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.360
for being cut off from
the rest of the world.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.970
If anything. Millie's
death has opened my eyes

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.570
to the problems that happen
out there in the real world.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.973
- Yeah. but I was caught up in the moment.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.663
Lost my temper.

00:27:17.663 --> 00:27:18.850
- No worries.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.300
If you like. we can talk about it now

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.710
or wait till your session.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.150
- I think I'm okay.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.593
- No one could have anticipated
an the accident like this.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.390
- That's why they're called accidents.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.680
- Right.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.690
- See you at my session.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:36.530
- See you then.

00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:45.471
(sinister music)

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.500
- I wish you would stop staring at me.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.190
- You shouldn't undress in public.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.693
Oh. you'll regret that.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.420
(uptempo island music)

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.693
- Well. good afternoon.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.713
How's the voice?

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.143
- Hey. how you doing?

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.400
Sure. I can use a spotter.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.900
Carter got bored and decided
to ride the unicycle.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.193
Oh. you want to lift?

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:57.880
I don't think you could handle that.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.134
Let's try that.

00:28:59.134 --> 00:29:00.134
Let's go over there.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.590
How long you've been lifting?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.533
- Since she saw you walk into the gym.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.053
- Let me see what you can do with that.

00:29:19.847 --> 00:29:22.660
Put your shoulders all the
way back. that's right.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.857
- She's not half bad. Detective.

00:29:29.857 --> 00:29:31.673
- No. she is not.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.983
Her technique's pretty good too.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.800
Your shoulders might be
a little sore tomorrow.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.433
- Where have you been?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.360
- She's been working out with us. why?

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.870
- Well. I was gonna go for a swim.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.620
I could use some company.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.680
- That's a good idea.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.584
- All right. All right.

00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:54.501
All right.

00:30:31.434 --> 00:30:32.310
- You know. I never realized

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.093
how much Millie did around here.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.890
- You kept her pretty busy.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.723
- I miss her.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.360
Not only because she
took care of everything.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.953
but she was such a sweet person.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.267
- Must be four o'clock on the dot. huh?

00:30:59.807 --> 00:31:01.693
She's just like clockwork.

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:05.240
(water splashing)
(screaming)

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.073
- What the hell?

00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:11.073
(electric buzzing)

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.293
- [Mick] Doc. stay away from the water.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.323
- Got it.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.973
- Get her out.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.353
- She's gone.

00:31:44.077 --> 00:31:46.180
- What the hell was that for?

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.013
I didn't do anything.

00:31:47.013 --> 00:31:48.897
- [Phil] You put live cables in the pool?

00:31:50.454 --> 00:31:51.287
- I didn't do that.

00:31:51.287 --> 00:31:52.960
Why would I do that?

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.020
- She slapped you. just this morning.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.367
I heard you threaten her.

00:31:56.367 --> 00:31:59.840
Was this your way of getting even?

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.713
- Getting even.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:02.573
by killing her?

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.480
- Maybe you didn't think
the shock would kill her.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.681
- Maybe you thought you
could just scare her.

00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:09.514
- Yeah.

00:32:09.514 --> 00:32:12.210
Well maybe somebody else did it.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.360
- Oh. this is horrible.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.100
- Yeah. we stuck here until Friday.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.440
- And there's six of us left.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.353
- Your point?

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.750
- My point is. multiple
accidents don't just happen.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:29.413
- Yeah. I'm not a fond
believer in coincidence either.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.843
- Otis. help me get
her into the infirmary.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.400
- Now why would I go kill her.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.900
and make more work for myself?

00:32:46.286 --> 00:32:47.660
- It's gotta be him.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.083
Who else has access to extension cords?

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.280
- You know this kind of reminds me

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.233
of that scene and Family Possessions.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.377
- What do you mean?

00:32:58.377 --> 00:33:00.333
You think there's a connection?

00:33:01.421 --> 00:33:02.254
- I don't know.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.640
Two accidents. Millie and Hilda.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.490
Both murdered the same
way as an Angie's films.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.770
- [Phil] So you think these
may not all be accidents.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.190
- Oh great.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.810
So now we got a killer on
the loose. at a resort?

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.260
We are paying a thousand dollars a day?

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.900
- [Phil] Well. if Carter's
right. we've got six suspects.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.970
- This resort's been around

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.013
for 15 years without one accident.

00:33:26.998 --> 00:33:28.350
Why would it start happening now?

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.033
- It's gotta be one of us.

00:33:31.955 --> 00:33:33.255
- Well. I know two things.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.310
I'm not the killer.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.133
and Angie's films are tied in.

00:33:43.924 --> 00:33:46.841
(knocking on door)

00:33:52.055 --> 00:33:53.055
- Who is it?

00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:06.161
They didn't ask. and I didn't tell 'em.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.610
Besides. I only surrender
my weapon when I fly.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.317
Relax. they're not for you.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.483
I can't. not right now.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.350
I got to go talk to the
Doc about something.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.120
I want you to stay here until I get back.

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:45.681
I won't be long.

00:34:52.134 --> 00:34:55.801
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.587
(knocking on door)

00:35:07.633 --> 00:35:08.990
- What?

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.890
- What are you doing here?

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.940
Will you stop with this?

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.583
Are you gonna fuck the detective?

00:35:20.851 --> 00:35:22.260
- Yes.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.510
- What if he's the killer?

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.770
- Stop. please.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:27.780
- Why?

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.953
'Cause he's a cop?

00:35:30.143 --> 00:35:30.976
- Yeah.

00:35:31.983 --> 00:35:33.983
- You are unbelievable.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.740
- Detective. is everything all right?

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.230
- No. everything's not all right.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.600
I've got two dead people
and I need answers.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.160
and you seem awfully
obsessed with Angie's movies.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.830
- I told you. these are Marla's posters.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.490
A few posters doesn't
make anyone obsessed.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:56.063
And besides. isn't fan short for fanatic?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.690
- What about Family Possessions?

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.780
- [Doc] It's one of her
best. I've been told.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.290
- Yeah. well Carter told me
that in Family Possessions

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.793
a young lady gets electrocuted in a pool.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.890
You find that funny?

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.960
- No. what I find funny

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.680
is your knowledge of
Miss Newborn's movies.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.890
In Family Possessions.
Miss Newborn's character

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.830
fills the swimming pool
with electric eels.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:20.960
- Electric eels?

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.940
- Yes. and when the young girl

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.820
who's the main competition
for the affections

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.470
of a handsome young man.
jumps into the pool.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.900
the eels shock her to death.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.733
Quite a bit different

00:36:34.733 --> 00:36:37.550
than having an electric
cable fall in the pool.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.383
don't you think?

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.770
- What about the explosion?

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:54.603
- What about it?

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.600
- Didn't it copy a killing
in this film. Death House?

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.803
- Look detective. if you're
trying to find a tie-in.

00:37:02.803 --> 00:37:05.040
then I suppose you can find a similarity

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.710
in the depths from any
of Miss Newborn's movies.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.150
but it doesn't make me a killer
because I've watched them.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.283
I mean. what would be my motive?

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.520
- Crazy people don't need a motive.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.970
- That's what you think. I'm crazy?

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.480
- I don't know what to think.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.400
But it's either you or Otis.
and Otis is too obvious.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.940
- Otis has been at this
resort for seven years.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.980
He's got his problems. but he's no killer.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.090
- Problems?

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.470
- I caught him peeking into
windows on a few occasions.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.810
- He's a peeping tom?

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.440
- Mostly Marla and Millie's room.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.070
- Mostly. what about Hilda?

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.000
- Are you kidding?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.900
She paraded around the pool half naked

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.430
every day for almost a month.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.463
- Sounds like I got to go talk to Otis.

00:37:45.793 --> 00:37:47.010
Where can I find him?

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.520
- It's dark.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.370
You might catch him outside.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.720
His MO. as you would call it.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.470
is to fix something near the windows.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.320
- Angie's the only female
left on this island.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.770
She might be the next target.

00:38:01.871 --> 00:38:04.704
(soft jazz music)

00:38:13.721 --> 00:38:15.150
(knocking on door)

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.630
- What did you forget. Detective?

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.620
I'm doing a booming business tonight.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.613
So what can I-

00:38:24.288 --> 00:38:26.650
(yelling)

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.403
- Working hard. or hardly working?

00:38:29.313 --> 00:38:30.660
- Don't you come any closer.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.388
- Never bring a knife to a gunfight. Otis.

00:38:33.388 --> 00:38:34.730
What's the matter?

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.100
You don't like type that fights back.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.030
- What do you want?

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.010
- I want to know what you're doing here.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.830
- I'm working.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:41.663
- Please.

00:38:43.611 --> 00:38:44.444
Hands out.

00:38:44.444 --> 00:38:45.277
- You can't do that.

00:38:45.277 --> 00:38:46.110
- Do what?

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.080
- Arrest me.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.913
- What makes you think I'm arresting you?

00:38:47.913 --> 00:38:49.530
- I've been arrested before.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.650
Besides. handcuffs are a dead giveaway.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:53.773
- You know the drill.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.113
Put them on.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.110
Thanks for letting me
know you got a rap sheet.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:01.310
What'd they get you for?

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.670
- Trespassing. mostly.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.630
drunk and disorderly a couple of times.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.070
but I know my rights.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.900
- Your rights don't
include killing people.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.740
- I didn't kill anybody.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.903
- Today. or ever?

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.750
Is that a tough question?

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.710
- Yeah. I've killed.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:22.543
Too many.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.070
- Service. huh?

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:25.903
Ours?

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.620
- Yes. ours.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.080
Three tours in Afghanistan.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.913
- Here it is.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.820
Army Ranger. huh?

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.850
Surprised I was able to sneak up on you.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.493
- I'm a Ranger. not an Indian.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.070
Besides. I'm trying to
put all that behind me.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.410
Now what are you gonna do with me?

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.243
- I don't know.

00:39:53.185 --> 00:39:55.060
Where'd you get the blood?

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.400
- I punched the wall.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.560
- Why would you do that?

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.420
- Because I miss Millie.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.160
She was my friend.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.090
- You always sneak a peek at your friends?

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:06.620
- It wasn't like that with Millie.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.510
She liked to show off. I like to watch.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.730
- Please. you're telling
me that she knew about it?

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.563
- Yeah.

00:40:13.563 --> 00:40:14.890
- Okay. I call bullshit.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.940
- Why would I kill her. or that
other girl for that matter?

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.870
- Maybe because you're a sicko.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.090
- All right. look.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.113
I admit I've had some
challenges since I got out.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.050
But between the Doc and the VA hospital.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.850
I'm getting the help I need.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:31.040
Did you ever serve?

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.743
- 15 years. Miami Dade Police force.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.553
- They say I got PTSD.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:39.180
- I know the feeling.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.340
- You get that on the police force.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.423
- So they tell me.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.103
Tell you what.

00:40:47.976 --> 00:40:49.226
how about we make a deal?

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.250
You stop working. call it a night.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.300
and I'll do the same.

00:40:56.502 --> 00:40:58.552
But if there's one more accident tonight.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.450
I'm coming right for you.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.283
You understand?

00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:05.220
You know they say that you can learn a lot

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.020
from looking through a man's wallet?

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.210
Those your folks?

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.043
- Yeah.

00:41:11.043 --> 00:41:11.876
- Still around?

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:13.873
- No.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.913
- Sorry.

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.544
(muffled talking)

00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:26.070
(gasping)

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.640
Relax.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.876
- What's with the gun?

00:41:29.876 --> 00:41:31.590
- I'm a detective.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.243
- You gave me a heart attack.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.080
I thought you were with Angie.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.943
- Oh Angie. I left her in my room.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:41.100
Where you going?

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.183
- I was going to the kitchen for a snack.

00:41:44.171 --> 00:41:45.900
- [Phil] Have you seen Carter?

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.460
- No. not for a few hours.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.560
- Well be careful.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.760
Something not right around here.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.613
and I can't put my finger on it.

00:42:16.686 --> 00:42:19.519
Well. that was thoughtful of you.

00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:40.207
I hope the wine helped your throat.

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:53.532
Goodnight. my scream queen.

00:42:57.523 --> 00:42:59.700
Do you want me to take you to your room?

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.075
- No.

00:43:01.075 --> 00:43:02.492
It's safer here.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.920
- For Christ's sake Mick.
can't you eat in the dark?

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.700
- Jesus Carter. I didn't
know you were even in here.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.023
- That was the idea.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.920
- I don't like eating in the dark.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.893
- Me neither. but I figured it was safer.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.690
- Yeah well. together we
should be safe. right?

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.913
- Yeah. if one of us is not the killer.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.870
- Are you the killer?

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:12.983
- No. are you?

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.680
- Nope.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.257
- Good. that's a relief. let's eat.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.393
- Hey Doc.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.560
Doc. do you want anything
before I turn in?

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.383
Guess not.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.010
- So. you don't believe
these were accidents?

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:43.396
- Mick my man. accidents
don't happen. they are caused.

00:44:43.396 --> 00:44:45.840
Now if somebody caused it or something.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.170
I'm guessing that's what the
detective's gonna find out.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.873
- Yeah. but we could help by
narrowing it down. can't we?

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.483
- The use of the deduction.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:57.710
Yeah. I guess we could.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:02.320
- Okay. so if it's not
you and it's not me.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.320
then that leaves Phil. no.
Otis. the Doc. Phil and Angie.

00:45:10.348 --> 00:45:11.523
It can't be Angie.

00:45:12.822 --> 00:45:13.655
- And why not?

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.030
- No motive. for one.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.670
- Let me break it down to you like this.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:22.420
What better way for her
to revitalize her career.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.610
than kill a bunch of
people at a health spa.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.973
in the same way as in one of her movies.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.990
- Come on. you can't be serious.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.450
- Oh I'm very serious.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.530
I mean. can't you just see the headlines.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.390
I mean it practically writes itself.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.450
- Yeah. but she don't need
to revitalize her career.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.070
she's doing just fine.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.800
(coughing)
- If you say so.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.633
- But.

00:45:46.697 --> 00:45:47.530
- But?

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.980
Things didn't start happening

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.610
until you and Miss Newborn arrived.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.800
- What. what you're saying
it's either me or Angie?

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.750
- [Carter] Not unless
there's somebody else

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.540
on this island that we haven't met.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.280
- Well. what. what about Otis. or the Doc?

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.550
- Nah. I don't see Doc as
being the murdering type.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.720
but Otis. he is a creepy
kind of character.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.690
You know. he kinda reminds me

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.190
of Lenny from Of Mice and Men.

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.443
- Yeah.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.393
My money's on Otis.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.870
- So. you don't think
it's me. you. or Phil.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.553
- Wait.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.463
- Wait. what's the matter?

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:30.120
- Years ago. Angie was up for
a flick called Maniac Cop.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.093
- Oh God.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.210
man you people and these titles.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.433
- No. no. seriously.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.127
It was about this crazy cop

00:46:38.127 --> 00:46:39.740
who would go around killing people.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.410
just to create more work for himself.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.520
His gimmick was he'd frame others

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.930
for the crimes he'd commit.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.853
and then he'd take credit for the arrest.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.400
- So now you think Phil is the murderer?

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.363
- I'm saying it's not impossible.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.210
- All right. this is
an interesting theory.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.650
but I've seen the man play chess.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.350
and he's not much of a strategist.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.297
- What if it's all in our minds
and there isn't any killer?

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.363
- Dead bodies. no killer.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.280
Right.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.140
- No. really.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.920
I mean. these could all
really be accidents.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.720
- I told you how I felt about that.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.950
The mind is an incredible thing.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.330
I guess it's easier to call
them a series of accidents

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:38.120
than assume that one of
us is a serial killer.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.990
- Serial killer?

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.880
Now you're scaring me.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.290
Hey. keep those thoughts to yourself.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.488
- I'm just thinking out loud.

00:47:46.488 --> 00:47:47.343
- All right well.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.970
I'll see you in the morning.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.803
- Appreciate it.

00:47:57.038 --> 00:48:00.705
(bright instrumental music)

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.963
- Good morning. sleeping beauty.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.833
Some coffee.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.053
- Thank you.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.200
- Yes. you're still fully dressed.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.670
I am not one to take advantage.

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:18.713
You were pretty wined out
when I got back last night.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.910
Carter found some donuts in the kitchen.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.997
if you want to head down.

00:48:26.307 --> 00:48:27.913
So you got any plans for today?

00:48:29.538 --> 00:48:31.651
- I want to hang out with you.

00:48:31.651 --> 00:48:33.250
- Well. I'd like to hang out with you.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:34.200
How about this?

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.460
Head down to the kitchen.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.253
put some food together.
have a nice picnic outside.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.290
That'd be nice.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:44.720
Unless. you don't have a film where

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.020
someone accidentally
dies on a picnic. do you?

00:48:52.795 --> 00:48:55.120
- You want some more?

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:55.970
- Morning fellas.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.490
- I'm good.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:01.653
- Coffee. Detective?

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.940
- It's okay. Detective.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.140
Me and Mick already
drank from the same pot.

00:49:07.137 --> 00:49:08.823
- All right. hit me.

00:49:10.228 --> 00:49:11.410
Thought you didn't serve.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:15.538
- Yeah well. help is getting
a little short around here.

00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:16.638
and Doc's not even up.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.853
I thought I'd pitch in.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:22.380
- You guys want anything cooked though.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.310
you're on your own.

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:26.300
- Hasn't there been enough
cooking around here?

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.260
- Hopefully the cold
cuts. cereal and pastries

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.227
will keep us until Friday.

00:49:31.227 --> 00:49:32.060
Yum. yum.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.360
Where do you think you're going?

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.170
- We are going to a picnic.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:41.183
- Are you kidding me. with
everything that's going on?

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:43.780
- Well unless someone
chokes on a sandwich.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.340
I don't see an accident happening.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.920
- I got two words for you.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.353
Mama Cass.

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:51.903
(soft music)

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.483
- Beautiful.

00:50:06.164 --> 00:50:07.497
You. this place.

00:50:10.665 --> 00:50:12.116
I mean this would be the perfect getaway

00:50:12.116 --> 00:50:14.066
of it wasn't for all those dead people.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.100
Why am I here?

00:50:23.965 --> 00:50:25.813
I knew that question was gonna come up.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.810
I killed someone in the line of duty.

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:36.290
Teenager. I thought he was
pulling a gun on me but he.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.760
in actuality he was
pulling out his cell phone.

00:50:40.154 --> 00:50:41.810
A cell phone.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.810
Internal affairs deemed it a good shoot.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.920
The department put me on paid leave.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.863
and here I am. trying to decide
if I still want to be a cop.

00:50:52.779 --> 00:50:53.983
And that's how I met you.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:57.423
Listen.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:03.873
I want you to take this.
for your protection.

00:51:06.867 --> 00:51:08.227
Of course. I'm here to protect you.

00:51:08.227 --> 00:51:09.363
But what if I'm not?

00:51:10.899 --> 00:51:11.732
You're gonna have to use this

00:51:11.732 --> 00:51:13.543
to protect yourself. understand?

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:17.320
You know how to shoot one of those?

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.720
Never point a real gun at anybody.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.960
unless you're ready to shoot it.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.760
Let me show you how to properly use that.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.160
This is not a prop. this
has real bullets. okay.

00:51:32.524 --> 00:51:34.774
(gasping)

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.553
It's Marla.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:41.040
Go to Doc. quickly.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.583
Tell him we've got another body.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:52.613
- What's wrong?

00:51:53.758 --> 00:51:54.793
The Doc?

00:51:54.793 --> 00:51:55.869
I haven't seen him.

00:51:55.869 --> 00:51:56.923
He's not in his office.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.710
Let's go check his room.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:07.440
- Where are you two going in such a hurry?

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.850
- Looking for Doctor Patterson.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:10.333
- [Carter] Did you check his room?

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.940
- What? Marla's dead?

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.670
- I thought you said she left on the boat?

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.470
- [Mick] She was headed to the boat.

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.520
- Where did you find her?

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.040
- Near the pier.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.830
Someone was in a rush and
dumped her body in the bushes.

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.013
- The boat driver?

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.610
- Well. that would explain Marla's death.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.970
but what about the others?

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:30.477
I haven't seen Dan in days.

00:52:30.477 --> 00:52:33.840
But you. you know these
grounds better than anyone.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.170
- She did say she was going to
get a key card back from Dan.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:40.030
- Uh huh. you needed her key card.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.350
- I have my own key card.

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:44.930
and it opens a lot more
doors than Marla's.

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.723
- We've gotta go tell the Doc.

00:52:56.411 --> 00:52:57.700
- We sure he's even in here?

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.250
- I don't know. I haven't seen him today.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.793
and I haven't seen him since last night.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.040
- Doc. Doc Patterson?

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.152
You in there?

00:53:06.152 --> 00:53:07.290
- [Carter] Just kick it in. Detective.

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:10.063
- No no no. wait. use my keycard.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:24.613
- [Phil] Who might have done this?

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.307
- Phil. you think this was a suicide?

00:53:29.358 --> 00:53:30.191
- No.

00:53:32.134 --> 00:53:33.217
Where's Otis?

00:53:34.949 --> 00:53:36.697
- He was just here.

00:53:36.697 --> 00:53:39.017
- That bastard must be guilty.

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.350
- Let's get him down.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.750
Take my watch.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.197
I'm not back in 30 minutes.
leave the dining room.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:52.510
- I told you it was him.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:56.861
- I thought you had it narrowed
down between me and Angie.

00:53:56.861 --> 00:53:57.694
- Me?

00:53:57.694 --> 00:54:00.630
- Oh. look. I'm a fan.

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.180
but who would benefit more

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.850
from this happening this week?

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:06.103
- Nobody. if we're all dead.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.163
- Oh yeah.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:16.753
It does seem similar to Dead Act.

00:54:17.633 --> 00:54:19.100
- [Carter] Yeah. that's right.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.687
That's the one where the
hotel clerk hung hisself.

00:54:20.687 --> 00:54:25.493
'cause he found the body
of his wife. and daughter.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.473
- Come on man. let's get him down.

00:54:31.872 --> 00:54:34.372
(eerie music)

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.443
- Why'd you run. Otis?

00:54:51.462 --> 00:54:53.962
(tense music)

00:55:06.012 --> 00:55:07.311
- Well did you find him?

00:55:07.311 --> 00:55:08.411
- No.

00:55:08.411 --> 00:55:11.462
- Where could he possibly go?

00:55:11.462 --> 00:55:13.460
- Maybe we should split
up and look for him.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.170
- No. no. no. it's too dangerous.

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:18.180
He knows the island. he has the advantage.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.420
It's safer if we stay together.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.420
They can come to us.

00:55:39.987 --> 00:55:41.987
- Angie. it's your pick.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.823
- You think he's watching us?

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:51.303
- I don't know.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.443
Maybe.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.833
- Why would he run away after
we found the Doc's body?

00:56:00.097 --> 00:56:02.980
It's gotta mean that
he's the killer. right?

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.120
Made it look like a suicide.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.270
- Why don't you take
it easy on that stuff.

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.540
- Should I?

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.690
- I may need your help.

00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:13.404
- I can help.

00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:17.563
What kind of help would I possibly be?

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.833
- Maybe you can jump in
front of a bullet for me.

00:56:22.941 --> 00:56:26.023
- If he comes for me. I'd rather be drunk.

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:30.950
- What if he comes for Angie. huh?

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:32.730
She may need you to be sharp.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:33.563
- Me?

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.823
When she's got you. Detective?

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.113
She don't need me.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.903
You're her white knight.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:49.606
- Whatever. just lay
off the sauce. will you?

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:52.457
- Ooh. what you gonna
vote me off the island?

00:57:01.591 --> 00:57:05.008
(tense orchestral music)

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:36.910
- You two gonna be okay?

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:39.690
- Why. where you going?

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:41.820
- I thought I'd take a look around.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.320
see if there's a way we
can secure these doors.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.360
- I'm assuming locking
them would be useless

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.980
since we know he got keys.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.063
- Yeah. I was thinking
of something stronger.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.033
There's gotta be a place

00:57:53.033 --> 00:57:54.780
where they keep some chains and tools.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.580
- There's a shed where
he keeps the lawnmower.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.443
- I think I saw that when
I brought Marla's body up.

00:58:03.974 --> 00:58:05.237
- You want me to go with you?

00:58:10.035 --> 00:58:12.770
- No. I'm gonna need you to stay here.

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:13.933
keep an eye on things.

00:58:17.674 --> 00:58:18.507
I'll be back.

00:58:22.949 --> 00:58:26.616
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:55.383
Otis?

00:59:04.876 --> 00:59:07.043
(banging)

00:59:40.187 --> 00:59:41.386
- Is everything okay?

00:59:41.386 --> 00:59:43.439
- Everything's fine.

00:59:43.439 --> 00:59:44.770
- I was starting to get a little worried.

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:46.980
- I was able to secure
all the doors with chains.

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.610
So if he's gonna come after us.

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:50.550
he's gonna have to break through a window.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.400
- You're assuming that he's
not hiding in here somewhere.

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:57.260
You probably just locked
him in here with us.

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.420
- You know Carter.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.693
there's something I just
don't like about you.

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:03.260
- Yeah. I get that a lot.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.990
- I'm pretty sure I
know where he's hiding.

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.963
It's getting dark.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.370
I'd rather go after him in the morning.

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:12.090
- You ever thought maybe you
shouldn't go after him at all?

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.793
- I'd rest a lot easier
knowing he's in handcuffs.

01:00:25.152 --> 01:00:27.402
(groaning)

01:00:30.386 --> 01:00:32.570
- Oh. what'd I miss?

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:33.770
Did we catch the killer?

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.340
- We're locked in?

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.026
- Locked in?

01:00:37.026 --> 01:00:38.640
You're sure that he can't get to us?

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.099
You know that for sure?

01:00:40.099 --> 01:00:41.770
- I'm sure.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.680
The good guys always
out-think the bad guys.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.330
- Oh. that's only in the movies.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.750
- Hardly.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.850
- Can I go to my room?

01:00:53.201 --> 01:00:55.963
- No. I think we should
all stay in here tonight.

01:00:58.262 --> 01:01:02.797
Unless. there's something you
need to get from your room.

01:01:02.797 --> 01:01:04.293
I could walk you down there.

01:01:10.075 --> 01:01:11.720
- Where are they?

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.113
It's been almost an hour.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.333
Carter?

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:17.203
Carter?

01:01:17.203 --> 01:01:19.150
- Hey. is he here?

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.140
- Phil and Angie. they
haven't come back yet.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.900
It's been an hour.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.300
- Isn't she with the detective?

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.023
- Yeah. but she said she
only had to get a few things.

01:01:28.783 --> 01:01:31.180
- You don't get out much. do you Mick?

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.730
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:38.043
- He means sometimes it takes
a woman longer to get ready.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:39.850
right Carter?

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:41.600
- That's exactly what I meant.

01:02:02.873 --> 01:02:04.040
- I gotta go.

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:10.533
Yeah. I know where he is.

01:02:10.533 --> 01:02:11.913
He's in the tool shed.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.590
Of course I'm gonna be careful.

01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:31.524
I do think I found my mojo again.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.433
thanks to you.

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.466
Stay here.

01:02:42.466 --> 01:02:44.966
(gun cocking)

01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:50.625
(tense orchestral music)

01:02:58.161 --> 01:03:02.161
(high-tension orchestral music)

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.724
Really?

01:03:11.724 --> 01:03:13.474
You left me a shovel?

01:03:15.048 --> 01:03:17.298
(yelling)

01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:27.263
- I am trying really hard
not to kill you right now.

01:03:28.511 --> 01:03:30.928
I wish you'd appreciate that.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:43.064
Have you ever been shot by one of these?

01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:44.823
- I can't say I have.

01:03:44.823 --> 01:03:46.656
- It hurts like hell.

01:03:50.509 --> 01:03:51.533
I've already got your gun.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.910
Detective. I didn't do those things

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.967
that everybody thinks I did.

01:03:58.967 --> 01:03:59.860
- Then why are you running. Otis?

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:04.383
- Do you really think that
the Doc committed suicide?

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:05.216
- No.

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:06.480
- Neither do I.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.723
That's why I ran.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.790
Come on. I can see it in your face.

01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:13.040
I can see it in all their faces.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.173
They think I did that.

01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:18.620
- Well. the thought did cross our minds.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.400
- The other night you said.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.100
if someone else has an
accident there'd be a problem.

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.690
that's why I ran.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.550
- Where is this going. Otis?

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:30.017
- I ran because you already
said you were gonna blame me.

01:04:30.017 --> 01:04:32.430
- You told me that you have
the keys to everything here.

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:33.668
- Yeah.

01:04:33.668 --> 01:04:35.330
- Who could have took Marla's keys?

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:39.993
- The killer. or anybody that
found the body before you did.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:41.743
Maybe that's it.

01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:44.640
Yeah that's it. you're the killer.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.700
- That's stupid.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.419
- You're the killer. and now you're just

01:04:47.419 --> 01:04:49.220
trying to make me the patsy.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.880
- Patsy?

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.080
You've been watching
too many Bogart movies.

01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:56.395
What's your plan?

01:04:58.473 --> 01:05:00.707
- I was gonna tie you up.

01:05:00.707 --> 01:05:02.957
- Then what?
- I don't know.

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:07.870
You're not a very good detective. are you?

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.870
- So I've been told.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.173
- Checkmate.

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:42.673
- Bullshit.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.220
- I'm sorry. Mick.

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:47.113
I guess it's just my killer instinct.

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:58.953
I guess I was tired of playing. too.

01:06:03.306 --> 01:06:06.973
(sinister orchestral music)

01:06:18.367 --> 01:06:22.860
Hey. I thought I heard
something back there.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.960
- You think it's Phil?

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:27.137
- No. Phil would have yelled out.

01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:29.973
Maybe it's Otis.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.930
How are we gonna protect ourselves?

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.653
- Jesus. where the hell'd you get that?

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:43.486
- Phil.

01:06:43.486 --> 01:06:46.017
- [Carter] Do you know how to use it?

01:06:46.017 --> 01:06:49.080
- Here. take this. take this. take this.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:49.913
Give me that.

01:06:51.414 --> 01:06:53.130
- Do you know how to use it?

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.723
- Hey. I'm from New York.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.990
Maybe we should bunch up.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:02.923
Matter of fact. where's my weapon?

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.750
- Well. get another
knife from the kitchen.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.120
Go on really. I'll cover you from here.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:11.953
Go ahead.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.003
And you.

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.700
why don't you go back to your room.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.933
lock the door. and stay out of sight.

01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:27.483
I'll come get you when it's safe.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:37.652
(tense music)

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.530
Hurry up. Carter.

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:07.523
- Shut up Mick.

01:08:07.523 --> 01:08:09.110
I'm trying to find a
knife to protect myself.

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:10.393
not butter my bread.

01:08:19.203 --> 01:08:21.480
- Hurry up. Carter.

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.743
Carter. will you hurry up?

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.558
(yelling)

01:08:30.558 --> 01:08:31.975
- This is stupid.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.261
I'm coming.

01:08:44.145 --> 01:08:47.562
(tense orchestral music)

01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:27.223
Figured I drew the short straw.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:29.623
Hey Mick.

01:09:30.793 --> 01:09:32.250
if you ever thought
about using that thing.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.020
you should use it now.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:34.870
Let's shoot this mother.

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.014
- Oh. shut up.

01:09:36.014 --> 01:09:41.014
(nail gun firing)
(gun firing)

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:44.087
(gun firing)

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:50.063
Damn. this hurts.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.433
- Great work. Mick.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.120
You got him.

01:10:14.371 --> 01:10:16.221
Bastard shot me with a damn nail gun.

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:19.980
I got to get it out before I get infected.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.430
Oh man. help me up.

01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:23.410
- I'm sorry Carter.

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:25.350
but you were right.

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:26.830
- Right about what?

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:30.310
Oh yes. about Otis being the killer.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.320
- Don't be stupid. Carter.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.893
Why would Otis kill anyone?

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.659
- Yeah but you said that-

01:10:36.659 --> 01:10:38.077
- You were right.

01:10:38.077 --> 01:10:40.823
You said it was either me or Angie. right?

01:10:41.945 --> 01:10:44.420
But Carter. when they find your body

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.733
with a nail in your head.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.670
they're gonna think it was Otis. right?

01:10:50.228 --> 01:10:53.061
(nail gun firing)

01:10:54.607 --> 01:10:57.107
(tense music)

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.403
- Angie?

01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:24.387
- Angie?

01:11:24.387 --> 01:11:26.543
It's me. open up.

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:37.603
- Otis?

01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:42.130
- I tried to tell you it wasn't me.

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:42.963
- What happened?

01:11:42.963 --> 01:11:45.060
Who did this? Carter?

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.260
- No. it wasn't Carter.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.093
- Mick?

01:11:48.022 --> 01:11:51.907
- Yeah. he shot me. and
then he killed Carter.

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.647
I think he's after Angie. now.

01:11:55.647 --> 01:11:56.890
- Oh. Angie.

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:57.723
- Wait wait.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.633
- Sorry I doubted you. soldier.

01:12:14.249 --> 01:12:15.758
- Is everything all right?

01:12:15.758 --> 01:12:16.841
- Absolutely.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:20.363
As usual. I took care of it.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:27.643
While you were sitting
around. I killed them all.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.540
Well. I mean. all except your boyfriend.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.609
Otis. he took care of him.

01:12:33.609 --> 01:12:36.192
But me. I killed everyone else.

01:12:37.923 --> 01:12:38.756
- Why?

01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:44.870
- For the completion of
my script. of course.

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:46.880
It had to be me.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.293
I'm the killer.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.250
What's the matter?

01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:53.913
Angie. you're scared?

01:12:57.403 --> 01:13:00.087
It's the perfect plot for my script.

01:13:01.008 --> 01:13:03.230
Get this.

01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:05.913
It's about this washed up actress.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:07.983
like you.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.430
whose handsome and smart manager.

01:13:14.799 --> 01:13:15.632
like me.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.890
he murders this whole bunch of people.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:23.917
just to bring all her films
back into the public eye.

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.880
What do you think?

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.450
What are you looking so surprised?

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:35.420
I told you all about this.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.837
Don't you remember?

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.893
Scream Test.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.031
That's kind of catchy. don't you think?

01:13:44.031 --> 01:13:45.948
- I think you're crazy.

01:13:46.897 --> 01:13:47.897
- I'm crazy?

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:54.553
But I'm gonna dedicate my
film to you. my darling.

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.213
This. this film.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.810
this film it's dedicated

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:07.883
to my long-time client. my best friend.

01:14:10.277 --> 01:14:13.457
who was tragically killed
by a mass murderer.

01:14:17.977 --> 01:14:21.053
You see. in my script.

01:14:21.053 --> 01:14:22.353
I'm the only survivor.

01:14:25.803 --> 01:14:27.136
- You're insane.

01:14:28.574 --> 01:14:29.657
- I'm insane?

01:14:30.752 --> 01:14:32.169
No. I'm a genius.

01:14:36.786 --> 01:14:38.850
What an ending.

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:40.003
Can't you see that?

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:45.420
I kill you. of course.

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:51.900
I can always find myself
a new scream queen.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.683
I could start all over again.

01:14:55.487 --> 01:14:57.320
After all these years?

01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:03.018
All these years.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.943
you mean. all these years.

01:15:08.943 --> 01:15:13.943
when you kept reminding me
that I'm nothing without you.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.503
that you're my only client.

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:21.770
All the years. when you wouldn't give

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:23.727
my idea the time of day.

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:27.797
What was it you. you said. wait a minute.

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:30.543
Oh. oh.

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.373
I couldn't even direct traffic.

01:15:40.293 --> 01:15:41.210
- Please.

01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:44.720
- A person can only take so much.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.150
You never saw me for my creative mind.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.563
I can direct.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:54.963
and even produce.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.553
What are you so upset about?

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:08.403
This will definitely get you
into the Horror Hall of Fame.

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:12.053
posthumously. of course.

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:22.883
You know. it's a shame
that you can't scream.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.203
but I mean like who's
gonna hear you anyway?

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:31.763
Oh yes.

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:34.591
that's right. sweetheart.

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:35.920
You can do this.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.490
Loud. come on honey. as loud as you can.

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:39.893
Come on. come on.

01:16:40.969 --> 01:16:43.313
But who's gonna come and save you?

01:16:44.268 --> 01:16:47.094
(screaming)

01:16:47.094 --> 01:16:49.055
- It's over. Mick.

01:16:49.055 --> 01:16:51.638
(guns firing)

01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:06.994
- Phil. you're hurt.

01:17:06.994 --> 01:17:08.451
- I'm fine.

01:17:08.451 --> 01:17:10.030
Are you okay?

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:11.080
- [Mick] Scream Test.

01:17:14.557 --> 01:17:18.330
It's about this washed
up actress. like you.

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:21.500
- [Carter] What better way for
her to revitalize her career.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.760
than kill a bunch of people the same way

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.960
as in one of her movies.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.409
- [Mick] This will definitely get you into

01:17:29.409 --> 01:17:31.492
the Horror Hall of Fame.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.050
- Everything's gonna be okay now.

01:17:39.936 --> 01:17:41.993
- I'm so sorry.

01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:44.823
I'm sorry darling.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.680
but it's not every day a star

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.790
can orchestrate her own comeback.

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:57.790
and perform the perfect
crime. all at the same time.

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:03.270
I believe Mick revitalized
my career. after all.

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:06.753
Look. it's based on a movie.

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.483
and I play myself.

01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:16.410
The script is left for me
by my deceased manager.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.603
who turned out to be a deranged killer.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.767
It's genius.

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.913
And it's about time you
came up with a good idea.

01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:35.963
Thanks. Phil.

01:18:37.775 --> 01:18:40.942
(big band jazz music)

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:55.620
- Angie baby. goosebumps.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:56.620
Goosebumps. really.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:57.940
Look at this.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.740
Such a great script.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:02.650
a great script for a great actress.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:04.410
- You really think so?

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:05.680
- I can hardly believe it.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.660
Three months after you went
through that incredible ordeal.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.533
and here we are telling your story.

01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:13.210
- It was great therapy for me.

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:15.280
And it's a sure hit for you.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.180
- Your public is gonna eat this up.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.870
- I'm sure they're chomping at the bit.

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:21.550
just waiting for me to
reach the top again.

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:23.850
- Dedicating the film to Mick.

01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:25.320
such a nice touch.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.920
- Oh yes.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.463
Mick. it's the least I could do.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.030
- Well. he did die saving your life.

01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:36.090
Oh. he did more than that.

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:37.973
He died saving my career.

01:19:38.814 --> 01:19:40.090
- (laughing) Good one.

01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:41.153
You ready to start?

01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:43.933
- I was born ready.

01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:47.910
- [Manager] All right
everybody. let's do this thing.

01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:49.720
Isaiah. lock it down.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.950
- [Isaiah] All right. quiet on the set.

01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:54.580
This is a take. roll cameras.

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:56.923
- [Woman] Scream Test.
scene one. take one.

01:19:59.741 --> 01:20:03.408
(dramatic orchestral music)
