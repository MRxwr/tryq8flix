00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.699
Rodney. bro.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:20.968
Bro. you're not gonna believe

paparazzi ask about me

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:23.838

Ain't nobody know about you or

Man. you're tripping.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.043
- Bro. I'm telling you
I know what I heard.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:30.478
And I heard the paparazzi say
it.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.812
- What about you and Jordan?

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:32.813
- I heard it.

00:03:32.847 --> 00:03:33.814
They forgot my PH water.

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:34.815
What's going on?

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:35.850

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.431
- Cancel the interview. cancel

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.333
I ain't in the mood for
Kamilah and her antics.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:53.367
You know she's still mad at me

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.336
for ghosting her way back in 05.

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:56.837
- You got caught with your pants
down.

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:58.239
Like literally.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.509
- Shit. Got damn.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.177
Your eggplant is everywhere.
bro.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.378
This worse than Kevin Hart.

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:06.013
- So we're making jokes
about my career now.

00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:07.248
- No man. just...

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.216
Let's just. just breathe daddy.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.217
Just breathe.

00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:11.218
- I can't even deny it.

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:12.386
- And that's just the business.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.188
It's just a business man.

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:15.856
- Who put the camera in the
room.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.891
- You're right.

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:17.858
- How did the camera get in
here?

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:19.726
- It's a mystery a foot

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.264
They were on some super
Ninja CIA spy type shit.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.032
I wonder what kind of camera
that was.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.600
- Rodney how you so nonchalant
about this?

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.703
Well. first of all. for
starters. it's not me.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:31.771
- Wow.

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:34.707
- Secondly. all press is good
press

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.775
that you know.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.378
- No. you must've forgot about
Thick.

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:39.880
His last album was bomb
and it's still flopped.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:41.382
- Oh. you got a point
'bout that.

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:42.883
Look. you got five minutes to
get ready

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:44.218
for this Kamilah Trill
interview.

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.252
Look. daddy. you be good man.

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:47.054
I'll see you out there.

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:49.622
(upbeat music and audience
noise)

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.993
- Today on the show we have

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:56.063
a multi-platinum selling
heartthrob of our generation.

00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:59.732
The amazing and now
controversial Will Clay.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.402
- Thank you for having me
Kamilah.

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.237
It was always dope coming down
here.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.405
checking you out at Epic.

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:06.073
How was your first ride?

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:07.441
- listen. you know

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.577
we have to put that into
perspective for the people.

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:13.080
You were my first major
interview as a journalist.

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:14.747
- Yeah I mean. what else could
I have been talking about?

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.283
- Well. let's cut to the chase.

00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:18.085
You're back with the new album.

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:21.422
What's next. is slated to
be your comeback project.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.756
But critics are all wondering
whether or not it will live

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.926
up to the success of
your previous releases.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.495
- I mean I know it's a lot going

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.430
on in the media as of this
morning

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:30.965
but I can take it.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:31.966
You know. when I think my fans
are going

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.200
to be thoroughly pleased

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:34.835
with what we got going
for them on the album.

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.138
- You sound very confident
about your new album.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:38.606
- Well I mean. my paps always
told me.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:40.040
even if you got to smile

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:42.775
through bad situations to
smile and get through them.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.311
- Speaking of difficult
situations.

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:45.479
You were recently caught

00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:47.948
on tape with the pop star.
Jordan Holmes.

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:50.783
How does your girlfriend
Kiaira K feel about that?

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.785
She can't be handling
that well.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.023
- Kamilah. we're right here.
we're going there already!

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.325
- I can't hold back with my
first. right?

00:05:58.359 --> 00:05:59.692
- Listen Kamilah.

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.297
- I love Kiaira always will.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.331
And that's that?

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:06.133
So my new single "Ain't Just
Sex".

00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:07.201
I'm actually performing it

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.136
for the first time tonight in
Philly.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.371
So you actually should come
through.

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.473
Everybody's invited to
come and check it out.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.308
- Will. are you deflecting?

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:15.643
- No.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.478
- Just talking about what
matters.

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.711
- Right. what's up baby

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.050
- Let's welcome Kiaira K
publicist

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.219
to the stars to the show.

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:27.154
So you are saying this happens.

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:29.023
- No. what we're saying is we
wanna focus

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:31.659
on the album. not the
negativity.

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.661
- Okay. so when was the first
time

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.862
that you cheated on Kiaira?

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:36.096
Was this recently?

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.166
- Kamilah. can we focus
on the album. please.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.001
- Why don't you just tell the
truth.

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:42.836
- Kamilah. it didn't happen.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.005
Okay he did not cheat on me.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.908
I know Will. that video
was old long before he

00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:49.410
and I even got together.

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:51.879
- Will. why don't you just
admit that you made a mistake?

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.080
We all know you're not perfect.

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.248
Even though you pretend to be.

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.183
- I asked you not to discuss
this.

00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:58.018
I have not cheated on Kiaira.

00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:00.020
Now please can we keep
back to the interview

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:02.690
before I turn into a meme on
this show.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.191
- And we'll be right back

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:06.393
after this commercial break
with the Kamilah Trill Show.

00:07:06.427 --> 00:07:07.394
- Kamilah. what the
hell is wrong with you?

00:07:07.428 --> 00:07:08.395
You set me up.

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:09.463
- Told you that nothing was

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.265
off the table. stop tryna people
please.

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:12.433
And just admit not just

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:15.735
to her and your fans. but to
yourself.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.037
- Look Kamilah.

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.706
We're trying to give you
an opportunity to fix

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.407
this like a professional

00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:22.576
or if you'd like for me
to step out of character

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.777
I can drag you across
a little gossip show.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.046
- Oh. excuse me.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.715
You're threatening me for
telling

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.749
the truth about Will's foolery.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.885
Everyone knows that Will has
been cheating

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.387
on you for years Kiaira

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.622
The whole industry knows.

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:36.457
- Come on she's lying
Ki. She one of the ones

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.891
- Cheating with who?

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.227
- This is business and ratings
are going to be ratings.

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:41.729
Whether or not you wanna pretend

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.731
that the whole world didn't see
him

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:44.898
and Jordan on tape.

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.067
Or let's not R Kelly this
situation.

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:48.569
Just tell the truth Will.

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:51.305
- Listen Kamilah. what I do and
don't do

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:53.407
don't got shit to do with you.
Aight.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.642
But please don't forget who I
am.

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.477
- You're delusional.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.745
You're everybody's business.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:58.746
You're a public figure.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.748
And you screwed up royally.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.150
- We are about to come from
commerical show. places
everybody.

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:05.819
- Either you talk or you leave
either way

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:08.088
I'm gonna be reporting
your news. Mr. Perfect.

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:09.290
- Okay cool.

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:11.759
Actually. Kamilah. I got a
story for you.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:12.760
Kiss my ass.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.128
- Ooh. word?

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:18.599
- And we're back from our
commercial break with Kiaira K.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:19.967
Girl let's talk.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.602
- Let's talk.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.204
(jazz piano )

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.778
- Hey Dad.

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.613
- Son how're you doing?

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.982
- I heard about what's going on.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.785
♪ Happy birthday to you

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.287
♪ Happy birthday to you

00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:45.326
♪ Happy birthday William
Clay Gregory the Third ♪

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:49.797
♪ Happy birthday to you

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.165
We love you. Will.

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.636
We saw your interview on the
TV and I thought you said

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:56.870
that Kamilah girl was your
friend.

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:59.640
She seemed a little rude if you
asked me.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.975
- Mom she was just doing he job.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:03.377
I mean honestly.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.012
Everybody wanted her to go
hard and then that on me.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.481
So I think I came out pretty
good.

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.049
- Anyway it's just uncomfortable

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:12.319
for us to see you go under so
much pressure on national TV.

00:09:12.353 --> 00:09:14.655
- Speaking of pressure Will.
How's Kiaira

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:16.223
you know. dealing with all this.

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.392
- You knew her handled the
business

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:19.993
and cleaning up the mess.

00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:21.762
- Alright.

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:25.199
Well. tell her. I asked for. I
got to go check on the mac and
cheese.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.368
- Hey Will. you still here?

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:28.837
- I'm still here Pops.

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.337
- Look here now I know you're
dealing

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:32.339
with something that I
can't even understand.

00:09:32.373 --> 00:09:35.509
Fame and life in the limelight.

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:37.745
You got everyone up in your
business.

00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:40.013
That could be overwhelming now

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:43.584
now just remember your
foundation
and put your trust in God.

00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:45.085
Thank you dad.

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:47.087
I needed to hear that right
about now.

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.022
- You always got a home here.
all right?

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:50.557
If you need to come back here

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:54.027
and you need a break and leave
that popstar bunnies alone.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:55.696
- Okay dad.

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:56.697
- And don't forget.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.867
Think about what I said.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.869
- Mommy loves you Will.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.236
- I love y'all too.

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:05.939
- I know y'all done heard what
happened

00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:07.374
what happened on Kamilah Trill
today?

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:10.210
Will Clay. ya boy dropped the
ball

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.579
on live television and Kamila
pressed him

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:16.083
about him cheating on his
fiance with Jordan Holmes.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.451
- Embarrassing.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.454
- Let tell you. we got all the
tea today.

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:24.391
- Totally. totally
unacceptable and embarrassing.

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:27.060
But what do you expect
from a guy like Will Clay?

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:28.462
- You just don't like him.

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:29.930
- No. it's not that I don't like
him.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.131
It's just that

00:10:31.165 --> 00:10:33.267
like I said. I judge
people by their actions.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.301
- Yes.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:35.904
- Okay. his action is showing
time

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:38.907
and time again that he's a piece
of shit.

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:40.107
That's it.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.109
He's a piece of shit
and I'm not surprised.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.610
Okay. you're surprised?

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:45.746
- I can give him a little bit
more credit

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.080
than you're giving him.

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:49.249
- I'm not surprised at all.

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:54.121
What I am surprised is that
Kiaira is coming to his defense.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.089
Like why is she coming to his
defense

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:57.191
when he cheated on her?

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.761
That's crazy to me.

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:02.763
- So black women. we do
have to stop doing this.

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:04.798
We have to stop putting
ourselves

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.633
as the sacrifice in front of
black men.

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.937
She should have just let him
and left his ass out there

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:11.104
and let him do whatever he
needed to do and catch that L.

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:14.107
- Apparently now I'm no moral
authority.

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.443
Okay. but I can call out.

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:20.113
Definitely. I can call out low
character.

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:23.450
When I see it now.
Kiaira needs to leave him

00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:24.785
instead of coming to his
defense.

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:25.786
- Black men. don't cheat.
that's what they say.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.955
Unfortunately this one did

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:27.988
'cause they got the footage to
prove it.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:28.823
baby I done seen that thang.

00:11:28.857 --> 00:11:30.290
And it's crazy.

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.159
But to be honest. this is
probably a publicity stunt.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.127
That Kiaira has set up in order

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.796
to help promote his new album.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.130
Cause that's what we're
all talking about him now.

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:38.465
- No. no. no.

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:39.834
It's not a publicity stunt.

00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:41.635
Okay. alright.

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:44.171
What do you expect from
Will the heartthrob

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:46.340
- I can give him more
credit than you give him.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.674
- No. trust me.

00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:50.344
He's not gonna be faithful
to anyone but himself.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.479
It's just. it is what it is.

00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:54.849
See things for what they
are it is what it is.

00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:56.383
- Look. I couldn't really
tell if it was him.

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:57.718
It was kind of like that. you
know?

00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:58.987
- It was him.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.154
- Okay. I guess look.
we got the tea everyday.

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:02.891
all day on TKA.

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:03.724
See you guys next time.

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:05.325
I'm your girl Mona.

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.393
- I'm your boy. Justin.

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:07.661
- Justin don't like Will Clay.

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.030
but we out here love you guys.
peace.

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:12.533
- Check it out.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.668
- What?

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:15.736
- What y'all think.

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.338
- Think about what. why
are we here?

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:19.506
What is this?

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.675
- This is my inspiration
for my next video.

00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:23.878
For "Ain't Just Sex" came
down here.

00:12:23.912 --> 00:12:25.412
I was looking

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:28.348
at it and I'm like. this is
the direction I'm trying to go.

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:30.584
- Okay first of all.
we need to be focusing

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:31.451
on getting in front

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:32.887
of this Kamilah Trill interview

00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:34.521
and this Jordan Holmes video.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:35.756
- This is my way of
getting in front of it.

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:38.358
With the music.
I'm telling you

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:40.028
It's doper than it looks.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.528
Rod. What you think?

00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:45.033
I don't know man. I kind of
like the smoke.

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:47.035
baby oil...girls.

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.036
- nigga nigga.

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:49.703
I just got in trouble for that.

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.039
No. come on a slap in
the face to the fans.

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.040
If I did something like that.
promoting sex.

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.708
I'm thinking now.
imagine it lit

00:12:54.741 --> 00:13:01.281

- Kiaira why weren't my friends
invited.

00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:03.484

00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:05.052
Bullshit

00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:06.520
Listen. they'll get over it.

00:23:06.554 --> 00:23:08.656
This isn't a party for them
anyway.

00:23:08.688 --> 00:23:10.491
- Oh that's how you feel
about my best friends?

00:23:10.524 --> 00:23:12.493
- Look. it is what it is.

00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:14.195
Okay their cute little common
folk.

00:23:14.228 --> 00:23:16.497
But we're different
breed. different class.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.865
And we need to act like it.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:19.699
- That's bullshit.

00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:22.236
- Excuse me!

00:23:24.572 --> 00:23:26.907
- Y'all think Ki was being
shady?

00:23:26.941 --> 00:23:28.342
- I know it look a certain way

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:30.044
But I don't think she was
being shady on purpose.

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:31.679
- Speak of the devil.

00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:33.214
- Hey Ki. how you doing?

00:23:33.247 --> 00:23:34.848
(Rodney) Aw man

00:23:34.882 --> 00:23:37.351
- So glad you all could
make it to the party.

00:23:37.384 --> 00:23:38.852
- What we would miss it for the
world.

00:23:38.886 --> 00:23:41.188
but only if we had an invite.

00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:43.090
- Oh. I'm so sorry. I heard
about that.

00:23:43.123 --> 00:23:44.925
I know you guys are like his
family.

00:23:44.959 --> 00:23:49.363
- No. we are family unlike
you a gold digging troll.

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:51.198
- That escalated quickly.

00:23:51.232 --> 00:23:52.533
- I don't like what you're
insinuating.

00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:54.868
- I'm not insinuating I'm
stating

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:56.604
just stop being fake all the
time

00:23:56.637 --> 00:23:59.206
and just admit you don't
bang with us you claim.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.608
- You want to keep it real.

00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:02.376
I'm here for Will and Will only.

00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:06.380
And I have no interest in
you three stooges around me.

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:09.883
It breeds jealousy when the
people around you are succeeding

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:11.552
and you're stuck at your
little nine to five.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:13.287
- Shardae. please do me a favor

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.922
and snatch this jawn weave out.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.726
- I'm going to let her
live off Will's hard work

00:24:18.758 --> 00:24:20.127
and success another year.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.062
She'll be riding more coattails
before the night's end.

00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:23.564
- That's what she's good at.

00:24:23.597 --> 00:24:25.599
- Hey. Will. Will come on man.

00:24:26.766 --> 00:24:29.403
- Guess what I just had
an Epic conversation

00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:30.738
with Chuck Stearman.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.572
(Kamal) Chuck Stearman?

00:24:31.605 --> 00:24:33.007
- Y'all know the producer?

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.242
Guess what he wants me to be
the lead in his next film.

00:24:35.276 --> 00:24:36.143
(Rodney) Who?

00:24:36.176 --> 00:24:37.745
Will Clay!

00:24:37.777 --> 00:24:39.280
(crowd cheers)

00:24:39.313 --> 00:24:41.915
I can't believe it y'all and
Rodney. I gave him your number.

00:24:41.949 --> 00:24:43.250

00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:44.084

00:24:44.118 --> 00:24:44.918

00:24:44.952 --> 00:24:45.753
You already know baby

00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:46.954

Will.

00:24:54.628 --> 00:24:57.498

00:25:04.138 --> 00:25:05.773
- Oh. I'm sorry your majesty.

00:25:05.806 --> 00:25:06.607
You know what?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.474

00:37:03.024 --> 00:37:05.993
- That's talking about my baby
Kiaira K

00:37:06.027 --> 00:37:10.197
Ooh. ooh ooh come here Kiaira K
Ooh. Ooh!

00:37:12.066 --> 00:37:13.200
Hey come on. let's go.

00:37:15.036 --> 00:37:15.870
K.

00:37:16.871 --> 00:37:18.039
You're a fool

00:37:18.072 --> 00:37:19.907
(jazz music playing in
background)

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.214
- Goodnight.

00:37:32.552 --> 00:37:33.553
Sorry we're closed.

00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:35.189
- Perfect timing.

00:37:35.222 --> 00:37:37.058
- What you're doing here?

00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:38.526
I'm vindicated. baby.

00:37:38.558 --> 00:37:40.528
- I see things must be going
good

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.761
if you're doing a surprise pop
ups

00:37:41.795 --> 00:37:42.863
on your friends.

00:37:42.897 --> 00:37:45.232
- Come on. Shardae I said I'm
sorry.

00:37:45.266 --> 00:37:46.367
- So you just came to kick it

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.402
or apologize for the other day.

00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:50.737
- I actually came to talk to
you.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.206
I need a little bit of
advice or something.

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:54.375
And I know he wanted a
few people in my life.

00:37:54.408 --> 00:37:57.044
We're actually gonna keep
it one hundred with me.

00:37:57.078 --> 00:37:58.412
All right. wassup?

00:37:58.446 --> 00:38:01.382
You know how rough
stuff been going lately.

00:38:01.415 --> 00:38:02.715
And I just been thinking
about getting older

00:38:02.749 --> 00:38:05.052
as an artist and what I'm
going to do after this.

00:38:05.086 --> 00:38:06.586
And I know I'm not too old yet

00:38:06.619 --> 00:38:08.721
but I've been doing this for a
long time

00:38:08.755 --> 00:38:11.559
and it's really starting
to take a toll on me.

00:38:11.591 --> 00:38:13.793
- You in your feelings again.
talking

00:38:13.828 --> 00:38:15.762
about taking a break from your
music.

00:38:15.795 --> 00:38:17.597
Is that what you really want to
do?

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.766
- Not all the way. look check it
out.

00:38:19.799 --> 00:38:22.103
So I met this artist's name.
Staci G.

00:38:22.937 --> 00:38:24.071
And she is cold. she's lit

00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:25.106
When I tell you she just got the
IT factor

00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:27.308
and it dawned on me.

00:38:27.341 --> 00:38:29.609
Maybe I could develop an artist.

00:38:29.642 --> 00:38:32.079
I'm more than just my voice.

00:38:32.113 --> 00:38:33.114
- So what y'all going to be

00:38:33.147 --> 00:38:34.949
like a Rick James and Teena
Marie.

00:38:34.982 --> 00:38:37.318
You got jokes. See girl
you always playing too much.

00:38:37.351 --> 00:38:39.086
- No I'm going sign her.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.421
I'm a develop her. write with
her.

00:38:40.454 --> 00:38:42.755
create a classic album and bow
out as Will

00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:45.459
artist and welcome as Will the
executive.

00:38:47.294 --> 00:38:49.463
- It's ambitious I like it.

00:38:50.865 --> 00:38:51.664
You know I'll support your
stuff.

00:38:51.698 --> 00:38:53.000
(Will) Oh. thank you!

00:38:54.468 --> 00:38:56.669
- So is Kiaira cool with this?

00:38:56.703 --> 00:38:58.272
- What'd you think about last
night?

00:38:58.305 --> 00:38:59.607
- What sex?

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:02.309
- No Stacey G at the studio.

00:39:03.643 --> 00:39:05.112
- Why are we talking about this
now?

00:39:05.146 --> 00:39:06.947
I'm ready to go upstairs for
round two.

00:39:06.981 --> 00:39:08.349
- Because it's just been

00:39:08.382 --> 00:39:10.951
on my mind heavy and I'm
want to make sure we lock her

00:39:10.985 --> 00:39:12.386
down before we lose her.

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:14.321
- Look. she was good and all
well. but we need to focus

00:39:14.355 --> 00:39:18.025
on you and getting you locked
into this long-term deal.

00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:19.659
That's money on the table now.

00:39:20.528 --> 00:39:22.630
- I just think about it.

00:39:22.662 --> 00:39:24.664
Staci could be the key to
getting our record label

00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:28.668
off the ground and I could
retire and maybe just transition

00:39:28.701 --> 00:39:33.807
into working on her and me
and you guess what we can do?

00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:35.742
You can start a family.

00:39:36.709 --> 00:39:38.979
You talking about retiring and
becoming

00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:41.515
a produ... Chile! Please.

00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:43.050
you need to worry about singing.

00:39:43.083 --> 00:39:45.319
And let me and Rodney
worry about your career.

00:39:45.352 --> 00:39:46.153
All right.

00:39:46.187 --> 00:39:47.188
Wow!

00:39:47.221 --> 00:39:48.556
I will see you later. family.
man.

00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:50.858
- Wow goodnight to you too.

00:39:52.259 --> 00:39:54.061
- So Kiaira. isn't cool with it.

00:39:54.094 --> 00:39:55.529
- Not the way she was talking.

00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:58.666
- But would you do it without
her?

00:39:58.698 --> 00:40:00.167
- I don't know. I've been with
Kiaira

00:40:00.201 --> 00:40:01.402
and Rod for so long.

00:40:01.435 --> 00:40:03.003
It's like. I couldn't
even imagine my life.

00:40:03.037 --> 00:40:05.339
or my career without them.

00:40:05.372 --> 00:40:06.674
- Well you need to do what's
best for you.

00:40:06.706 --> 00:40:08.676
And sometimes Rodney and Kiaira

00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:10.377
don't have your best interests
in mind.

00:40:11.711 --> 00:40:13.914
- Why are you so dope Shardae?

00:40:13.948 --> 00:40:15.849
You've been literally one of
the most consistent people

00:40:15.883 --> 00:40:17.451
in my life.

00:40:17.484 --> 00:40:20.454
- All your life. and best
friends
tell each other the truth.

00:40:21.455 --> 00:40:22.890
And I don't want you to waking
up one day

00:40:22.923 --> 00:40:24.525
and just realizing that your
purpose was right in front

00:40:24.558 --> 00:40:25.392
of you.

00:40:26.726 --> 00:40:30.698
You are more than a
beautiful man that can sing.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.900
- So you think I'm beautiful.

00:40:32.933 --> 00:40:38.038
- Always ruining a tender
moment with ya pretty ass.

00:40:38.072 --> 00:40:40.474
(jazz music playing in the
background)

00:40:43.077 --> 00:40:44.044
- Hey baby.

00:40:44.078 --> 00:40:45.045
- Rodney. how you doing man?

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:46.213
Thank you so much.

00:40:46.247 --> 00:40:47.047
Thank you man.

00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:47.915
I appreciate it.

00:40:48.816 --> 00:40:49.917
Oh the good stuff. huh?

00:40:53.587 --> 00:40:54.622
- Hey Steve.

00:40:54.655 --> 00:40:56.123
You mind if I get another round
of that?

00:40:57.091 --> 00:40:57.891
Oh yeah.

00:40:57.925 --> 00:40:58.726
Feel free to indulge.

00:40:58.758 --> 00:40:59.560
- Yeah damn right.

00:40:59.593 --> 00:41:00.728
- Especially you Will.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.162
I'm gonna take this whole bottle
home.

00:41:03.597 --> 00:41:05.566
- So we want to commend you all.

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:07.401
Will. Rodney. and Kiaira for all

00:41:07.434 --> 00:41:10.971
of your hard work and
achievements
and your new world tour

00:41:11.005 --> 00:41:13.741
that we believe will be your
best yet.

00:41:13.773 --> 00:41:14.774
- Thank you so much.

00:41:14.808 --> 00:41:16.243
It's shaping up to be pretty
lit.

00:41:16.277 --> 00:41:18.778
We all know by now that
initially we had some doubts

00:41:18.812 --> 00:41:20.581
onto whether or not we
could get a good return

00:41:20.614 --> 00:41:23.651
from an RnB album that seemed to
speak

00:41:23.684 --> 00:41:25.452
to only a certain demographic.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.325
But ultimately. ultimately. you
surpassed those expectations

00:41:31.959 --> 00:41:34.094
with the creation of this new
album.

00:41:34.128 --> 00:41:35.829
- Your support means
everything to us Steve.

00:41:35.863 --> 00:41:37.264
thank you so much.

00:41:37.298 --> 00:41:38.465
- So how about these contracts

00:41:38.499 --> 00:41:40.467
cause that's why we're here
tonight right?

00:41:40.501 --> 00:41:42.436
That is why we're here. right?

00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:43.971
- See. that's what I like about
you.

00:41:44.004 --> 00:41:45.939
You put your business first

00:41:45.973 --> 00:41:47.474
- You know.

00:41:47.508 --> 00:41:50.678
- So let me introduce
you to Braxton McCall.

00:41:50.711 --> 00:41:53.113
He is our bright new
executive that was brought

00:41:53.147 --> 00:41:55.149
over from the merger with BCMA.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.951
- Think he was at the
birthday party right?

00:41:57.985 --> 00:41:59.219
- Yeah. he was.

00:41:59.253 --> 00:42:00.287
So this is more like
your second introduction.

00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:01.121
- I recognize you man.

00:42:01.155 --> 00:42:02.356
Good to see you.

00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.290
- Good to see you.

00:42:03.324 --> 00:42:04.725
Thank you. Steve.

00:42:04.758 --> 00:42:07.795
Will. my sole purpose is to
strengthen our partnership

00:42:07.828 --> 00:42:09.196
with the deal that benefits us
all

00:42:09.229 --> 00:42:11.332
and takes your career to the
next level.

00:42:11.365 --> 00:42:12.966
So I'll be teaming up

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.802
with Kiaira and Rodney behind
the scenes

00:42:14.835 --> 00:42:16.070
to ensure that dream.

00:42:18.172 --> 00:42:19.640
I think you'll be happy

00:42:19.673 --> 00:42:22.142
with our very lucrative offer
that far exceeds any offer

00:42:22.176 --> 00:42:23.812
that any R&B artists would
receive

00:42:23.844 --> 00:42:25.212
in today's climate.

00:42:25.245 --> 00:42:26.680
This agreement would take
effect.

00:42:26.714 --> 00:42:27.915
once you first step

00:42:27.948 --> 00:42:30.484
on stage for your new
world tour this summer.

00:42:30.517 --> 00:42:32.853
- We want you to know how
much you're valued Will.

00:42:35.356 --> 00:42:39.193
- Damn. I mean. well.
yes. this is good stuff.

00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:41.195
- Will.

00:42:42.429 --> 00:42:44.998
- I mean. it's a nice
number. but it's a 360.

00:42:45.032 --> 00:42:46.667
I don't do those.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.669
- Look. I totally understand.

00:42:48.702 --> 00:42:50.738
Look. 360's get a bad rep

00:42:51.772 --> 00:42:53.207
but I still think you can
see the benefits of this.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.176
- Will everyone in this room
knows how amazing you are

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.378
and all of the great
talents that you possess.

00:42:57.411 --> 00:42:59.046
Braxton and Steve. wanna make
you the face

00:42:59.079 --> 00:43:02.416
of their new merger and
a major brand worldwide.

00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:04.184
Our first priority is going
to be getting you moved

00:43:04.218 --> 00:43:05.519
from the East coast to LA.

00:43:05.552 --> 00:43:07.888
where BMCA is finest agents are
located

00:43:07.921 --> 00:43:10.224
and getting you into the new
artist development program.

00:43:10.257 --> 00:43:11.725
- Wait what?

00:43:11.759 --> 00:43:13.193
I just moved back.

00:43:13.227 --> 00:43:14.628
Y'all want me to go back

00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:17.197
and do what? I know y'all
don't think Will Clay going

00:43:17.231 --> 00:43:18.599
through anybody's artist

00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:21.034
development program and
actually did Kiaira tell y'all

00:43:21.068 --> 00:43:22.069
that I'm actually not even sure

00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:23.570
that I want to be an artist
anymore.

00:43:23.604 --> 00:43:26.573
I kind of want to get on a
backend and do some producing.

00:43:26.607 --> 00:43:28.542
- Will. I'm confused I just...

00:43:28.575 --> 00:43:29.777
- Do you mind if we just had
a moment with Will outside?

00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:33.547
- Kiki look I know what I want.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.883
I know what I want.

00:43:34.915 --> 00:43:36.316
Okay. we'll be back.

00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:39.219
- I don't know why y'all had
to pull me out to meeting.

00:43:39.253 --> 00:43:41.054
Being all dramatic.

00:43:41.088 --> 00:43:42.289
- Somebody want to tell me

00:43:42.322 --> 00:43:43.390
what the hell was that in there?

00:43:43.424 --> 00:43:44.625
- That was Mr. Gregory over here
wants

00:43:44.658 --> 00:43:46.393
to leave all this money on the
table.

00:43:46.427 --> 00:43:47.896
So you can start his new record
label

00:43:47.928 --> 00:43:50.230
with his muse for the day. Staci
G.

00:43:50.264 --> 00:43:51.565
- Hold on.

00:43:51.598 --> 00:43:53.400
Wait. Nobody thought it
was important to tell me

00:43:53.434 --> 00:43:54.768
that before we walked in there?

00:43:54.802 --> 00:43:56.970
- Think about it y'all we don't
need them.

00:43:57.004 --> 00:43:58.572
The three of us. we know the
game

00:43:58.605 --> 00:44:00.274
but we also know music.

00:44:00.307 --> 00:44:02.242
Add that with Staci well we got
magic.

00:44:02.276 --> 00:44:05.579
- Will. I get it. but it's a
lot of commas in there. man.

00:44:05.612 --> 00:44:06.413
- A lot of commas.

00:44:06.447 --> 00:44:07.681
- Can we do both?

00:44:07.714 --> 00:44:09.149
- Bro that's chump change
compared to our work

00:44:09.183 --> 00:44:10.417
Think about it.

00:44:10.451 --> 00:44:11.985
If we get ownership

00:44:12.019 --> 00:44:13.922
we're not living off the
advances that the label given
us.

00:44:13.954 --> 00:44:15.322
It's a big picture move here.
bro.

00:44:15.355 --> 00:44:16.757
Come on.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:17.591
You know what?

00:44:17.624 --> 00:44:19.092
It's my career.

00:44:19.126 --> 00:44:20.260
Y'all gotta do what I tell
y'all to do because I pay y'all.

00:44:20.294 --> 00:44:21.094
I write the checks.

00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:22.596
So this is what I want.

00:44:22.629 --> 00:44:24.264
This is what I'm going to go
in there and make it happen.

00:44:24.298 --> 00:44:25.766
That's all I'm saying.

00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:28.937
- Relax. you're getting a
little. worked up. calm down.

00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:29.770
Let's talk about that.

00:44:29.804 --> 00:44:31.171
- All right. listen Ki

00:44:31.205 --> 00:44:33.942
you go in there. make something
up.

00:44:33.974 --> 00:44:34.775
- Make something up?

00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:36.109
You guys?

00:44:36.143 --> 00:44:37.277
Oh my God.

00:44:37.311 --> 00:44:38.947
- You you go home. and go get
some rest.

00:44:38.979 --> 00:44:40.113
And we'll reconvene tomorrow.

00:44:40.147 --> 00:44:41.782
We'll figure this out. okay?

00:44:41.816 --> 00:44:44.017
- Rodney. Kiaira. this
is deeper than what know.

00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:46.119
I made a promise to my
grandfather many years ago

00:44:46.153 --> 00:44:48.288
at his grave that I would never
settle.

00:44:48.322 --> 00:44:49.456
And then I would always remember

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.691
that all things are possible

00:44:50.724 --> 00:44:53.126
through Christ and y'all
gotta make it happen.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.997
- Okay. okay. I'll handle it
and I'll make sure we take care

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.666
of what you need first and
foremost. okay?

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.534
- Fix this.

00:45:02.002 --> 00:45:03.303
- But listen. this is
what I find interesting.

00:45:03.337 --> 00:45:06.306
I always took Will Clay to be
selfish.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.474
Like he's like a pretty boy.

00:45:07.508 --> 00:45:09.543
- Cause he is.

00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:11.011
He definitely is.

00:45:11.044 --> 00:45:12.981
But. it looked like he wanted

00:45:13.013 --> 00:45:15.716
to do something a little bit
more than sing apparently.

00:45:15.749 --> 00:45:17.351
Ya know my sources tells me

00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:20.989
that he done turn down the
multi-million dollar deal

00:45:21.021 --> 00:45:23.156
in pursuit of doing his
own thing independently.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.391
- Okay. I see you. Will Clay.

00:45:24.424 --> 00:45:26.560
I'm not gonna turn down
a big deal like that.

00:45:26.593 --> 00:45:28.161
but it's okay to each's own.

00:45:28.195 --> 00:45:30.330
But listen. maybe he
wants to change directions

00:45:30.364 --> 00:45:31.833
and not be so egocentric.

00:45:31.866 --> 00:45:33.700
You know. maybe he might
be on his Nipsey Hussle.

00:45:33.734 --> 00:45:35.502
you know. inspire everybody for
change.

00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:37.504
You know. he might be different
now.

00:45:37.538 --> 00:45:38.672
- I doubt it.

00:45:38.705 --> 00:45:40.842
You asked me that was a fool ass
move.

00:45:40.875 --> 00:45:42.376
- Dang. that's how he doing it.

00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:43.845
TKA all day.

00:45:43.878 --> 00:45:45.212
You know how we do bring you

00:45:45.245 --> 00:45:47.581
the tea every day. all day.
have a good night guys.

00:45:50.284 --> 00:45:53.053
- Hey. I'm at my mom's house and

00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:55.355
You won't believe what I found.

00:45:55.389 --> 00:45:57.524
All these old behind CDs

00:45:57.558 --> 00:46:00.028
and mixetapes from a billion
years ago.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.261
- You got my favorite one in
there.

00:46:01.295 --> 00:46:03.865
- You mean the one you made
thinking it..

00:46:03.898 --> 00:46:06.533
- You know it. That was my
old G. The goat. the greatest.

00:46:06.567 --> 00:46:08.368
The legend. Usher Raymond

00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:11.405
- Ew fan boy. I remember
you used to pop lock

00:46:11.438 --> 00:46:14.541
and dance under the fire
hydrant. pretending it was rain.

00:46:14.575 --> 00:46:17.544
Oh. please don't act like I
was the only one acting crazy.

00:46:17.578 --> 00:46:19.047
I can't even count how many
times

00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:22.783
I remember butchering that boy
is mine

00:46:22.817 --> 00:46:25.385
and still at the. all these
years.

00:46:25.419 --> 00:46:26.787
You still ain't picked aside.

00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.222
- And we are not having
this conversation tonight

00:46:29.256 --> 00:46:30.457
and don't be mad

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.426
because your dad banned
Lil Kim and Foxy Brown.

00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:33.760
Once he heard them lyrics.

00:46:35.462 --> 00:46:37.297
- There's a whole lesson on
temptation.

00:46:37.331 --> 00:46:38.632
Well. thank God.

00:46:38.665 --> 00:46:41.069
He never caught you doing
your LL impersonation.

00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:42.336
- Oh. I could still do it.

00:46:44.438 --> 00:46:47.107
- Bye. I am not impressed.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.309
Anyway do you remember the
first one that we made?

00:46:50.277 --> 00:46:51.079
- Of course I do.

00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:52.746
Will and Shardae volume one.

00:46:52.779 --> 00:46:55.649
- I'm looking at it right now.

00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:58.251
And guess what I just picked up.
Brandy.

00:46:58.285 --> 00:47:01.588
- Seriously. "always on
my mind". that was always

00:47:01.622 --> 00:47:03.256
in heavy rotation.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.293
- but how'd you turn a joyful
song into a mournful song.

00:47:06.326 --> 00:47:08.930
That's what I'm trying to figure
out.

00:47:08.963 --> 00:47:11.598
- You know that was around
the time grandpa died.

00:47:11.632 --> 00:47:14.768
So just was always listening
to that one all the time.

00:47:14.801 --> 00:47:17.771
Everybody else drifted in
they own little weird world.

00:47:17.805 --> 00:47:19.974
You was the only one who leaned
in.

00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:25.512
- That's the best friends do.

00:47:25.545 --> 00:47:26.380
- (Will) True.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.854
- All right that's enough
reminiscing

00:47:32.887 --> 00:47:34.621
I got to go Will.

00:47:34.655 --> 00:47:35.990
- All right bye.

00:47:37.324 --> 00:47:38.158
- Bye.

00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:47.835
(hip hop music playing in
background)

00:47:51.005 --> 00:47:52.339
- All right now don't forget.

00:47:52.372 --> 00:47:53.808
Braxton has the camera
crew following us now okay?

00:47:53.841 --> 00:47:56.010
- Yeah yeah blah-blah-blah
what's up everybody.

00:47:56.044 --> 00:47:57.879
It's your boy the big dog

00:47:57.912 --> 00:48:01.149
Rodney Rod baby how are you
doing my ladies out there.

00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:03.550
We out on the road first tour

Get ready to get kicked
off and we gonna show some

00:48:05.419 --> 00:48:06.821
behind the scenes real quick.

00:48:06.854 --> 00:48:09.690
Kiaira. what's up baby
you looking good tonight.

00:48:09.723 --> 00:48:10.524
- Hi.

00:48:10.557 --> 00:48:11.859
- How are you doing?

00:48:11.893 --> 00:48:13.326
- Rodney you have something
to do like your job?

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.328
- But mommy that's boring.

00:48:15.362 --> 00:48:17.165
Ladies and gentlemen you already
know

00:48:17.197 --> 00:48:18.699
the one and the only newest
member

00:48:18.732 --> 00:48:21.169
of the team is Staci G.

00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:22.235
She only goes by one letter in
her name

00:48:22.269 --> 00:48:24.005
cause she thinks she's an icon.

00:48:24.038 --> 00:48:25.173
I don't know where she get that
from

00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:26.573
- Leave me alone.

00:48:26.606 --> 00:48:28.241
- Okay but  baby sing
something for them real quick.

00:48:28.275 --> 00:48:29.443
- Leave me alone.

00:48:29.476 --> 00:48:32.013
- And we gonna save
that for the tour y'all

00:48:32.046 --> 00:48:34.015
Look. we got so much going on.

00:48:34.048 --> 00:48:37.185
This man needs no
introduction because legends

00:48:37.217 --> 00:48:39.020
let all their work do the
talking.

00:48:39.053 --> 00:48:40.554
- Or their loud ass managers.
Boy. I'm on the phone.

00:48:41.555 --> 00:48:43.356
- But that hurt bro. but ladies

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.892
and gentlemen it's Will Clay.

00:48:45.759 --> 00:48:47.195
Willy Will baby. what's up man!

00:48:47.227 --> 00:48:48.361
Tell the people the good news

00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:49.262
- Oh yeah the good news.

00:48:49.296 --> 00:48:50.530
So guess what

00:48:50.564 --> 00:48:53.366
We decided as a team we

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.902
the tour at Madison Square
Garden

00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:57.270
'Cause we wanna make full circle

00:48:57.304 --> 00:48:58.305

I see you in here rehearsing

00:49:58.132 --> 00:49:59.432
with your little blue jacket on.

00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:01.668
Have you ever done a real
dress rehearsal before?

00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:04.638
- Yeah. but never really with
all these cameras around.

00:50:04.671 --> 00:50:07.141
- That's a Kiaira thing
she got this thing.

00:50:07.175 --> 00:50:09.309
Will. everything needs to be
documented.

00:50:09.342 --> 00:50:10.978
Document this Kiaira what's up?

00:50:11.012 --> 00:50:14.148
You like this. Kiaira. this is
of you.

00:50:14.182 --> 00:50:15.615
No but I'm so proud of
you though seriously.

00:50:15.649 --> 00:50:17.952
I know you're about to rock this
tour.

00:50:17.985 --> 00:50:19.352
- Thank you so much.

00:50:19.386 --> 00:50:22.123
You know. I was so nervous.
but you've been such

00:50:22.156 --> 00:50:23.390
a great coach.

00:50:23.423 --> 00:50:26.160
Like for real. my G pretty
good for a old head.

00:50:26.194 --> 00:50:27.829
- Oh. oh now I'm old.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.064
This is Stacy.

00:50:30.097 --> 00:50:31.398
I knew it was something special
in you.

00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:33.201
The moment I saw you and
now the whole world about

00:50:33.234 --> 00:50:35.669
to see you starting
this tour off in Philly.

00:50:35.702 --> 00:50:37.305
So you know what that means.

00:50:37.337 --> 00:50:38.806
You bout to be singing

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.976
at one of the cities where
the dopest music came out of.

00:50:42.009 --> 00:50:45.146
Oh man. I remember being
a kid barely sitting

00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:48.983
at Fairmont park singing.
writing. dreaming.

00:50:49.016 --> 00:50:50.684
hoping for moments like these.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.023
(jazz music playing in
background)

00:50:58.692 --> 00:51:01.695
- Wow haven't met here in years.

00:51:01.728 --> 00:51:04.364
- This used to be our
spot back in the day.

00:51:04.397 --> 00:51:06.666
So many memories around
here. man. the bridge

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.669
the water. we used to have
some good times out here.

00:51:09.703 --> 00:51:11.839
- Well. somebody is in a
good mood.

00:51:11.873 --> 00:51:14.342
Dressing rehearsals must be
going nicely.

00:51:14.374 --> 00:51:16.509
- I guess it's just

00:51:16.543 --> 00:51:19.546
I don't know how I feel about
leaving it all behind so soon.

00:51:19.579 --> 00:51:20.547
You know ever since I've been
here.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.917
I just been focused on me.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.252
I ain't had no time to get

00:51:24.285 --> 00:51:26.386
up with you and see how
things are going with you.

00:59:05.212 --> 00:59:07.147
Hey Jamie real quick.

00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:08.817
I'm not liking the way
my vocals are sounding.

00:59:08.849 --> 00:59:11.685
Can you add some more reverb
when we get over in the room?

00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:14.388
- Yeah first off you sounded
great.

00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:16.323
Kiaira told me not to add any
more reverb.

00:59:16.357 --> 00:59:19.828
- No. no Kiara got nothing to
do with the way I sound. I do.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.862
So go over there and add some
more reverb

00:59:21.895 --> 00:59:22.831
like I asked got it?

00:59:22.863 --> 00:59:24.198
- Yes. sir.

00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:25.332
- Cool also while you're at it.

00:59:25.366 --> 00:59:26.500
can you talk to the lighting
designer?

00:59:26.533 --> 00:59:27.701
The lights ain't doing nothing
for me.

00:59:27.735 --> 00:59:29.838
They gotta dance we need like
some gobos

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.171
or some movers or something.

00:59:31.205 --> 00:59:32.906
Can y'all do something about
that.

00:59:33.774 --> 00:59:35.676
- I don't want to be combative.

00:59:35.709 --> 00:59:36.910
- Kiaira told me I can't
make any set design

00:59:36.944 --> 00:59:38.545
changes without her prior
approval.

00:59:38.579 --> 00:59:39.713
She said she has to approve
everything.

00:59:39.747 --> 00:59:40.681
- No. no excuse me.

00:59:40.714 --> 00:59:41.515
Kiaira said what?

00:59:41.548 --> 00:59:43.517
- Will. baby. listen.

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.551
- I'll get right on that for
you.

00:59:44.585 --> 00:59:46.520
- So yeah. about that Kiaira
thought

00:59:46.553 --> 00:59:47.521
we should change that too.

00:59:47.554 --> 00:59:48.857
- Yo Rodney you're my homie.

00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:50.859
But you got to start
realizing who pays who here.

00:59:50.924 --> 00:59:52.693
Alright when I ask
somebody to do something

00:59:52.726 --> 00:59:54.863
in my rehearsal. I want to hear
yes sir.

00:59:54.895 --> 00:59:55.696
- Yes. sir.

00:59:55.729 --> 00:59:56.530
- Got it sir.
- Got it sir.

00:59:56.563 --> 00:59:57.398
- My pleasure. sir.

00:59:57.431 --> 00:59:58.465
- My pleasure sir.

00:59:58.499 --> 00:59:59.566
- I'm sick of hearing all this
goddamn

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.769
Kiaira said. Kiaira said this my
show.

01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:02.871
And if y'all could implement
that.

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:04.371
that y'all could both hit the
door.

01:00:04.405 --> 01:00:05.205
And I mean that. bro.

01:00:05.239 --> 01:00:06.407
I don't wanna hit any doors.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.241
I don't ain't deal with this
shit no more.

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:09.109
- Okay I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:12.212
- What? Will. no. one's
begging you to be here.

01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:14.581
Okay Staci G is ready.

01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.886
- You two are hilarious.

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:18.887
- No. no. no chill Rod.

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:20.721
- What you mean Staci G's ready?

01:00:20.754 --> 01:00:22.222
This is my show.

01:00:22.256 --> 01:00:25.894
- I mean that this show is
gonna go on with or without you.

01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:27.461
I just wonder what your
fans are gonna think

01:00:27.494 --> 01:00:31.064
when they find out that their
little favorite artists backed

01:00:31.098 --> 01:00:32.399
out because he didn't get his
way.

01:00:32.433 --> 01:00:33.902
- Man. fuck them fans.

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.302
And this dumb ass show
is deeper than that.

01:00:35.335 --> 01:00:37.070
And you know what Kiaira.

01:00:37.104 --> 01:00:38.972
you've been trying to control
and manipulate my career

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:41.408
with your analytics and all
your formula since day one.

01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:42.443
But guess what?

01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:44.445
You can't recreate God given
talent.

01:00:44.478 --> 01:00:45.279
- Will please.

01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:46.613
- And it's right here.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:47.981
Something your ass won't
never know nothing about.

01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:49.918
Kiaira what you got to realize?

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.821
This is a thousand of you
but it's only one of me.

01:00:52.854 --> 01:00:53.922
And I mean that.

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:54.923
- He didn't mean that.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.256
- Yes he did.

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.760
- If you think that you
can make it without me

01:00:59.793 --> 01:01:00.929
go right ahead.

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:02.596
But don't you dare come running
back

01:01:02.629 --> 01:01:04.765
when everything falls apart.

01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:06.166
- Will she didn't mean it bro.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.000
(laughs)
- What're doing?

01:01:07.034 --> 01:01:08.837
- Hey Ki fuck you.

01:01:14.308 --> 01:01:15.944
- Will. Will we can fix this.

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:16.811
Will. Will.

01:01:18.045 --> 01:01:21.014
- Rodney he's washed we got
Staci

01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:22.817
and she is the future.

01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:23.818
- Let's go.

01:01:29.056 --> 01:01:31.458
- Like. I really hope
he takes his pompous ass

01:01:31.492 --> 01:01:34.661
and stops alienating folks
and talking about his fans

01:01:34.695 --> 01:01:37.531
like give the younger
artists a chance instead

01:01:37.564 --> 01:01:39.166
of sabotaging his own career.

01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:42.871
But his new music sounded good
though.

01:01:42.904 --> 01:01:43.972
So I'm still listening

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:45.339
to the album. even though he had
jerk.

01:01:47.876 --> 01:01:48.910
You done with him?

01:01:48.943 --> 01:01:51.178
- I ain't got no word. nothing
enough.

01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:52.479
I have nothing left to say.

01:01:52.513 --> 01:01:54.849
- I guess for next time on TKA
all day.

So you're going to drown
yourself in your sorrows.

01:06:28.622 --> 01:06:29.924
Shardae look. I'm done.

01:06:29.957 --> 01:06:31.259

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:33.760

everything

01:06:33.794 --> 01:06:35.328
Look news flash.

01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:39.267
I ain't perfect. I tried to be
but people mess up every day.

01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.468
- Will. ain't nobody perfect.
but I'm not

01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:43.770
going to let you sit
here and sink yourself

01:06:43.805 --> 01:06:45.605
into a depression.

01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:47.607
So you need to get up. clean up.
and just

01:06:47.641 --> 01:06:48.843
deal with your demons.

01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:50.144
- It's so easy for you
to say from the outside.

01:06:50.178 --> 01:06:52.779
looking in. This all I know.
everybody want

01:06:52.814 --> 01:06:54.514
to see another entertainer.
crash and burn

01:06:54.548 --> 01:06:56.284
and I'm supposed to just lose it
all.

01:06:56.316 --> 01:06:59.120
That's bullshit Shardae and you
know it.

01:06:59.153 --> 01:07:00.787
- Will. don't get hyped with me.

01:07:00.822 --> 01:07:02.857
Okay I'm the only one looking
out for your

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:03.723
Woe is me self

01:07:04.992 --> 01:07:05.827
- I'm sorry.

01:07:06.894 --> 01:07:08.162
You know I didn't mean it like
that.

01:07:08.196 --> 01:07:10.164
My bad

01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:15.837
- It's cool. but don't
let it happen again.

01:07:16.838 --> 01:07:18.039
Or I'ma have to put hands on you

01:07:18.072 --> 01:07:21.175
Like I did back in the day in
drama club.

01:07:22.176 --> 01:07:26.180
- Oh you know I still can't
believe you hit me right?

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.218
- Of course. with that mouth
of yours. you had it coming.

01:07:33.687 --> 01:07:35.488
Shardae

01:07:35.522 --> 01:07:37.191
- This is all a mess right now.

01:07:38.926 --> 01:07:40.194
I ain't talked to Kiaira

01:07:40.228 --> 01:07:42.696
or Rodney since everything went
down.

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:47.001
Well. what about the
dream you told me about

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:48.236
About you taking a break from
being

01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:50.872
the artist and focusing on Staci
G.

01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:54.507
You got to let the Lord light
the fire

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:58.846
that is born inside of you and
just put it into your craft.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.882
- It's funny I forgot all about
that.

01:15:12.646 --> 01:15:13.781
Alright. I'll talk to you later.

01:15:13.814 --> 01:15:14.615
All right.

01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:16.150
I'll talk with you.

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:17.351
(Justin) Come on dog.

01:15:17.384 --> 01:15:19.486
That entitled celebrity
card is played out.

01:15:21.722 --> 01:15:23.691
You ain't been right since
your grandfather died.

01:15:23.724 --> 01:15:25.292
- No. you I ain't got nothing to
lose.

01:15:25.326 --> 01:15:26.126
I will kill this nigga.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.661
- Mal Mal we good?

01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:28.796
Let's just get out of here
before this

01:15:28.829 --> 01:15:29.863
get any worse for this clown.

01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:34.368
- Nah. it's cool. I got what I
need.

01:15:34.401 --> 01:15:36.337
Yeah. Get your ass out of here.

01:15:42.176 --> 01:15:43.510
- Where the hell have you been?

01:15:44.511 --> 01:15:45.312
- I'm securing the bag man

01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:46.480
Nigga don't touch me.

01:15:46.513 --> 01:15:47.348
I'm out.

01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:48.515
Get back the best way you can

01:15:49.383 --> 01:15:50.217
You scary!

01:15:51.518 --> 01:15:55.255
(club chatter)

01:15:56.523 --> 01:15:59.526
(crying)

01:16:01.595 --> 01:16:02.429
- Oh boy.

01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:05.699
- That's okay.

01:16:05.733 --> 01:16:07.000
Let it out.

01:16:07.034 --> 01:16:08.268
We know he did you wrong.

01:16:10.371 --> 01:16:12.573
- I just tried to stand
up for him. you know

01:16:12.606 --> 01:16:14.575
be everything that he needed.

01:16:16.377 --> 01:16:18.212
But I guess that just wasn't
enough.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.182
I was the one taking all the Ls.
you know

01:16:22.216 --> 01:16:25.252
I was the one picking up the
pieces and rearranging them

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.088
you know. making sure that
he looked good at all times

01:16:28.122 --> 01:16:30.190
but I guess for somebody
like William Clay Gregory

01:16:30.224 --> 01:16:33.560
the third. that just wasn't
important.

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:36.063
You know. but.

01:16:38.065 --> 01:16:39.700
I mean.

01:16:39.733 --> 01:16:40.968
At the end of the day

01:16:42.069 --> 01:16:43.637
the money is what talks right?

01:16:45.406 --> 01:16:46.240
- Wow.

01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:50.879
So did you know that
he was cheating on you

01:16:50.911 --> 01:16:51.745
with Jordan Holmes?

01:16:53.013 --> 01:16:56.450
- You know. Jay. I didn't
want to believe it.

01:16:57.418 --> 01:17:00.154
but me being me

01:17:02.423 --> 01:17:06.393
I believed him when he said
that it wasn't recent. you know

01:17:06.427 --> 01:17:11.432
I didn't have any reason not
to. so I took his word for it

01:17:12.599 --> 01:17:14.301
and I kept it moving.

01:17:14.334 --> 01:17:16.170
You know. that's what black
women do.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:22.242
- Sounds like you were
something special. A real rider.

01:17:22.276 --> 01:17:23.577
I mean. that's how I was raised.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:26.113
you know. with honesty and
integrity.

01:17:28.782 --> 01:17:31.752
The only good thing that
came out of this situation

01:17:31.785 --> 01:17:34.755
is that Rodney and I was
able to start our own label

01:17:34.788 --> 01:17:37.491
and we were able an sign
amazing artist Staci G.

01:17:37.524 --> 01:17:41.595
You know. I got an awesome
partner. an awesome artist

01:17:41.628 --> 01:17:43.964
out of an unfortunate
and horrible situation.

01:17:45.332 --> 01:17:46.467
- I know that's right.

01:17:47.701 --> 01:17:52.105
Now what we really want to know
is.

01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:54.441
did you get the bag from his
lying ass?

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:56.310
(laughter)

01:17:57.978 --> 01:18:02.115
- Let's just say I am not
the unfortunate one okay?

01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:05.118
- Well let me be the first
to say congratulations

01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:06.955
on your new label and project.

01:18:06.987 --> 01:18:08.288
Thank you so much.

01:18:08.322 --> 01:18:10.825
Tell us some more about
what you got going on.

01:18:10.859 --> 01:18:12.626
- My pleasure Jay.

01:18:12.659 --> 01:18:16.497
So our label is No Mercy Records

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:19.868
and the first artist to
be released is Staci G

01:18:19.901 --> 01:18:22.369
and her first single is titled

01:18:22.402 --> 01:18:26.975
"Should've Known". which is
actually my story with Will.

01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:31.478
you know. somehow Staci
was there to witness some

01:18:31.512 --> 01:18:33.480
of the horrible things that he

01:18:33.514 --> 01:18:37.351
and I went through and her
being such an amazing artist.

01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:41.021
She was able to capture some
of that raw pain and emotion

01:18:41.054 --> 01:18:44.658
that I had gone through and
was able to put into the song.

01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:48.395
- Oh so y'all like
Jermaine Dupri and Usher

01:18:48.428 --> 01:18:49.530
with the Confessions.

01:18:51.031 --> 01:18:53.700
- I mean. I hadn't thought
about it. but you can say that.

01:18:54.701 --> 01:18:57.538
- All right. now we definitely
have a special treat

01:18:57.571 --> 01:18:59.007
for our listeners.

01:18:59.039 --> 01:19:03.510
First let's get into this
new Staci G song and maybe

01:19:03.544 --> 01:19:06.246
after the commercial break.
we can get into some more tea

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.715
about Will Clay and his
retirement announcement.

01:19:09.884 --> 01:19:10.717
- Maybe.

01:19:15.622 --> 01:19:19.226
(crying)

01:19:25.632 --> 01:19:28.702
(bottle clinking)

01:19:28.735 --> 01:19:32.739
(dramatic piano playing)

01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:38.612
- It's Rod talk to me.

01:19:39.746 --> 01:19:40.581
Rod

01:19:42.082 --> 01:19:44.052
- Bro tell me what I just saw

- Listen Will once the label
offered you the new deal.

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.816
And you turn it down.

01:20:14.849 --> 01:20:17.284
Idiot. What was I supposed to
do?

01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:19.453
- Keep my career in your hands.

01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:20.922
(Will) <i>Fight for me dog.</i>

01:20:20.955 --> 01:20:21.956
You ain't never heard of that?

01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:24.257
- You were supposed to fight for
me.

01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:26.760
- Will listen the only
time that I throw my hands

01:20:26.793 --> 01:20:28.295

01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:30.697
And right now the money is with

01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:49.449

01:20:59.159 --> 01:21:00.494
- Get off my line nigga.

01:21:05.198 --> 01:21:07.200
(bottle clinking)

01:21:07.234 --> 01:21:12.006
(jazz music playing in
background)

01:21:25.853 --> 01:21:28.689
(phone ringing)

01:21:30.925 --> 01:21:32.060
- What the hell do you want?

01:21:32.093 --> 01:21:32.994
- I've been trying to reach you
for weeks

01:21:33.027 --> 01:21:34.829
there's been a huge problem.

01:21:34.862 --> 01:21:36.329
What the hell happened now?

01:21:36.363 --> 01:21:37.731
God damn!

01:21:37.764 --> 01:21:39.733
I was looking through your
accounts and notice a lot

01:21:39.766 --> 01:21:42.870
of inconsistencies and your
taxes haven't been paid either.

01:21:42.904 --> 01:21:44.538
I signed a check every month.

01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:47.075
Kiaira and Rodney supposed
to be paying that.

01:21:47.108 --> 01:21:49.010
Come on man. it's just.
you've got this wrong.

01:21:49.043 --> 01:21:50.845
You need to talk to Kiaira and
Rodney.

01:21:50.878 --> 01:21:52.345
I see the checks have been
cashed

01:21:52.379 --> 01:21:53.513
but they were made

01:21:53.547 --> 01:21:56.416
out to a company called I.R.S.

01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:58.251
Looks like a shell company.

01:21:58.285 --> 01:21:59.854
Since you didn't make
arrangements

01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:02.355
and you haven't returned
my calls for a month.

01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:03.690
the feds are going to be

01:22:03.724 --> 01:22:06.027
at your home tomorrow
morning to cease property.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.729
(crying)

01:22:10.064 --> 01:22:10.898
- Will?

01:22:11.933 --> 01:22:12.766

01:22:13.734 --> 01:22:14.568
You okay?

Are you there?

01:22:16.904 --> 01:22:17.738

01:22:18.906 --> 01:22:22.776
(jazz music continues)

01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:25.746
(screams)

01:22:30.283 --> 01:22:32.086
What did I do?

01:22:34.956 --> 01:22:36.256
- God I'm sorry

01:22:37.959 --> 01:22:39.160
I'm sorry.

01:22:46.134 --> 01:22:48.335
(somber piano plays)

01:22:49.937 --> 01:22:52.439
(coughing)

01:22:59.847 --> 01:23:03.117
(jazz music continues)

01:23:07.487 --> 01:23:11.125
(coughing)

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.607
- You what it do?

01:23:30.812 --> 01:23:32.146
- Yeah I'm good.

01:23:33.881 --> 01:23:35.817
I need a place to stay

01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.819
It's a long story.

01:23:37.852 --> 01:23:38.953
I don't feel like explaining.

01:23:38.986 --> 01:23:40.620

01:23:40.654 --> 01:23:42.290

I'm Rodney baby.

01:30:10.444 --> 01:30:13.347
- Chile Will Clay was
not playing that's exact

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:15.683
that was some five heartbeat
stuff first of all.

01:30:15.715 --> 01:30:17.851
that's how Bird should
have ran up on Big Red.

01:30:17.885 --> 01:30:20.221
When Rodney looked up. he
looked like he saw a ghost.

01:30:20.254 --> 01:30:23.723
- Man if somebody stole my
money. slept with my girl

01:30:23.756 --> 01:30:26.427
and then gave certain media
members dirt.

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:27.461
- All your dirt.

01:30:27.494 --> 01:30:28.795
- And I would've beat that ass
too.

01:30:28.829 --> 01:30:31.532
And you can tell what was
emotional from the rip

01:30:31.565 --> 01:30:33.534
- Hold on did you just give
an exclusive without giving

01:30:33.567 --> 01:30:34.868
an exclusive.

01:30:34.902 --> 01:30:37.037
And you gloss over that
little thing a little bit

01:30:37.071 --> 01:30:39.873
Sounds like you just gave up
your source

01:30:39.907 --> 01:30:41.709
- It should be public knowledge
by now.

01:30:41.741 --> 01:30:44.278
I mean. at least every news
outlet.

01:30:44.311 --> 01:30:47.780
Know that you. all you have
to do is give your boy Rodney

01:30:47.815 --> 01:30:50.718
a bag for some dirt on the Clay
camp.

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:54.722
- Damn but they have been doing
my man's foul all this time.

01:30:54.754 --> 01:30:56.724
Speaking of. did you see this
GoFundMe

01:31:11.972 --> 01:31:13.407
But you can't help. but see

of friends that you need.

01:31:15.976 --> 01:31:17.111
The ones that's gonna ride

you wrong.

01:31:18.345 --> 01:31:20.581
- True you know what?

01:31:20.614 --> 01:31:22.249
I've been a little harsh.

01:31:22.283 --> 01:31:24.585
I'll give them a pass
for this small thing.

01:31:24.618 --> 01:31:25.953
Do you think I should give him a
pass?

01:31:25.986 --> 01:31:27.288
- Please give this man a
pass he been through enough.

01:31:27.321 --> 01:31:28.656
- I'm gonna tell you why
I'm gonna give him a pass

01:31:28.689 --> 01:31:30.424
because I like how he took it
back

01:31:30.457 --> 01:31:32.092
to the streets on this case.

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:33.827
- You know he ain't
from nobody streets.

01:31:34.862 --> 01:31:36.330
He looked like he was.

01:31:36.363 --> 01:31:38.332
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

How about we write together?

01:34:00.607 --> 01:34:02.743
Like we used to do when we were
teenagers.

01:34:02.776 --> 01:34:05.145
- Really. you want to write with
me?

01:34:06.113 --> 01:34:07.080
I'm all rusty.

01:34:07.114 --> 01:34:08.917
- Stop it can't be that bad.

01:34:08.949 --> 01:34:09.983

Let's do it.

01:34:10.951 --> 01:34:11.785
Alright

01:34:12.786 --> 01:34:13.587

01:34:20.794 --> 01:34:25.265
- I missed this Will with us
having fun. writing. singing...

01:34:25.299 --> 01:34:26.800
- Like the good old days.

01:34:26.835 --> 01:34:29.102
Back when we didn't have
no cares in the world.

01:34:29.136 --> 01:34:31.972
- Just family. fun and friends

01:34:32.005 --> 01:34:32.941
- Running through the streets.

01:34:32.973 --> 01:34:34.641
Broken pencils. torn up

01:34:34.675 --> 01:34:36.109
notebooks writing so much.

01:34:36.143 --> 01:34:38.645
- Yeah we used to run the
streets so much together.

01:34:41.482 --> 01:34:43.952
- If only we could catch
that lightning in a bottle

01:34:43.984 --> 01:34:45.486
Like you always wanted.

01:34:45.519 --> 01:34:47.120
- Nothing's better than this
moment.

01:34:47.154 --> 01:34:48.188
Right here.

01:34:48.222 --> 01:34:49.056
Right now

01:34:50.324 --> 01:34:52.493
- That energy we used
to have. that chemistry

01:34:55.028 --> 01:34:56.163
Think we can get that back.

01:34:57.164 --> 01:34:59.399
So raw. so honest.

01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:02.469
- I don't know.

01:35:02.503 --> 01:35:04.671
Are you still a wild child at
heart

01:35:06.206 --> 01:35:08.475
Are you willing to explore

01:35:08.509 --> 01:35:09.643
Love.

01:35:09.676 --> 01:35:10.511
Cry...

bad days. but you got

01:35:25.425 --> 01:35:27.327
to promise me one thing.

01:35:27.361 --> 01:35:28.662
- What's that?

01:35:28.695 --> 01:35:30.030
- You're going to do some
therapy.

01:35:30.063 --> 01:35:31.866
Okay so that you can love you

01:35:34.535 --> 01:35:36.036

01:35:39.373 --> 01:35:44.278
(R&B music plays)

01:35:58.759 --> 01:36:00.394

I don't know what to say to him.

01:36:08.468 --> 01:36:09.803
You got to think about it.

01:36:09.837 --> 01:36:11.071
You know. I've been holding

01:36:14.741 --> 01:36:16.376

01:37:55.342 --> 01:37:56.543

01:39:29.003 --> 01:39:30.938
And I want the Celestial
Seasonings

01:39:30.972 --> 01:39:32.739
the traditional medicinals.

01:39:32.773 --> 01:39:33.941
I want all of it.

01:39:35.275 --> 01:39:36.777

- It feels good to have
you back home again.

01:39:54.028 --> 01:39:55.629
I knew you'd be back here
eventually.

01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:59.499
- Can't lie to you. I've
been running from this place

01:39:59.533 --> 01:40:03.971
for a long time man just
out fear of what you and mom

01:40:04.005 --> 01:40:06.140
was going to think about me.

01:40:06.174 --> 01:40:08.542
- So that's why you been
sending me to voicemail.

01:40:11.645 --> 01:40:15.448
Well. hey I didn't bring
you back here to scold you

01:40:15.482 --> 01:40:16.284
or beat you down even more than
you've

01:40:16.316 --> 01:40:17.684
been doing in the news.

01:40:18.518 --> 01:40:19.553
I really just wanted to

01:40:19.586 --> 01:40:22.290
look at you in the eyes to see
if you

01:40:22.322 --> 01:40:26.160
learned something and you're
ready for real change now.

01:40:27.661 --> 01:40:29.997
- I am.

01:40:30.031 --> 01:40:34.001
Man. I hurt a lot of people

01:40:37.171 --> 01:40:41.175
I've burned and I've been
burned by those I love

01:40:43.677 --> 01:40:47.480
but. I'm ready I think I'm
ready to make that change.

01:40:47.514 --> 01:40:49.317
- You think or you know?

01:40:49.349 --> 01:40:50.383
- I know.

01:40:50.417 --> 01:40:52.820
- Good. whatever you've done in
the past

01:40:52.854 --> 01:40:54.188
you need to leave it there.

01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:56.489
All right.

01:40:56.523 --> 01:40:59.693
You taking responsibility for
your actions

01:41:01.195 --> 01:41:03.197
but you can't hold on to that.
that guilt

01:41:03.231 --> 01:41:06.566
and shame that you're feeling.

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.535
Because it'll eat you up inside

01:41:08.568 --> 01:41:10.872
and it'll destroy everything you
touch.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:16.911
You gained the world and
now you've experienced

01:41:16.944 --> 01:41:19.847
what it's like to lose your
soul.

01:41:19.881 --> 01:41:22.716
It's time to let Jesus.

01:41:25.052 --> 01:41:27.587
restore it for you. rebuild it.

01:41:27.621 --> 01:41:29.357
We didn't pull all that word
unto you

01:41:29.389 --> 01:41:30.523
when you were growing up just

01:41:30.557 --> 01:41:31.859
for you not to have it available

01:41:31.893 --> 01:41:33.727
to you when you need it the
most.

01:41:34.728 --> 01:41:37.530
- Dad man you don't even know

01:41:37.564 --> 01:41:39.867
how relieved that makes me feel.

01:41:39.901 --> 01:41:41.302
I've been ashamed of myself.

01:41:42.402 --> 01:41:45.739
people pleasing and
protecting a false image

01:41:47.141 --> 01:41:48.742
I thought because I wasn't from
a bad area

01:41:49.944 --> 01:41:52.046
or didn't have bad parents
that I had to make this image.

01:41:52.079 --> 01:41:53.747
Just to make people like me.

01:41:55.917 --> 01:41:57.385
- Listen son. you need
to take pride in the fact

01:41:57.417 --> 01:42:02.422
that you didn't do that and
know that we're behind you

01:42:03.157 --> 01:42:08.062
no matter what. even when
you act like a heathen.

01:42:08.095 --> 01:42:10.730
(laughter)

01:42:10.764 --> 01:42:12.233

feelings

01:42:22.343 --> 01:42:24.577
