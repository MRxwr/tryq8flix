Are you there?

Hey. the link is at 75%.

Perfect. done. lock it off.

197
00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:12.939
- It's a backup plan.

Okay.

Okay. he's in.

an internal test. sir.

about?

about an objective change?

got this.

We told them that the comm
modules weren't sitting tightly.

with the modules.

slightly exaggerated. okay?

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.742
Look it. in layman's terms.
they have two brains. okay?

317
00:17:33.983 --> 00:17:36.745
One is the module that caps
their artificial intelligence.

00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:39.092
that allows us to communicate
with them.

319
00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:41.163
The module also allows
them to make the best

decisions in the field possible.

off a cliff or not.

We can set objectives.

whatever it is that we want them
to do.

326
00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:57.041
but. ultimately. they will
decide

327
00:17:57.283 --> 00:17:58.836
the best and most efficient way

328
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.183
of doing what it is
that we want them to do.

329
00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:02.978
- So they make their own
decisions?

330
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.359
- Yeah. pretty much.

331
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.052
I mean. look it. these robots
have full-blown AI. okay?

332

of us.

autism.

in the real world. okay?

337
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.687
They can walk around aimlessly.

trying to figure out
what the hell they are.

339
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:26.657
but they're not gonna learn
much in the middle of a jungle.

That's why we've never
let them self-learn.

why

342
00:18:30.937 --> 00:18:32.490
we've kept them off the grid

technical and acutely autistic

best.

352
00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:55.237
And

353
00:18:58.585 --> 00:18:59.448
done.

354
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.863
- You think this is a fucking
joke?

You do understand that.
if this mission fails.

356
00:19:05.213 --> 00:19:06.214
and you get caught. you could
end up

1107

We have to start making some

I don't have enough assets in

I recommend you call in drone
support.

1116
01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:12.262
we wipe this area clean.

1117
01:04:12.503 --> 01:04:14.643
- Listen. this op is off the
grid.

1118
01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:16.749
If I start making calls for
drone support.

1119
01:04:16.991 --> 01:04:18.924
we're gonna have a lot
bigger problems to deal with.

1120
01:04:19.165 --> 01:04:20.511
- [Kroger] We have their
positions.

1121
01:04:20.753 --> 01:04:22.444
- I'll call you right back.

1122
01:04:22.686 --> 01:04:24.067
- We tracked the BR1 to the
site.

1123
01:04:24.308 --> 01:04:25.137
BR2 is en route.

1124
01:04:25.378 --> 01:04:28.002
- That kid had a module in his
hand.

1125
01:04:28.243 --> 01:04:29.175
Does it have a GPS beacon?

1126
01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:30.349
- [Kroger] It does.

1127
01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.626
- Then why haven't we been
tracking that?

1128
01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.834
- Well. we didn't know the kid
had it!

1129
01:04:33.076 --> 01:04:34.111
We've been using the GPS tracker

1130
01:04:34.353 --> 01:04:35.837

1131
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.528
We thought that the module
was still attached to the BR4

1132
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.220
so we just never thought
of that as an option.

1133
01:04:39.461 --> 01:04:40.911
So it just never came to mind.

1134
01:04:41.981 --> 01:04:43.258

1135
01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.092
- Look. the whole point of this
exercise

1136
01:04:49.333 --> 01:04:51.370
was to see how reliable your
assets are

1137
01:04:51.611 --> 01:04:53.130
in a real life situation.

1138
01:04:53.372 --> 01:04:54.683
Now I've got people on
both sides of the fence

1139
01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:55.926
looking in on this. and. so far.

1140
01:04:56.168 --> 01:04:58.964
all we have is an unarmed Navy
SEAL

of them with a sledgehammer!

1142
01:05:01.311 --> 01:05:03.520
- That sledgehammer didn't stop
our asset.

1143
01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:05.384
A very large explosive booby
trap did.

1144

Not to mention. your intel
on the site was incorrect.

1149
01:05:15.773 --> 01:05:17.534
Having seven US civilians in the
zone

1150
01:05:17.775 --> 01:05:19.743
was not part of our test
parameters.

1151
01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:22.263
- All right. I'll figure
out how to clean this up.

1152
01:05:22.504 --> 01:05:23.885
But your people have to
figure out how to control it

1153
01:05:24.127 --> 01:05:25.093

the camp.

- 20 to 30 minutes.

- Does BR3 have a lock on Four?

1159

- There's an intermittent
signal. but getting close.

1160

- How close?

1161
01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.421
- BR2 is in the blast zone.

1162
01:05:42.662 --> 01:05:44.285
BR3 has a lock on BR4.

1163
01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:45.907
They're close.
