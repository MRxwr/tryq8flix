00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.325
(were safe and well taken care of throughout the shoot.)

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:29.825
He would've used all of his energy even if it killed him.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.636
So he probably doesn't remember who he is by now.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.769
Zi O. you punk.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.070
He's back.

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:37.879
We're doing our best to bring him in.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.509
Run away.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.975
Don't do it!

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.780
This may be a great opportunity.

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.575
You know this is your last chance. don't you?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.379
Whichever of the two is alive is the murder suspect.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.215
(Previously on "L.U.C.A.: The Beginning")

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.990
We've met. haven't we?

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.089
I remember exactly who you are.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.530
So you'd better remember...

00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:00.759
what happened to my parents.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.129
But he won't die. right?

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.030
He can still die if he's in critical condition.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.965
If he died. bring me his body. In the freshest state possible.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.139
He ran away.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.176
He was dying. but he got up...

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.446
The weak cells probably died. and only the strong cells survived.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.119
I've been waiting for you. What did I do to you?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.446
I'm the one with questions.

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:58.559
We'll be back. Gu Reum.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.059
Stay home alone for just a little while.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.556
Where are you going?

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.795
We won't take long. It'll take less than an hour.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.655
Let's go eat tonkatsu for lunch.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.266
Mom.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.905
My baby. let's go eat something more delicious than tonkatsu.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.736
Like what?

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.945
Whatever you want. Your dad will buy it for you.

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:32.056
We'll see you later.

00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:34.746
Search carefully.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.576
Darn it.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:08.815
Guys.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.755
Gu Reum is in trouble.

00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.930
She either got kidnapped or went missing.

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:16.690
Restrict all the entrances of the adjoining subway stations...

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.229

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.625

00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:57.385
- Move! - Grab one!

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.866
- My gosh! - Hurry!

00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:15.505
- Let's go! - Move!

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.315
Hurry up!

00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.846
Is this really possible?

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.955
No. it's impossible.

00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:27.520
This is totally insane.

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:29.056
This is a mixture of everything.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.599
He has the DNA of humans. immortal jellyfish.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.926
electric eels. and even flies.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.265
Do you think this is genome editing?

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.065
It's impossible to edit all these genes together at once.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.440
Unless they put all these animals into a blender...

00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.039
and combined them all together.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.435
That means they manipulated the germ cells.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.976
Regardless of whether this is possible or not. it's illegal.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.950
What kind of lunatic would do that kind of experiment?

00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:57.885
No one I know of. Except for one person.

00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.955
Who?

00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:01.856
Professor Ryu Jeung Kwon.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:03.856
"Ryu Jeung Kwon"?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.926
You mean the guy who lost his one arm?

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:10.226
- You know him? - Of course.

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.270
He got kicked out of school and arrested...

00:07:12.271 --> 00:07:14.695
because of the genetic modification experiment he did.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.409
Gosh. he's known to be a real psycho in this field.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.775
He's a complete lunatic.

00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:21.476
We went to college together.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.010
He used to be my best friend.

(National Forensic Service)

00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:29.246
Oh. I see. I'm sorry.

00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:30.945
You don't need to apologize.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.015
I was the one who told people that he was crazy...

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:36.486
and suggested that he should get kicked out of school.

("When Will the Skies Collect Those Who Are Broken Inside?")

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.866
Come on! Hurry!

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.805
Let's get out of here!

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.846
Aren't you hungry?

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.675
What? We're all doing this to make a living.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.446
Cut it out. This is serious.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.520
What's more serious than having to eat when you're hungry?

00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:11.655
Hey.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.655
Let's go.

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:27.836
Everyone makes at least one big mistake in life.

00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:30.736
For instance. they commit murder. steal. do drugs. or get married.

00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:34.505
But you've already made a big mistake.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.880
You were bound to rot in jail. but I got you out.

00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:38.816
Then you should've made sure not to make another mistake.

00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.220
I apologize.

00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:42.620
An apology isn't going to cut it.

00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:43.689
I can find him.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.590
Where? How?

00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:48.015
And don't say you're going to wait until he shows up again.

00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:50.186
He disappeared with...

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.630
the female cop that followed us at the hospital.

00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:54.659
The cops are probably looking for her.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.596
If we're able to keep track of their investigation records.

00:09:57.101 --> 00:09:58.795
we'll be able to find them before they do.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.970
What if he just left that cop and ran away by himself?

00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:06.135
If he left her there. she would've gotten hit by the subway.

00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:08.645
But he came and saved her.

00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:11.875
He would've run.

00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:14.175
I've never seen him save someone before.

00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:17.915
I'll get you the investigation records. so find him.

00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:23.625
If you do this right. I'll let you retire.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.755
You can't live here forever.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.625
You should live in a house that has windows and a garden.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.566
You can also get yourself a dog.

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:35.135
But don't get married.

00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:37.466
It only causes trouble.

00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:42.905
I need to get shots every two weeks anyway.

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.045
I can't leave this place even if I want to.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.545
I'm sure we can find a way.

00:10:49.991 --> 00:10:53.155
If you find Zi O. I'll give you one of his arms.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.555
You know we can transplant his body onto yours.

00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:59.755
Will you really do that for me?

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.125
What would be so difficult about giving you an arm?

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.035
Solving a single problem could lead everything else to fall into place.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.135
Once we take care of this. everything else will be minuscule.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.035
You'd better catch him this time.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.305
If you fail to catch him again.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.946
it'll make me start questioning your competence.

I tried to stop your bleeding. but I'm not sure if it's healed.

00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:34.555
You hurt your head. Take it easy.

00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:36.826
That's the last thing I'll do with you.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.836
(Handle with care)

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.635
That's enough.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.375
Just tell me what you know about me.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.905
You said you know me.

00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:01.015
If you want to know. you tell me first.

00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:03.246
Tell me what you remember.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.726
Someone collapsed.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.895
I remember saving her.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.706
I think it was you. but I'm not sure.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.040
Thank you for saving my life.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.145
There. You happy?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.976
What else do you remember?

00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:32.419
I don't remember anything else.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.151
I woke up at the hospital and ran until I got here.

00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:35.285
That's all I remember.

00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:37.246
Who were those guys who chased after you at the subway station?

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:38.861
- I don't know. - Do you remember...

00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:39.956
falling from the rooftop?

00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:42.356
What about Mr. Kim's death?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.856
Who's Mr. Kim?

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.696
Did you hurt your head?

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.366
Tell me what you know.

00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:54.895
Move.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.795
Don't you feel safe enough to tell me now?

(Juan Metropolitan Police Agency)

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.500
I wonder who he was...

00:14:56.501 --> 00:14:58.265
considering they came all the way to the hospital to kill him.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.836
They probably wanted to get rid of the witness of a murder incident.

00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:05.740
But he broke his back.

00:15:05.741 --> 00:15:07.736
How did he suddenly get up and run away?

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.850
Maybe it was someone else's X-ray.

00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:11.380
Maybe he was fine to begin with.

00:15:11.381 --> 00:15:14.045
Sir. aren't you suspicious as well?

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:17.645
I'm more shocked that people kill their own parents for money.

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:20.060
And how could they be cruel enough to kidnap and bury those kids?

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.120
That's what I don't get.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:23.956
My gosh. why are you suddenly acting so humane?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.395
Listen. you punk.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.566
The moment you think it's okay to kill parents and kids.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.895
you lose your right to be human.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.466
I know that.

00:15:34.771 --> 00:15:37.265
But it's weird that you're being like this all of a sudden.

00:15:38.011 --> 00:15:39.206
Are you planning to run for an election?

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.400
- Yes. I did. - See? What did I tell you?

Shortly after the fire incident was reported.

00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:04.125
a vehicle in the vicinity was reported stolen.

"22G 7801". A silver sedan.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.005
I've put out an APB.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.866
Okay. thanks.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.110
See? It's not like he could've carried Gu Reum on his back.

00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:18.076
He stole a vehicle and managed to escape.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.816
Only seasoned veterans like me can figure out this much.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.686
Well done. Great job.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.686
Now. comb through the CCTV footage and locate that vehicle.

Wait. you want me to do that?

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.625
Captain.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.366
Goodness. Can't he get the juniors to do it?

00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:40.340
The police are trying to locate the stolen vehicle now.

00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:41.936
Wait in the car.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.905
How can you...

00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:51.005
not remember anything?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.880
I do remember some things. but I don't know what they are.

00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.590
I don't even know if they're my memories.

00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:56.746
Then...

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.915
how do you remember me?

00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:04.425
I was curious about that too. That's why I saved you.

00:17:09.331 --> 00:17:11.196
Have we met before?

00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:14.835
If there's no one else like you.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.406
then I'm sure it was you.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.019
Hey. turn up the siren...

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.946
if you want to tell the whole world where we're headed.

00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.976
When I was 10.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.906
you came to my house.

00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:00.676
Are you sure it was me?

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.845
Some kind of blue light beamed out of your eyes.

00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:08.285
What's wrong?

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.926
Don't do that.

00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:12.325
Don't! You're scaring me!

00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:16.926
Dad! Dad!

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.835
And it attacked me.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.476
Why did I go to your house?

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.845
That's the question I want to ask.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.486
Why you came to my house and where you went after that.

00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:42.226
How could you make me suffer like this...

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.626
my whole life when you only stayed for a day?

00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:01.176
That was the last time I saw you.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.146
And after that.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.045
my parents disappeared.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.785
I have no recollection of that.

00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:20.055
Not remembering anything doesn't make your past go away.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.126
Do you think I killed them?

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.396
You're certainly capable of doing that.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.065
That night.

00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:30.966
I saw an evil monster.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.746
You see. I'm scared of people.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.015
Whenever someone walks up to me. it makes my hair stand on end.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.886
If I were an evil monster. why would I be terrified of people?

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.426
Whether you're evil or not is not up to you to decide.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.560
Hey. let's hurry up.

00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:55.966
Yes. sir.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.805
I'm going to dig through your brain if I have to.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.805
I will do whatever it takes to find out what really happened.

00:20:28.454 --> 00:20:29.650
Someone's here.

00:20:31.095 --> 00:20:32.559
Run. It's him.

00:20:52.306 --> 00:20:53.632
Hey. who are you?

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:56.872
A hitman? A private detective?

00:21:19.796 --> 00:21:20.891
Where is he?

00:21:21.727 --> 00:21:24.132
Even if you guys catch him. he'll end up in my hands eventually.

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:26.132
You cops had better stay out of this.

00:21:28.636 --> 00:21:30.832
You little... Who do you think you are?

00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:48.726
- Be careful who you shoot. - Yes. sir.

00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:50.295
- You three. go that way. - Yes. sir.

00:21:50.296 --> 00:21:51.552
We'll go to the second floor.

00:21:51.826 --> 00:21:52.991
Go!

00:23:10.737 --> 00:23:13.802
You'd better stay away from him. He's mine!

00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:27.921
Over here!

00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:35.092
Gu Reum!

00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:39.931
Gu Reum!

00:23:41.306 --> 00:23:42.632
You scumbag!

00:23:42.977 --> 00:23:44.532
Get him!

00:23:50.046 --> 00:23:51.671
Hey! You piece of...

00:23:52.116 --> 00:23:53.612
Go! Get him!

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:55.751
- Hey. go! - Go!

00:23:57.386 --> 00:24:00.122
Hey. are you all right?

00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:02.395
You're okay. right?

00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:03.822
Stay right here.

00:24:25.017 --> 00:24:27.842
7pm. here.

00:24:48.106 --> 00:24:49.605
He's fast.

00:24:49.606 --> 00:24:50.971
- He's not there? - No.

00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:55.001
Keep looking.

00:24:55.277 --> 00:24:56.411
Yes. sir.

00:24:57.277 --> 00:24:59.141
You go that way.

00:25:00.346 --> 00:25:01.441
Hey.

00:25:02.787 --> 00:25:04.082
Are you really okay?

00:25:04.687 --> 00:25:05.782
Yes.

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:08.382
How did you find me?

00:25:12.596 --> 00:25:13.792
Were you abducted?

00:25:14.227 --> 00:25:16.065
I passed out while fighting on the subway track.

00:25:16.066 --> 00:25:17.666
and this was where I was when I woke up.

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:18.862
Let's see your arm.

00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:21.961
- What? - Show me your arm.

00:25:29.277 --> 00:25:31.575
- There's no restraint mark. - No.

00:25:31.576 --> 00:25:33.145
How many abducting and kidnapping cases...

00:25:33.146 --> 00:25:35.115
do you think I've worked on over the years?

00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:36.286
Is this a quiz?

00:25:36.287 --> 00:25:39.651
Be it abduction or kidnapping. the victim always says. "Thank you."

00:25:40.626 --> 00:25:42.181
But do you know what the perp says?

00:25:43.697 --> 00:25:46.322
- What? - "How did you find us?"

00:25:47.896 --> 00:25:49.092
And that's what you said.

00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:53.466
Why won't you answer me?

00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:55.201
You majored in talking back.

00:25:56.007 --> 00:25:58.105
- Do you suspect me? - Yes.

00:25:58.106 --> 00:25:59.971
Oh my...

00:26:00.507 --> 00:26:03.072
Are you saying I abducted myself?

00:26:09.917 --> 00:26:11.782
I'm not hiding anything.

00:26:12.757 --> 00:26:14.622
- Are you sure? - Yes.

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:15.926
Really?

00:26:15.927 --> 00:26:18.691
What about you? Are you hiding something?

00:26:18.826 --> 00:26:20.491
- What would I hide? - Well.

00:26:20.727 --> 00:26:22.832
you won't say how you found me.

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:26.532
Is it a trade secret?

00:26:34.576 --> 00:26:35.875
Something happened. didn't it?

00:26:35.876 --> 00:26:37.542
I don't know. I was unconscious.

00:26:38.816 --> 00:26:40.181
Something happened to you. didn't it?

00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:43.151
That's why you keep hiding it.

00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:47.951
I'll get you a female officer to handle it. so tell the truth.

00:26:48.927 --> 00:26:50.221
We'll keep it confidential.

00:26:52.596 --> 00:26:56.032
Seriously. you have one wild imagination.

00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.966
- No? - No.

00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:01.562
- I don't think so. - I said no.

00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:06.802
That's a relief then.

00:27:10.876 --> 00:27:12.141
Are you hanging out?

00:27:13.447 --> 00:27:14.582
Are you?

00:27:16.086 --> 00:27:17.612
Did you check every corner?

00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:19.322
We looked everywhere. There's nobody here.

00:27:20.287 --> 00:27:22.382
- No one at all. - Those rats.

00:27:26.326 --> 00:27:27.862
Put out an APB. and let's wrap up.

00:27:28.267 --> 00:27:29.762
- Yes. sir. - Let's go.

00:27:30.136 --> 00:27:31.332
Let's go.

00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:45.812
Are you sure he didn't leave?

00:27:47.646 --> 00:27:49.012
I didn't see him leave.

00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:58.595
Zi O treated that girl?

00:27:58.596 --> 00:27:59.921
It's more than that.

00:28:00.967 --> 00:28:03.062
I felt like he was protecting her.

00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:05.792
If they protect each other.

00:28:05.796 --> 00:28:07.501
they'll definitely meet again.

00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:13.201
Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum. Police Academy grad.

00:28:13.507 --> 00:28:15.545
She was with Major Crimes. but was demoted...

00:28:15.546 --> 00:28:17.446
to Criminal for insubordination.

00:28:17.447 --> 00:28:18.776
(Parents went missing)

00:28:18.777 --> 00:28:21.085
There's nothing unusual except for her parents going missing.

00:28:21.086 --> 00:28:23.651
That's what's unusual. Her father is Ha Young Jae.

00:28:24.517 --> 00:28:25.615
Ha Young Jae?

00:28:25.616 --> 00:28:28.251
The co-founder of this lab and researcher.

00:28:28.487 --> 00:28:30.491
The person who created Z-0.

00:28:37.437 --> 00:28:40.305
If he hadn't taken off with the lab notes and Z-0.

00:28:40.306 --> 00:28:42.302
we wouldn't be in this mess.

00:28:42.507 --> 00:28:44.001
You couldn't catch him back then?

00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:45.731
Is he really missing?

00:28:59.957 --> 00:29:01.651
We have your wife.

00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:04.221
Talk. or she dies.

00:29:06.096 --> 00:29:07.491
Do you want to make your daughter a children's home?

00:29:08.267 --> 00:29:09.532
I wouldn't know.

00:29:10.796 --> 00:29:12.731
He and his wife disappeared.

00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:15.161
Was it Z-0?

00:29:18.136 --> 00:29:20.141
It's highly probable.

00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:25.272
I'll take care of the cops.

00:29:26.687 --> 00:29:28.211
so mark the female detective.

00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:29.681
Yes. sir.

00:29:42.796 --> 00:29:46.661
(Fire at Subway Station)

00:29:54.662 --> 00:29:59.662
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E03 'L.U.C.A.: The Beginning'</font>

<font color="#ff0080">-â¥ Ruo Xi â¥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:09.522
Can we meet right now?

00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:18.991
Why? Do I look pretty?

00:30:19.237 --> 00:30:20.666
Why do you look so terrible?

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:22.431
I'm a detective.

00:30:23.177 --> 00:30:24.776
So you should've been more obedient.

00:30:24.777 --> 00:30:26.241
Why are you suffering there?

00:30:26.477 --> 00:30:28.542
It would've been much easier digging into people.

00:30:28.557 --> 00:30:30.925
I wasn't kicked out for being disobedient.

00:30:30.926 --> 00:30:32.062
Then?

00:30:32.327 --> 00:30:34.461
I dug into my direct supervisor.

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:37.266
He was so dirty.

00:30:37.267 --> 00:30:39.102
You kept at it even after you were told to stop. didn't you?

00:30:39.436 --> 00:30:41.731
- Yes. - That's insubordination.

00:30:41.977 --> 00:30:43.741
Did you call me here to scold me?

00:30:44.106 --> 00:30:46.342
That too. And to ask for a favor.

00:30:46.946 --> 00:30:49.011
A personal favor is fine. but not special treatment.

00:30:51.446 --> 00:30:53.152
Find a person for me.

00:30:54.116 --> 00:30:55.355
That sounds like special treatment.

00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:56.682
Remember that guy...

00:30:57.126 --> 00:30:59.451
who was fighting for his life in the hospital. then fled?

00:31:00.696 --> 00:31:02.991
His name was Zi O. I believe?

00:31:04.297 --> 00:31:07.761
I analyzed his DNA. and it was strange.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.705
In what way?

00:31:10.706 --> 00:31:12.605
I don't know if you'll believe me...

00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:14.201
- I'll believe you. - What?

00:31:15.106 --> 00:31:16.301
Anything.

00:31:18.047 --> 00:31:19.941
It's not very believable.

00:31:20.676 --> 00:31:24.041
but it seems he's human but not human.

00:31:24.317 --> 00:31:25.441
What?

00:31:25.886 --> 00:31:27.112
How do I put it?

00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:30.481
I can't say he's human.

00:31:32.227 --> 00:31:34.855
- A mutant? - No. nothing like that.

00:31:34.856 --> 00:31:36.226
Does he have supernatural powers?

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:39.761
If certain abilities excel. that could be supernatural.

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.791
But we can't tell just from the DNA.

00:31:44.007 --> 00:31:46.031
Then what's weird?

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.271
We need to run tests to figure that out.

00:31:49.547 --> 00:31:51.172
You want me to find Zi O?

00:31:51.507 --> 00:31:54.142
That's your case. so you can handle that.

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:58.182
Ryu Jeung Kwon. My college friend.

00:31:58.717 --> 00:32:01.016
It should be easy for you to find him.

00:32:01.017 --> 00:32:02.781
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

00:32:03.287 --> 00:32:05.586
- That's why I'm asking you. - Did he go missing?

00:32:05.587 --> 00:32:07.195
No one reported him missing.

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:08.655
He can't be located. is more accurate.

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:10.422
His family didn't report him missing?

00:32:10.767 --> 00:32:13.592
They had cut ties with him.

00:32:13.997 --> 00:32:15.862
so it's understandable.

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:17.261
What happened?

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:18.902
During the last association meeting.

00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:22.132
he gave a presentation.

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:24.372
That caused a bit of a problem.

00:32:24.846 --> 00:32:28.216
Humans realized how unstable they were.

00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:32.412
However. they made the wrong choice in order to overcome that.

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:35.812
Rather than becoming stronger. they built machines.

00:32:36.186 --> 00:32:39.082
Rather than developing their brains. they built computers.

00:32:39.456 --> 00:32:42.551
Soon. there will come a time when we leave the world to machines.

00:32:43.067 --> 00:32:45.961
and thinking to AI.

00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:53.076
Humans chose technology over evolution.

00:32:53.077 --> 00:32:55.701
The result? Technology is developing.

00:32:56.077 --> 00:32:59.441
but humans are regressing.

00:33:01.017 --> 00:33:04.682
It wasn't the passion of a young scientist. but lunacy.

00:33:04.747 --> 00:33:06.655
He's right though.

00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:08.286
He may be.

00:33:08.287 --> 00:33:10.721
Since some supported him fanatically.

00:33:10.927 --> 00:33:15.692
Humans became the only species to choose to stop evolution.

00:33:15.856 --> 00:33:18.625
Evolution is change. and change is life.

00:33:18.626 --> 00:33:20.792
A species that stops evolution becomes extinct.

00:33:21.337 --> 00:33:23.765
In order to prevent the extinction of mankind.

00:33:23.766 --> 00:33:25.736
we must enhance evolution...

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:27.732
and keep our species alive.

00:33:28.876 --> 00:33:31.942
- He's a psycho. - He has lost his mind.

00:33:32.746 --> 00:33:34.011
He's weird.

00:33:35.876 --> 00:33:37.341
The ethics of research!

00:33:38.387 --> 00:33:42.312
We must realize that we're watching humans regress!

00:33:43.556 --> 00:33:46.852
The value of science is not ethics or morals.

00:33:48.856 --> 00:33:50.091
It's taking on new challenges!

00:33:51.666 --> 00:33:53.332
That's nonsense.

00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:00.805
Immediately thereafter.

00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:02.636
the academy asked for my opinion.

00:34:02.637 --> 00:34:06.176
I used everything I had to criticize him.

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:08.375
My report was chosen.

00:34:08.376 --> 00:34:11.346
and he was expelled for violating the ethics of research.

00:34:11.347 --> 00:34:12.781
They cut his funding.

00:34:13.956 --> 00:34:17.252
He was arrested a few months later. and then his family left him.

00:34:17.527 --> 00:34:18.955
Why was he arrested?

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:21.526
Embezzling research funds. Trafficking of human eggs...

00:34:21.527 --> 00:34:22.821
and endangered animals.

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:25.596
He insisted he was innocent.

00:34:25.597 --> 00:34:28.332
but it looked like people wanted him executed.

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:31.401
Was it that serious?

00:34:33.177 --> 00:34:36.301
For example. what if you merged a human with a dog...

00:34:36.746 --> 00:34:39.301
to create a human with a keen sense of smell?

00:34:39.947 --> 00:34:43.281
What if you mix a human and a bird to create a human that can fly?

00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:44.786
What if you add the fish DNA to a human...

00:34:44.786 --> 00:34:46.611
and a baby with gills is born?

00:34:46.956 --> 00:34:49.415
A man who can produce a powerful current like an electric eel...

00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:51.752
or shoots out potent venom like a jellyfish does.

00:34:52.456 --> 00:34:53.551
Can you call that man human?

00:34:54.097 --> 00:34:55.921
What are the boundaries of mankind?

00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:58.361
He didn't stop at just believing in such a possibility.

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:02.162
Jeung Kwon was actually working on it.

00:35:03.137 --> 00:35:06.102
We kept it from the media because it was so shocking.

00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:09.131
but they seized a chimera when they were searching his lab.

00:35:10.447 --> 00:35:11.872
What is a chimera?

00:35:13.976 --> 00:35:15.872
An organism made up of cells from different animals.

00:35:16.117 --> 00:35:17.912
Human cells could be combined with animal cells.

00:35:31.467 --> 00:35:32.597
That's insane.

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:33.732
Insane. indeed.

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:36.832
But he disappeared after he got out of jail.

00:35:37.206 --> 00:35:38.966
Some say he moved abroad. Others say he killed himself.

00:35:38.967 --> 00:35:40.176
There are all these rumors.

00:35:40.177 --> 00:35:41.971
but no one has seen or met him since his release.

00:35:42.806 --> 00:35:46.872
Are you saying Ryu Jeung Kwon created Zi O?

00:35:47.177 --> 00:35:49.785
- It's just my speculation. - But how likely is it?

00:35:49.786 --> 00:35:50.881
Well...

00:35:51.217 --> 00:35:54.455
The recent gene-editing experiment done by China and the US...

00:35:54.456 --> 00:35:56.486
did succeed in producing children who are immune to HIV.

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:59.386
I'd say it's possible to create any kind of "human".

00:35:59.387 --> 00:36:01.926
You can even inject human germ cells into a pig...

00:36:01.927 --> 00:36:04.192
to grow human organs inside it.

00:36:06.126 --> 00:36:08.436
So it's a pig on the outside but a human on the inside?

00:36:08.436 --> 00:36:09.562
Creepy. right?

00:36:10.206 --> 00:36:12.131
They say science has limits. but not its own.

00:36:12.507 --> 00:36:13.605
Then whose limits are they?

00:36:13.606 --> 00:36:14.935
They're imposed by morality.

00:36:14.936 --> 00:36:17.801
Scientists aren't allowed to take their experiments further.

00:36:18.277 --> 00:36:19.506
So if they break out of that.

00:36:19.507 --> 00:36:21.676
they can take it further? Is that what you're saying?

00:36:21.677 --> 00:36:25.682
Many scientists want to create new living organisms.

00:36:25.916 --> 00:36:28.682
Let's be honest. Who wouldn't want to be like the Almighty?

00:36:28.987 --> 00:36:30.221
Let's say...

00:36:30.786 --> 00:36:32.752
such a creature was born.

00:36:35.356 --> 00:36:37.761
Then can it have the human mind?

00:36:38.097 --> 00:36:39.221
That I don't know.

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:43.502
But its instincts may supersede its feelings or thoughts...

00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:46.062
because it's partially made up of animal cells.

00:36:48.737 --> 00:36:50.772
Then if such creatures grow in number.

00:36:51.177 --> 00:36:53.676
they'll rule all of us ordinary folks. right?

00:36:53.677 --> 00:36:56.245
This world will not be ruled by the strongest.

00:36:56.246 --> 00:36:58.942
but by those who can quickly adapt to change.

00:36:59.146 --> 00:37:01.212
That is why mankind is the ruler of this planet.

00:37:01.317 --> 00:37:04.151
Look at what people are doing. I'm so sick of them.

00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:06.381
You find them in every corner of the earth. no matter how remote.

00:37:07.826 --> 00:37:09.921
You can find Jeung Kwon. right?

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:13.792
I'll do my best.

00:37:21.936 --> 00:37:23.745
(Juan Metropolitan Police Agency)

00:37:23.746 --> 00:37:27.245
Kim. who was hit by the cargo train and died on the spot.

00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:29.671
was formerly employed by the military.

00:37:30.146 --> 00:37:32.816
Kim fled while being investigated...

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:34.881
for military corruption back in 2019.

00:37:35.487 --> 00:37:38.622
Based on his text message which appears to be a suicide note.

00:37:38.726 --> 00:37:40.596
the police are investigating the case.

00:37:40.597 --> 00:37:42.792
weighing the possibility of suicide.

00:37:43.326 --> 00:37:45.796
In the text message. he apologized to...

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:49.392
Hey. we're the police. Who said this is a suicide case?

00:37:49.936 --> 00:37:51.935
- Since finding this message. - Not me.

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:53.935
the police have been having a hard time...

00:37:53.936 --> 00:37:55.676
- I didn't say it either. - due to the location...

00:37:55.677 --> 00:37:57.645
Not a single reporter showed up in our office.

00:37:57.646 --> 00:37:59.502
The platform is sealed off at the moment.

00:38:00.416 --> 00:38:03.171
Do they run stories on the news without actually covering them?

00:38:03.887 --> 00:38:07.412
Hold on. We couldn't access Kim's information in the system.

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:09.812
Who obtained all that info?

00:38:10.157 --> 00:38:12.781
After that. Kim...

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:16.091
Captain. about the subway station case...

00:38:16.496 --> 00:38:18.261
The reporters somehow know what we didn't even know.

00:38:19.266 --> 00:38:21.296
We can't access the victim's info. We sent in a request.

00:38:21.297 --> 00:38:22.665
but they're ignoring our request.

00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:24.801
Just let it go. The case is being transferred.

00:38:25.166 --> 00:38:26.236
What do you mean?

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:28.701
Zi O's case too. They've been transferred to a different precinct.

00:38:29.177 --> 00:38:30.301
Take your hands off it now.

00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:33.046
What? Murder and kidnapping...

00:38:33.047 --> 00:38:35.241
It's a high-profile case. We can't let them take it from us!

00:38:35.447 --> 00:38:37.212
Who got the case? The Regional Investigation Unit?

00:38:37.447 --> 00:38:38.542
No idea.

00:38:39.146 --> 00:38:41.582
I just met with the chief and was told to hand it over.

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:43.111
Hand over all the reports.

00:38:43.726 --> 00:38:45.051
There's none.

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.352
What report?

00:38:48.757 --> 00:38:50.892
We've just been running around. The investigation hasn't even begun.

00:38:51.697 --> 00:38:52.991
Come in.

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.662
Yes. we're here.

00:38:58.766 --> 00:38:59.861
Where's Gu Reum?

00:39:01.337 --> 00:39:03.442
- Is she at the hospital? - I don't know.

00:39:05.306 --> 00:39:07.841
She's being treated. She said she'll be here tomorrow.

00:40:13.007 --> 00:40:14.111
Eat it.

00:40:14.817 --> 00:40:15.912
I got it for you.

00:40:31.097 --> 00:40:33.491
You said there are some memories engraved in your mind.

00:40:40.507 --> 00:40:41.671
A white room.

00:40:42.137 --> 00:40:43.272
A narrow hallway.

00:40:44.606 --> 00:40:46.142
A kid who looks terrified.

00:40:46.376 --> 00:40:48.671
Curtains on fire. Academy Loan.

00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:49.971
The blue land...

00:40:50.817 --> 00:40:51.942
The wind.

00:40:51.987 --> 00:40:53.611
Lastly. your face and my name.

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.252
Any memories of killing someone?

00:41:08.197 --> 00:41:09.292
I don't know.

00:41:11.306 --> 00:41:13.875
Hey. try to bring back your memories.

00:41:13.876 --> 00:41:15.332
Don't just say that you don't know.

00:41:18.007 --> 00:41:20.116
I do remember waking up after being unconscious for a while.

00:41:20.117 --> 00:41:23.412
Although I don't know whether it's only happened once or more.

00:41:24.016 --> 00:41:26.881
When I wake up. everything's always wiped clean.

00:41:28.416 --> 00:41:30.455
So when you regain your consciousness.

00:41:30.456 --> 00:41:31.852
you don't remember anything?

00:41:32.387 --> 00:41:33.821
That's right. except for a few things.

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.921
How convenient.

00:41:37.297 --> 00:41:38.866
I wish I could do that too.

00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:41.192
Turn my memory on and off.

00:41:41.436 --> 00:41:43.531
Do you know what it's like to start over after everything's wiped out?

00:41:44.337 --> 00:41:45.732
I feel as though...

00:41:47.237 --> 00:41:50.031
I was abandoned without knowing what I used to do and who I am.

00:41:52.407 --> 00:41:53.816
Not knowing what to do because...

00:41:53.817 --> 00:41:56.341
you know nothing about yourself. Do you know what it's like?

00:41:58.317 --> 00:42:00.182
You know what it's like to live in pain all your life?

00:42:01.317 --> 00:42:03.625
My parents. who said we should have tonkatsu for lunch.

00:42:03.626 --> 00:42:05.381
never came back after they left the house with you.

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:08.151
Are they dead? Are they alive?

00:42:08.697 --> 00:42:09.821
Or...

00:42:12.027 --> 00:42:13.562
did they abandon me?

00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:15.866
Even while praying that they're still alive somewhere.

00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:17.562
I caught myself thinking. "What if they're alive?"

00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:21.531
"If they're alive and well after abandoning me."

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:23.841
"then what about me?"

00:42:25.847 --> 00:42:28.741
Do you know what it's like to be trapped in that scary thought...

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.241
all your life?

00:42:30.317 --> 00:42:33.042
At least you remember being abandoned. I don't even have that.

00:42:34.487 --> 00:42:36.781
I can't empathize with you because I don't have parents.

00:42:38.286 --> 00:42:40.221
I remember nothing. so I have nothing to tell you.

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:43.662
I'll get going.

00:42:44.496 --> 00:42:45.991
You grew up in a children's home.

00:42:47.936 --> 00:42:49.131
I'll take you there tomorrow.

00:42:53.036 --> 00:42:54.602
Then we'll find out...

00:42:55.837 --> 00:42:57.401
who abandoned you...

00:42:58.476 --> 00:43:01.442
and whether or not that precedes the day you came to my house.

00:43:01.976 --> 00:43:03.682
I grew up in a children's home?

00:43:08.317 --> 00:43:09.582
Come out when I call you tomorrow.

00:43:10.956 --> 00:43:12.082
Hey.

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.062
Where's the children's home?

00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:18.821
You're curious?

00:43:19.226 --> 00:43:20.361
I told you.

00:43:21.597 --> 00:43:23.801
I'll dig through your brain to find out what happened.

00:43:29.637 --> 00:43:30.971
What if I refuse to go?

00:43:31.106 --> 00:43:32.571
Then keep living like that.

00:43:33.847 --> 00:43:35.442
Without even knowing who you really are.

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.701
You haven't eaten yet?

00:44:07.876 --> 00:44:09.111
Did you see the news?

00:44:10.487 --> 00:44:12.741
A former soldier accused of corruption died by suicide.

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:14.781
What a joke.

00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:18.622
You see. even the deceased have a thing called honor.

00:44:20.056 --> 00:44:22.051
To a dead person. that is too much of a luxury.

00:44:22.797 --> 00:44:24.662
What will they say when I die?

00:44:25.427 --> 00:44:27.736
"A former female soldier who made a move on her superior..."

00:44:27.737 --> 00:44:29.192
"to get a promotion dies by suicide."

00:44:29.597 --> 00:44:30.761
Something like that?

00:44:31.367 --> 00:44:32.531
Just don't die.

00:44:34.007 --> 00:44:35.832
You said we were doing this for our country.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:39.241
You roped me into this so I could prove my loyalty to the country.

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:40.942
Are you sure this is how it's done?

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:44.341
You see. we're just small fry.

00:44:44.817 --> 00:44:46.841
It's normal that we don't know everything.

00:44:48.157 --> 00:44:50.281
Just as ants don't know about space?

00:44:51.126 --> 00:44:52.951
If you don't like it. leave.

00:44:53.126 --> 00:44:54.852
What about this leg?

00:44:55.496 --> 00:44:58.091
It'll rot and fall off without the shots.

00:44:59.266 --> 00:45:02.091
Isn't that why you're obeying with your mouth shut?

00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:03.801
Stop whining.

00:45:04.837 --> 00:45:06.861
Sure. I'm just whining.

00:45:06.907 --> 00:45:09.332
What's the big deal about an arm and a leg?

00:45:09.476 --> 00:45:12.942
But we're doing who-knows-what just to keep them.

00:45:17.246 --> 00:45:19.745
That female cop will get a new cell phone tomorrow.

00:45:19.746 --> 00:45:22.812
They planted a tracker. so keep a close eye on her.

00:45:36.436 --> 00:45:38.901
A half day? Why?

00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:43.035
I got 15 stitches.

00:45:43.036 --> 00:45:47.071
Back in my day. we stapled it and continued working.

00:45:47.576 --> 00:45:49.145
You've got it good.

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.177
That's why people call you...

00:45:50.177 --> 00:45:51.285
a "kkondae". condescending older person.

00:45:51.286 --> 00:45:52.446
It's an honor.

00:45:52.447 --> 00:45:55.086
"Kkondae" was added to the British dictionary.

00:45:55.087 --> 00:45:57.252
You mean English dictionary.

00:45:57.587 --> 00:45:58.821
I'm injured.

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.752
What will you do if you leave early?

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:04.066
- Rest. - Rest and do what?

00:46:04.067 --> 00:46:05.966
You used to nag that I didn't rest enough.

00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:07.535
Now. you nag because I want to rest.

00:46:07.536 --> 00:46:08.895
You wouldn't rest even when I told you to.

00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:10.932
So it's suspicious that you suddenly want to.

00:46:11.407 --> 00:46:14.031
Look. I'm injured.

00:46:15.436 --> 00:46:16.531
Ouch.

00:46:19.847 --> 00:46:21.042
Who is that?

00:46:21.976 --> 00:46:24.586
- Wait. - Kim Hwang Shik. You recognize him?

00:46:24.587 --> 00:46:26.741
He was in the subway station.

00:46:27.456 --> 00:46:29.281
He committed suicide by jumping in front of a subway.

00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:30.622
No way.

00:46:31.257 --> 00:46:32.756
That was an accident.

00:46:32.757 --> 00:46:34.692
If we say it was an accident. we need to explain it.

00:46:34.996 --> 00:46:36.926
Why was he there at that hour?

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:39.091
Who sent him there? Why?

00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:41.696
But there's no need if we say it was suicide...

00:46:41.697 --> 00:46:42.962
since it's personal.

00:46:43.496 --> 00:46:44.636
Why was it suicide?

00:46:44.637 --> 00:46:46.006
That's what the police announced.

00:46:46.007 --> 00:46:47.506
Which police? This is our case.

00:46:47.507 --> 00:46:49.636
- They did. - "They" who?

00:46:49.637 --> 00:46:52.046
I don't know. We were told to hand it over. and to drop it.

00:46:52.047 --> 00:46:53.846
They didn't say who from which unit was investigating.

00:46:53.847 --> 00:46:55.616
If they took the case. they should tell you...

00:46:55.617 --> 00:46:57.712
who's taking it. where to send what you have...

00:47:04.387 --> 00:47:07.995
This is above lowly cop's paygrade. is that it?

00:47:07.996 --> 00:47:10.151
This punk. Lowly cop?

00:47:10.496 --> 00:47:12.165
We have the right to investigate.

00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:13.765
Then where did this case go?

00:47:13.766 --> 00:47:16.066
I don't know. They said to drop it. so we did.

00:47:16.067 --> 00:47:17.906
- You should as well. - Captain.

00:47:17.907 --> 00:47:19.336
I'm telling you in case you stir up trouble.

00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:22.575
Why are you just taking it without any complaints?

00:47:22.576 --> 00:47:25.245
I did complain. I complained like crazy.

00:47:25.246 --> 00:47:26.346
I mean...

00:47:26.347 --> 00:47:28.971
You were kicked out for insubordination. right?

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:30.741
For investigating a supervisor.

00:47:31.617 --> 00:47:33.982
You were sent here because you were with Major Crimes.

00:47:34.257 --> 00:47:37.752
Violent Crimes guys like us would've lost our badges.

00:47:38.286 --> 00:47:40.696
So don't stick your nose around after leaving work early.

00:47:40.697 --> 00:47:42.852
Just sit down and rest.

00:47:47.137 --> 00:47:48.861
You have a new phone.

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:51.531
Submit your old one and go home.

00:47:59.646 --> 00:48:02.241
You found her? Where is she?

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:04.841
I'll join you guys. so keep me updated.

00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:27.372
Seriously. You rude brat.

00:48:27.876 --> 00:48:30.301
Sit in the front. Do you think you're a chairman?

00:48:45.726 --> 00:48:48.091
Hey. Sit in the back.

00:48:49.097 --> 00:48:51.162
It feels weird sitting side by side.

00:48:58.036 --> 00:48:59.261
Go back.

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.232
Which a children's home?

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.542
You don't remember being in a children's home?

00:49:07.746 --> 00:49:09.372
I've never been to one.

00:49:12.146 --> 00:49:15.712
People may lie. but documents never do.

00:49:16.556 --> 00:49:17.821
Sit in the back.

00:49:19.427 --> 00:49:21.392
What does it matter where I sit?

00:49:22.956 --> 00:49:25.292
It's me you hate. not where I sit.

00:49:26.626 --> 00:49:27.932
Want to ride in the trunk?

00:49:30.297 --> 00:49:31.462
Let's go.

00:50:16.441 --> 00:50:17.940
How may I help you?

00:50:17.941 --> 00:50:19.576
Well... Just a minute.

00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:25.215
I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum.

00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:27.550
I'm here to see Sister Stella.

00:50:27.551 --> 00:50:29.485
Are you the detective who called?

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.556
She's waiting for you. Please come in.

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:37.655
I'll ask the questions. You stay quiet.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.376
Sister Stella.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:11.456
Hello. I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum. I called earlier.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.826
I sense very good energy from you.

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:21.505
Too good for a detective.

00:51:21.841 --> 00:51:24.905
I don't know what brings you here.

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:30.976
but since you're here anyway. I'll bless you.

00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:38.485
You seem to be with someone else.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.025
Yes. we came together.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.726
Bless you.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.226
Say something.

00:51:50.171 --> 00:51:51.396
Thank you.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.376
She's still at a church.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.806
Is she praying?

00:52:05.551 --> 00:52:07.585
Can I get some sort of a reaction?

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.315
Haven't you read her profile?

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.516
She isn't religious.

00:52:16.731 --> 00:52:18.655
I'm looking for someone.

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:23.630
It has been a while since we closed the children's home...

00:52:23.631 --> 00:52:26.139
for this and that reason.

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.105
So I'm not sure I'll remember.

00:52:28.571 --> 00:52:30.806
For whom are you searching?

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.009
It has been over 20 years.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:38.246
but did you know Jang Jae Woo and Hwang Eun Gyeong?

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:42.585
I don't know.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.715
(Hwang Eun Gyeong. Missing)

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.255
According to their family. they were a member of his church.

00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:53.800
They left to go to mass that day and went missing.

00:52:53.801 --> 00:52:56.795
I've spent my entire life here.

00:52:57.071 --> 00:52:59.300
If that had happened.

00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:02.266
the police would've come.

00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:07.039
I've never heard of any member of our church going missing.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.110
It was a missing person case. but the police never came?

00:53:10.111 --> 00:53:12.315
Not for that. no.

00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:15.045
Then what for?

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.085
There was...

00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:22.655
a fire in the church.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.025
They came for the first time then.

00:53:26.501 --> 00:53:27.596
I see.

00:53:30.171 --> 00:53:34.306
Then do you remember the name Zi O?

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.905
Do you?

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.405
Zi O?

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:45.246
I remember him.

00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:49.686
How could I forget that name?

00:53:50.691 --> 00:53:51.916
Do you know...

00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.686
who dropped him off here?

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:57.085
No.

00:53:57.531 --> 00:53:59.596
He came on his own.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.230
I went out one morning.

00:54:02.231 --> 00:54:04.465
and he was standing by the statue of Virgin Mary.

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.896
"Did you come here on your own?"

00:54:08.341 --> 00:54:10.166
"Did someone bring you here?"

00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:14.235
I kept asking. but he said the same thing.

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.505
Zi O. Zi O.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.646
That became his name.

00:54:20.151 --> 00:54:23.445
Do you remember exactly what date. or what month and year it was?

00:54:23.751 --> 00:54:26.215
I don't remember.

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.786
It was so long ago.

00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:33.826
It has been over 20 years.

00:54:35.801 --> 00:54:37.739
Did anyone come to see him...

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.536
or sponsor him at some point?

00:54:39.801 --> 00:54:41.605
Why do you ask?

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.206
What do you want to know?

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.306
I was wondering if there was anyone related to him in some way.

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:54.416
Did he do something wrong?

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:56.045
No.

00:54:57.091 --> 00:54:59.885
Did someone adopt him?

00:55:01.361 --> 00:55:02.826
Yes. there were several.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.896
Was there a man named Ha Young Jae among them?

00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:10.666
Ha Young Jae.

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.795
Ha Young Jae.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.206
No.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:19.706
I've never heard that name before.

00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:22.449
Your memory may be imperfect.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:25.376
so may I see your documents?

00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:28.016
No.

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:33.085
It's impossible for me not to remember.

00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:37.860
I can't forget a single detail...

00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:40.326
related to that child.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:48.366
Whenever someone took him to adopt him.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.905
they brought him back the day after.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.146
They said they couldn't keep him.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:01.246
They all said that they couldn't raise him for a single day.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.815
They looked terrified when they brought him.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.786
and left as if they were running away.

00:56:09.591 --> 00:56:11.400
So... Sister.

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:13.056
That's how he was.

00:56:14.631 --> 00:56:16.726
He was too difficult for everyone.

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:20.235
I see.

00:56:20.401 --> 00:56:23.039
- That child... - You don't need to continue.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.166
No.

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:29.076
If you're involved with him. you need to know this.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.275
He set this church on fire.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.945
That's when I hurt my eyes.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.916
Stay away from him.

00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:49.065
He doesn't remember being here.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.835
He was always like that.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.210
Even after starting the fire.

00:56:59.211 --> 00:57:02.605
he said he didn't remember. and that it wasn't him.

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.405
Do you know why?

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.885
- Why? - Inside of him...

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.416
lies a demon.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.130
The demon started the fire.

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:17.795
and the child didn't remember.

00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:19.695
No.

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:24.735
That child...

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.835
was a demon.

00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:33.076
He changed faces as needed in the situation.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:36.876
I didn't start the fire.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:40.250
I never did that. I've never even been here.

00:57:40.251 --> 00:57:41.786
How could I have started the fire?

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.186
Zi O?

00:57:51.231 --> 00:57:52.726
Are you Zi O?

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:57.596
No. It can't be.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.596
He couldn't come in here.

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:06.179
No.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:10.905
If you are that child. you couldn't come in here!

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.476
If I am that child. I'm right here.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:17.545
Your face.

00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:23.826
Your face.

00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:33.596
Zi O.

00:58:38.211 --> 00:58:40.505
You really are Zi O.

Please send them to the fiery pit.

01:00:10.901 --> 01:00:12.135
Is that me?

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:16.465
Was I that unbearable?

01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:20.335
You're a demon.

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.806
You are a demon.

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.315
You're a demon who should've burned to death before coming here.

01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:29.945
How did you get in here? You're the child of a demon!

It wasn't me.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.706
Do you know how many people you killed?

01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:55.976
Those young children.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:37.246
I don't know.

01:02:37.881 --> 01:02:39.376
I didn't do it.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.616
I don't know anything.

01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:48.320
I said to stop.

01:04:10.071 --> 01:04:12.505
I knew nothing. but you turned me into a monster.

01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:15.346
I was human until you called me a monster.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.545
You're the one who made me a monster.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.545
Go to the fiery pit. you monster.

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.085
Why should I?

01:04:44.711 --> 01:04:45.835
Why should I?

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.445
Lead this monster...

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:31.815
into the fiery pit.

(L.U.C.A.: The Beginning)

01:06:30.481 --> 01:06:32.975
I don't want to know more. I'm scared.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.685
That's the key to finding out who you are.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:36.790
Can I trust you?

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.355
Please bring Zi O safely.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:42.086
I can say it for sure not. He isn't human.

01:06:42.361 --> 01:06:44.190
Zi O. right? Zi O?

01:06:44.191 --> 01:06:46.929
Someone knows we're together.

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.730
It wouldn't be a conspiracy. right?

01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:50.030
Should we run away?

01:06:50.031 --> 01:06:52.570
You were the only person who didn't think I was dangerous.

01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:53.666
You were the only one.

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.136
Stop it.

01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:58.065
I remember now.
