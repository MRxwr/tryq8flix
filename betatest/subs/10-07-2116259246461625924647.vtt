3
00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.175
Whoa! What is that. yo?

4
00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:49.372
It looks like some kind
of alien spaceship.

5
00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.248
Oh. how wonderful.

6
00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.849
Perhaps these aliens
are the peaceful kind

7
00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:55.319
that enjoy playing that

8
00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.452
song.

9
00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:59.555
If Hollywood movies
have taught me anything.

10
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:03.220
it's that space aliens
only come here
for one reason.

11
00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:04.456
to replace us!

12
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.928
Well. no alien is replacing me.

13
00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:19.975
Greetings. Earthlings.

14
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.705
We are the Nerdlucks.

15
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.609
Oh. my goodness.
I know these guys.

16
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:27.785
They're the aliens
from Space Jam.

17
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.385
What's a Space Jam?

18
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:31.580
It's only the greatest
sports movie of all time.

19
00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:32.715
Sorry. Never heard of it.

20
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.288
-Me neither.
-Nor the I.

21
00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:36.227
How have you never heard of it?

22
00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.190
It stars Bugs Bunny
and Michael Jordan.

23
00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.466
Michael Jordan?

24
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:41.891
Oh. yeah.

25
00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:44.132
That's the dude who sells
all them shoes.

26
00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:48.238
Oh. I wish to watch
the movie about the salesman
who plays the basketball.

27
00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:51.435
Well. we happen to own
a copy on VHS.

28
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.475
But our VCR is busted.

29
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.945
No problem.
We've got a VCR in the tower.

30
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.379
We can watch it there.

31
00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:58.576
-Yeah. let's check this out.
-Oh. yeah!

32
00:01:58.711 --> 00:01:59.575
-Excellent!
-Let's do this.

33
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:01.483
Wait. are you guys crazy?

34
00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:07.993
Inviting these aliens
into our home
is a horrible idea. Titans.

35
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.458
How do we know
we can even trust them?

36
00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:12.527
Just sit down and watch
the movie. dude.

37
00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:21.329
Oh. yeah.
Space Jam!

38
00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:22.306
No.

39
00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:29.511
This is
Teen Titans Go!
See Space Jam.

40
00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:31.612
Now let's fast forward
to get to the good stuff.

41
00:02:34.317 --> 00:02:37.584
I just feel at
this particular time
that I reached the pinnacle

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.516
of my basketball career
and I must retire.

43
00:02:40.652 --> 00:02:42.759
Holdup. MJ is retiring?

44
00:02:42.894 --> 00:02:45.490
Nice going. Cyborg.
You skip to the end
of the movie.

45
00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.299
Nah. this is the beginning.

46
00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.428
But he said he was the done
playing the basketball.

47
00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:52.129
Yeah. he says that a lot.

48
00:02:52.264 --> 00:02:55.198
...anybody this.
except for one person.
and. uh...

49
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.472
but I think I'm gonna go
and play professional baseball.

50
00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:00.136
What position
will you play?

51
00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:02.346
I don't know.
As a kid. I was a pitcher.

52
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.139
I think that'd be kind of hard
for me to pitch.

53
00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:05.877
so I think I'm gonna play
the outfield now.

54
00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:23.894
No way!

55
00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.137
There's an amusement park
in space?

56
00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:28.904
And look. it's named
after Robin.

57
00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.873
Ha. Very funny.

58
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.708
But mark my words. Titans.
you're all making
a huge mistake.

59
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:56.697
Woo-hoo!

60
00:03:58.735 --> 00:04:00.996
Let's get out of here. Dad.
this stinks.

61
00:04:01.132 --> 00:04:03.407
Don't bring me
here anymore. all right?

62
00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:05.106
Don't bring me
here anymore. all right?

63
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:06.569
Are you listening?

64
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:07.812
Did you hear him?

65
00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.309
Did you hear him?

66
00:04:09.445 --> 00:04:11.314
That little brat is right.

67
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.181
I've told you.
if I've told you once...

68
00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:16.086
Yo. that's Danny DeVito.

69
00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:17.952
My dude played The Penguin.

70
00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:21.385
Man. where's Batman.

71
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.797
I told you a thousand.
thousand. thousand.
thousand times!

72
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:28.427
We need new attractions.

73
00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:29.633
-Right!
-New ones.

74
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.601
Uh-huh.

75
00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:31.629
Get it?

76
00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:32.935
Big. shiny new things. Yeah.

77
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.271
Absolutely. sir.

78
00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.231
Look at me.
Look at me and listen.

79
00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:38.941
-The customer is always right.
-

80
00:04:39.077 --> 00:04:39.977
Right.

81
00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:41.570
What is he the doing?

82
00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:43.480
He's smoking.

83
00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.608
But smoking is so bad
for you. yo.

84
00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:47.911
Right.

85
00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:49.785
-Okay. we need something--
-Oop!

86
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:51.147
My bad.

87
00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:52.951
-We need something...
-

88
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.659
Nutty.

89
00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.785
Nutty?

90
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.555
I hopes ya'll don't mind.
but I loves counting
butt shots in movies.

91
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.759
That's one.

92
00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:03.932
-Something wacky.
- Wacky.

93
00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:05.929
We need something.
something. something.
something--

94
00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:08.169
-We need something-
-Looney? Oops.

95
00:05:08.304 --> 00:05:09.739
Looney. Thank you.

96
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.101
Looney?

97
00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:15.072
I'm an elk! Shoot me!

98
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:22.581
Yes! Looney! Yes!

99
00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:25.251
Now you're talking. Looney.

100
00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:29.085
Looney. That's it.
that's the word
I was looking for. Looney.

101
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.620
-Get the Looney Tunes.
-Looney Tunes!

102
00:05:31.755 --> 00:05:32.523
Bring 'em here.

103
00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.625
Sir. just noticing. sir.

104
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:37.363
They're from Earth.

105
00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:38.897
What if they can't come?

106
00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:41.969
What did you say?
What if they can't come?

107
00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:43.700
Uh-huh?

108
00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:45.810
-Make 'em.
-Cool.

109
00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:47.640
Make 'em.

110
00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:49.205
We're gonna get 'em.

111
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.976
We're gonna get 'em.
Yeah. right.

112
00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:02.221
Cyborg's fun fact.

113
00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:05.221
The number 45
was Michael's high school
jersey number.

114
00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.394
Strike!

115
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:11.366
Looks good in a uniform.

116
00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:13.530
Looks great. Can't teach that.

117
00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:14.934
Can't teach it.

118
00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.073
Podolak!

119
00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.542
Podolak. come here.

120
00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.478
-I'm sorry I didn't mean...
-Come here.

121
00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:23.108
Yes. sir?

122
00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:24.881
I want you to make sure
that nobody bothers Michael.

123
00:06:25.016 --> 00:06:26.708
I want him to be
the happiest player
in the world.

124
00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:28.013
The happiest.

125
00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.214
Slider. Don't swing.

126
00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:37.858
Strike three!

127
00:06:37.994 --> 00:06:40.496
-I told you not to swing.
-Couldn't help it.

128
00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:42.628
I understand.
Hey. nice talking to ya.

129
00:06:50.404 --> 00:06:53.077
Wow. Everyone's so supportive
of Michael striking out.

130
00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:57.580
I believe they are hoping
to get the free sneakers
from the nice salesman.

131
00:06:57.715 --> 00:06:59.451
We're not worried.
We're not worried.

132
00:07:02.383 --> 00:07:04.748
-Good job. Michael
-Get out there. Michael.
Don't worry.

133
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:05.783
Good try. Good hustle.

134
00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:08.125
Good cut. Michael. Good cut.

135
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.518
That was a strike out. Mike.
That was a good-looking
strike out. Real good.

136
00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:12.189
I mean. you look good
when you strike out. man.

137
00:07:12.324 --> 00:07:13.956
When I strike out. man.
it looks nasty. man.

138
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:15.434
At least you look good. man.

139
00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.064
Hi. Mr. Jordan.

140
00:07:19.997 --> 00:07:21.730
Mr. Jordan. I'm Stan--

141
00:07:26.243 --> 00:07:27.446
Ow. jeez.

142
00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:34.144
You all right?
That was a nasty fall.

143
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.914
Yeah. Oh. I'm Stan Podolak.
Mr. Jordan

144
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.019
I'm the Barons' new publicist.

145
00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:43.257
I'm here to make
your life easier.

146
00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:45.160
You want me
to drive you somewhere.
I will drive you anywhere.

147
00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:47.063
You want me to pick up
your laundry.
babysit your kids.

148
00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.364
I will do it.

149
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.260
I knew I recognized that dude.

150
00:07:50.395 --> 00:07:52.997
That's that fool
from Jurassic Park. yo.

151
00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:55.670
I am here
to personally guarantee

152
00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:58.510
that no one
will ever bother you.

153
00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.512
Friends. look.
It is the Santy Claus.

154
00:08:07.647 --> 00:08:09.312
Ho. ho. ho.

155
00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:13.525
What was that?

156
00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.130
Hang on.

157
00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:23.162
Hanging on.

158
00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:25.266
Why is Looney Tunes
in the center of the Earth?

159
00:08:25.402 --> 00:08:28.196
Because it's
the looniest place
the writers could think of.

160
00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:30.366
-Oh. Whatever.

161
00:08:33.807 --> 00:08:35.837
-Bombastic.
-Cool.

162
00:08:46.454 --> 00:08:48.853
All right.
you irascible bunny.
Come back.

163
00:08:48.988 --> 00:08:50.858
Ho. ho. There's my man Bugs.

164
00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:52.696
I'll be with you
in a second. folks.

165
00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:55.632
after I finish
with nature boy here. Oop.

166
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:59.329
All right. pesky wabbit.
I've got you now.

167
00:09:00.569 --> 00:09:02.667
Here's a fun fact.

168
00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:05.203
Bugs Bunny got his name
when legendary animator
"Ben-Bugs" Hardaway

169
00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.203
drew a sketch of a rabbit
which got labeled

170
00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.647
by his fellow coworkers
as Bugs' Bunny.

171
00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.550
And Elmer Fudd
was originally named Egghead.

172
00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:13.948
Ouch.

173
00:09:15.318 --> 00:09:16.214
Hmm.

174
00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:21.718
One small step for moi!

175
00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:24.856
Moi!
- One giant leap
for Moron Mountain!

176
00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:27.355
-

177
00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:30.129
And one whopper headache
for Elmer Fudd.

178
00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.370
Diminutive. Ain't they?

179
00:09:36.505 --> 00:09:39.407
-We seek the one
they call Bugs Bunny.
-Yeah. Bugs Bunny.

180
00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.375
Have you seen him?

181
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.410
Where is this guy?

182
00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:43.411
Is he around?

183
00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:45.575
Hmm... Bugs Bunny.

184
00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:50.120
Bugs Bunny.
Say. does he have great.
big long ears?

185
00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:51.420
Like this?

186
00:09:51.555 --> 00:09:53.084
Yeah.

187
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.089
And does he hop around
like this?

188
00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.832
Yeah.

189
00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.459
Well. does he say.
"What's up. Doc?"
like this?

190
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.634
Eh... What's up. Doc?

191
00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:08.833
Yeah.

192
00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:10.999
Nope. never heard of him.

193
00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:13.645
Aw!

194
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.338
You know. maybe there is
no intelligent life

195
00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:18.441
out there in
the universe after all.

196
00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:25.957
Hold on there.
Mr. Looney Tune.

197
00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:29.889
Ah-ha! Even more proof
that these Nerdlucks
are evil!

198
00:10:30.024 --> 00:10:31.656
Ah. Bugs kinda had that coming.

199
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:33.088
Okay. bunny.

200
00:10:33.224 --> 00:10:35.390
Gather up your Tune pals.

201
00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:38.727
We're taking you
for a ride.

202
00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:41.365
So. like. where we goin'?

203
00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.212
Are we there yet?

204
00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.045
Ah. I'm really sorry
it took so long. but.
you know...

205
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:52.083
Sherm. Sherm.
don't. don't worry about it.

206
00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:53.408
...that exit on 65
wasn't clearly marked.
It was like--

207
00:10:53.544 --> 00:10:54.984
Hold.
Hold on. Right here.

208
00:10:55.119 --> 00:10:55.513
What. here?
- Yes. Right here.

209
00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:56.452
Oh.

210
00:10:56.587 --> 00:10:57.886
So that's MJ's house?

211
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:00.483
He must make the modest
of the salaries.

212
00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:02.153
Thanks for the ride. Sherm.
I appreciate it.

213
00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:04.491
-It's Stan. Mike.
-I'm sorry.

214
00:11:04.626 --> 00:11:06.454
But that's all right.
You can call me
Sherm if you want to.

215
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.695
Because I followed
your whole career

216
00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:09.630
-and I just think you're
the greatest athlete that's...
-Stan! Stan. Stan. Stan.

217
00:11:09.765 --> 00:11:11.065
...that's ever lived.

218
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.166
Gimme that remote!
I wanna see more Bugs.

219
00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:23.009
Stop the music!

220
00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:24.976
-Top duck comin' through!
-Hey!

221
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:27.013
Jeez! It's gettin' so a guy

222
00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:28.881
can't even get himself
wet around here!

223
00:11:29.017 --> 00:11:31.682
So. what's the big emergency?

224
00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:34.390
Uh. these little guys would
like to make an announcement.

225
00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:36.024
Here you go. shorty.

226
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.155
-All right. All right.

227
00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:41.860
You. all of you.

228
00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:44.559
are now our prisoners!

229
00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:47.299
See! I told you they
want to abduct us!

230
00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:54.736
Ooh!
We're in big trouble now.

231
00:11:54.871 --> 00:11:58.039
We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space.

232
00:11:58.174 --> 00:11:59.175
No fooling.

233
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.719
Where you will be our slaves

234
00:12:00.854 --> 00:12:03.012
and placed on display
for the amusement

235
00:12:03.148 --> 00:12:04.381
of our paying customers.

236
00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:08.351
Oh. fear clutches
my breast.

237
00:12:08.487 --> 00:12:11.253
Okay. If these Nerdlucks
are so friendly.

238
00:12:11.388 --> 00:12:13.191
then why is Bugs chained up?

239
00:12:13.327 --> 00:12:15.066
He's just doing
a little street magic.

240
00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:18.502
But they just called all
of the Looney Tunes
their prisoners!

241
00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:20.233
It's all part of the act. yo.

242
00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:23.597
I don't know.
Something smells fishy...

243
00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:25.601
That would be
your breath. Robin.

244
00:12:28.042 --> 00:12:31.409
We ain't a-goin' nowheres!

245
00:12:32.813 --> 00:12:34.181
Whoa guns!

246
00:12:34.316 --> 00:12:36.084
How bouts we make this
a bit more kid friendly?

247
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:38.548
That's better.

248
00:12:39.588 --> 00:12:40.517
Oh.

249
00:12:44.387 --> 00:12:46.730
Eh. not so fast. doc.

250
00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.695
You just can't turn us
into slaves.

251
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.363
that would be bad.

252
00:12:50.499 --> 00:12:52.402
You've gotta give us
a chance to defend ourselves.

253
00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.903
Oh. yeah? Who says?

254
00:12:55.038 --> 00:12:56.065
Says who?
- Why?

255
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.303
That's another one!

256
00:12:59.577 --> 00:13:00.940
Just a sec.

257
00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:03.314
There! Read em and weep. boys.

258
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.882
What's this?

259
00:13:05.018 --> 00:13:07.582
"Give them a chance
to defend themselves."

260
00:13:07.718 --> 00:13:09.653
Do we have to?

261
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.049
-It's in the rule book.
-It is.

262
00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:13.383
Okay. It is in the rule book.

263
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:16.289
Uno momento!
We have to confer.

264
00:13:18.892 --> 00:13:20.460
Cyborg fun fact.

265
00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:22.795
This scene is a reference
to the 1970 movie. Patton.

266
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:23.997
which won Best Picture.

267
00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:26.097
But do you know
which 2018 movie

268
00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:27.762
should have won best picture?

269
00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:32.608
All right. troops.

270
00:13:32.743 --> 00:13:34.502
It is for us to choose

271
00:13:34.637 --> 00:13:36.480
a battlefield that affords us--

272
00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:38.042
I got it.

273
00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:40.878
Yes. Private Porkster?

274
00:13:41.013 --> 00:13:45.417
How
about we challenge
them to a spelling bee?

275
00:13:45.552 --> 00:13:48.985
Say... We could have
a bowling tournament.

276
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:54.288
Sufferin' Succotash!
What's wrong with all of ya?

277
00:13:54.424 --> 00:13:55.824
I say. we get a ladder.

278
00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:58.262
wait till the old lady's
outta the room.

279
00:13:58.397 --> 00:14:00.869
then grab that little bird.

280
00:14:01.004 --> 00:14:02.835
-Whoa! Whoa!

281
00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:05.172
Take a deep breath. Sly!

282
00:14:05.307 --> 00:14:07.675
Okay. let's analyze
the competition.

283
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:09.011
Hmm. That's a good idea.

284
00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:11.009
Now. uh. what are
we lookin' at here?

285
00:14:11.144 --> 00:14:12.477
Let's see.

286
00:14:12.612 --> 00:14:14.149
We got a small race
of invading aliens.

287
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:18.214
Small arms! Short legs!

288
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.083
-Not very fast.
-Hmm.

289
00:14:20.218 --> 00:14:21.820
Tiny little guys.

290
00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:24.554
Can't jump high.

291
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.929
Hey! They's just
described you. Robin.

292
00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:28.431
Very funny.

293
00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:30.968
Uh-huh.

294
00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:36.871
We challenge you
to a basketball game.

295
00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:39.369
All right. Basketball it is!

296
00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.942
-Basketball!
-Oh boy. oh boy.

297
00:14:42.078 --> 00:14:44.847
All right! What is basketball?

298
00:14:44.982 --> 00:14:46.379
-What's that?
-Beats me.

299
00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:47.242
-We didn't have that in school.
-I have no idea.

300
00:14:47.377 --> 00:14:48.453
-What?
-Lights!

301
00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:50.421
Pardon me! Oop. sorry.

302
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.552
Hey! Down in front!

303
00:14:55.358 --> 00:14:58.286
An exhilarating
team sport currently growing
rapidly in popularity...

304
00:14:58.422 --> 00:14:59.854
And the game is on!

305
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.593
No good!

306
00:15:02.729 --> 00:15:04.200
Over here! Over here!
Over here! Over here!

307
00:15:04.335 --> 00:15:07.367
And nothing! Still can't
get it in the basket. Man!

308
00:15:07.502 --> 00:15:09.369
Looks like the crowd
is having none of it.

309
00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:13.073
From downtown... Boom!

310
00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.045
...Association.

311
00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:18.047
Featuring the best players
in the world!

312
00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:21.381
-The best players in the world.
-The best!

313
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.039
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

314
00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:43.166
I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

315
00:15:43.301 --> 00:15:45.339
Excuse me.

316
00:15:45.474 --> 00:15:47.371
Ouch!
Get your feet out of my nose!

317
00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:49.206
Be quiet.
they're looking!

318
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:51.906
Hey! It's basketball.

319
00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:55.382
-Where?
-Whoa! Now what?

320
00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:00.316
Hey hey!

321
00:16:00.452 --> 00:16:02.124
Fun Fact. Patricia Heaton

322
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.825
starred on the sitcom.
The Middle.

323
00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:05.226
which was filmed next door

324
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.922
to the offices
of Teen Titans Go!

325
00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:08.761
What? What?
- She's looking again.

326
00:16:08.896 --> 00:16:10.296
Close it up!
Close it up!
- Tightly.

327
00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:12.630
You poked me again.

328
00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.306
-Sweetheart.
-What?

329
00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:17.599
I thought you were gonna
get better seats this year.

330
00:16:17.734 --> 00:16:18.971
This is as good as I could get.

331
00:16:19.107 --> 00:16:20.573
This guy next to me

332
00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:22.336
is doing something
very weird in his raincoat.

333
00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:24.039
Pop quiz time.

334
00:16:24.175 --> 00:16:27.280
Dan Castellaneta is the voice
of which famous TV dummy?

335
00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:30.786
If you guessed Robin
you'd be wrong!

336
00:16:30.922 --> 00:16:32.518
Robin isn't famous at all.

337
00:16:32.653 --> 00:16:34.119
Honey. will you just
let me watch the game?

338
00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:36.090
Barkley's killing us!

339
00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:38.495
Hey! Someone's killing someone.

340
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.191
No. Seriously?

341
00:16:40.327 --> 00:16:43.001
Wow! A killer! Let me see!

342
00:16:45.267 --> 00:16:47.170
There! That's him. The killer.

343
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.273
He's big.
-He's good.

344
00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.536
He's mine!

345
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:54.868
Okay.
Go get him!

346
00:16:55.004 --> 00:16:56.711
Yeah!
Watch out!

347
00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:57.510
- Hey!
Watch it!

348
00:17:07.322 --> 00:17:08.517
Come on. Get back on defense.

349
00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:09.851
Why isn't the crowd shocked

350
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.525
that he just got
an alien up his nose?

351
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:14.091
You can't shock these people.
they're New Yorkers!

352
00:17:17.198 --> 00:17:18.135
What are you doing?

353
00:17:26.978 --> 00:17:29.708
Time out! Call the time out!

354
00:17:29.843 --> 00:17:32.382
What's wrong with you. man?
You're killin' us.

355
00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.880
Let him in!
Let him in!
- Open up!

356
00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:35.211
Open!

357
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.546
Wow! He did it.

358
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:41.392
I got it! I got his talent.

359
00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:42.719
Super.

360
00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:44.058
-Sit down. Chuck.
-Hey. man. I'm fine!

361
00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:46.087
-Charles.
-I am fine!

362
00:17:46.223 --> 00:17:47.756
No. no. no. no! I'm playing
you too many minutes.

363
00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:49.265
-I'm not tired!
-Go get the doctor.

364
00:17:59.902 --> 00:18:00.777
What's up. baby? You all right?

365
00:18:00.912 --> 00:18:01.874
-Yeah. man.
-Sure?

366
00:18:02.009 --> 00:18:02.806
Yeah.

367
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.745
Come on. we're okay.
You're okay.

368
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:07.085
-You're all right.
Come on. let's go.
-Yeah. man.

369
00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:12.713
He catches the ball
like friend Robin!

370
00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:15.724
With the baby hands!

371
00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:22.100
Come on. Patrick.
It's showtime!

372
00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:25.400
You guys suck!

373
00:18:32.072 --> 00:18:32.968
Popcorn!

374
00:18:36.044 --> 00:18:37.110
Okay. Okay.

375
00:18:37.246 --> 00:18:38.477
Now. which of you maroons

376
00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:40.314
has ever played
basketball before?

377
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.147
-I have. Coach.

378
00:18:42.283 --> 00:18:43.516
And there's an important

379
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:45.413
strategic question
I need to ask you.

380
00:18:45.548 --> 00:18:46.520
Yes. yes?

381
00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:52.395
What do you think?

382
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.261
I'm kind of partial
to purple and gold myself.

383
00:18:54.397 --> 00:18:56.327
It goes better
with my coloring.

384
00:18:56.463 --> 00:18:59.802
-A-one. two. three. four.
Disco disco duck!
-Guys! Nice outfit. Daffy.

385
00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:03.871
The little
aliens say it's their turn
to use the court.

386
00:19:04.006 --> 00:19:05.441
Yeah. sure.

387
00:19:05.576 --> 00:19:07.839
Let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.

388
00:19:07.974 --> 00:19:10.911
Too bad you can't practice
getting taller. boys.

389
00:19:18.988 --> 00:19:20.382
Whoooa!

390
00:19:25.257 --> 00:19:26.626
Ah!

391
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:52.349
Holds up!
So you guys have the ability

392
00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:53.783
to steal our talents

393
00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:55.483
and turn into monster
versions of us?

394
00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:56.819
That's right.

395
00:19:56.955 --> 00:19:58.494
Then what are
you the waiting for?

396
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.922
Yeah. we want to see
what you guys look like as us.

397
00:20:01.058 --> 00:20:03.695
No. no. no.
This is a terrible--

398
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.593
Nah. don't listen to him.
Go for it!

399
00:20:05.729 --> 00:20:07.403
Okay. if you say so.

400
00:20:15.805 --> 00:20:18.913
Whoa! Booyah. dude!

401
00:20:20.249 --> 00:20:23.579
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

402
00:20:28.818 --> 00:20:31.456
This is the amazing...

403
00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:34.894
Ha-ha! Huh? Hey! What gives?

404
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.027
Why do they have cool new
talents and I don't have any?

405
00:20:38.162 --> 00:20:40.698
That's 'cause
you got stuck with Robin

406
00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:43.272
and he ain't
gots no talent.

407
00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.903
I do too have talent.
Check this out.

408
00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:49.537
And slide. eeeyyy. ooh-ooh.
hooma-chaaa!

409
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:52.710
Dude. you gotta stop.

410
00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:54.483
Let's just get back
to the movie.

411
00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:57.849
Hey. little pig...

412
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.522
-Boo.
-

413
00:21:02.292 --> 00:21:03.585
I wet myself.

414
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.061
Time to play
a little basketball.

415
00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:17.436
Those little pipsqueaks
just turned into superstars!

416
00:21:17.572 --> 00:21:20.343
They're monsters!

417
00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:24.509
Sufferin Succotash!
They're monstars!

418
00:21:24.645 --> 00:21:26.917
See. Titans? They're monsters!

419
00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:29.418
No. they're Monstars.

420
00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.213
That's like a whole
letter difference.

421
00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:34.292
Eh. I think we might
need a little bit of help.

422
00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:36.960
Okay. little fella.

423
00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.862
Hey. it's Bill Murray!

424
00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:40.130
I love Bill Murray.

425
00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:42.892
-That dude's my hero. yo!
-Hero?

426
00:21:43.028 --> 00:21:45.099
But he does not
have the superpower.

427
00:21:45.234 --> 00:21:46.601
Oh. yes. he does.

428
00:21:46.736 --> 00:21:49.263
Bill Murray's superpower
is being Bill Murray.

429
00:21:50.638 --> 00:21:53.834
You my friend. or you my enemy?

430
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.339
You are my friend. right?

431
00:21:55.474 --> 00:21:56.805
You are my ally.

432
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.772
Classic Jordan versus Bird!

433
00:21:58.908 --> 00:22:00.080
That dude's a bird?

434
00:22:00.216 --> 00:22:01.610
Now I see it!

435
00:22:01.745 --> 00:22:02.912
Draw the feathers

436
00:22:03.048 --> 00:22:04.816
and there's
the very large beak!

437
00:22:04.952 --> 00:22:07.948
But I'm not sure
how he lays the eggs.

438
00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:09.386
Larry Bird doesn't lay eggs.

439
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:10.394
He lay-ups!

440
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.590
You are my associate.

441
00:22:13.725 --> 00:22:14.931
my personal assistant.

442
00:22:15.066 --> 00:22:16.690
You are my weapon.

443
00:22:16.825 --> 00:22:17.797
You are leaving.

444
00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.195
Oh.

445
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.871
-Great shot.
-Oh. nice shot. Mr. Murray.

446
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.710
Cyborg's Fun Fact.

447
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.711
Bill Murray's hat was invented
in 1880 by Robert W. Patton!

448
00:22:29.847 --> 00:22:32.477
Who used to predict weather
for The Seattle Times.

449
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:37.311
-Good try.
-Not bad. Not bad.

450
00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.750
Something for you all
to shoot at.

451
00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:40.853
-Hit it good. Larry.
-Do my best.

452
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.856
It was a good shot.

453
00:22:44.689 --> 00:22:46.725
Yeah. I know.

454
00:22:46.861 --> 00:22:48.131
Mike. I gotta
ask you something.

455
00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:49.994
The NBA has to face reality.

456
00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:52.095
What's happening
to these players is serious.

457
00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:55.030
They're gonna
need new players with talent.

458
00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:58.541
guys who are skilled. but
never really thought about
a professional career before.

459
00:23:00.937 --> 00:23:02.303
You think I got a shot?

460
00:23:04.444 --> 00:23:05.312
Come on. really?

461
00:23:05.448 --> 00:23:06.880
-No.
-Don't kid me.

462
00:23:07.015 --> 00:23:10.681
Listen. it's a man's game.
and you can't play.

463
00:23:10.816 --> 00:23:12.347
What if I tried really hard?

464
00:23:12.483 --> 00:23:14.555
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to hit this ball.

465
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.390
It's because I'm white.
isn't it?

466
00:23:16.525 --> 00:23:18.757
No. Larry's white. So what?

467
00:23:18.893 --> 00:23:21.432
Larry's not white.
Larry's clear.

468
00:23:23.897 --> 00:23:24.858
-Good shot. Larry.
-That far?

469
00:23:24.994 --> 00:23:26.536
Get inside of this ball.

470
00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:30.536
Ooh. you clowns
can't beat that.

471
00:23:30.672 --> 00:23:32.206
It's the best shot I ever hit.

472
00:23:32.342 --> 00:23:35.376
Ugh. golf is so boring.

473
00:23:35.511 --> 00:23:37.442
Well. of course it's boring.

474
00:23:37.577 --> 00:23:40.150
The movie's got NBA players.
space aliens
and the Looney Tunes.

475
00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:43.412
If they made the scene any more
exciting. the audience's
head would explode.

476
00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:46.117
You feel that the NBA has
to face reality. don't you?

477
00:23:46.253 --> 00:23:48.215
Just gotta start looking
for some more dominant players

478
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:49.620
in places they
never looked before.

479
00:23:49.755 --> 00:23:51.054
Just look at the ball.

480
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.787
Visualize the shot
where you want it to go.

481
00:23:52.923 --> 00:23:54.095
Right. right. right.

482
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.598
Be the ball.

483
00:23:55.733 --> 00:23:57.267
-Be the ball.
- Get off the tee.

484
00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:58.634
-Why?
- You can't jump.

485
00:24:00.764 --> 00:24:02.231
I-- Yeah. Go on.

486
00:24:02.998 --> 00:24:04.132
Close to the pin.

487
00:24:04.268 --> 00:24:06.107
Close to the pin.
for dinner?

488
00:24:06.242 --> 00:24:07.872
Sounds good.
- I'll go close
to the pin.

489
00:24:08.008 --> 00:24:09.579
Okay.
-I'll take some of that.

490
00:24:12.547 --> 00:24:14.151
That's not bad.

491
00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.512
It's a good shot.

492
00:24:15.647 --> 00:24:16.685
Get down!

493
00:24:18.552 --> 00:24:19.655
Look at that spin.

494
00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:29.995
Hey. Since when
are golf balls magnetic?

495
00:24:31.398 --> 00:24:32.360
Come on.

496
00:24:34.963 --> 00:24:36.474
It is alive!

497
00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:45.041
My first hole in one. Yes!
-

498
00:24:45.177 --> 00:24:46.974
Oh!
- Don't say it.

499
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.178
You ever see this before?

500
00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.178
Larry?

501
00:24:50.314 --> 00:24:52.153
Nothing but the bottom
of the cup.

502
00:24:52.288 --> 00:24:55.351
Oh. God.
that's his ball.
-Yeah. yeah. it's my ball.

503
00:24:55.486 --> 00:24:57.660
-Sorry.
-Wait. wait.
Let me get a picture.

504
00:24:57.795 --> 00:24:59.723
All right. here we go.
You're gonna smile.

505
00:24:59.858 --> 00:25:01.856
You're reaching--
You're reaching for the ball
and then you smile.

506
00:25:01.992 --> 00:25:03.167
-Okay?
-Yes.

507
00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:04.934
And you think this is good.

508
00:25:05.069 --> 00:25:05.866
Just take the picture!
-All right. okay.

509
00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:08.506
Uh-oh.

510
00:25:16.108 --> 00:25:17.805
What kind of camera
is that?

511
00:25:17.941 --> 00:25:19.341
-Just a regular--
-Would you not point that
at me please?

512
00:25:19.477 --> 00:25:20.775
-And close the lens cap.
-I didn't do anything--

513
00:25:20.911 --> 00:25:21.809
Where'd he go?

514
00:25:24.114 --> 00:25:28.854
Fun fact...The temperature
at the center of the Earth
is 9.800 degrees.

515
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.660
No. no. no. no!

516
00:25:43.372 --> 00:25:46.874
Oh. look out for that
first step. doc.
It's a real lulu.

517
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.073
Bugs Bunny?

518
00:25:49.209 --> 00:25:51.338
Eh. you were expecting
maybe the Easter Bunny?

519
00:25:51.474 --> 00:25:52.840
You're a cartoon.
You're not real.

520
00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:54.077
Not real. eh?

521
00:25:54.212 --> 00:25:56.581
If I weren't real.
could I do this?

522
00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:02.752
Oh. look. Is that Michael?

523
00:26:04.694 --> 00:26:06.320
Why is Sylvester in the sewer?

524
00:26:06.456 --> 00:26:07.994
He's getting ready
to ambush Tweety.

525
00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:11.534
Bah!

526
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.564
Okay. but why is Taz
in the mailbox?

527
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.738
Because Tasmanian devils
are the number one cause
of mail tampering.

528
00:26:16.874 --> 00:26:19.032
Come on. Raven.
This isn't rocket science.

529
00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:20.869
Basketball!

530
00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:23.237
Ooh! I thought I saw...

531
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:25.748
I did.
I did see Michael Jordan.

532
00:26:26.748 --> 00:26:28.351
Eh. pardon me. Mr. Jordan.

533
00:26:31.082 --> 00:26:32.247
Your John Hancock. please?

534
00:26:32.383 --> 00:26:34.823
Back off! Let the doctor
take a look.

535
00:26:36.556 --> 00:26:37.720
Woops!

536
00:26:37.856 --> 00:26:38.921
A little high.

537
00:26:39.057 --> 00:26:40.596
-No.
-Going down.

538
00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:44.096
- No!

539
00:26:45.195 --> 00:26:48.166
-Oh!
-

540
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:51.268
So... what do you say
we go for a little spin?

541
00:26:52.143 --> 00:26:53.204
Yes.

542
00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:55.304
Hmm.

543
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.311
Now. let's see what we got
inside here.

544
00:26:59.845 --> 00:27:01.278
Say "ah".

545
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.351
All right.

546
00:27:04.486 --> 00:27:05.821
He's okay!

547
00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:08.725
What's going on here?

548
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.387
Why. Michael.
I thought you'd never ask.

549
00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:13.390
You see. these aliens
come from outer space

550
00:27:13.525 --> 00:27:15.594
and they want to make us slaves
in their theme park.

551
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.595
Eh. what do we care?

552
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.836
They're little.
So we challenge them
to a basketball game.

553
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.628
But then they show up
and they ain't so little.

554
00:27:21.763 --> 00:27:24.266
They're huge!
We need to beat these guys.

555
00:27:24.401 --> 00:27:25.808
because they're talking
about slavery.

556
00:27:25.943 --> 00:27:27.502
They're going to make us
do stand-up comedy.

557
00:27:27.638 --> 00:27:30.345
the same jokes every night
for all eternity.

558
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:32.047
What's he whining about?

559
00:27:32.182 --> 00:27:34.511
I know comedians
who would love that kind
of job security.

560
00:27:34.646 --> 00:27:38.486
Entertainment is indeed
the toughest of
the businesses.

561
00:27:38.622 --> 00:27:41.620
We're gonna be locked up
like wild animals and then
trotted out to perform

562
00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:46.530
for a bunch of low-brow.
bug-eyed. fat-headed.
humor-challenged aliens!

563
00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:49.298
Eh. what I'm trying
to say is...

564
00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:52.394
We need your help!

565
00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:54.033
Yeah. but I'm
a baseball player now.

566
00:27:54.168 --> 00:27:57.499
Right. And I'm
a Shakespearean actor.

567
00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:05.705
Stop the movie!

568
00:28:05.841 --> 00:28:08.378
If I laugh any harder.
I's gonna pee myself.

569
00:28:09.847 --> 00:28:11.149
Oops.

570
00:28:11.285 --> 00:28:13.482
That Bugs Bunny
is pretty loony.

571
00:28:13.618 --> 00:28:16.819
You want to see loony?
We'll show you loony.

572
00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:46.981
You guys want to watch
more of the movie?

573
00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:47.989
Yeah!

574
00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:53.021
Mike?

575
00:28:53.157 --> 00:28:54.930
Michael. it's Stan.

576
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.930
It's Stan Podolak.

577
00:28:57.066 --> 00:28:59.429
Look. I need you
to come out now. okay?

578
00:28:59.565 --> 00:29:01.695
Because you've got
a baseball game tomorrow.

579
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:04.005
I'd look pretty stupid
if you don't show up.

580
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.105
You think Michael's all right?

581
00:29:07.241 --> 00:29:08.542
Boy. I hate
to leave him like this.

582
00:29:08.678 --> 00:29:10.277
I'm sure he's fine.

583
00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:12.780
I think he just had to get away
from that Stan character.

584
00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:15.248
Oh. God.
He's pathetic. isn't he?

585
00:29:15.384 --> 00:29:17.585
Larry. I'm going to give us
both twos back there.

586
00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:20.684
-We weren't in any kind
of emotional state to putt.
-I think that's fair.

587
00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:22.054
Yeah.

588
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.756
Come on. Larry Bird!
To the Batcave!

589
00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:35.569
Look. I want to help. but
I haven't played basketball
in a long time.

590
00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:36.670
My timing's all off.

591
00:29:36.806 --> 00:29:38.341
Eh. we'll fix your timing.

592
00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:40.133
Look at our facilities.

593
00:29:40.268 --> 00:29:41.735
We've got hoops.

594
00:29:42.778 --> 00:29:44.309
We got weights.

595
00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:46.776
We've got balls.

596
00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:47.745
Whoa!

597
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.814
You sure do.

598
00:29:48.949 --> 00:29:50.282
This place is a mess.

599
00:29:50.417 --> 00:29:52.684
Mess? You're worried
about a little mess?

600
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:56.450
There's nothing here
a little spit-shine
wouldn't fix.

601
00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:58.653
-Spit-shine!
-Spit-shine!

602
00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:02.665
Remember. kids.

603
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.066
when your parents tell you
to clean your room. just
give it the old spit-shine.

604
00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:19.580
Lemony fresh.

605
00:30:19.715 --> 00:30:21.082
You guys are nuts.

606
00:30:21.217 --> 00:30:24.347
Correction.
We're Looney Tunes.

607
00:30:24.483 --> 00:30:26.381
And as such are
the exclusive property

608
00:30:26.516 --> 00:30:29.491
and trademark of
Warner Bros Inc.

609
00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.455
Ha-ha! Another butt!

610
00:30:32.957 --> 00:30:34.088
Mmuah!

611
00:30:41.703 --> 00:30:43.302
I'm here.

612
00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:45.733
Me. too.

613
00:30:47.005 --> 00:30:48.175
That hurt.

614
00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.280
Who are these guys?

615
00:30:52.416 --> 00:30:55.853
Well. uh.
remember the tiny aliens
I told you about?

616
00:30:56.849 --> 00:30:57.851
Oh.

617
00:30:57.986 --> 00:30:59.548
You heard of the Dream Team?

618
00:30:59.683 --> 00:31:02.490
Well. we're the Mean Team.
wussy man.

619
00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:03.826
Wussy man.

620
00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.854
-"Wussy man"?
-We're the Monstars!

621
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.696
M-O-N--

622
00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:10.494
Let's see what you got. chump.

623
00:31:11.728 --> 00:31:13.432
I don't play
basketball anymore.

624
00:31:13.567 --> 00:31:16.104
"I don't play
basketball anymore."

625
00:31:17.202 --> 00:31:18.903
Maybe you're chicken.

626
00:31:20.713 --> 00:31:23.369
I say. I resemble that remark.

627
00:31:23.505 --> 00:31:24.644
You calling me chicken?

628
00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:26.615
Hey. come here.

629
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.583
-Whoa!
-

630
00:31:32.254 --> 00:31:33.918
That's gonna
give me nightmares.

631
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:37.317
Ooh! Watch the footwork.

632
00:31:37.453 --> 00:31:39.219
Can you believe it?

633
00:31:39.354 --> 00:31:40.386
Whoa!

634
00:31:40.522 --> 00:31:42.794
Get out of the way!

635
00:31:45.535 --> 00:31:46.392
Ah!

636
00:31:46.528 --> 00:31:48.538
Hey. everybody!

637
00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.441
Look at your hero now.

638
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.710
You guys
are making a big mistake.

639
00:31:56.846 --> 00:31:58.438
You're all washed up...

640
00:31:58.573 --> 00:32:01.546
-Baldy.
-"Baldy"?

641
00:32:01.681 --> 00:32:04.411
He's not washed up.
Michael's the greatest ever.

642
00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:06.181
-Shut up.
-Doh!

643
00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.856
My poor little cranium.

644
00:32:11.991 --> 00:32:12.957
You okay?

645
00:32:13.093 --> 00:32:14.728
Yeah. Are you okay?

646
00:32:14.863 --> 00:32:16.564
-Hey!
-Whoops.

647
00:32:16.699 --> 00:32:20.597
You're not scared of them.
are you. Michael?

648
00:32:30.078 --> 00:32:31.140
Let's play some basketball

649
00:32:31.276 --> 00:32:32.246
Yeah!

650
00:32:36.885 --> 00:32:38.314
What do you doing?

651
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.617
I'm. uh... I'm fixing a divot.

652
00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:42.223
Oh.

653
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.028
He's fixing a divot.

654
00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:55.128
Fun fact... Schlesinger Gym
was named after
Leon Schlesinger.

655
00:32:55.264 --> 00:32:57.439
who was the original producer
of The Looney Tunes.

656
00:32:57.574 --> 00:33:00.835
and the gym is modeled
after a Warner Brothers
soundstage.

657
00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:28.432
Has anyone here
ever played basketball?

658
00:33:28.568 --> 00:33:31.237
-Um. I have...
-

659
00:33:31.373 --> 00:33:33.208
I'd like to try out
for the team.

660
00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:34.974
Hey.

661
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.039
Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.

662
00:33:37.174 --> 00:33:38.679
Lola?

663
00:33:38.815 --> 00:33:40.174
Yes?

664
00:33:40.309 --> 00:33:41.445
Hello.

665
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.620
Eh. my name is...
Bugs.

666
00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:46.985
-You wanna play
a little one-on-one. doll?

667
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.856
-"Doll"?
-Uh-huh.

668
00:33:48.991 --> 00:33:52.054
On the court... Bugs.

669
00:33:52.189 --> 00:33:53.621
Sure.

670
00:33:53.756 --> 00:33:55.989
-Oh. she's hot.
-

671
00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:00.070
-Ready?
-Yes.

672
00:34:01.997 --> 00:34:06.534
-I got it. I got it--
-

673
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:08.243
The girl's got some skills.

674
00:34:10.174 --> 00:34:11.510
Yes?

675
00:34:14.446 --> 00:34:17.414
Don't ever call me "doll."

676
00:34:17.549 --> 00:34:19.920
Indeed. she is not one of these

677
00:34:20.056 --> 00:34:22.224
or these. or any of these.

678
00:34:24.225 --> 00:34:25.590
-Check.
-

679
00:34:27.756 --> 00:34:30.292
Hey. nice playing with ya.

680
00:34:30.427 --> 00:34:32.458
She's... leaving?

681
00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:34.532
Yeah! Because one single basket
automatically gets you
on the team.

682
00:34:34.668 --> 00:34:36.269
Well. no wonder
they need Michael so bad.

683
00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:37.734
-Mais oui!
-Okay. Where's the ball?

684
00:34:40.402 --> 00:34:43.542
-Let's do some drills.
- Yeah.
let's do that.

685
00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:49.442
Can anyone lend me
a pair of sneakers?

686
00:34:49.578 --> 00:34:51.253
Uh. sneakers?

687
00:34:54.289 --> 00:34:56.223
Oh.
-Sowwy.

688
00:34:56.359 --> 00:34:57.828
Someone's gonna
have to go to my house

689
00:34:57.963 --> 00:34:59.459
and pick up my basketball gear.

690
00:34:59.595 --> 00:35:02.989
-To your house?
In 3-D land?
- Yeah.

691
00:35:03.124 --> 00:35:06.230
Would somebody
get this guy a mask? Ugh.

692
00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:08.599
And whatever you do...

693
00:35:08.735 --> 00:35:10.739
don't forget
my North Carolina shorts.

694
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.476
Your shorts? From college?
- Ooh-hoo.

695
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:16.480
I wore them under
my Chicago Bulls uniform
every game.

696
00:35:19.374 --> 00:35:22.013
So why can't Michael
get his own basketball shorts?

697
00:35:22.148 --> 00:35:23.147
Beats me.

698
00:35:23.283 --> 00:35:25.483
I too am the very lost.

699
00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:27.114
I've seen this movie
a hundred times

700
00:35:27.249 --> 00:35:29.153
and I still don't know why
he can't go back home.

701
00:35:29.288 --> 00:35:32.187
Well. we were in the movie
and we don't even know
the reason.

702
00:35:32.323 --> 00:35:35.264
Well. we can go online.
get more information
on the film.

703
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.007
Titans.
Can I have word with you?

704
00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:49.974
Listen up. I think these aliens
have something sinister planned
with this website.

705
00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.644
Why else would it
still be around
after all these years?

706
00:35:52.779 --> 00:35:54.883
Because it's super awesome.
That's why.

707
00:35:55.018 --> 00:35:56.848
But look! Jam Central.

708
00:35:56.983 --> 00:35:59.455
They're probably
using this site
to jam our computer.

709
00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:02.189
so we can't call for help
when they try to replace us!

710
00:36:02.324 --> 00:36:04.525
Stop being the paranoid. Robin.

711
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.927
Now let's figure out why MJ
can't go back home.

712
00:36:07.063 --> 00:36:08.794
Hmm. Here we go.

713
00:36:08.929 --> 00:36:10.858
It says here
that Michael had to join
the Looney Tunes

714
00:36:10.994 --> 00:36:12.592
because they wouldn't
let him go.

715
00:36:12.727 --> 00:36:15.197
Oh. now I get it!

716
00:36:15.332 --> 00:36:17.773
In order to prevent themselves
from becoming prisoners.

717
00:36:17.908 --> 00:36:20.308
the Looney Tunes
had to make Michael
their prisoner.

718
00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.973
Oh. yeah!
That makes total sense. yo!

719
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:26.712
And look! It says here that
the Michael Jordan's lawyer

720
00:36:26.848 --> 00:36:29.846
originally came up with
the idea for the Space Jam.

721
00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:33.386
Well. if anyone knows comedy.
it's lawyers.

722
00:36:33.522 --> 00:36:35.748
Okay. Titans.
You got your answer.

723
00:36:35.884 --> 00:36:39.858
Now can we please
get off this website
before something bad happens?

724
00:36:39.994 --> 00:36:42.826
Not yet. bro. I want to play
some of them classic games.

725
00:36:47.532 --> 00:36:48.964
I knew it!

726
00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:50.735
This website
is trying to hack our computer!

727
00:36:51.435 --> 00:36:53.503
Relax. dude.

728
00:36:53.638 --> 00:36:55.572
The computer is probably
just having an issue
with the outdated software.

729
00:36:55.707 --> 00:36:57.837
We can't take that risk!

730
00:36:57.972 --> 00:36:59.541
We need to shut it down now!

731
00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:04.844
Is he the dead?

732
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.683
Mm. no. He's still breathing.

733
00:37:06.819 --> 00:37:08.720
Great!
Let's get back to the movie.

734
00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:12.856
The view back here stinks.

735
00:37:13.996 --> 00:37:15.930
Whoa!

736
00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:17.660
Whoa! Oh. what?
-We're right in front
of Michael's house.

737
00:37:17.795 --> 00:37:20.431
-I knew that!
-

738
00:37:20.566 --> 00:37:22.105
Okay. let's go in this way.

739
00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:24.736
I say let's go in that way!

740
00:37:25.902 --> 00:37:27.970
He just never learns.

741
00:37:30.344 --> 00:37:32.212
Now. let me see.

742
00:37:32.347 --> 00:37:35.780
I must be very. very. close.

743
00:37:38.419 --> 00:37:39.584
-Mother!

744
00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.863
Nice digs.

745
00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:53.435
Well. well. I wonder
who that could be.

746
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.908
Twinkle. twinkle. little star.

747
00:37:59.044 --> 00:38:01.437
Shh! Everyone's sleepin'!

748
00:38:01.573 --> 00:38:03.406
I knew that.

749
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:06.578
Come on! Come on!
We gotta find
Michael's basketball stuff.

750
00:38:06.714 --> 00:38:08.608
Now. spread out
and search the place.

751
00:38:08.744 --> 00:38:10.414
Yes. sahib.

752
00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:11.880
Oh. brother!

753
00:38:12.015 --> 00:38:14.252
Here I am.
in the peak of my form.

754
00:38:14.387 --> 00:38:17.124
-playin' second banana
to some sort of a hare-brain.
-Yap. yap. yap.

755
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.728
Hmm. This could be useful.

756
00:38:19.863 --> 00:38:21.831
Ah-ha!

757
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:24.763
Michael must
really love underwear
to keep it in his trophy room.

758
00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:27.761
Oh! One of his shoes.

759
00:38:27.897 --> 00:38:29.834
Nope. Nope. Nope.

760
00:38:32.836 --> 00:38:34.542
Where is that other shoe?

761
00:38:36.344 --> 00:38:38.845
Where are you?

762
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:39.976
Eureka!

763
00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:43.111
Come to Papa.

764
00:38:45.747 --> 00:38:48.257
Nothing to see here.
kid. We're just
breaking and entering.

765
00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:49.821
What a fuzz-foot.
You are so clumsy.

766
00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:53.253
-Catch. featherhead.
-Thanks.

767
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.660
Well. time to go.

768
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:00.502
Did we get everything?

769
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.900
The shorts!

770
00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.166
In there?

771
00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:07.806
Okay. I'll check.

772
00:39:12.347 --> 00:39:14.307
I found... the shorts.

773
00:39:15.249 --> 00:39:16.518
Whoa!

774
00:39:18.483 --> 00:39:20.814
The pain!

775
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.621
I'm right behind ya. pal.

776
00:39:22.756 --> 00:39:24.553
Eh. that's none too reassuring.

777
00:39:24.689 --> 00:39:25.686
Nice puppy.

778
00:39:25.822 --> 00:39:27.023
How's about a bone?

779
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.230
No dice.

780
00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:31.230
What about a nice holiday ham?

781
00:39:31.366 --> 00:39:32.900
He ain't buyin' it.

782
00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:34.497
-Can't we
talk this over. Rover?
-Down. Beethoven!

783
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:37.066
Ooh! The kids are here.

784
00:39:39.638 --> 00:39:41.202
Give it to me. Charles.

785
00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.245
-Here you go. Bugs.
-Yeah! Thanks. kid.

786
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.016
Shoo! Shoo!

787
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:51.052
Bad dog!

788
00:39:51.187 --> 00:39:56.021
That is the last time
I'm ever working with dogs
or children!

789
00:39:56.157 --> 00:39:58.224
Bye-bye!
- Hey.
where're you going?

790
00:39:58.359 --> 00:40:00.126
Well. uh. you see.

791
00:40:00.261 --> 00:40:02.198
the Looney Tunes have
a big basketball game
comin' up.

792
00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.295
and. uh. your dad's gonna play.

793
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:05.530
All right!

794
00:40:05.666 --> 00:40:07.965
Yeah! But don't tell anybody.

795
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.442
Isn't it weird that these kids
have. like. no reaction

796
00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:14.770
to an animated rabbit
and duck in their house?

797
00:40:14.906 --> 00:40:18.181
No. Raven. There's nothing
weird about seein'
a bunch of cartoon characters

798
00:40:18.316 --> 00:40:22.111
stealing your dad's stuff
and then telling you
not to say anything about it!

799
00:40:22.246 --> 00:40:25.047
This is it!
This is it!

800
00:40:25.183 --> 00:40:27.186
I don't know
where you are. Michael...

801
00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:29.720
but wherever you are.
you obviously
enjoy being there!

802
00:40:29.856 --> 00:40:31.591
More than spendin' time
with me!

803
00:40:31.727 --> 00:40:33.426
You better hope
this Jordan character

804
00:40:33.562 --> 00:40:35.330
still knows how to play hoops.

805
00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.259
You and me both.
brudduh.

806
00:40:37.394 --> 00:40:40.628
Listen. how's this
for a new team name.

807
00:40:40.763 --> 00:40:42.133
"The Ducks!"

808
00:40:42.269 --> 00:40:43.472
Please!

809
00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:44.901
What kind of
Mickey Mouse organization

810
00:40:45.037 --> 00:40:47.476
would name their team.
"The Ducks?"

811
00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:49.704
So sue me.
It's just a suggestion.

812
00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:56.076
You're doin' it!

813
00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:58.546
You're becoming mighty! Go!

814
00:40:58.682 --> 00:41:00.045
Come on. guys.
No pain. no gain.

815
00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:03.186
Ha! That's two more butts!

816
00:41:03.322 --> 00:41:06.589
I don't hear it! What is it?

817
00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:08.927
Come on!
-Now shake it.
keep on sweating!

818
00:41:09.792 --> 00:41:11.197
Eh. guys?

819
00:41:11.332 --> 00:41:12.500
Yeah?

820
00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.329
Look who's
finally ready to play!

821
00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:24.481
Let's see
if I remember how to do this.

822
00:41:31.483 --> 00:41:32.346
Yes!

823
00:41:55.914 --> 00:41:56.942
Michael!

824
00:41:59.249 --> 00:42:01.546
Is it really you?

825
00:42:01.681 --> 00:42:05.386
Thank God. you're all right!
You're all right!

826
00:42:05.521 --> 00:42:08.050
Oh-ho-ho. I was so worried.

827
00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:10.723
Come on. Stan.
Don't hug me. please.

828
00:42:10.858 --> 00:42:12.420
-Sorry.
-What are you doin' here?

829
00:42:12.555 --> 00:42:14.896
I gotta take you back.
You've got baseball practice.

830
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:17.596
I can't. I'm helpin' my friends
in their basketball game.

831
00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:19.429
Let me get this straight...

832
00:42:19.564 --> 00:42:21.532
First. Michael quits the NBA
to play Minor League baseball.

833
00:42:21.667 --> 00:42:25.202
Now he's quitting baseball
to play cartoon basketball
for free?

834
00:42:25.337 --> 00:42:28.711
Yup! His career is really
going places in this film!

835
00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.905
If it doesn't bother you.
it doesn't bother me.

836
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:33.414
I mean... Let me help!
Let me help! I could help!
I can help! Let me help!

837
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:35.014
What can you do?

838
00:42:35.149 --> 00:42:37.250
Well. you know. I mean...
I may not be very tall.

839
00:42:37.386 --> 00:42:39.113
but I'm slow.

840
00:42:39.248 --> 00:42:41.755
-And large.
-And a dork.

841
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.293
I'll do anything. Michael!
Anything!

842
00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.222
-Anything?
-Anything.

843
00:42:48.027 --> 00:42:51.194
Come here.
Come here for a second.

844
00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:53.399
-Sit right here.
- Okay.

845
00:42:53.534 --> 00:42:55.034
Okay. no problem.

846
00:42:55.169 --> 00:42:58.933
All right! All right.
Let's go. team!

847
00:42:59.068 --> 00:43:01.605
You know.
if somebody gets injured.
we could see a lot of minutes.

848
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.877
I'm a cheerleader.

849
00:43:15.753 --> 00:43:17.287
Holds up.

850
00:43:17.423 --> 00:43:19.754
So the big game takes place
in Looney Tunes land?

851
00:43:19.889 --> 00:43:21.290
Yeah. so?

852
00:43:21.426 --> 00:43:23.358
So. why'd they call this movie
Space Jam?

853
00:43:23.493 --> 00:43:25.364
When the Jam
doesn't take place in space?

854
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.702
Because "Looney Tunes Land
In The Middle
Of The Planet Jam"

855
00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:30.068
doesn't have
a nice ring to it. Raven.

856
00:43:37.246 --> 00:43:38.606
Yes!

857
00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:42.619
Butt shot!

858
00:43:57.863 --> 00:43:59.735
Just get out of my way.

859
00:44:07.203 --> 00:44:09.111
-Ready?
- Yes!

860
00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.509
Let's go.

861
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.048
Okey-doke. Ready to go?

862
00:44:22.184 --> 00:44:23.850
Yeah. yeah. sure. sure.

863
00:44:23.985 --> 00:44:24.918
Riot!

864
00:44:26.963 --> 00:44:30.156
Ladies and gentlemen...

865
00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:32.662
the starting lineup for...

866
00:44:32.797 --> 00:44:35.336
The Tune Squad!

867
00:44:37.136 --> 00:44:39.200
Standing two-foot-four.

868
00:44:39.335 --> 00:44:42.168
The Wonder From Down Under...

869
00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:46.540
The Tasmanian Devil!

870
00:44:48.613 --> 00:44:51.480
- At small forward.

871
00:44:51.616 --> 00:44:55.247
standing a scintillating
three-foot-two...

872
00:44:55.383 --> 00:44:57.490
the "Heartthrob of the Hoops."

873
00:44:57.625 --> 00:45:00.987
Lola Bunny!

874
00:45:04.162 --> 00:45:06.033
At power forward.

875
00:45:06.168 --> 00:45:09.569
the "Quackster of the Courts."
Daffy Duck!

876
00:45:09.704 --> 00:45:12.335
Thank you. Thank you!

877
00:45:14.637 --> 00:45:17.909
Very funny.
Let's all laugh at the duck.

878
00:45:18.044 --> 00:45:20.383
And at Point Guard.

879
00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:22.575
standing three-foot-three...

880
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.911
four feet
if you include the ears...

881
00:45:25.047 --> 00:45:30.154
Co-captain of the Tune Squad...
"The Doctor of Delight."

882
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.690
-Bugs Bunny!
-Thank you! Thank you!

883
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:38.161
And now...

884
00:45:38.297 --> 00:45:40.768
the player-coach
of the Tune Squad...

885
00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:45.065
at six-foot-six
from North Carolina.

886
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.374
his Royal Airness.

887
00:45:47.509 --> 00:45:51.308
Michael Jordan!

888
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:57.048
Who? Is he a Looney Tune?

889
00:45:57.184 --> 00:45:59.188
Uh... Well...
Perhaps.

890
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:04.088
You guys ready?

891
00:46:04.224 --> 00:46:05.587
I'm set
to take it to the rack. Jack.

892
00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:07.788
Those Monstars'll
wish they'd never been born!

893
00:46:07.924 --> 00:46:10.791
-Guys. let's just go out
and have fun.
- Yeah!

894
00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:14.562
The challengers
for the Ultimate Game...

895
00:46:14.697 --> 00:46:17.772
all the way
from Moron Mountain.

896
00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:20.275
Oh. come on!
More introductions?

897
00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.800
Relax. girl!

898
00:46:21.936 --> 00:46:25.005
They're getting folks
hyped up for the game!

899
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.974
Yeah!

900
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:29.951
Go. Monstars!
Go. Monstars!
Go. Monstars! Go. go!

901
00:46:38.122 --> 00:46:40.326
What are you looking at?

902
00:46:47.965 --> 00:46:49.696
Cool shoes.

903
00:46:52.639 --> 00:46:53.670
Uh. Ugh.

904
00:46:53.805 --> 00:46:54.701
Ready?

905
00:47:00.944 --> 00:47:02.850
l got it. l got it. l got it.
l got the ball. l got the ball.

906
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.778
Coming through.
little boys.

907
00:47:04.913 --> 00:47:07.985
Who do they think they are.
the Detroit Pistons?

908
00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:11.157
Yes!

909
00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.091
Way to go. boys.

910
00:47:13.227 --> 00:47:15.523
Did you see the moves
on that one?

911
00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:17.031
Come on. come on.
show me somethin'.

912
00:47:17.166 --> 00:47:19.128
What you got?
Come on. show me somethin'.

913
00:47:19.264 --> 00:47:20.133
You ain't got no hands.

914
00:47:22.038 --> 00:47:22.964
Huh?
- Whoops.

915
00:47:23.099 --> 00:47:24.300
The duck!

916
00:47:24.436 --> 00:47:26.000
Yo.
D-up on the duck. man.

917
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.336
Yeah!

918
00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:28.801
- Oh.

919
00:47:28.936 --> 00:47:30.977
-

920
00:47:31.113 --> 00:47:33.113
This game is
out of control. yo.

921
00:47:33.248 --> 00:47:35.648
Call the Commissioner Gordon.
Call him!

922
00:47:41.622 --> 00:47:43.183
Oh. my.

923
00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:45.895
She was wide open.

924
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.391
Come on. baby.
I'm open. I'm open.

925
00:47:47.526 --> 00:47:48.991
Hit me up. hit me up.
School's open. baby.

926
00:47:49.126 --> 00:47:51.197
Yeah. yeah. Yeah!

927
00:47:51.897 --> 00:47:53.402
Ha!

928
00:47:55.469 --> 00:47:56.606
Watch the screen!
Watch the screen! Watch him!

929
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:58.271
Coming your way.
coming your way.

930
00:47:58.406 --> 00:47:59.540
Hey. man. I'm gonna
make him do something.

931
00:47:59.675 --> 00:48:00.503
Get him!

932
00:48:05.114 --> 00:48:07.511
Wait. The Monstars
are up now by six

933
00:48:07.646 --> 00:48:09.675
and we're in the second period?
How'd that happen?

934
00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.510
Because this is
the Ultimate Game.

935
00:48:11.646 --> 00:48:13.720
It transcends space and time.

936
00:48:13.856 --> 00:48:15.518
And apparently logic. too.

937
00:48:17.523 --> 00:48:19.424
Nice shot. Mr. J.

938
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.359
Hey. hey. hey. come on.
Come on. Get back on defense.

939
00:48:23.027 --> 00:48:24.023
Way to go!

940
00:48:24.159 --> 00:48:25.792
MJ! MJ!

941
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.866
Red light.

942
00:48:29.001 --> 00:48:30.133
Feed me! Feed me!

943
00:48:30.268 --> 00:48:32.304
Feed you? Feed me!

944
00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:36.402
- Oops. Uh-oh.

945
00:48:36.537 --> 00:48:37.747
Bad little putty tat!

946
00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:39.047
I'll take that.
thank you.

947
00:48:40.081 --> 00:48:42.008
Here. don't try this at home!

948
00:48:46.054 --> 00:48:47.754
-Wai--
-You goin' somewhere?

949
00:48:47.889 --> 00:48:49.422
May I remind you. sir.

950
00:48:49.558 --> 00:48:52.558
that physical violence is
patently against the rules?

951
00:48:52.693 --> 00:48:54.063
Yeow!

952
00:48:54.198 --> 00:48:58.066
Did you order original recipe
or extra crispy?

953
00:49:02.037 --> 00:49:03.732
-Let's go. Come on.
-Me?

954
00:49:03.867 --> 00:49:05.970
-Oh. boy. I'm ready.
I can do this.
-Mouse?

955
00:49:06.105 --> 00:49:07.870
You picked the mouse?

956
00:49:08.006 --> 00:49:09.571
I love basketball.
I've always loved basketball.

957
00:49:09.707 --> 00:49:11.545
-Do you love basketball?
- Uh-huh.

958
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.081
-You're big. I bet you're good
at basketball.
- Right.

959
00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:14.377
I'm small. but I'll try really.
really hard

960
00:49:14.513 --> 00:49:15.974
-to be good at basketball.
-Okay.

961
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:17.647
-Really I will.
I always try hard.
-Yeah.

962
00:49:17.782 --> 00:49:18.220
My mom says "Try your best
in everything you do--"

963
00:49:22.321 --> 00:49:25.956
-Try to get by me. doll.
-"Doll?"

964
00:49:26.092 --> 00:49:27.590
-Whoa!

965
00:49:29.262 --> 00:49:30.764
-You go. girl.

966
00:49:30.899 --> 00:49:32.291
Don't ever call me...

967
00:49:32.426 --> 00:49:33.935
"Doll."

968
00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:37.168
She is not
the consumer product!

969
00:49:37.303 --> 00:49:39.005
-Nice shot.
-Thanks. Bugs.

970
00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.006
Hmm? Where's your defense. boy?

971
00:49:42.141 --> 00:49:43.470
I got you right here.

972
00:49:46.607 --> 00:49:48.611
Piece of pie? Pork chop?

973
00:49:48.746 --> 00:49:51.350
-Some sorbet. perhaps?
- Yeah!

974
00:50:06.361 --> 00:50:07.368
Half-time.

975
00:50:09.837 --> 00:50:11.868
Holey putty tat.

976
00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:13.667
We're better than them.
- Yeah. man.

977
00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:15.442
We got it goin' on.
One more half

978
00:50:15.578 --> 00:50:17.174
-and we're on our way. man.
- We got 'em. boys.

979
00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.871
Moron Mountain. here we come.

980
00:50:20.007 --> 00:50:21.807
We're gonna be slaves.

981
00:50:21.943 --> 00:50:23.214
Come on. guys.
Keep your head up.

982
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:24.480
Got whole another half to play.

983
00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.366
It's the boss.

984
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:44.000
Hello. Mr. Swackhammer.

985
00:50:44.135 --> 00:50:45.901
All right.

986
00:50:46.037 --> 00:50:48.807
Not bad for the first half.
but we gotta keep this up.

987
00:50:48.942 --> 00:50:50.375
Hey. no problem.

988
00:50:50.511 --> 00:50:51.705
-We stole the--
-We stole the talent. boss

989
00:50:51.841 --> 00:50:53.339
from the best players
in the NBA.

990
00:50:53.475 --> 00:50:54.841
From the NBA?

991
00:50:54.977 --> 00:50:56.282
And it was little.
uh. uh. uh. grand-mama.

992
00:50:56.418 --> 00:50:58.087
-What was it. Larry Johnson?
-Shut up!

993
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.915
I smell something.

994
00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:03.926
It's probably
all that nasty cigar smoke.

995
00:51:04.062 --> 00:51:05.554
We have been playing
really hard.

996
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.624
Yeah.
-Not you. you idiot.

997
00:51:10.164 --> 00:51:11.991
It's coming from over here.

998
00:51:12.127 --> 00:51:13.832
- That locker!

999
00:51:13.967 --> 00:51:15.599
Yeah!

1000
00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.673
-Look!
-

1001
00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.606
It's the chubby boy.

1002
00:51:20.742 --> 00:51:22.172
Ah.

1003
00:51:22.307 --> 00:51:25.240
It smells like a spy.

1004
00:51:28.284 --> 00:51:29.911
You guys need
a publicist?

1005
00:51:30.046 --> 00:51:32.116
- Look.

1006
00:51:32.252 --> 00:51:34.289
-I know we're down.
- Oh. yeah.
let's hear the story.

1007
00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:36.550
But I've been in this situation
many times before.

1008
00:51:36.686 --> 00:51:38.660
Oh. this is a piece of work.
-We can still win this thing.

1009
00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:40.394
-It's not over with.
We gotta come together.
-

1010
00:51:40.529 --> 00:51:41.623
Oh. yeah.
-We gotta believe in ourselves.

1011
00:51:41.758 --> 00:51:43.198
We can come back
and win this game.

1012
00:51:43.334 --> 00:51:44.093
Yeah. right.
That's gonna help us.

1013
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:48.971
Looks like Stan just had

1014
00:51:49.107 --> 00:51:50.798
a close encounter
with a bug-zapper.

1015
00:51:50.934 --> 00:51:54.968
The Monstars.
The Monstars!

1016
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:01.012
Ooh. that's gotta hurt.
- You all right. Stan?

1017
00:52:01.148 --> 00:52:02.642
The Monstars.

1018
00:52:02.778 --> 00:52:05.120
The Monstars

1019
00:52:05.256 --> 00:52:08.183
stole the talent
from the NBA players.

1020
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.755
So that's what happened
to those guys.

1021
00:52:13.891 --> 00:52:17.766
I think
we should forfeit.

1022
00:52:17.902 --> 00:52:19.065
Yeah.
-Listen.

1023
00:52:19.201 --> 00:52:20.831
I didn't get dragged down here

1024
00:52:20.967 --> 00:52:22.662
just to get my butt whipped
by a bunch of ugly Monstars.

1025
00:52:22.797 --> 00:52:24.138
I ain't goin' out like that.

1026
00:52:24.273 --> 00:52:25.733
We're lettin' 'em
push us around.

1027
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.271
We gotta fight 'em back.

1028
00:52:28.407 --> 00:52:29.671
We gotta take it to them.

1029
00:52:29.807 --> 00:52:31.013
We gotta get
right in their faces.

1030
00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:33.644
-What do you say?

1031
00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:36.042
Are you with me or not?

1032
00:52:41.986 --> 00:52:44.154
Eh. finished?
Eh. great speech an' all. doc.

1033
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.790
Eh. you had 'em riveted.

1034
00:52:45.925 --> 00:52:49.159
-But. er. didn't you
forget somethin'?
-What?

1035
00:52:49.294 --> 00:52:50.859
Your secret stuff.

1036
00:52:58.774 --> 00:53:00.176
Wow.

1037
00:53:00.311 --> 00:53:03.212
Whoa! Nice deltoids.
-Play along.

1038
00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:08.215
Eh. stop hogging it. Mike.
We're your teammates.

1039
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:11.152
-Secwet stuff?

1040
00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.584
Secret Stuff?

1041
00:53:12.719 --> 00:53:14.984
You wouldn't hold out
on us. would you?

1042
00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:17.149
No. I mean. I didn't think
you guys really needed it.

1043
00:53:17.284 --> 00:53:20.359
I mean. you're so tough.
You're competitive.

1044
00:53:20.495 --> 00:53:23.626
We're also chicken. son.
We need it bad.

1045
00:53:23.762 --> 00:53:24.866
-Hey!
-Can I have a little drink?

1046
00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:26.733
I'd like some of that.

1047
00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:28.060
-If I could just--
- Yeah. Can I have
a sip. please?

1048
00:53:28.196 --> 00:53:29.403
You know.
this goes against

1049
00:53:29.538 --> 00:53:31.740
everything they taught me
in health class.

1050
00:53:31.876 --> 00:53:32.938
Do you wanna win or not?

1051
00:53:33.073 --> 00:53:34.408
Bottoms up.

1052
00:53:36.409 --> 00:53:38.173
-Yummy.

1053
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:40.215
All right. How about we go out
and kick some alien butt. huh?

1054
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.277
Let's go!
How about it. huh? Ready?

1055
00:53:42.412 --> 00:53:43.681
Yeah.

1056
00:53:45.648 --> 00:53:46.684
Let's go!

1057
00:53:50.451 --> 00:53:52.752
Check out all those classic
Looney Tunes characters.

1058
00:53:52.888 --> 00:53:54.489
There's lady head turtle body.

1059
00:53:54.625 --> 00:53:56.022
And the chicken feet man.

1060
00:53:56.157 --> 00:53:58.824
Whoa. this whole crowd
is freaky. yo.

1061
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.334
Looks like them animators just

1062
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.797
copy-and-pasted these fools
over and over.

1063
00:54:02.933 --> 00:54:05.066
I never
noticed that before.

1064
00:54:05.201 --> 00:54:07.538
This weirdo is over here.
here. here. and here.

1065
00:54:07.674 --> 00:54:09.734
And these cats.
and this guy. and her?

1066
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.103
This is crazy. man!

1067
00:54:11.238 --> 00:54:13.942
Okay. Okay. Sorry.
Back to the movie.

1068
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.598
Coming through.
-Hey.

1069
00:54:34.628 --> 00:54:35.469
Bugs.

1070
00:54:37.138 --> 00:54:38.230
Special delivery.

1071
00:54:39.772 --> 00:54:41.473
- Great!

1072
00:54:41.609 --> 00:54:44.104
-Whoa! Boo.
-

1073
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:52.112
Eh. nice kaboom. Wile E.

1074
00:54:57.852 --> 00:54:59.285
Again with the guns?

1075
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.726
Don't worry. Mom and Dad.
I'll take care of it.

1076
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.103
Let's teach them
a lesson.
- Ah. man.

1077
00:55:19.642 --> 00:55:21.246
Hey...

1078
00:55:21.382 --> 00:55:23.077
Oh. man. look at that one.

1079
00:55:25.218 --> 00:55:26.084
Nice butt!

1080
00:55:29.556 --> 00:55:31.184
Dunk.

1081
00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:32.684
You ain't
going anywhere. chump.

1082
00:55:34.732 --> 00:55:37.058
Er. going up.
- You're mine. boy! Ooh.

1083
00:55:38.928 --> 00:55:41.403
-Slammy!
- Yes!

1084
00:55:42.597 --> 00:55:43.564
Hello!

1085
00:55:43.699 --> 00:55:45.132
Cyborg's fun fact.

1086
00:55:45.267 --> 00:55:47.903
Pepe Le Pew was
originally named. "Stinky."

1087
00:55:48.039 --> 00:55:51.010
Hey. he shares
the same nickname as Robin.

1088
00:55:51.145 --> 00:55:52.106
Two points.

1089
00:56:00.919 --> 00:56:02.358
Ooh.
this will be good.

1090
00:56:04.358 --> 00:56:06.886
Yo. check out that butt!

1091
00:56:07.022 --> 00:56:08.826
-

1092
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.200
-Okay. birdie.
-Uh-oh.

1093
00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.543
-

1094
00:56:23.679 --> 00:56:26.646
-

1095
00:56:38.726 --> 00:56:40.628
I'm gonna step outside
for a minute

1096
00:56:40.763 --> 00:56:43.559
to get some fresh air.
Cyborg. you should join me.

1097
00:56:43.694 --> 00:56:44.763
No. thanks. I'm good.

1098
00:56:46.193 --> 00:56:47.396
-Ow!
-It wasn't a question.

1099
00:56:47.531 --> 00:56:48.602
Okay. okay.

1100
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.737
Here's the plan.
I'm going to search their ship

1101
00:56:53.873 --> 00:56:55.741
-while you be on the lookout.
-Fine.

1102
00:57:06.418 --> 00:57:08.352
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be
on the lookout.

1103
00:57:08.488 --> 00:57:11.384
Yeah. and I'm looking out
to see what's inside this
cool spaceship.

1104
00:57:11.519 --> 00:57:13.822
Fine. Then help me search
for clues that will expose

1105
00:57:13.957 --> 00:57:15.154
what these aliens are planning.

1106
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.993
They're not
planning anything. dude.

1107
00:57:17.128 --> 00:57:19.063
All that's in here is stuff
from the movie.

1108
00:57:19.199 --> 00:57:20.161
Aha!

1109
00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:25.600
Perhaps their secret lies in
this bottle of secret stuff!

1110
00:57:25.736 --> 00:57:27.202
I wouldn't do that.

1111
00:57:27.337 --> 00:57:29.411
That water has been in there
for like 25 years.

1112
00:57:29.547 --> 00:57:31.909
There's a secret in here.
You'll see!

1113
00:57:34.943 --> 00:57:37.112
Must get to secret.

1114
00:57:38.949 --> 00:57:42.347
-

1115
00:57:42.483 --> 00:57:45.589
Okay. But I wonder
what's behind this door.

1116
00:57:45.724 --> 00:57:47.925
Wait. It says "Do not open."

1117
00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.928
Because they're
obviously hiding something.

1118
00:57:52.629 --> 00:57:53.601
You were right!

1119
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.104
I was right.

1120
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.169
Will you give it up. dude?
They're not hiding anything.

1121
00:58:02.305 --> 00:58:04.270
Then what about this
examination chair?

1122
00:58:04.406 --> 00:58:05.776
I'm sure they're planning
to use this

1123
00:58:05.912 --> 00:58:07.845
to perform weird experiments
on us.

1124
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:10.076
-like replacing our bodies.
-No. man.

1125
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:12.279
That's just Daffy's chair. See?

1126
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:16.822
Ain't I a stinker?

1127
00:58:20.461 --> 00:58:21.561
Oh. good. They're back.

1128
00:58:21.696 --> 00:58:23.125
Now we can
watch more of the movie.

1129
00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.595
All right. guys.
we're right back in this game.

1130
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:29.435
-Come on. now.
let's play some tough defense.
-

1131
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:31.372
Why didn't you get this guy?

1132
00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:33.131
He's a baseball player.

1133
00:58:33.267 --> 00:58:34.542
Yeah. boss. a baseball player.

1134
00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.143
Looks like a basketball player
to me.

1135
00:58:37.279 --> 00:58:38.712
Yeah. me too.

1136
00:58:38.847 --> 00:58:40.942
Shh! He's the one I want
for Moron Mountain.

1137
00:58:41.078 --> 00:58:42.210
-Hey.

1138
00:58:44.782 --> 00:58:46.511
Are you talkin' to me?

1139
00:58:46.647 --> 00:58:48.649
Yeah I'm talkin' to you.
You want a piece of me?

1140
00:58:48.784 --> 00:58:50.057
Come and get it.

1141
00:58:51.522 --> 00:58:52.528
Uh-oh!

1142
00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:56.554
What did you have in mind?

1143
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:58.624
What about we raise the stakes
a little bit?

1144
00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.964
Mm-hmm.

1145
00:59:00.862 --> 00:59:02.365
Interesting.

1146
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.069
Gross!

1147
00:59:04.205 --> 00:59:06.639
He just blew secondhand smoke
in Michael Jordan's face!

1148
00:59:06.775 --> 00:59:10.044
He is the worst of
all the villains.

1149
00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:11.469
If we win...

1150
00:59:11.605 --> 00:59:13.345
you give the NBA players
their talent back.

1151
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:15.276
But what if we win?

1152
00:59:16.818 --> 00:59:18.679
-If you win?
- Uh-huh.

1153
00:59:18.814 --> 00:59:20.219
You get me.

1154
00:59:20.354 --> 00:59:21.522
Good deal. boss.

1155
00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:22.587
I like that!
-Eh. doc...

1156
00:59:22.723 --> 00:59:24.054
you think that's a good ide--

1157
00:59:27.193 --> 00:59:29.158
You'll be
our star attraction...

1158
00:59:30.997 --> 00:59:33.200
You'll sign autographs
all day long.

1159
00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:38.002
And play one-on-one
with the paying customers.

1160
00:59:38.138 --> 00:59:40.168
How does he expect Michael
to sign autographs

1161
00:59:40.304 --> 00:59:41.874
and play basketball
at the same time.

1162
00:59:42.009 --> 00:59:44.010
Really? You're still
asking questions. girl?

1163
00:59:44.145 --> 00:59:46.312
Don't you know by now
that none of this makes sense?

1164
00:59:46.448 --> 00:59:48.243
It's Looney! Looney!

1165
00:59:50.284 --> 00:59:51.250
Deal.

1166
00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.150
All right!
- Yeah!

1167
00:59:54.286 --> 00:59:55.888
The boss don't
playin' do he?

1168
00:59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.623
I don't think you should have
done that. doc.

1169
01:00:00.759 --> 01:00:02.092
I have faith in my team.

1170
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.261
Crush 'em!

1171
01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:09.462
It's feedin' time.
boys!

1172
01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.577
Ye-ga. er. ba-bee.
er. ba-bee--

1173
01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:18.670
There's butts number nine
and ten. yo!

1174
01:00:18.805 --> 01:00:21.648
I'll tell you brother.
this match is gettin' ugly!

1175
01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:24.778
Oh. yeah! There's a chop
to the head!

1176
01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.111
A body slam!

1177
01:00:26.246 --> 01:00:28.185
Another chop! A kick!

1178
01:00:28.321 --> 01:00:31.088
It's not looking good for
the Tune Squad. brother!

1179
01:00:35.393 --> 01:00:39.801
But Mommy. I don't want to go
to school today.

1180
01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:43.562
I want to stay home
and bake cookies with you.

1181
01:00:45.772 --> 01:00:47.605
This is
gonna be fun!
- I'm open! I'm open!

1182
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.203
Lola! Lola! Heads up!

1183
01:00:49.339 --> 01:00:52.338
Oh!
- Belly flop!

1184
01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:54.643
This butt fills
half the screen. yo!

1185
01:00:55.915 --> 01:00:59.615
Oh. my! Bugs!

1186
01:01:00.854 --> 01:01:02.981
-Bugs!
-Is this your man?

1187
01:01:04.658 --> 01:01:05.956
Are you okay?

1188
01:01:06.092 --> 01:01:10.155
Me? Oh. yeah. I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1189
01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.662
Oh. Bugs... thank you.

1190
01:01:12.798 --> 01:01:14.968
Oh...it was nothin'!

1191
01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:18.205
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1192
01:01:26.479 --> 01:01:28.249
I need a break from all of
this intense sports action.

1193
01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:29.683
You ain't kidding. mama.

1194
01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:30.980
All this suspense over
who's gonna win

1195
01:01:31.115 --> 01:01:32.579
has got my tummy tied in knots.

1196
01:01:32.714 --> 01:01:35.454
I know how it ends
and I'm still feeling anxious.

1197
01:01:36.655 --> 01:01:37.988
Dude. bad vibes.

1198
01:01:38.123 --> 01:01:39.821
I know what will
calm those nerves.

1199
01:01:39.956 --> 01:01:41.389
Snack time. baby!

1200
01:01:43.425 --> 01:01:45.294
Help yourself to
whatever you want.

1201
01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.068
Now. this is mine!

1202
01:01:56.204 --> 01:01:57.845
Mmm. peanut butter.

1203
01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.720
Here we go.

1204
01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:07.883
Can you reach those chips
for me. please?

1205
01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:09.417
Get it yourself.

1206
01:02:09.553 --> 01:02:12.519
But you're so tall
and your hands are so big.

1207
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.827
Really? You mean it?

1208
01:02:16.962 --> 01:02:18.730
You're also a strong leader.

1209
01:02:18.866 --> 01:02:20.428
And we can appreciate someone

1210
01:02:20.564 --> 01:02:23.098
who forces others
to act against their will.

1211
01:02:23.234 --> 01:02:24.900
You would make
a great Nerdluck.

1212
01:02:25.036 --> 01:02:27.305
Wow! You really mean that?

1213
01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.267
Yeah. totally.
- Oooh. you'd be great.

1214
01:02:29.403 --> 01:02:30.640
Did you hear that. Titans?

1215
01:02:30.775 --> 01:02:32.077
Whatever.

1216
01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:34.374
You know what?

1217
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.949
Maybe you aliens
aren't so bad after all.

1218
01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.950
Told you there was nothing
to worry about.

1219
01:02:39.086 --> 01:02:41.754
Now let's get back
to the movie!

1220
01:02:43.817 --> 01:02:46.860
I could have been
a contender!

1221
01:02:46.995 --> 01:02:49.891
The Monstars!
The Monstars!

1222
01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:51.360
Clear!

1223
01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:11.244
Okay. We need a fifth player.

1224
01:03:11.379 --> 01:03:12.754
Hey. Coach. listen.

1225
01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:14.447
You got anymore of
that secret stuff?

1226
01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:15.988
I think it's startin' to
wear off.

1227
01:03:16.124 --> 01:03:18.719
It didn't wear off.
It was just water.

1228
01:03:18.855 --> 01:03:21.990
You guys had the "special
stuff" inside of you all along.

1229
01:03:22.126 --> 01:03:23.762
Yeah. Yeah. I-I knew that.

1230
01:03:23.898 --> 01:03:25.928
But. listen. you got any more?

1231
01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:27.495
Yah. I'll get
a double one.
- Can I have some too?

1232
01:03:29.804 --> 01:03:31.334
-Stan?
-Yeah! Eh. m-me?

1233
01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.366
-You're in at center.
-

1234
01:03:34.502 --> 01:03:36.175
Just guard the big guy. okay?

1235
01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:38.736
Guard him? Guard him?
Guard him? I'll smother him!

1236
01:03:38.872 --> 01:03:40.814
I'll be all over him
like a cheap suit!

1237
01:03:40.949 --> 01:03:43.078
I'll be on him
like stink on rice!

1238
01:03:43.213 --> 01:03:44.512
I tell you. he's goin' down!

1239
01:03:51.552 --> 01:03:52.857
Michael. over here! Over here!

1240
01:03:52.993 --> 01:03:54.826
Over here. I'm open! I'm open!

1241
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.225
Come on! Come on!

1242
01:03:56.361 --> 01:03:58.794
Now. you got it!
Get the fat one.

1243
01:04:02.998 --> 01:04:03.898
Yes!

1244
01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.969
Ah-ha! Nice shot!

1245
01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:09.944
Big man pancake.

1246
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:14.883
Haha! Look they made
a "Flat Stanley."

1247
01:04:19.617 --> 01:04:20.988
Let's get him outta here!

1248
01:04:42.037 --> 01:04:42.905
Eww!

1249
01:04:44.974 --> 01:04:46.343
Oh. my!

1250
01:04:53.281 --> 01:04:54.315
How'd he do that?

1251
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:56.117
Oh. anybody could do that. doc.

1252
01:04:56.252 --> 01:04:58.524
Even you. Watch this.

1253
01:04:58.659 --> 01:04:59.690
Watch this.

1254
01:04:59.826 --> 01:05:01.254
See? No sweat.

1255
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.294
This is Looney Tune Land.

1256
01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:10.071
Ten seconds to go?
Thanks for tellin' me... doc.

1257
01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.203
I hate to be the bearer of
bad news. Your Airness.

1258
01:05:13.339 --> 01:05:15.171
but if you don't find
a fifth player.

1259
01:05:15.307 --> 01:05:17.735
your team will
forfeit the game.

1260
01:05:17.871 --> 01:05:19.205
-Now the rules apply?
-Forfeit?

1261
01:05:19.341 --> 01:05:21.110
Precisely. Sir Altitude.

1262
01:05:21.245 --> 01:05:23.018
No way. We'll find someone.

1263
01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:26.218
Da-Da-Da-Da-
Da-Da-Da-Da!

1264
01:05:28.019 --> 01:05:29.486
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1265
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:31.951
I didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!

1266
01:05:32.087 --> 01:05:34.258
Hey!

1267
01:05:34.394 --> 01:05:36.624
Perhaps I could be
of some assistance.

1268
01:05:37.964 --> 01:05:39.893
That's our fifth guy.

1269
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:42.601
Let's go. Now you get to live
up your dream. Let's go.

1270
01:05:42.736 --> 01:05:44.703
All right.

1271
01:05:44.838 --> 01:05:46.969
-All right. We need to
score two points--
-Here's how I see it.

1272
01:05:47.104 --> 01:05:48.437
-Duck...
-Yes?

1273
01:05:48.572 --> 01:05:50.371
You kick it in to
the girl bunny...

1274
01:05:50.506 --> 01:05:51.704
-Yeah?
-...down in the post.

1275
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.477
You dish it back out
to the guy bunny.

1276
01:05:53.613 --> 01:05:55.416
-Got it!
-You swing it around to Mike
over here.

1277
01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.479
-Bill. Bill. Bill. Bill.
-You go to the hole
and dominate!

1278
01:05:57.615 --> 01:05:59.482
-We're on defense.
- Oh. yeah.

1279
01:05:59.617 --> 01:06:02.084
Whoa. ho-ho.
I don't play defense.

1280
01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:04.618
-Typical.
-All right. you're gonna have
to listen to Mike on this.

1281
01:06:04.754 --> 01:06:06.656
-Listen up.
-Somebody steal the ball.

1282
01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:09.958
get it to me. and I'll score
before the time runs out.

1283
01:06:10.093 --> 01:06:12.295
-Don't lose
that confidence! Okay!
-I won't. All right.

1284
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.698
Paws and wings in here!
All right!

1285
01:06:13.833 --> 01:06:15.003
Let's go.

1286
01:06:20.902 --> 01:06:24.745
This is why I was born.
I thrive on pressure.

1287
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.610
Excuse me? Uh. uh. s-sorry!

1288
01:06:26.746 --> 01:06:28.441
Yo. yo. yo. Yo. Easy on the
trousers. Daf. Easy. man. Easy.

1289
01:06:28.576 --> 01:06:30.379
Pardon me. Uhm. Mr. Murray.

1290
01:06:30.515 --> 01:06:32.119
something's really been
buggin' me.

1291
01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.990
-Yeah?
-Just how did you get here.
anyway?

1292
01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:37.620
Producer's a friend of mine.

1293
01:06:37.755 --> 01:06:39.322
Just had a teamster come
and drop me off. you know.

1294
01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:43.054
Uh-huh. Well.
that's how it goes.

1295
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:45.532
Hey. you see this. uh. kind of
chunky fellow over here?

1296
01:06:47.096 --> 01:06:48.102
Uh-huh.

1297
01:06:50.404 --> 01:06:53.105
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Oh. that's good! Oh. yes!

1298
01:06:53.241 --> 01:06:54.767
All right. let's do it!
You the duck!

1299
01:06:54.902 --> 01:06:57.838
Now. let's all play fair. Here.

1300
01:06:57.973 --> 01:06:59.942
Yo. spaceman. don't choke now!
Come on. come on.

1301
01:07:00.077 --> 01:07:02.244
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
-It's gut check time!

1302
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.086
-

1303
01:07:05.987 --> 01:07:07.181
This must be mine.

1304
01:07:07.317 --> 01:07:08.716
Whoaho-ho!

1305
01:07:08.851 --> 01:07:10.689
This belongs to me.
I'm goin' this way.

1306
01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:12.192
-I'm goin' left!
I'm goin' left!
-Look left! Look left! Yes!

1307
01:07:12.327 --> 01:07:14.392
Whoa-ho-ho! Don't ever
trust an Earthling!

1308
01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:17.028
What'cha got?

1309
01:07:19.762 --> 01:07:22.231
Get the rabbit!
Get the girl!

1310
01:07:22.366 --> 01:07:24.228
Come on! Come on! I'm open!

1311
01:07:24.364 --> 01:07:25.972
I'm o--!

1312
01:07:26.107 --> 01:07:28.206
-That's mine!
-Not today!

1313
01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:29.744
Hey!
- Come on! Ohh!

1314
01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.076
Bring it on. dude.

1315
01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:33.609
Whoopsie daisy! Woo-hoo!

1316
01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:35.677
You're mine!

1317
01:07:40.484 --> 01:07:42.288
Number twelve with the assist!

1318
01:07:44.759 --> 01:07:45.753
Mike. I'm open!

1319
01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:49.691
Never mind.

1320
01:08:27.164 --> 01:08:29.404
The Tunes win!!

1321
01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:32.234
This proves once again that
Michael Jordan is the solution

1322
01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.768
to all of life's problems!

1323
01:08:33.903 --> 01:08:36.241
That was a great stretch for
the basket too.

1324
01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:37.506
You know. you really
got some skills.

1325
01:08:37.642 --> 01:08:39.776
You might be able to
play in the NBA.

1326
01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:43.578
Thanks. Mike.
I'll probably quote you
on that.

1327
01:08:43.714 --> 01:08:45.184
But I'm gonna take this
opportunity

1328
01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:46.678
to retire from
the game of basketball.

1329
01:08:46.814 --> 01:08:48.588
-No. come on. man.
-No.

1330
01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:51.082
No. I'm gonna retire right now
and that's all there is to it.

1331
01:08:51.217 --> 01:08:53.619
I'm gonna go out on top.
undefeated and untied.

1332
01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:55.319
That's the way it's gonna be.

1333
01:08:55.455 --> 01:08:56.956
You go on ahead and celebrate
with your teammates and--

1334
01:08:57.092 --> 01:08:59.030
No. come and help us. man.
Celebrate with us.

1335
01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:01.702
No. I-I-I'd like to. but
I have to ice down my knees
right away. okay?

1336
01:09:01.838 --> 01:09:03.304
They're startin' to go.

1337
01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.140
-All right. Good-bye. man.
-All right. See you.

1338
01:09:06.941 --> 01:09:08.141
Are you sure?

1339
01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:11.912
Yes. Definitely sure.
Definitely.

1340
01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:15.239
And the best part of the movie
has left the building.
ladies and gentlemen.

1341
01:09:15.374 --> 01:09:18.151
Thank you. Bill Murray.
You're a national treasure.

1342
01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.016
-Losers!
- Sorry.

1343
01:09:20.152 --> 01:09:21.152
Choke artists!

1344
01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.819
He's the real choke artist!

1345
01:09:22.954 --> 01:09:25.353
Makin' everyone choke on
that nasty smoke like that.

1346
01:09:25.489 --> 01:09:26.788
Mm-hmm. That ain't right.

1347
01:09:26.923 --> 01:09:29.459
The party's over!
Get in the spaceship.

1348
01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:31.127
Why do you take it
from this guy?

1349
01:09:31.263 --> 01:09:33.667
Because he's bigger.

1350
01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:35.131
He's bigger...

1351
01:09:35.267 --> 01:09:37.839
Than we used to be.

1352
01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.333
Right!

1353
01:09:39.469 --> 01:09:40.469
What are you doing?

1354
01:09:40.604 --> 01:09:41.569
Ooooooooh!

1355
01:09:41.704 --> 01:09:43.567
-Hey! Wait!
-Come here!

1356
01:09:45.941 --> 01:09:49.745
No! What? Hey! Let me go!

1357
01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.223
Had it in ya all the time.
didn't you?

1358
01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.158
One thing. though.
Pass me the ball. Bugs.

1359
01:10:07.294 --> 01:10:09.033
You gotta give my friends
their talent back.

1360
01:10:09.168 --> 01:10:10.134
Oops.

1361
01:10:10.269 --> 01:10:12.538
-Do we have to?
-Yeah.

1362
01:10:12.673 --> 01:10:14.500
-Yeah.
-It was part of the deal.
Touch the ball.

1363
01:10:16.175 --> 01:10:18.174
Oh. okay.

1364
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:20.209
Uh. fair is fair.

1365
01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:21.645
There you go. Touch it.

1366
01:10:28.815 --> 01:10:30.551
That was so much fun.

1367
01:10:30.686 --> 01:10:33.157
I feel so... insignificant.

1368
01:10:33.292 --> 01:10:35.056
My clothes don't fit.

1369
01:10:35.192 --> 01:10:38.429
-What a trip.
-
I'm up for another one.

1370
01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:39.960
Michael!
Do you know what time it is?

1371
01:10:40.096 --> 01:10:41.802
Se-seven fiftee--

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:43.603
quarter past seven.

1373
01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.937
Exactly. You've got
a baseball game
in five minutes.

1374
01:10:46.072 --> 01:10:47.902
Okay. Take this.

1375
01:10:49.075 --> 01:10:49.909
Is it safe?

1376
01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.411
Yeah. Put in my bag.

1377
01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:54.280
It's kind of...

1378
01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.308
I really enjoyed playing
with you guys.

1379
01:10:56.444 --> 01:10:58.987
-You guys got a lot of. uh...
- Uh-huh?

1380
01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:00.783
-A lot of. uh...
- Yes?

1381
01:11:00.918 --> 01:11:03.055
Well. whatever it is.
you got a lot of it.

1382
01:11:06.026 --> 01:11:07.427
Well. gotta go.

1383
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:10.055
-Bugs?
-Eh. Mike?

1384
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:12.693
-Stay outta trouble.
-You know I will.

1385
01:11:12.828 --> 01:11:14.461
-Come here!

1386
01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:16.265
-Ohh!
-

1387
01:11:17.735 --> 01:11:19.373
Ah-hoo. hoo. hoo!

1388
01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:22.601
Wow!
What a great movie!

1389
01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:23.969
You were right. Titans.

1390
01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:25.913
They didn't come here
to replace us.

1391
01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.379
-Yes. we did.
-What?

1392
01:11:28.514 --> 01:11:30.414
Why do you think
we were so eager

1393
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:31.913
to watch the movie
with you?

1394
01:11:32.048 --> 01:11:33.880
We thought you guys
just wanted to hang.

1395
01:11:34.015 --> 01:11:36.557
No. What we wanted
was your powers.

1396
01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:40.623
And we can't believe
you just gave 'em to us.

1397
01:11:40.759 --> 01:11:42.462
We heard you Titans
were dummies.

1398
01:11:42.597 --> 01:11:44.699
But we didn't realize
you were that dumb.

1399
01:11:47.062 --> 01:11:49.268
Yeah. Stupid.

1400
01:11:49.403 --> 01:11:50.632
Okay.
You've had your fun.

1401
01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:52.036
Now give us back
our powers.

1402
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:53.341
You got it!

1403
01:11:56.573 --> 01:11:58.610
We're the Titans now!

1404
01:12:50.527 --> 01:12:51.928
Where are we?

1405
01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:54.600
Is it just me or does
this place look familiar?

1406
01:12:55.466 --> 01:12:56.767
See!

1407
01:12:56.902 --> 01:12:58.571
I knew those aliens
couldn't be trusted!

1408
01:22:55.066 --> 01:22:56.828
Well. that's all. folks!

1409
01:22:56.964 --> 01:22:59.770
Eh. be-eh that's my line.
Eh. be-eh that's--

1410
01:22:59.905 --> 01:23:01.299
Step aside. babe.

1411
01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.103
Let a star do this.

1412
01:23:03.238 --> 01:23:04.605
That's all-- Whoa!

1413
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.607
That's all. folks!

1414
01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.643
Can I go home now?
