- Dr. Philip is new Dean!

We get second class treatment.

95
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.900
- Dad!
- Hey. Indu! Where are you going?

96
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.090
Just leave him alone!

97
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.410
Hey. Indu! Mental! Stop.

98
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.220
Dad. today's destiny is
the result of our past actions.

99
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.960
What we do today
decides our future!

100
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.490
I won't complain about today.

101
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.700
It's my payback. Cheers.

102
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.900
Payback?

103
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.400
What happened?

104
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.170
To earn more overseas.

105
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.840
I defied my dad.

106
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.810
No!

107
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.100
- I betrayed him.
- What?

108
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.190
You betrayed Grandpa?

109
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.000
You refused to discuss Grandpa.
What happened?

110
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.500
I feared you kids
would despise me

111
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.090
so I never told you
of my betrayal.

112
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:18.090
But it's time you knew
we have a big family.

113
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.980
This is my dad.

114
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.750
Your Grandpa.

115
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.990
Mom!

116
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.990
My sisters.

117
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:46.990
My brother.

118
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:53.440
In my house and our village.
Dad was the head.

119
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.380
My dad was there for
every household.

120
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.280
Though deadly diseases
were cured with medicines.

121
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.820
our villagers died
of simple diseases.

122
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.000
My dad rued that.

123
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.260
He tried hard to bring
doctors to our town.

124
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.430
But it's not city wages.

125
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.800
Doctors never came.

126
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.240
To end this. Dad made me a doctor.

127
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.900
Once my education ended.
I went home.

128
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.750
This is from Sai Baba temple.
All will be fine.

129
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:50.000
- Serve buttermilk.
- Sir! Come. - How is she?

130
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
- Take her to the city hospital.
- We want our hospital.

131
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.500
A boy gets your name;
a girl. Madam's name.

132
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.240
Wait a bit.

133
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.500
- Bro-in-law is here!
- Carry on.

134
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.710
- Brother! Greetings. - Hello.

135
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:10.550
I didn't expect this hospital
to be finished.

136
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.000
- You did it.
- God's blessing.

137
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.300
- Bro. Chandrashekar is at home.
- Call him here.

138
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.500
You better go there.

139
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.900
I'll be back. Take charge.

140
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.000
- Chandu! - Dad!

141
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.130
People are waiting. Let's go!

142
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.090
- One minute.
- Auspicious time is near.

143
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.500
- Listen... - Everyone's there.

144
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.770
- Dad. listen. - Talk later.
- Listen. please.

145
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.800
- Who's this?
- She's Kausalya. - Oh!

146
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.000
- You're in love. I'll get you married.
Come. - Listen. - It's time.

147
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Please. She studied medicine.

148
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
- Her family settled in America.
- OK.

149
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.800
I want to marry her
and settle in America.

150
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:55.890
A-America?
I want to marry her
and settle in America.

151
00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.390
A-America?

152
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.700
And this hospital?

153
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.850
- I didn't know about it.
- You need a hospital.

154
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.990
I built it.
I made you a doctor.

155
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.800
It's my and Government money.

156
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.500
We trusted you'd be its doctor.

157
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.500
- Why America?
- America is huge.

158
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.400
I can live in luxury
and earn more.

159
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.800
I'll make it big.

160
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.300
You'll be big

161
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.000
- but my village?
- This village.

162
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.500
A compounder can handle
these wretched farmers.

163
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.790
Wretched farmers?

164
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.090
You were born to a farmer.

165
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.390
Because they grub in the dirt.
we eat.

166
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.620
Their hard owned wages

167
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.500
made you a doctor
aiming for America.

168
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.290
- Honey!  - You...

169
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.090
Stop this during wedding talk.

170
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:14.850
Honey. come. bless the couple.

171
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.490
Shut up!

172
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.490
What do you say?

173
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.950
- I promised them I'd go.
- So!

174
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.850
I must go to America.

175
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.840
Go!

176
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.990
- Dad!
- Don't call me Dad.

177
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:43.050
Uselessness to one's village
equals death.

178
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:48.400
From now. you're dead to me.

179
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.390
Later on. when you know I die.

180
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.800

184

185

188
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.990
I'll go.

189
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.990
Come on! Half a day is wasted.

190
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.470
This hospital can't be opened.

191
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.990
Forgive me.

192
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:17.530
That issue estranged you?
A simple sorry solves it.

193
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.490
It's a simple thing.

194
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.500
You don't know Grandpa.

195
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:31.970
He'd die for someone loyal
but won't forgive disloyalty.

196
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:37.900
He won't let me go home.

197
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:45.950
My dream of overseas work.
living in luxury.

198
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.090
was my mistake.

199
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.490

200
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.900

202
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.460
Hi. Dad! Today's destiny
depends on our past actions.

203
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.800
Likewise. tomorrow's destiny
depends on our present actions.

204
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.340
Our future depends on today.

205
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:39.000
So. I'll meet Grandpa.
I'm off to India today.

206
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.980
Grandpa won't be mad
at his grandson.

207
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:51.160
I'll say sorry for you.
I'll try hard.

208
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.690
I'll reconcile you.

209
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.950
Wish me good luck. Love you both!

210
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:06.000
Dad. I'm scared.
What will happen?

211
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.450
Excuse me! Can I take a picture?

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.990
<i>Papiha! We're here.</i>

362
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.990
Mom!

Sweetheart. 2 mins...

I'll help her.

368
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.490
Sir. don't risk a kid.
Please come back.

369
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.500
Papiha! Papiha!

370
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.800
Mom!

371
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.370
Sir! Thank you so much.

372
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.800
- Uncle! - Uncle's coming.

373
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800
Stay still.

374
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.090
- Mom! - Papiha!

375
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.990
Mom!

376
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:22.090
Be careful. lad!

377
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.740
Slowly!

378
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:38.880
I'm OK. don't worry. Papiha's OK.

379
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.510
Down!

380
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.200
- Down! Down! - Talk Telugu?
- Let me down. - Down?!

381
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.930
- Like that. yes! Slowly.
- Take care.

382
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.660
<i>Go slow.</i>

383
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.100
<i>Careful!</i>

384
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.090
<i>Dear!</i>

385
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.090
Move. everyone. Move!

386
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.540
Papiha! I almost lost you.
I got scared. Dad.

387
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.040
You're mad? Why take her up?

388
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.340
Let it go.

389
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.990
Drink water.

390
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.650
<i>Move aside.</i>

391
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.860
"Let evil effects."

392
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.900
"bad minded people. negativity."

393
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.990
"all be destroyed."

394
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.000
Hey. man! Grandma
wants you here.

395
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.990
It's Saturday. She won't talk.
I'll talk for her.

396
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.090
I'm Chandrasekhar's son.
your grandson.

397
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.990
Hey! Why'd you come here?

398
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:28.090
- Old Ma asks who you are.
- Shut up! - Grandma.

399
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.360
Not talking. but asking.
Baby Girl.

400
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.090
This boy came from London.

401
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.510
He'll learn farming
and stay with us.

402
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.500
Yeah! Learn from him.

403
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.850
Dad's a big farmer.

404
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.950
- Go. man. - You!

405
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.850
Don't heed him.

406
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.390
- Show him around.
- Yes. Pa-in-law.

407
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.090
Make yourself at home.

408
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.230
- Your name?
- Abhi. I mean Abhiram!

409
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.960
- Ram! OK.
- Ram! Nice!

410
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.800
- I'll take my bag. - It's OK.
- Wow! A palace.

411
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.400
It's his ancestral property.

412
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.170
- You're...
- Kasi. son-in-law.

413
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.500
- He's a son-in-law.
- Introduce me. - Work!

414
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.920
Without his sons. Pa-in-law
needs his daughters. so we stay.

415
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.990
I'm the dad of the little girl
you saved a few minutes ago.

416
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.000
O God. we're glad you saved her.

417
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.370
Chitra. Balaraju's niece.
lives here.

418
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.890
- Sweets. Uncle.
- Thank you. sweetheart.

419
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.050
It's superb!
Hey! Come. come...!

420
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.090
See. from London. Here you go.
my favourite chocolate.

421
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:04.390
- Thanks. Uncle. - Kiss?
- Thank you. sweetheart.

422
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:09.190
- Aunt sent this. You'd eat it?
- I will.

423
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:13.930
- Foreign. is why.
- Dad cooks this.

424
00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.300
Why not your Mom?

425
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.800
- Mom died long ago.
- Oh! That's so?

426
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.170
- I lost my parents too.
- I'm very sorry.

427
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.640
I'm sorry about your mom.

428
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.950
- Friends? Shake hands.
- Friends. - Yeah!

429
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.620
But I like the whole thing.

430
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.290
Big house! Grandpa. Grandma.
so many people.

431
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.900
Knowing family makes me happy.

432
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.590
- Want breaking news? - What?
- Grandpa garlanded your photo.<i>(= dead!)</i>

433
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.490
What? Not funny.

434
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.790
Didn't I say? I know Dad well.

435
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.410
How's Mom?

436
00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.180
You met Bangari?

437
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.750
What's he do?

438
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:09.620
He's mysterious. He doesn't
live at home. Dunno why.

439
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.490
- Be careful. Grandpa is
sensitive and emotional. - Mm.

440
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.730
Though far away. I'm glad they're happy.

441
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.700
Don't disturb that happiness.

442
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.670
- Bye!
- Bye! Come back soon.

443
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.700
- Goodnight. dad! Goodnight. Indu!
- Good night! - Miss you both.

444
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.570
Yes! Come back.

445
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.440
<i>Useless guy!</i>

446
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.180
My dad was an M.P. (Member Parliament)
I'm an M.P.!

447
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.850
Next election.
you'd be M.L.A.

448
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:43.490
- Dare go to Cock fights?
- Don't hit!

449
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:51.890
Your Uncle Balaraju let
his son off. not your son.

450
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:57.890
Last election. I begged
Uncle for support and got none.

451
00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:01.240
All down the drain!

452
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.000
- God's finger wrote.
- He's my bro-in-law.

453
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
He envies our growth.

454
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.500
So? Drinking coffee?
We let him off? Let's act!

455
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:21.000
Skip anger in politics. Beg.

456
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.700
Once done. discard them.

457
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.750
We must set up
the beer factory.

458
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:40.000
Focus on that.
Handle Bro-in-law later.

459
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:13.780
Good morning. Sir!
I mean. 'Suprabatham'.

460
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.780
- 'Subhodayam.'
- S..Subhodayam.

461
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.000
Recall your mother tongue.

462
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.900
- Sure. Guru. it's Karate?
- 'Karasamu.'

463
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.950
- Can I? - You'll hurt!

464
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:31.290
No pain. no gain. Guru.
I mean. learning can hurt.

465
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.030
Oh! Greetings. Guru (Master)!

466
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:39.990
- That's not the greeting.
- Oh. How? - Narayana!

467
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.930
- He learned fast.
- I took 2 weeks.

468
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.990
- Extraordinary.
- A genius!
- He learned fast.
- I took 2 weeks.

469
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.400
- Extraordinary.
- A genius!

470
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.190
- Talk Telugu. - Huh?
- Oh. you did.

471
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.490
- Guru? - Hit me!

472
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.850
Whoa. Guru. ready.

473
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.700
Teach him to hit you well.

474
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.810
Look here.

475
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.990
Guru! He's...

476
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.600
Satya!

477
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.000
- Sister! - Aunt.
- Hi. Satya!

478
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.990
Hi. Uncle!

479
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.490
Grandpa!

480
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.190
I missed you!

481
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:08.790
- You missed Festival.
- Why so thin? - Not eating well?

482
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:12.490
I studied for semester exams
day and night...

483
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.090
to get good marks.

484
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.190
- Balaraju's 'mo' is proud.
- What logic!

485
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.990
Ram!

486
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.590
Yes. Master.

487
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.900
This is Satya.

488
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:33.570
He came from London
to study farming.

489
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.450
- Hi! - Greetings!

490
00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:40.790
Learn culture from him.

491
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:45.490
- Hey! Get ready to leave.
- OK. sure!

492
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.900
Where's Grandma?

493
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.850
- Today's boring. - As always.
- Take this. - Why?

494
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:02.900
- Why so down?
- No reason.

495
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:09.700
When Dad threw me out.
our buffaloes looked at me

496
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.620
so unsurprised.

497
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:19.400
- Still...  - They
felt bad for a mate. Silly!

498
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.900
- Call me a buffalo? - Any siblings?

499
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.930
- A little sister.
- Hi. - Hi.

500
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.200
- What's your dad do?
- He's...

501
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.500
- What? - A doctor. sir.
- Hey!

502
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.880
- Hey!
- Run! Run! Grab this.

503
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.940
<i>Run! Run!</i>

504
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.120
Run! I'll kill you.

505
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.190
Useless idiots!

506
00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.190
Jobless guys.

507
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:56.090
Guru. why's a big hospital
locked?

508
00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:00.900
Its doctor died
before it opened.

509
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.840
- Useless guy!
- Oh. Grandpa.

510
00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.410
Don't praise him.

511
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:11.990
You unquestioningly
let a stranger stay?

512
00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:16.790
- Your husband's idiotic!
- Stop it. - Quit that talk.

513
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:22.090
He's a good boy.
Balaraju accepts no-one easily.

514
00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.950
Exactly. Tell her.

515
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.990
Hey! Why's everyone crowded here?
What's up?

516
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.790
Hey! Stop it.

517
00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.990
Let him.

518
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.090
Stop it!

519
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.870
You're here?

520
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.640
Think I'm scared
if you bring people?

521
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.580
Why get involved?

522
00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.990
This is no cock fight.

523
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.190
It's a Government deal.

524
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.320
Don't dare butt in.

525
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:30.500
Stop it. all of you. Stop...!

526
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.560
Hey!

527
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.800
Respect elders.

528
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.630
Hey! Stop. Stop. I said!

529
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.600
Why fight?

530
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.190
Why butt in?
Wasn't I talking to him?!

531
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.600
Hey. hey! Shut up.

532
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:52.850
- Our mistake. He's immature.
- OK. What's up?

533
00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:54.380
Good morning.

534
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:59.760
- According to Indian Constitution...
- What's wrong with Telugu culture.

535
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.600
- Use Telugu. - Telugu isn't
as powerful as English.

536
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.060
Say it in Telugu?

537
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.530
- 'Pratyekantaka' (Indian Constitution).
- Talk Telugu. - I did.

538
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:13.040
It's hard to explain
Sections in Telugu.

539
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.550
Hello. No Sections here.

540
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:19.500
This land is only for
all types of farming.

541
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.850
Bro-in-law decided
by consensus.

542
00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:28.990
If you harp on Sections.
we'll break your bones.

543
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.050
Understand? Go.

544
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.890
- Ask your dad to meet me.
- Sure. Come.

545
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:35.890
Come!

546
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.920
Everyone. go!

547
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.390
Hey! Come. come.

548
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:54.190
Hello!

549
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:07.100
- Hey. come. come.

550
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.500
Hi! Very nice to see you here.
I can't believe it.

551
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.660
You charmed Grandpa?
You're a rock star! So nice.

552
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.090
Be direct. Come to the point.

553
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.340
Don't tell Grandpa
we met at a pub.

554
00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:28.110
- Delete the photos.
- If you're scared. why do it?

555
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.170
Oh!

556
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.820
Isn't it wrong?

557
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.420
Whoever it is.

558
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.940
you kiss him?

559
00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.760
Shit!

560
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.620
OK. I'm sorry.

561
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.830
Please. delete those photos.

562
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.760
Why should I?

563
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.490
OK. How much?

564
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.400
Buy me this town?

565
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.090
Nope. You cannot buy me. y'know.

566
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:04.090
Still. I wanna be my happiest.

567
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.000
Do that.

568
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.050
- I'll delete the photos.
- Who are you?

569
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.950
Don't act smart.

570
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.100
Delete or else!

571
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.990
Guru!

572
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.990
Disgusting!

573
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:35.140
- Tomorrow...
- Excuse me! Wow!

574
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.990
- What's this?
- Festival of Lights. - Why?

575
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.580
Wives pray for family prosperity.

576
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.590
- Oh! Why's she here?
- To pray for a good match.

577
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.220
How about single men?

578
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.900
- Good question!
- We've no ritual

579
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.900
- so we got them.
- What?

580
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.460
Oh. we got good wives
without prayers.

581
00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.800
- We look after you.
- Cool down.

582
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.870
- He means no-one's
as good as you. - Sure.

583
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.580
- I went to a Hyderabad pub.
Know how girls go? - How?

584
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.080
Short skirts. Skulling drinks.

585
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.780
Like this...ouch!
And break legs.

586
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.490
For Grandma. For Grandpa.

587
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.120
Sweets?

588
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:22.090
- Fill my hand. - Open your mouth.

589
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.460
Wonderful!
What is this?

590
00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.300
- Just burns.
- Why not treat it?

591
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.940
Women get burns cooking.

592
00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:38.800
- I'll get ointment.
- It's OK. I'm used to pain.

593
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.990
Ointment won't take it away.

594
00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:50.090
I won't let you be in pain.
Back soon.

595
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.000
Good boy!

596
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.900
Baby! Are you feeding us?

597
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:05.000
Oh God! I'll do it now.
Chitra! Come quickly.

598
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.910
Aren't you ashamed in public?

599
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.440
My God!

600
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:36.230

631
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.910
I got rich

632
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.900
yet couldn't build
such a mansion.

633
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.550
Sure. Nod and accept
what he says.

634
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.350
You too.

635
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.990
Recall why we're here.
Deal carefully.

636
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:32.660
Hello. Uncle!

637
00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.730
- You came about the factory?
- Wow! Uncle.

638
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.490
To the point. Here.

639
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.700
- Take a chair.
- It's fine.

640
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.040
I'm like your son.

641
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.400
My brother pushes
his sons away.

642
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.320
Dad! Don't butt in.

643
00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.950
Uncle. the point is...

644
00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:04.000
Dad has long planned a beneficial
project for locals by seeking

645
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.500
Delhi's factory sanction.

646
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.700
If the factory's here.
directly....

647
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.270
Directly 2000 people.

648
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.440
- Indirectly...
- 4000 people.

649
00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:19.700
- You explain then. - Go on.
- After this.

650
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.610
around it. build
a shopping complex.

651
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:27.020
- multiplex. post office.
- Sir! Not a post office.

652
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.850
International I.T. corridors.

653
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:35.820
Like so. Our village
can develop big.

654
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:39.900
- This factory is- ?
- Beer! - Beer? - Beer.

655
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.600
Areas nearby will buy it.

656
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.240
It's worth $US300 million.

657
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:52.900
- Your partnership is 10%.
- $30 million.

658
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:58.950
For helping us set this up.

659
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:03.750
- that's why. - $30 million.

660
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:09.600
It's a great deal
just to shut my trap.

661
00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:17.070
- This factory profits us all.
- Yes. Uncle. - Wow.

662
00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:23.500
But many will get addicted
to this poison you'll make

663
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.880
and lie drunk on the road.

664
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:32.650
This factory's run-off
will affect fertile land.

665
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.650
Acres will die.

666
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:38.150
Cultivation will be lost.

667
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:42.290
What will our children eat?

668
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.490
Land is our Mother.

669
00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:50.090
I won't let you turn fertile land
into a graveyard.

670
00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:54.970
Come. Didn't I say.

671
00:58:54.970 --> 00:59:01.980
as long as he lives.
this factory won't be set up.

672
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:06.990
Even if I die.
I won't let it happen.

673
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:12.190
Let's go. We wasted our time.

674
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:21.520
~Adoration to Lord Vishnu~

675
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.270
Whose photo?

676
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:28.770
- Your elder uncle. dear.
- Baby!

677
00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:30.990
Coming. dear.

678
00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:44.450
God!

679
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:47.460
He mastered it. Pa-in-law.

680
00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:51.090
Sir. watch out!

681
00:59:56.430 --> 01:00:01.170
- No need!
- He's old and fears losing.

682
01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:04.640
You shut up...Pa-in-law!

683
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.190
Old man has it.

684
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.090
Anyone want to bet with me?

685
01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.060
Sorry. sorry! Mistake.

686
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.290
Hit him on the head instead.

687
01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:29.260
Bangari Sir. quiet!
I missed.

688
01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.850
- What's all this?
- Guru. please.

689
01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:35.590
- Pa-in-law! Careful.
- Uncle. you'll be hurt.

690
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:39.330
Grandpa. get my head.

691
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:42.990
- Oh. old man.
- <i>Please stop.</i>

692
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.600
- <i>He's a boy!</i>
- Uncle. eat Aunt's sweet.

693
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.660
- Here. - Chitra. move!

694
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:53.180
You didn't once hit me.
Shame. shame. Guru.

695
01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:58.220
- Uncle! - Don't get between.

696
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.950
<i>- What's going on?
- Pa-in-law!</i>

697
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.870
<i>Stop. Pa-in-law.</i>

698
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.900
Dad! Stop. Dad.

699
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.090
Satya. come.

700
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.140
- Guru. too old.
- Grandpa!

701
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.090
You dared me to fight. Yaaah!

702
01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:24.090
Let's stop. You're too old.

703
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:39.570
<i>- You hurt yourself?
- Hold it.</i>

704
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.900
Bring the First Aid box.

705
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.070
- Thanks. - I warned you.
- You're great!

706
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.310
Forgive me.

707
01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:51.280
- Why? - I broke an important photo.

708
01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.180
Who said it is?

709
01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.950
His photo's here-

710
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:59.850
he'd be important.

711
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:03.990
Hey! Remove that.

712
01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:21.990
- What is it?
- You resolved our worry.

713
01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:45.490
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes...!

714
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:52.000
Hey! Thank you! Thank you...!
Love you!

715
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.900
- Sorry! - Is he gay?

716
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.890
Anyone here?

717
01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.900
Chitra...!

718
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.700
- Come here! - <i>God!</i>

719
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.640
Hurry! Undo my bodice.

720
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.370
Hurry. It's too tight.

721
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.190
Undo it quickly.

722
01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:32.090
Well? Be quick.

723
01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.980
<i>Oh God!</i>

724
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.050
Aah! Mom!

725
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:48.290
Ssh! Phone...! If you tell.
I'll show your photos.

726
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.500
Why'd you scream?

727
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.230
What happened?

728
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.090
- I tested my loud scream.
- What?

729
01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:00.400
- She's mad.
- Aren't I busy?

730
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.840
She's a devil.

731
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:09.090
A loud scream test?!

732
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.390
Towel off.

733
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.760
Towel off. honey.

734
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.090
Now!

735
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.190
Hit the gym.

736
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:28.200
That guy's a risk to
that home's girls.

737
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.670
- Yes. Uncle. Elders are right.
- You still know?

738
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:35.790
- Crap. - Don't pick on me.

739
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:40.580
Cut his ponytail;
evict him. Vow it.

740
01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:44.390
- It's our blood. not liquor.
- Watch me!

741
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:49.190
He blackmailed me with
the photos. What to do?

742
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.380
Come see me?
No delay. honey.

743
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.650
I tell Grandpa?
Show him photos?

744
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.190
Please...! Don't tell. - Yep.

745
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:21.860
- No-one must see us. - Yeah.

746
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.190
- Let's go out. - Uhuh.
- Then decide.

747
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:29.990
What's this?
Your skirt has a pocket.

748
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.670
Wow! Beautiful!

749
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.770
Honey. this place is looking so sexy!

750
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:40.540
Isn't this place romantic?

751
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.590
Do I give. or do you take?

752
01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:49.650
- You give. I'll take.
- Wow! So talented.

753
01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:52.490
You're that brave?

754
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:59.150
Uncle!

755
01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.430
Scared?

756
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:04.200
- What are you doing?
- Boy!

757
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.430
Play with kids.

758
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:11.340
not with your phone battery.
Give up the phone.

759
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.130
- What phone...?
- Give it to me.

760
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:18.090
I have no phone.

761
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:28.120
- What's up?
- Two men are down.

762
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.330
- I'm good at martial arts.
- Mar- karate!

763
01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:34.360
But I prefer no fighting.

764
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.430
So give up the photos.

765
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.000
I vow on Mom-
I have no cell phone.

766
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.840
- Check me. - Oh God!
You'll hit us up close?

767
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:51.180
- No. no...! I'll never hit you.
- <i>Hey. hit 1 for free?</i>

768
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.410
Who are you?

769
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.550
Why go to my home?

770
01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:58.490
He won't talk.

771
01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:05.190
Make him drink this
to spit out the truth.

772
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:11.400
Sir! Sir..! Please.
I promised Dad I won't drink.

773
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.090
I'll tell Guru I'm leaving.

774
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.500
Drink first.

775
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.490
- Sir! Sir...! - Drink first.

776
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
Boss!

777
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.380
Please. sir!

778
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.980
- Please. sir! Please!
- Drink.

779
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:35.690
Now he'll blurt the truth.

780
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:37.830
Phone!

781
01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:41.030
You dare take photos
and blackmail her?

782
01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:43.990
<i>Hit him.</i>

783
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:50.000
- Bro! They got me drunk.
- Uncle! - Please. help me.

784
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.690
Despite differences.
we're family.

785
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:58.500
- Outsider. - Bro. chill.
- This once... - Sorry.

786
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:02.990
- I'll handle him.
- What'd you say?

787
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.990
No! No! No! No!

788
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:10.610
What a hit! Do it again.

789
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:26.970
Don't! I'm family.

790
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.600
- Don't hit. - How are you family?

791
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.000
Oh my god!

792
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.950
Who is this guy?

793
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.090
What's this he's doing?

794
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:45.910
Where's he going?

795
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:22.660
- He's not ordinary.
- It's unsafe here.

796
01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.690
Let's go.

797
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:38.090
Get up! C'mon.

798
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.510
I said don't fight.
Now you see?

799
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:49.190
So. Mr. Pillipeethri (Useless).
Go home. uh?

800
01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:54.090
<i>You wait.</i>

801
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:59.990
Where's his damn phone?

802
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:04.300
Honey! What's up?

803
01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.090
Want this?

804
01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:08.990
- Guru! - No!

805
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:20.290
Up. Hands up.

806
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.990
A bit more.

807
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:35.000
- Yours. You were looking for it.
- How'd it get in my pocket?!

808
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.210
Idiot!

809
01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:49.800
You got Bangari to hit me

810
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.510
so you can delete the photos.
Am I a kid?

811
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.700
You're an item number
Osama Bin Laden (terrorist).

812
01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.360
- Shit! - Hey!

813
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.190
Can you go easily?

814
01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:08.960
A hug and kiss. Do it.

815
01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.290
- No! - Master!

816
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:16.900
Huh? Hug me properly.

817
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.270
Tighter.

818
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.090
Closer.

819
01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:26.070
You hug anyone who asks?

820
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:29.200
You've a loose character.

821
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.500
No more drama!

822
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.590
From tonight. whenever I ask.

823
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:36.260
wherever I ask.

824
01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.000
1..2..3..4..5...

825
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.990
kisses. OK?
Or I'll call Guru...

826
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.570
One!

827
01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:50.400
One.

828
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.490
One!

829
01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:00.940
Yuck! Hey! Hey!

830
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:40.650
<i>~ Why do you turn your rosy eyes
into thorns pricking my heart ~</i>

831
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:46.660
<i>~ You're like a sweet dish
tempting me ~</i>

832

<i>~ O my dear! ~</i>

836
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.750
<i>~ Why keep fighting with me? ~</i>

837
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:50.260
<i>~ Is all this to kiss me? ~</i>

838
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:56.230
<i>~ Why this air of arrogance?
Give me a small kiss ~</i>

839
01:14:56.230 --> 01:15:03.100
<i>~ Quit loathing me
by kissing me hard ~</i>

840
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:09.940

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.080
<i>~ O my miser girl. my river  ~</i>

842
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.890

Men exploit others. Crap!
We must aid workers.

859
01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:50.400
Government fixed wage rates.
You reject the rate for profit?

860
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.370
This can't happen again. OK?
Go!

861
01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:59.000
- Tell him an American.. - If I say USA..
- What's up? - Pa-in-law..

862
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.500
- At a wedding we attended...
- Yes! - Someone saw Satya.

863
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:07.800
NRI American doctor is interested.
His dad's a doctor.

864
01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.000
No hurry. Marry off Chitra.

865
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.250
We've tried for 4 years.
Will Bangari let us?

866
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.600
- Son-in-law! - Yes.

867
01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.100
Did we send goods for the
Community Hall mass weddings?

868
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.400
I did.

869
01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.100
He'll marry off Chitra there.

870
01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:29.880
Nope! I can't make a Rummy.

871
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.950
What a waste.

872
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:33.980
- Hello! - Uncle! - What?

873
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:38.350
Grandpa is marrying off Chitra.
Come quickly.

874
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.690
Oh my! How dare he?

875
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.990
Let's see! Hey!

876
01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.190
Chitra is marrying?

877
01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:03.590
Yes. In case Bangari butts in
again. Bro-in-law rushed.

878
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:07.810
- Oh. if he finds out-
- Dare marry another?

879
01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:11.790
- Wait! Bangari. wait!
- Listen.

880
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:15.190
- Bangari!
- Don't be stupid.

881
01:19:15.190 --> 01:19:17.560
- Listen. - On the bike.

882
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.820
Bangari!

883
01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.990
- Bangari! - Hey!
- What? Kidnap?

884
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.990
Uncle!

885
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:28.900
Sir!

886
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:31.090
Sir!

887
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:38.190
Listen to me.

888
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:53.990
- So hard to marry you. Sit!
- Please! Listen to me.

889
01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:00.900
Quiet! Mangal Sutra. here.

890
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.500
Stop this rot!

891
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.840
- Chitra! - Why'd you come?
- Sir! You'll get in strife.

892
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.090
Who are you to me?

893
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:30.800
My mistake. sir. Forgive me.

894
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.730
Dare hit me?

895
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:36.500
Big error. sir. Sorry.

896
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.990
Talk to your dad.
It'll be OK.

897
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:44.200
Who are you to butt in
with Dad and me?

898
01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.800
Bangari sir!

899
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:45.990
Why are you laughing?
Bangari sir!

900
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.870
Why are you laughing?

901
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:55.990
Give me it.

902
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:57.980
Mangal Sutra!

903
01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.060
Give me it.

904
01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.160
Even if you beat me.
no wedding will occur. sir.

905
01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.990
- Huh? - I'll say one thing. - What?
- Your choice. - What is. kid?

906
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.960
- No problem. Guru.
- Stop.

907
01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:20.090
- Hey! Mangal Sutra. - Hey!
- Give me it. - Sir! Please!

908
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:26.190
- Police! - Dad! Dad!

909
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.960
He abducted this bride.

910
01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.090
He hit my daughter.
Arrest him!

911
01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.360
- Bro-in-law. Think it over...
- I did think!

912
01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.830
Letting him stay did this.

913
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:45.490
I should've had him arrested
that day.

914
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.390
Open a case!

915
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:50.500
Case? Why?

916
01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.450
She loves me.

917
01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:56.750
If she marries another.
she'll die.

918
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:59.490
That's why I took her.

919
01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:03.790
Shit! You resent your sons.

920
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:07.260
You treat others well.
not me.

921
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.090
Hey! See what I do!

922
01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:12.920
Take him away.

923
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:17.860
Hey! You came from nowhere

924
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:20.600
and caused strife.

925
01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:24.500
You stopped us.
Once out of jail...

926
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.910
I'll kill you.

927
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:32.000
- I will kill you.
- Take him away.

928
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:35.090
Chitra!

929
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.990
Uncle!

930
01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:50.930
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

931
01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:08.500
- I'm going home.
- That's childish.

932
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.500
- Grandpa! - Wait! - Come back.

933
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.100
Stop it! What's all this?

934
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.540
I don't want injections.

935
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.240
Just one. It won't hurt.
Just a prick.

936
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:23.780
- It's over. - Finished. Guru.
- You're...

937
01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.180
Grandpa!

938
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.590
- Is it down? - Soon.

939
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:30.250
- Down! - Wait. - Done.

940
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:34.900
- Hey! - What? Well?
- She's here. - She'll fix it.

941
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:38.350
- You do it. - How can I?
- Sister. let me.

942
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:42.990
- I'm shy. - It's OK.

943
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:55.740
Why stress? Reports show
you're strong.

944
01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.000
- Century guaranteed.
- Said so! They fussed.

945
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Baby's fasting- 10 years;
prayers- 10 years.

946
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.750
Chitra's marriage. 5 years.
Guaranteed. eh. Noka Raju?

947
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:13.460
- I'm N. Raju here.
- To her? - Yes.

948
01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:18.600
His mom prayed to Goddess Noka.
N. Raju. not Noka Raju?

949
01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:21.680
You may go to the ward.

950
01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:26.570
Noka Raju! Great hospital.
Set up in our village?

951
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:30.010
A building is available.

952
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:32.610
- Do it?
- Who'd go to a village...?

953
01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:36.350
- I run 3 hospitals.
- Earn double.

954
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:38.990
I didn't mean that.

955
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.090
Doctor N. Raju! Hmm.

956
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:52.630
Guru! Want to set up
a village hospital?

957
01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:55.090
Is it possible?

958
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:01.410
Dad's a London doctor.

959
01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:05.990
He sets up poor countries'
free medical camps.

960
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:10.780
They could send
the best equipment here.

961
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.790
World Health Organisation
supports them.

962
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:16.520
I'll ask Dad to
open a hospital.

963
01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.590
- You're serious?
- Yes. Guru.

964
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:23.090
- Son-in-law! - Yes.
- Go to the hospital.

965
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:35.470
- Son-in-law! - Yes.
- Renovate it. - OK.

966
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:38.990
- OK now? - Yes! Yes!

967
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.900
Where's my phone?

968
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.800
Oh God!

969
01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:56.950
Leaving? Why rush. hm?

970
01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:01.570
Lost something?
Worried for this?

971
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.400
Return it.

972
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:06.600
- A hug for the phone.
- Get lost!

973
01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.640
- Give me it. - OK.

974
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.710
A kiss for the phone.

975
01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:12.880
Didn't you ask me?

976
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:15.440
Kiss me or not?!

977
01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:18.220
I'd fall for this look.

978
01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.800
You're mental. Gimme the phone.

979
01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:27.990
- Dare you to get it.
- Confirmed mental case!

980
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.570
Aren't you Chandrashekhar's son?

981
01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.750
If Grandpa knows. he won't
let you stay. so you lied?

982
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:40.140
Sure.

983
01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.680
What if Grandpa finds out?

984
01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.990
- I'll kill you.
- Let's see. Grandpa!

985
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:22.280
<i>~ O Prince! I am royally yours ~</i>

986
01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:29.660

1001
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:12.000
- Heart attack?
- No heart attack.

1002
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.800
Excitement raised BP.
Tests show he's doing superb.

1003
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.700
Thank God!

1004
01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.890
But. Dad. Grandpa
wants a hospital.

1005
01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:22.090
This village needs it.

1006
01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:24.420
I said I'd help.

1007
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:27.700
- You must help me.
- Correct. Good idea.

1008
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.660
You're great. my son.

1009
01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:33.000
I'll arrange hospital equipment.
doctors. everything.

1010
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.390
No worries. I hope Dad
forgives me after this.

1011
01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:39.870
Let's hope.

1012
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:43.140
Love you. dad.
Send hospital equipment.

1013
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:47.880
then bring your team.
Grandpa will be glad.

1014
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.450
Come on. Mr. Chandrashekhar.
Be strong. my boy. Bye bye...

1015
01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:53.330
Grandpa may want me.

1016
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:54.950
Yes!

1017
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:56.920
Hospital is arranged.

1018
01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.990
Gotta bail out Uncle.

1019
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:16.240
Hey! Why doesn't Grandpa
let Bangari stay?

1020
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.380
When I left my hostel.
Bangari was gone.

1021
01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.750
Mom said I was too young
to know!

1022
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:25.050
So I didn't ask.

1023
01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:27.920
What could it be?

1024
01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:33.990
Chitra and Bangara seemed
to have some problem.

1025
01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:38.400
Who can we ask...?

1026
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.230
Ouch!

1027
01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:42.190
Hi. Chitra!

1028
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:45.570
- I came to say sorry.
- Why?

1029
01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:49.040
I stopped your wedding.

1030
01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.000
- Sorry. Sorry...
- It's not you.

1031
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.950
- It was stopped before.
- Huh?

1032
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:59.850
- In the house. - Ah.
- At the gate. - Ah. - At the temple.

1033
01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:03.720
- My horoscope's bad. I'll never marry.
- Chitra!

1034
01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.460
Bangari's the problem.

1035
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.990
Don't blame my Bangari.
He adores me.

1036
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:17.000
I have high respect for
my Uncle who raised me.

1037
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.470
Uncle fumes at
Bangari's drinking.

1038
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:25.700
I've horoscope issues.
How will I marry?

1039
01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:30.700
Still. Bangari asked Uncle
if he can marry me.

1040
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:35.090
- Then fighting started.
- Fighting?

1041
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:39.990
Listen! I wanna marry Chitra.

1042
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:43.430
I'll do as you say.

1043
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:48.390
If you want.
I'll offer prayers.

1044
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:50.340
He's drunk.

1045
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:54.440
My sister married a guy whose
drinking tortured her.

1046
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.810
then orphaned Chitra.

1047
01:33:57.810 --> 01:34:01.110
I won't ruin her life.

1048
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:06.590
I magnanimously
let you stay. Get out.

1049
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:09.690
Get out!

1050
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:15.900

1053
01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.940
No. Remember 'Rowdygaru
Pellam' (movie)?

1054
01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:33.650
Recall what the hero
did to marry Shobna?

1055
01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:37.000
- God! 'Rape'?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.320
- Rape will get us wed.

1057
01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:45.000
Trust me. Rape now.

1058
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:52.250
- No. Get Uncle's consent to wed.
- He never will.

1059
01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:57.800
- See! Do you love me? - Mm.

1060
01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.500
- Rape. marry. Comply!

01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.750
<i>This once.</i>

1063
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:09.380

1064
01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:12.950
- Dear! - Listen to me.

1065
01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.990

01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:56.550
- I'll help you wed Chitra.
Come home. - Your home?

1072
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:59.160
- Got liquor? - Would I?

1073
01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.000
- C'mon. - I wanna drink.

1074
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:09.470
God! I blabbed.
Tell no-one. please.

1075
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:12.770

1078
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:26.590
He got an air ticket.

1079
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:28.260
What's up?

1080
01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.090

Rape. eh?

01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:43.200
Why rape?

1084
01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.980
- I sent all the equipment.
- Yeah.

1085
01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:49.970
- Someone called...
- Bunny! Bunny!

1086
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.900
- Bunny took delivery. - OK.

1087
01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:55.110
- Were you able to tell
your Uncle Bangari? - Huh?

1088
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:57.360
- Tell what? - Who you are.

1089
01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.090
- Bro! - You told him?
- I will. - It's important.

1090
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:06.900
- With the delivery.

1091
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:09.200
Have him talk to me.

1092
01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.090
Yeah. yeah! OK. bye. bye.

1093
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:17.540
He abducted Chitra.

1094
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:22.190
He's in the Police Station. Dad.

1095
01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.970
Police Station!

1096
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:29.620
Bangari's out on bail.

1097
01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.900
Bail? I'm sorry. Who paid?

1098
01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:36.500
Why was he in
the Police Station?

1099
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:40.400
He rejected my $300.000 offer.

1100
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.700
He called you useless.
In turn. you got upset.

1101
01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:51.540
Who's that boy? What's in the lorry?
Know anything?

1102
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:55.880
What's his hospital link?
What about your house?

1103
01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:59.590
Young girls are there.

1104
01:37:59.890 --> 01:38:05.950
If you don't act now.
he may rape or whatever.

1105
01:38:07.330 --> 01:38:14.990
If we ignore this.
it'll go out of control.

1106
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:27.010
God! You set son against dad.

1107
01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:33.020
We just kindled
his existing hatred.

1108
01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:36.150
He'll do the rest.

1109
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:44.130
Bro! Your dad sent goods.
Bangari hit me and took it all.

1110
01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:47.070
- Where? - Dunno.

1111
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:50.640
There are big fans. no wind.

1112
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.040
Who is he. bro?

1113
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.990
Uncle!

1114
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:15.990
He's here. Run over him!

1115
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:24.090
Sir! What are you doing?

1116
01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.690
Keep going! Hit him.

1117
01:39:41.890 --> 01:39:44.910
Go! Go! Hit him.

1118
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.920
Speed up! Hit him.

1119
01:39:54.230 --> 01:39:59.990
Sir! Please stop.
Sir! Sir! Steer left.

1120
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:32.990
Sir! Listen to me. Sir!

1121
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:38.900
Sir! Listen.
It's expensive equipment.

1122
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:43.940
Sir! Please. sir! Please!
PLEASE!

1123
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:55.530
Stop him! Don't let him go.

1124
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:57.430
Come on!

1125
01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.790
Sir!

1126
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.750
I spared you as my uncle
or else-

1127
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:18.150
Uncle? How?

1128
01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:22.050
I'm your brother's son.

1129
01:41:22.050 --> 01:41:25.170
Chandrasekhar's son.

1130
01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:30.990
Dad sent this equipment
to reopen our hospital.

1131
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:50.770
Sir wants a soda.

1132
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:53.890
Hey! Bring it soon.

1133
01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:56.680
- Sir! -<i>...beer factory-</i>

1134
01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.290
- That boy's here. - Which boy?
- From the cock fight.

1135
01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:03.760
He hit your son. London boy!

1136
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.590
If his boy hits someone. boast.

1137
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:09.490
If his boy gets hit.

1138
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:13.990
- omit negative publicity.
- I swear on my mom.

1139
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:20.100
Where is he? Where?
Where is he?

1140
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:21.640
Where is he?

1141
01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:24.850
Useless fellow.

1142
01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:27.940
He's drunk so early.

1143
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:33.090
He's here.

1144
01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.950
Who is it?

1145
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:38.990
Hello. Granddad.

1146
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.100
Granddad. how bad
were your deeds?

1147
01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:50.770
Why do that?

1148
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:56.140
My Guru will reopen
the hospital for locals.

1149
01:43:56.140 --> 01:44:01.680
Help him or stay quiet.
Don't act smart.

1150
01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.680
Losing a member
of either family

1151
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.320
- won't look good.
I came to say that. - Hey!

1152
01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.860
How can a foreign boy
make statements?

1153
01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:18.300
No statements. Straight action.

1154
01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:20.400
- I'm off.
- Mr. Pillikar Babu!

1155
01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.530
Actually. what I
want to tell you is-

1156
01:44:22.530 --> 01:44:26.000
- Didn't Grandpa ask you
to speak Telugu? - Yes.

1157
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.310
- So then? - Pillikar Babu!

1158
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:31.880
- Your Master's 2nd son
is our loyal dog. - Yeah!

1159
01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.380
- Feed a dog a biscuit. it obeys.
- So give biscuits.

1160
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.990
Bangari Uncle!

1161
01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.330
Fellows! You may escape
a bullet or bomb blast.

1162
01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:52.700
Missile- no escape.

1163
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.830
Uncle. no dialogues. C'mon.

1164
01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.100
- Hey. - Yes! - He called.

1165
01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:03.210
You're overconfident.
You may lose.

1166
01:45:03.210 --> 01:45:05.980
Uncle!

1167
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:17.790
- Dad! - Didn't I say?

1168
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:20.550
No statements. only action.

1169
01:45:20.630 --> 01:45:23.630
- This is.. - Uncle! Not now.

1170
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:26.450
- Only action. - Mm. - Go.

1171
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:33.500
- Hey! Stop him.
- Why? He's God! - Shut up!

1172
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:37.000
We spent a fortune to
get you out of the chair.

1173
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.180
He did it in secs. He's God!

1174
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.150
- Shut up!
- Hey!

1175
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:47.750
People came here in need.

1176
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:50.460
Some wanted jobs.

1177
01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:56.990
A few wanted money.
First time. someone warned us.

1178
01:45:56.990 --> 01:46:07.110
He'd give bro-in-law a fit.
Who is he? He's like him.

1179
01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:12.800
No point waiting. Time has come.

1180
01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:17.790
Let's finish them.

1181
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:21.090
- Careful. - Slowly.

1182
01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:24.590
- Put it down.
- Carefully!

1183
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.830
- Kid! - Yep.
- Grandpa wants you.

1184
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:30.460
- Why? - Your sister came
from London.

1185
01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:34.030
- Sister?! - Sister? Go.
- What?

1186
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:39.970
Not knowing my drama.
she'd tell Grandpa.

1187
01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:44.880
- How do you know?
- I know she'd tell him.

1188
01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.210
It's over. You fetch her.
We'll go home.

1189
01:46:50.210 --> 01:46:52.020
I'll handle it.

1190
01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:56.390
- Come with me.
- Uncle! I feel tension.

1191
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:58.990
Hey! Come along.

1192
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:06.090
Here's your bro!

1193
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:26.250
- Abhi! - Wait!

1194
01:47:26.250 --> 01:47:28.380
Oh God!

1195
01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:39.500
Hey! Think I don't know?

1196
01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:45.770
- G-guru! I wanted-
- See. he's scared.

1197
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:49.470
Am I Hitler? Are we at war?

1198
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:53.410
- We could've fetched her.
- Guru! - C'mon.

1199
01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:57.990
- She's lovely.
- I'd no idea. Guru.

1200
01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.120
Go inside. Am I Hitler?

1201
01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:08.390
- This is such a huge house. - I was
tense you'd blurt. - Why would I?

1202
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:11.160
- I knew. - Why just turn up?

1203
01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.770
I wanted grandparent time.

1204
01:48:13.770 --> 01:48:18.490
- Pig! - You'd stop me coming.
- Get lost!

1205
01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:21.170
Oh. you'll marry bro?

1206
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:23.370
Shh! Everyone's here.

1207
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:29.550
- Well. does your bro have friends?
- Girl friends. eh?

1208
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:33.590
Generally. who does he hang out with?

1209
01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:36.920
OK. fine. Any girlfriends?

1210
01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:40.990
- Yes. girlfriends-
- Baby!

1211
01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.530
<i>Greetings.</i>

1212
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:50.700
- Come to Shanti's Puberty Ritual.
- Please come to bless her.

1213
01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:56.040
- Shanti's that big?
- Girls grow fast. - You must come.

1214
01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.240
Puberty Ritual?

1215
01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.780
- You want Bangari at home?
- <i>Yes.</i> - Heed me.

1216
01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:05.990
- <i>What do we do?</i>
- What?

1217
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:09.450
Grandpa. that function...

1218
01:49:09.450 --> 01:49:14.530
- Yes. - Shanti's my class mate.
I want a function.

1219
01:49:14.530 --> 01:49:17.390
Grandma said never.

1220
01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.130
- I want my function.
- Quiet! Always whingeing.

1221
01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:24.340
It's impossible here.

1222
01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:26.900
Quiet! Why scold her?

1223
01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:30.910
Even if it is a woman's
first auspicious life event...

1224
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:33.110
it won't happen in our house.

1225
01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:36.250
Explain to her. not yell.

1226
01:49:36.250 --> 01:49:39.780
Girls here aren't lucky
enough to have it.

1227
01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.560
Why not? Satya had it.
I saw photos!

1228
01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.030
Back then. Bangari was home.

1229
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:52.190
Is that all?
Invite Bangari home.

1230
01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.870
- Abhi! - What?

1231
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:57.470
- Pa-in-law won't let him.
- Eh? - Bangari can't come.

1232
01:49:57.470 --> 01:50:02.640
Would Grandpa say no-
if it makes her happy?

1233
01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:07.850
Bangari won't stay.
He'll bless her and go.

1234
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:10.780
No winners or losers.

1235
01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:12.980
Right. Guru?

1236
01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:16.290
It's impossible. Come. dear!

1237
01:50:16.290 --> 01:50:19.620
Eh? No function due to Guru?

1238
01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:22.490
- God! Did I say so?
- Alright.

1239
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:25.400
- Let him come. - How?

1240
01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.100
Bangari is fussy.

1241
01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:33.990
He'll want your invitation.

1242
01:50:36.970 --> 01:50:40.950
- Come.
- Wow! Super! Thank you.

1243
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:42.970
<i>Calculate this.</i>

1244
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:46.980
- How much today?
- $US75.000.

1245
01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:49.290
We made so much.

1246
01:50:49.290 --> 01:50:53.990
We can earn much more.

1247
01:50:57.230 --> 01:50:58.960
Guru...!

1248
01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:01.570
- Wait. - He insults me with money.

1249
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:04.040
- Let's go. - It's not for him.

1250
01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:07.340
It's for Shravani. Grandma. all...

1251
01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:11.990
- How will they feel?
- OK. you see him.

1252
01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:17.010
OK. Guru. Your scarf.

1253
01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:21.150
Give it to your student? Hm?

1254
01:51:21.150 --> 01:51:26.090
Oh! Wow!

1255
01:51:27.230 --> 01:51:30.990
Your hand.

1256
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:35.930
- Hey. Bangari. - Dare call me Bangari?!
- I speak for Balaraju sir!

1257
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:37.640
Speak. Balaraju sir.

1258
01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.370
We're hosting a Puberty Ritual
for your niece. Shravani.

1259
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:43.040
Uncle should go.

1260
01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:47.140
Come to it! Don't act smart.

1261
01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.880
Don't contact Chitra.

1262

- There's lunch. You go. - Sir!
- He'll go. - No.

1268
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:18.410
I'll send him on my behalf.

1269
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:21.410
Your mom wants you there

1270
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:23.910
in your Uncle role.

1271
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:27.950
She prayed for this.

1272
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.710
Bike!

1273
01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:42.670

- He's different.
- Yes! Chitra can marry him.

1341
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:50.830

You raised him well.

1353
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:33.600
Such a son is all you need.

1354
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.540
Not everyone is so lucky.

1355
02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:43.280
I don't know why I'm shedding
happy tears talking to you.
Not everyone is so lucky.

1356

I wish you and your son
a long happy life.
Not everyone is so lucky.

1357

Here he is.
Not everyone is so lucky.

1358
02:00:52.990 --> 02:01:05.970
Not everyone is so lucky.

1359
02:01:05.970 --> 02:01:06.440
<i>I'm Kodukku. Ask if
you need anything.</i>
Not everyone is so lucky.

1360
02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.440
<i>I'm Kodukku. Ask if
you need anything.</i>

1361
02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.980
- <i>Alright? Yeah.</i>
- Kodukku!

1362
02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:15.990
- Eh? - Who? - A proposal.

1363
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:19.500
- Trouble for Chitra!
- Not Chitra; Satya.

1364
02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:23.900
The groom's an American doctor.
like a film hero!

1365
02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:37.300
This is mere formality.
I'm lucky to have this chance

1366
02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:39.640
by God's grace.

1367
02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:44.040
In America. by God's grace.
we do well.

1368
02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.640
If you agree. let's finish
these formalities.

1369
02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:52.320
I heard about you.
She's lucky.

1370
02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:57.590
I just worry your doctor son
is in America.

1371
02:01:57.590 --> 02:02:03.290
- Must she go far...
- Oh. we'll move to India with him.

1372
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:06.260
You'll open a hospital.

1373
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:12.600
He'd help set it up and
run it after marriage.

1374
02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:18.080
Great! I want a family hospital.
Now I've got it.

1375
02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.970
Accepted.

1376
02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.560
Shut up! It's not cinema!

1377
02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:39.860
Confess our love

1378
02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:43.130
and marry without consent?!

1379
02:02:43.130 --> 02:02:47.030
Just talk sense!

1380
02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:54.090
My dad suffered. For selfish reasons.
I won't upset this family.

1381
02:02:56.250 --> 02:02:59.790
Hey...

1382
02:02:59.850 --> 02:03:06.190
Family happiness matters
more than our happiness.

1383
02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:11.990
If Grandpa finds out who I am...

1384
02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:18.190
No way. No!

1385
02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:25.990
No way!

1386
02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:30.050
Everything's resolving. Satya.

1387
02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:32.990
I won't destroy it.

1388
02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:40.820
- Forget me.
- I couldn't care less.

1389
02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:44.700
I love you and I want you.

1390
02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:49.490
If I marry him.
my corpse will leave.

1391
02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:55.070
It's not dialogues; it's truth.

1392
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:58.990
It's your call.

1393
02:04:07.450 --> 02:04:10.950
- Hey. Bangari! - Stop.

1394
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:14.900
- You went mad?
- I did. Move.

1395
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:15.950
Hey.

1396
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:20.200
Hey. where's Mom? Where is she?

1397
02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:23.890
Hey. have you got any sense?

1398
02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:28.770
- Drunk again? - Stop.
- I'll kill you.

1399
02:04:28.770 --> 02:04:32.500
- Your dad will kill you.
Is he home? - Call him.

1400
02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.200
- I'll talk to him. - Get out.
- Call him here.

1401
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:38.800
What's wrong with you?
What's your problem?

1402
02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:41.620
Why marry off Satya?

1403
02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:44.090
I won't accept it.

1404
02:04:44.690 --> 02:04:46.560
- Who let you? - Don't!

1405
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:50.160
Jealous idiot!
Even if you can't.

1406
02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:52.990
- she must marry.
- Mistake.

1407
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.100
- She's your daughter.
- I know that.

1408
02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:58.570
- Dad...! - Call it off!

1409
02:04:58.570 --> 02:05:02.640
Stop this nonsense. I'll kill you!

1410
02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.380
Dare hit a woman?

1411
02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:08.040
An ideal American doctor

1412
02:05:08.150 --> 02:05:12.350
- will run the hospital.
- It's opened by Abhi!

1413
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:18.500
- Uncle! - From London. - Uncle. please.
- Marry Satya to Abhi. Ideal!

1414
02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:19.790
Shut up! You're mad?

1415
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:25.000
- You can't burden him or his family.
- Family? Know who?

1416
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000
- If I say.. - Uncle. please
listen. What're you doing?

1417
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.900
- Please listen. You'll ruin it all.
- Gimme. gimme.

1418
02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:37.000
- Satya. go. Show them photos.
- Please. Please listen.

1419
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.410
Please. Satya. don't open it.
Indu. go get it. Please.

1420
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.900
Don't open it. Satya.
Please. please. Satya. stop it.

1421
02:05:43.900 --> 02:05:46.980
Please. Uncle. listen.
Satya. stop. please!

1422
02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:52.320
Satya. please. you'll ruin everything.
Please. Uncle. listen.

1423
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:54.790
Satya. don't open it. please. Stop.

1424
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:56.830
Please. wait. Uncle.

1425
02:05:56.830 --> 02:06:00.390
They can't know. Please. Satya!

1426
02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.990
Please. Satya! Please!

1427
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.970
Please. Satya! Stop. please.

1428
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:06.300
Please stop. Satya. please...!

1429
02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:09.990
No!

1430
02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:12.900
Brother!

1431
02:06:36.370 --> 02:06:39.090
He's brother's son.

1432
02:06:56.490 --> 02:07:01.990
- Why not tell me. Abhi?
- Grandma!

1433
02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:13.490
Why not tell me. dear?

1434
02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:18.980
- You all come here. - Why?

1435
02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:21.240
Your dad can't know.

1436
02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:25.000
- Why? - Promise on me
you won't tell him.

1437
02:08:09.090 --> 02:08:12.690
I can't know what you all know.

1438
02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:17.990
So. you make them promise on you?

1439
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:22.990
Why?

1440
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.080
You think I'll evict him
knowing who he is.

1441
02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:31.990
I'm a heartless beast?

1442
02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:40.320
Your elder son opposed
my wishes.

1443
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:42.430
He left us all.

1444
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:46.530
He didn't check if we're alive
in 20 years.

1445
02:08:46.530 --> 02:08:50.970
Now his son comes and fools me.

1446
02:08:50.970 --> 02:08:54.740
He means more than I?

1447
02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:58.110
You conspired.

1448
02:08:58.110 --> 02:09:02.980
You all estranged me.

1449
02:09:04.110 --> 02:09:06.020
What to do?

1450
02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:09.990
Shut my trap and marry
my granddaughter to him.

1451
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:15.990
then lose face like a fool.
Is that it?

1452
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:22.090
Wrongdoers shouldn't stay here.

1453
02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:28.600
I didn't know you all
disapproved of that logic.

1454
02:09:28.610 --> 02:09:30.700
In that case...

1455
02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:35.810
I made a mistake and
shouldn't stay here.

1456
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:37.710
I'll leave.

1457
02:09:37.710 --> 02:09:42.420
- Live happily.
- Dear! - Forgive me.

1458
02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:44.990
- Guru... - You topped your dad.

1459
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:50.090
He left me.
You turned them against me.

1460
02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:52.160
Thanks a lot!

1461
02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:57.830
- No. Grandpa. - Who's your Grandpa?
- It's you!

1462
02:09:57.830 --> 02:10:00.300
Like it or not.

1463
02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:04.090
you're my grandpa;
I'm your grandson.

1464
02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:11.780
I thought you'd get angry
at the truth.

1465
02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:15.990
I never betrayed you.

1466
02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:20.390
I love Satya!

1467
02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.090
But I want you all more
than marrying Satya.

1468
02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:34.290
I came here on Dad's behalf.
Now I can't live without you all.

1469
02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:38.990
I want to stay with you all.

1470
02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:44.990
Why leave the house
for my mistake?

1471
02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:51.090
As you say. a wrongdoer
should go.

1472
02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:55.360
I made a mistake.

1473
02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.990
I'll leave.

1474
02:10:58.250 --> 02:11:00.660
Abhi!

1475
02:11:02.130 --> 02:11:06.370
- Abhi. don't go. Listen.
- Grandpa needs you all.

1476
02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:09.990
Take good care of him.

1477
02:11:10.210 --> 02:11:12.990
Abhi!

1478
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:23.980
Listen. don't go. Please.

1479
02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.490
You haven't eaten.

1480
02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:54.990
Have this.

1481
02:12:00.090 --> 02:12:03.730
I'll say something.

1482
02:12:03.730 --> 02:12:08.670
My parents showed me your photo.

1483
02:12:08.670 --> 02:12:12.170
I started crying.

1484
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:18.340
Mom said live as if
a husband is god.

1485
02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:21.510
So I married you.

1486
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:24.990
Your actions are god's.

1487
02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:30.790
Not once did I think
you made a mistake

1488
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:33.260
as my God.

1489
02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:36.330
That boy

1490
02:12:36.330 --> 02:12:41.160
came all the way here
to unite us.

1491
02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:46.970
You sent a good boy away
and didn't stop him.

1492
02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:52.940
You're not God. just ordinary.
That's it.

1493
02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:58.350
I want my kids and grand-kids.
I'll live with them.

1494
02:12:58.350 --> 02:13:03.090
Eat. You starved from morning.

1495
02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:06.790
His grandson came?

1496
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:11.890
So the prince is here.

1497
02:13:11.890 --> 02:13:14.960
This isn't right.

1498
02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:37.220
- Yes. Dad!
- Abhi. I've landed.

1499
02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:39.660
You've won!

1500
02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:42.960
- Dad. - Abhi!

1501
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.090
I feel anxiety now.

1502
02:13:47.150 --> 02:13:52.170
- Yeah.
- I hope Dad's fine.

1503
02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:55.000
Whatever he says.
I'll stay.

1504
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.640
- Where's Grandpa?
- Well. Grandpa...

1505
02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.880
You can't talk?

1506
02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.520
- Is he near? Call later?
- Dad! It's fine.

1507
02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.620
Hospital's ready. yep?

1508
02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:11.950
I'm outside it. You come.

1509
02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:13.760
Bye!

1510
02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.900
- Love you!
- Love you too!

1511
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:29.900
Sorry. Dad! Sorry!

1512
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:53.090
Brother!

1513
02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:04.090
Brother!

1514
02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:16.490
Brother!

1515
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:34.700
Indu!

1516
02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:36.990
Indu!

1517
02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:41.090
Indu!

1518
02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:51.090
- Brother! - Hey!

1519
02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:56.950
Brother!

1520
02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.500
Brother!

1521
02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:08.900
- Brother! - Indu!

1522
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:12.990
- Bro! - Hey! Drive.

1523
02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:15.970
Stop!

1524
02:16:31.090 --> 02:16:33.150
Brother!

1525
02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:43.970
Brother!

1526
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:22.990
Brother!

1527
02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:25.900
Brother!

1528
02:17:30.090 --> 02:17:36.090
Stop. please! I won't repeat it.
Sorry.

1529
02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:40.130
Know who she is?

1530
02:17:40.130 --> 02:17:43.390
She's your sister.

1531
02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:48.990
We're one family. Family!

1532
02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:01.510
Brother!

1533
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:03.990
Brother!

1534
02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:07.990
Brother!

1535
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:10.320
- Abhi! - Abhi!

1536
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.990
Bro!

1537
02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:17.200
How dare you.

1538
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:19.900
Get lost!

1539
02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.990
- Hey! - Let him go!

1540
02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:28.950
Tell them. Uncle.

1541
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:31.990
- Leave him. - Don't hit him.

1542
02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.990
Abhi!

1543
02:18:38.650 --> 02:18:40.550
- Indu. - Dad!

1544
02:18:40.550 --> 02:18:45.830
- Brother.
- Uncle. Dad...

1545
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:48.090
Abhi!

1546
02:18:56.850 --> 02:18:58.990
Abhi!

1547
02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:02.190
Oh God! Abhi...

1548
02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.900
Madam! Bachi shot Abhi.
It's bad.

1549
02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:11.990
Sir! They shot our boy.

1550
02:19:12.890 --> 02:19:14.990
Wait.

1551
02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:03.000
Chandra.

1552
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:09.090
Grandpa.

1553
02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:39.480
<i>Like it or not.</i>

1554
02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:43.470
<i>you're my grandpa;
I'm your grandson.</i>

1555
02:21:57.490 --> 02:22:02.890
Abhi. Abhi! Grandpa is here.

1556
02:22:02.890 --> 02:22:07.100
Look. He's here.

1557
02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:11.390
Abhi! Open your eyes.

1558
02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:13.900
Hey!

1559
02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:17.090
Abhi...

1560
02:22:32.650 --> 02:22:37.390
This is no problem.
just a small fight.

1561
02:22:37.390 --> 02:22:42.090
Bachi doesn't know who I am.

1562
02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:48.900
Once I get better...

1563
02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:52.780
I'll leave. Guru.

1564
02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:55.500
'Grandpa'!

1565
02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:58.280
I'm 'Grandpa'.

1566
02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:01.550
Where are you going?

1567
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:07.090
I didn't know who you were.

1568
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:12.620
How'd I fail to know you?

1569
02:23:12.730 --> 02:23:17.790
I hurt my grandson.

1570
02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:20.500
I'm getting old.

1571
02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:26.390
If you try to leave.
I'll hit your legs.

1572
02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:30.110
We'll go home.

1573
02:23:30.110 --> 02:23:33.990
OK. Where's the doctor?

1574
02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:36.990
Doctor!

1575
02:23:52.430 --> 02:23:57.600
Doctor. sir! You're our God.

1576
02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:03.900
You saved our grandson
and made us happy.

1577
02:24:03.900 --> 02:24:07.610
How do I repay your help!

1578
02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:11.710
Sincere thanks.

1579
02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:15.000
Can I take him home-

1580
02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.570
Dad. hug me once.

1581
02:24:27.570 --> 02:24:30.990
That's enough!

1582
02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:39.990
My son!

1583
02:24:47.090 --> 02:24:49.990
<i>Yes!</i>

1584
02:24:58.490 --> 02:25:00.960
Come.

1585
02:25:01.970 --> 02:25:04.990
Come closer.

1586
02:25:05.370 --> 02:25:10.380
I blindly believed our
village welfare was our welfare.

1587
02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:15.280
My generation is like that.

1588
02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:18.890
But the village is family;

1589
02:25:18.890 --> 02:25:22.960
a united family helps the village.

1590
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.990
My foreign grandson
taught me that.

1591
02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:32.470
Your wishes came true?

1592
02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:45.380
- Hey! Call the American.
- Grandpa! - We'll reject them.

1593
02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:50.700
- Son-in-law! - Yes.
- Ask the priest to wed 3 couples.

1594
02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:52.190
<i>Three weddings?</i>

1595
02:25:52.190 --> 02:25:54.360
Chitra and Bangari!

1596
02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.190
Abhi and Satya!

1597
02:25:58.490 --> 02:26:06.930
- Me and Baby. - You'll marry again?
- 60 years again!

1598
02:26:31.890 --> 02:26:37.900
<i>~ In a sky-blue sari

1599
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:43.960
