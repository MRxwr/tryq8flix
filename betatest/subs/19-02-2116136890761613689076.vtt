WOOHYUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.330
What was this?

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:25.979
HAN TAE-SAN

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.365
HAN TAE-SAN

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.870
Tae-san…

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.040
HAN TAE-SAN

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.172
-What is it?
-I can't do this.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.799
-What's wrong?
-I dropped this last time.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.093
The film keeps getting stuck now.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:01.014
I told you to just get a digital camera.
Nobody uses film cameras these days.

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.434
No way. Decent digital cameras
would cost as much as a car.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.768
And didn't I tell you?

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.397
Digital cameras don't have that warmth.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.607
How should I put it?

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.193
It lacks the human touch.
It's about humanity. you know?

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.071
Hello? Anybody in there?
That's a machine too. you know.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.365
My gosh.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.118
All right.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.916
All right. it's done.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.376
Okay.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.267
Yes! Tae-san! Look. it's working!

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.353
-It's working!
-What? It's working?

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.272
-Yes!
-Oh. yes!

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.108
Yes! Let's get a digital camera now!

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.904
<i>It's really working. right?</i>

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.996
Was that really you. Tae-san?

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.209
What?

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.724
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.021
<i>Mr. Han!</i>

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.814
Yes?

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:17.817
<i>Why weren't you picking up your calls?</i>

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.902
<i>You heard about me. right?
It's me. Mr. Park.</i>

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.573
Well. the phone was off.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.116
<i>Did you arrive okay?</i>

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.160
Pardon?

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.828
<i>Did you arrive okay?</i>

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.371
Oh. yes.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.082
Then you should've called me.

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.794
Where did you fall. then?

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:42.633
Well. the reed field in Gimpo.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.052
<i>Goodness.</i>

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.763
<i>That must've been pretty rough.</i>

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.931
<i>There have been download errors
these days.</i>

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.684
<i>Everyone keeps falling over there.</i>

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.352
You're not injured or anything?

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.606
Oh. and what about the Control Bureau?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.359
Oh. it's all right.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.195
<i>That's a relief.</i>

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.822
<i>So. did you bring it?</i>

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.494
Well. yes. I did bring the stuff.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.205
but what exactly do you mean?

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.918
<i>I guess it's natural to forget.
I mean the key!</i>

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.295
<i>Did you bring the key?</i>

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:20.505
The key?

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.216
Yes. I have the key.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.134
<i>Are your limbs all there?</i>

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:26.969
What?

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.680
<i>Are your limbs all intact?</i>

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.432
Yes.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.644
Good. Your health is the most important.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.271
All right. Let's meet.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.190
Bring the key.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.609
Where should I go?

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:44.403
<i>No. it's fine. We'll come pick you up.</i>

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.696
<i>Where are you now?</i>

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.991
I'm at an acquaintance's house.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.537
<i>An acquaintance?</i>

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.415
<i>You said your limbs are all intact. right?</i>

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.667
Yes.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.502
<i>But let me ask you something.</i>

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.587
What's the number

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.132
written on your right arm?

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.268
Hey. You're not Han Tae-san. are you?

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.566
What was that?

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.573
<i>The number you have dialed cannot…</i>

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.824
Damn it.

00:07:45.512 --> 00:07:51.215
SISYPHUS

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.064
SEUNG-BOK

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.984
Damn it.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.907
-Hello?
-<i>Why weren't you picking up?</i>

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.117
I'm on my way.

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:16.454
Oh. right. The meeting. It's over. right?

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:19.832
<i>I'm sorry about that.
I'll make sure to attend next time.</i>

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.669
Hello? Seung-bok?

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.631
You're angry at me again.

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:28.966
Why do you always get angry at me?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.136
Just come home right now.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.847
What's going on? You're scaring me.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.516
Hello?

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:02.875
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:21.852
Who are all these people?

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.479
The security alarm went off.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.273
What about the security camera?

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:28.734
Nobody was caught on camera.
I don't know what happened.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.373
Has any of your belongings gone missing?

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:48.504
I'm not sure.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.880
Look carefully.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.508
It looks like the culprit
made a huge mess.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:56.220
-No. it's just the way it was when I left.
-Pardon?

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.849
Well. it may look messy.
but it's actually pretty organized.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.018
-So it was like this…
-Hang on.

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:03.978
Something's different.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.404
It's fine now.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:21.412
It seems like a simple
breaking and entering case.

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:24.707
Did you see anyone suspicious
when you left the house?

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:31.631
The drawing.

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:34.342
It was always like that.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.552
No. I hung it upside down on purpose.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.179
Mr. Kim. take that down.

00:10:56.238 --> 00:10:57.990
"Don't look for your brother.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.659
If you do.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:01.952
you'll die"?

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:03.996
What?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.980
This is crazy. How did they get in?

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:35.111
I've requested officers to be placed here
and got all the guards to come.

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.655
I'm canceling all your schedules for now.

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.203
But by "brother." did they mean Tae-san?

00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:48.082
What did they mean by not looking
for your brother?

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.042
I have no idea.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:53.045
Hey. this isn't something
you can just forget about.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.423
Stop saying you don't know
and think about it.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.343
Have you done anything weird recently?

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.860
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.988
<i>Did you bring it?</i>

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.573
<i>Did you bring the key?</i>

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.210
Strange. I'm sure I saw it before.
but I can't remember where.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:40.050
It's not here.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.052
Is this it?

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.764
This must be it.

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.060
Why is that locked up?

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:53.606
Is this it?

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:06.577
I give up.

00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:24.929
What?

00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:34.313
Mr. Han. I'm going home now.

00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:35.898
Not now! Come over here.

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:37.733
Come on.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.485
Hurry!

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.530
Oh. gosh.

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.323
-Darn it.
-Where to?

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:50.204
What is this?

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:56.502
-Over here. Put it here.
-On the floor?

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:57.586
Put it down.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.308
-What are you doing?
-I'm making a darkroom.

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:14.228
Bong-seon. there's a red safelight
in the storage room.

00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:15.521
Go and bring it for me.

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:23.279
-And get a cup of coffee on the way back.
-Okay.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.114
-Iced coffee.
-Okay.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.340
What's with all these photographs?

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.385
Did you take them when
you were birdwatching?

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:47.553
Yes.

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.060
They're not birds.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:56.979
They're not.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.607
Could it be a stalker?

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:02.902
Maybe.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.616
Hey.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.078
Who's that?

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.915
My brother.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.795
Didn't your brother…

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:22.880
He died.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.843
They look like photos that were taken
after he died. What is all this?

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.845
This is impossible.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:31.722
-What is it?
-Hey.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.350
-What?
-The date…

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.143
It's today.

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:37.436
What?

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.358
What about this?

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.819
This is crazy.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.238
The conference. It's in two days.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.451
No way.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.333
Did you get married?

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:00.876
What are you talking about?

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.509
Hey. I don't even know this woman.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:11.929
You married someone you don't even know?

00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:14.932
Shut up.
I don't know what's going on. either.

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.018
What is all this?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:33.867
Seo-hae.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:46.380
Damn it.

00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:57.683
Is it the girl or the world?

00:16:58.475 --> 00:16:59.727
You can only choose one.

00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.025
No.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.295
<i>Don't breathe.</i>

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.380
<i>Everything is poison.</i>

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:42.431
I only took it off for a while
to tie my hair.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.974
What about you. dad?

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:45.684
I'm fine.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:08.457
SEYANGWON

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:24.139
That damn thief.
If I catch you. you're dead.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.814
Darn it.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:34.942
Where did it go?

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.366
It must be tough working in the heat.

00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:44.117
Was there a burglary or something?

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.578
Yes. But we're not open yet.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.372
We're open at 11.

00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:49.706
I'm not here to eat.

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.005
What is it. then?

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.715
I'm from the Immigration Office.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.675
HWANG HYUN-SEUNG

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.177
We don't have any illegal immigrants
working here.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.097
I got caught for hiring one last time.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.723
so I almost had to close the shop.

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:10.060
Now I never hire anyone who seems
the slightest bit suspicious.

00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:12.562
It's not about that. We received a report.

00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:22.948
<i>It's the police. right?
Some strange woman entered our restaurant.</i>

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:25.575
<i>Please calm down.
and tell us exactly what's going on.</i>

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:28.495
<i>She doesn't seem to be a foreigner.
She speaks Korean.</i>

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:30.289
<i>But something smells fishy.</i>

00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:33.250
That's Sun's voice.

00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:36.962
That lousy jerk.
I knew he'd cause trouble.

00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:39.089
The man who made that call
works here. right?

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:41.591
Yes. he works in our kitchen.
But he isn't here yet.

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.510
His name is Sun? Is he a foreigner?

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:46.638
No. not at all. He's absolutely Korean.

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.932
I just call him that.
It's like a nickname.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:52.602
His name is Choi Jae-sun.
He's not an illegal immigrant.

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.438
Did he do something wrong?

00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.898
It won't cause us any trouble. right?

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.692
Could we take a look around inside?

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:02.195
Well. you should at least tell me
what this is about.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.697
Check this place.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.537
What are you doing?

00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:19.421
We have signs of contact.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.425
Where were you last night?

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:25.385
I was at home.

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:28.472
Are there any other security cameras
besides that?

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:30.307
No. that's the only one.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.559
Were you with friends or family
last night?

00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:35.395
No. I live alone.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.397
This will get complicated.

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.233
Complicated? What do you mean?

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:44.154
Anyone who's come into contact
with them has to be quarantined.

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:48.450
Who are you guys? You're not
from the Immigration Office. are you?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.286
Where are you from?

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.372
Sir. what's important

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:56.708
isn't "where."

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.088
Take care of him.

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:29.074
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:34.788
I told you I don't have any.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.542
I'll wire you some when I get paid!

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:44.047
I don't have a single penny
on me right now.

00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:47.551
I'm hanging up.

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.765
This…

00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.560
Damn it!

00:23:56.643 --> 00:23:59.604
Hey! Do you have a girl
living in your house?

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.439
No.

00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:04.568
Don't lie to me!
Then who's that girl over there?

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.363
Damn it.

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.532
Why is she out there when she's sick?

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:13.201
You have to pay extra
if you have a roommate!

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.953
Don't try to fool me!

00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.372
Hey! Kid!

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:19.875
Darn it.

00:24:22.752 --> 00:24:25.547
You shouldn't be out here
when you're sick.

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:27.591
You're here.

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.009
Let's go.

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:31.845
-That bag…
-I got it from your closet.

00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:32.888
Let me borrow this.

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:36.099
Gosh. that's expensive.

00:24:36.766 --> 00:24:38.852
-But where are you going?
-Busan.

00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:40.645
Like that? Why?

00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:44.357
If Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase.
they're going to kill him.

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:47.068
-Who?
-You don't have to come.

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.111
Just get me a ticket.

00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:51.364
No way. You have to pay me first.

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.660
You said you'll give me the numbers
if I made the call.

00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:57.370
I never said I would.

00:24:57.454 --> 00:24:58.496
What?

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:03.501
Hey. I let you stay the night
and even fed you.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.462
Plus. you're taking my bag.

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:06.922
That's worth a lot.

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:11.593
I didn't report you.
even if you seemed a bit strange.

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:12.552
And you do this?

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.348
I could just report you.

00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:19.309
Give me back my bag.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.566
Oh. sorry.

00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:29.110
I'm really sorry.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.365
I said I'm sorry.

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:39.287
What?

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:41.831
Who are you?

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:43.250
Are you a ghost?

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:48.004
You're a ghost. right?
Please spare me. Just this once!

00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:56.304
I have an elderly mother
and a younger sibling.

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.515
My family will starve to death without me.

00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:00.892
Please don't kill me.

00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:03.812
Please. have mercy.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.239
I'll tell you the rest
when we're in Busan.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.326
Why would I go there?

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.036
I told you.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.039
if Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase.
they'll kill him.

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.711
What does that have to do with me?

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.504
Are you coming or not?

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.301
Darn it.

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.561
Give me that.

00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:54.738
I need clothes.

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.452
It's the only female clothing I have.

00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:04.956
It's our restaurant uniform.
I don't know why it's here. though.

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:07.542
You wear that.

00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:09.461
What?

00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:13.590
Don't be ridiculous.

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:16.426
No way. This is a luxury brand.

00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:17.969
It cost me a fortune.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.734
Darn it.

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:35.862
This jacket's expensive.

00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:42.369
That too.

00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:51.586
-And your pants.
-What?

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.964
Gosh.

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:25.829
She's so annoying.

00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:44.389
Let's go.

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:55.942
Right now?

00:28:56.025 --> 00:28:56.860
Yes.

00:28:58.653 --> 00:28:59.988
Hang on.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.199
I need to call my boss first.

00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:05.535
You can't get to Busan that quickly.
you know.

00:29:06.953 --> 00:29:08.747
Hang on. I need to take the day off.

00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:23.762
Why isn't he picking up?

00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:37.150
Why isn't he answering?

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.737
Is he still not at the restaurant?

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.364
He's never this late.
Hang on one more minute.

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:44.616
Let me call once more.

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.338
Those kids? They're in there.

00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:03.134
It's the Control Bureau.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:04.928
What?

00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:14.521
Put on your silencers.
There are eyes watching.

00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.486
What?

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.961
Don't pull out your guns
in a cramped place like this.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.508
Come on out!

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.293
That's enough.

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:09.213
Let's not do this. Come on out.

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:13.718
-We have to go.
-Go where?

00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:22.977
Over there? No way.

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.979
They'll kill you since you were with me.

00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.022
I'm not going.

00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:28.775
They're not on the other side.

00:34:29.358 --> 00:34:30.526
You can go by yourself.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.280
Wait! Don't shoot! I didn't do anything!

00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:36.532
I really didn't do anything.

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:39.494
-Please just let me go.
-Run!

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:52.757
Get up!

00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:33.214
Bravo!

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.091
Unbelievable.

00:35:35.174 --> 00:35:37.927
Illegal immigrants running around
in broad daylight?

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.937
Are you that desperate to die?

00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:52.650
All right. then.

00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:07.415
I'm not going to die today.

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.810
They're on a dump truck.
License plate. 92…

00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:28.895
No need.

00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:31.647
They can't last long without a broker.

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:35.735
Okay. We got a call from headquarters.

00:36:35.818 --> 00:36:36.944
They found something.

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:40.990
<i>Han Tae-sul. Don't open the suitcase.</i>

00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:43.075
Han Tae-sul? The Han Tae-sul?

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:45.786
Yes. The CEO of Quantum & Time.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.538
She called with that man's phone.

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.053
Is Grandpa in there?

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:09.018
DECEASED. HAN TAE-SAN

00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:27.286
Oh. the ashes got switched.

00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:59.443
It must be tough for you.
I hope your loved one can rest in peace.

00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:06.701
What a weirdo.

00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:56.625
Gosh. You startled me.

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:59.253
What's this? A DNA test?

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.881
Wait. Damn it.

00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:04.425
It's a paternity test.

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:09.555
I told you not to go outside.

00:39:09.638 --> 00:39:12.433
Sorry. I forgot.
I'm going to go back home.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.227
But why are you two always together?

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.146
What's going on?

00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:20.024
Are you two dating?

00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.068
Are you?

00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:23.944
You guys…

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.488
Are you really…

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:28.282
I was just kidding. but I guess it's true.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.831
It says there's a 99.9 percent chance
of not being a match.

00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.167
Lucky you.

00:39:45.007 --> 00:39:49.011
You two look great together. You did it!

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:50.304
Congratulations.

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:11.409
But…

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:16.247
is it really possible for someone
to fall from the sky?

00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:19.125
I'm not sure
if it's scientifically possible.

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.044
I don't know. either.

00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:24.880
Then what now? Should I take you home?

00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:26.966
I guess.

00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:32.054
By the way. how did they
get inside your house?

00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:35.516
The house is technically impenetrable.
It's built like a safe.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.602
-How did they get the door open?
-A safe…

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.064
You're a genius!

00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:47.069
Hey! Go to Jeongan-myeon 21-2.
Paju. Gyeonggi Province.

00:40:48.028 --> 00:40:51.073
I just remembered what that key is!
It's for a safe!

00:40:51.907 --> 00:40:54.869
How did you even think of that?

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.121
You're so adorable.

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:12.845
Bong-seon.

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.531
Wait here. Bong-seon.

00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:33.532
What is this place?

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.117
This place?

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:38.996
It's my first lab my brother built for me.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.129
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.039
Come on.

00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:08.294
It was around here somewhere.

00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:23.851
Who took this?

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.582
WHAT MODEL PLANE DID HE RIDE?

00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:49.585
FUND MANAGER KIM DONG-HYEON

00:43:49.668 --> 00:43:51.420
YOO EUN-JI NAMED DEPUTY PRESIDENT

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.466
HAN TAE-SUL DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.102
HAN TAE-SUL
QUANTUM & TIME CEO

00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:09.104
What is this?

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:12.524
What took you so long?

00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:36.674
What is all this?

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:44.098
This is the key to the safe. right?

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:45.849
Where's the safe?

00:44:49.895 --> 00:44:51.313
Why did you deceive me?

00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:55.984
Why did you pretend you were dead?

00:44:58.487 --> 00:44:59.696
How…

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:03.700
How could you do this to me?

00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:06.203
Answer your phone.

00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:15.796
-Hello?
-<i>Mr. Han Tae-sul?</i>

00:45:16.588 --> 00:45:20.259
<i>Are you the famous Han Tae-sul?</i>

00:45:20.342 --> 00:45:24.263
You should've told me. It's an honor.

00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:29.893
<i>The safe was really heavy.</i>

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:31.812
Who are you?

00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:35.482
<i>You have the key. right?</i>

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:38.819
Who are you?

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:40.362
Come on. don't shout.

00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:44.283
Shouting won't get you anywhere.

00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:47.536
<i>We should meet
and talk it out heart-to-heart.</i>

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.914
What happened to my brother?

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:55.210
<i>Let's take our time to talk.</i>

00:45:55.294 --> 00:45:59.756
<i>You have the key. and I have the safe.</i>

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.676
<i>It takes two to tango. you know.</i>

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:05.095
<i>We should meet up and talk.</i>

00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:10.684
And it seems everything inside
will be destroyed if you force it open.

00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:14.897
<i>That's pretty smart.</i>

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:18.817
How do you know my brother?

00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:19.735
Your brother?

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:23.989
Well. we're business partners.

00:46:24.573 --> 00:46:25.949
Just tell me one thing.

00:46:26.742 --> 00:46:28.368
Was my brother alive all this time?

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.162
Of course!

00:46:30.245 --> 00:46:32.247
-Why?
-<i>"Why?"</i>

00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:36.335
<i>My gosh. He's alive because he isn't dead!</i>

00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:39.963
What about the plane crash?
How did that happen?

00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:43.008
<i>You said you were going to ask one thing.
Question time is over.</i>

00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:46.470
All we need is that key.

00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:50.057
We'll come find you.
so take care of yourself until then.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.392
and keep that key safe.

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:55.479
Since we're making a deal.

00:46:55.562 --> 00:46:59.358
let me offer you something as an extra.

00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:03.362
Take a look outside.

00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:16.833
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:41.858
You see men in black uniforms. right?

00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:53.829
Hey. Bong-seon.

00:47:53.912 --> 00:47:57.207
Sir. some strange people
are heading that way.

00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.668
Yes. I know. Hang on. don't hang up.

00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:00.877
Okay.

00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:04.298
Who are those guys?

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:06.049
The Control Bureau.

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.469
<i>The Control Bureau.</i>

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.097
Are you

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.058
on their side?

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:18.478
<i>Those guys are ruthless.</i>

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:22.774
Once they catch you.
you'll never get back home alive.

00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:26.486
If you want to know what's going on.
just do as I tell you.

00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:32.284
I'll tell you what I tell all my clients.

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:36.830
"Run."

00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:55.390
Darn it.

00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:58.935
-Bong-seon.
-<i>Yes. sir.</i>

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.229
Get the car started.

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:38.558
Move in. We're going to capture him alive.

00:49:39.184 --> 00:49:40.519
Go.

00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:15.429
Darn it.

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.973
-Bong-seon!
-Yes. sir!

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:18.408
Bong-seon.

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:20.452
Bong-seon!

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.339
Bong-seon. let's go. Bong-seon!

00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:43.725
You'll lose your breath
if you keep running like that.

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:45.143
Come with us.

00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:48.230
Bong-seon.

00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:19.845
<i>Forty-eight kilometers
until your destination.</i>

00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:22.222
Turn that off.

00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:26.059
Sorry. sir.

00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:49.291
IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUREAU

00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.835
"Immigration Control Bureau"?

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:56.715
Aren't you going a bit overboard
with immigrant management?

00:52:59.134 --> 00:53:00.844
They're dangerous.

00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:21.239
IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUREAU

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.049
NO SIGNAL

00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:23.468
Damn it.

00:54:51.663 --> 00:54:53.665
Pardon us for what we did to you.

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.292
I can't get a signal.

00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:58.753
-It's for security purposes.
-What is this place?

00:54:58.837 --> 00:54:59.879
The Immigration Office?

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:02.257
No. we've become a bureau since last year.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.093
We're the Immigration Control Bureau.
Team 7.

00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:08.054
Excuse us for a moment.

00:55:17.522 --> 00:55:18.815
What are you doing?

00:55:24.362 --> 00:55:26.072
Have you met this woman before?

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.540
No. Who is that?

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:40.128
Where is the suitcase?

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:46.426
Let me ask you again.

00:55:47.093 --> 00:55:48.470
Where is the suitcase?

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:51.890
Who are you guys?

00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:54.768
I told you
that we're the Immigration Control Bureau.

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:58.188
Managing immigrants coming from where?
What does that have to do with me?

00:55:58.271 --> 00:56:00.440
Mr. Han. the important thing

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.609
isn't where they come from.

00:56:11.576 --> 00:56:15.038
We don't want to harm you. Mr. Han.

00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:18.625
Normally. we should've
taken care of you already.

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:21.252
but because of your social status…

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:25.381
You know what government business is like.

00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:27.801
Please cooperate.

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:30.095
I'll ask you one last time.
Where's the suitcase?

00:56:31.137 --> 00:56:32.263
I don't know.

00:56:33.264 --> 00:56:34.432
All right.

00:56:35.517 --> 00:56:37.352
You seem to be quite a playboy.

00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:41.272
It's best to stay out of trouble
in these unsettling times.

00:56:41.356 --> 00:56:42.565
don't you think?

00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:44.984
There will be a "Me Too" article
released tomorrow.

00:56:45.985 --> 00:56:46.820
What?

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.364
I guess your stock prices will drop
about ten percent.

00:56:49.447 --> 00:56:53.618
And for the day after tomorrow…
Yes. this will be nice.

00:56:53.701 --> 00:56:55.078
Retinol. diazepam…

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:58.498
Habitual use
of illegal psychotropic drugs.

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.667
If there's an article
about the CEO Han Tae-san

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.794
being a drug addict.

00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:05.004
you'll have to give up your position.

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.548
Shall we meet again after that?

00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:11.678
If you sit in that chair
after you become a normal citizen.

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:14.806
you won't be able to say things
so confidently like

00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:17.058
"I don't know. I don't remember" again.

00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:19.936
Whatever you want.

00:57:20.019 --> 00:57:23.940
Everyone starts out as confident as you.

00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:26.234
But they all act the same eventually.

00:57:26.317 --> 00:57:29.112
They say "Please let me live.
I'll tell you everything.

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:30.989
Please just kill me."

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:36.327
Like your brother. Han Tae-san.

00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:41.458
What did you just say?

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.793
Say that again!

00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:46.337
Take him home.

00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:49.424
You jerks! Come over here!

00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:50.967
Mr. Han!

00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:56.264
We're keeping an eye on you.
Watch your back.

00:57:56.347 --> 00:57:59.184
Let me go. Let go of me. you punks!

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:14.324
Mr. Han!

00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:17.118
Are you okay?

00:58:20.705 --> 00:58:23.833
Mr. Han. are you sure you're okay?

00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.418
I think you should get some rest.

00:58:57.742 --> 00:58:59.869
After I regained consciousness.

00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:02.497
I got a call from them.

00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:06.209
They said you'll be out in a few hours.

00:59:06.292 --> 00:59:08.253
They told me not to call anyone

00:59:08.336 --> 00:59:09.963
and to wait for you at your house.

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:12.340
Then I found you unconscious
at the front door.

00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:15.510
Who were those guys. though?

00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:17.679
The Control Bureau.

00:59:18.263 --> 00:59:20.139
Controlling what?

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:23.017
I don't know. either.
They wouldn't tell me.

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:29.315
I think you should really stay home
from now on.

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.858
That threat you received.

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:34.112
-and what happened yesterday…
-Let's go.

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:35.863
Where?

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.367
Busan.

00:59:51.212 --> 00:59:52.880
Two tickets to Busan. please.

00:59:54.173 --> 00:59:56.884
The 10:30 KTX Train arrives the earliest.

00:59:56.968 --> 00:59:59.554
-How much is it?
-It's 119.600 won for two tickets.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.765
Gosh. What about a Mugunghwa Train?

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:05.101
There's one that leaves at 10:20.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:08.062
-How much is that one?
-It's 57.200 won.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.482
I'll get two tickets for that.

01:00:12.066 --> 01:00:14.736
If you're using your card.
insert it in the device here.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:16.446
No. I'm paying with cash.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.950
Here's 56.000 won. and…

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.628
Here. 1.200 won.

01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:44.515
Two executive car seats
for a KTX Train to Busan.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.429
What happened. Tae-san?

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.483
Bong-seon.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:39.070
Do you think I've lost my mind?

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:41.906
I'm not sure.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:44.951
I just…

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.123
miss my brother.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.500
That's all.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:56.921
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:00.550
-If they come to the conference…
-What if they do?

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.760
Maybe they're the ones

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:05.596
who wrote that on the wall.
The Control Bureau or something.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.015
-No. they're not.
-How would you know that?

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.810
If they wanted to kill me.
they'd have done it yesterday.

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:14.522
-Then who…
-How would I know?

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.818
By the way. you're riding a train
instead of a plane…

01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:22.530
Would you want to ride a plane
after a plane accident?

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:28.995
Gosh. those thieves. They always try
to make you buy the expensive ones.

01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:43.509
Isn't it funny?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.304
Look at the screen over there.

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:51.225
The KTX Train leaves ten minutes later
than the Mugunghwa Train.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.935
but it arrives three hours earlier.

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:55.480
Doesn't that resemble our lives?

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.649
People who have wealthy parents
get to ride KTX Trains

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.693
and arrive earlier than other guys

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.612
even when they leave later than them.

01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:06.240
Life is so unfair.

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:13.664
What? Is that blood?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.084
Yes.

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:23.883
But who were those guys?

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.093
They said they were the Control Bureau.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.679
Are you an illegal immigrant?

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:31.224
None of your business.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.267
-Hey.
-What?

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:37.438
Who were they? They even had guns!

01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:39.398
The Control Bureau.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:43.152
What kind of government bureau
carries guns around like that?

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.738
My gosh. I almost died. you know.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.408
I can't die. I told you.

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:51.869
I'm the breadwinner of my family.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:54.247
If you don't tell me the lottery number…

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:58.501
I can't even go home.
and my boss isn't picking up my calls.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.796
I don't even have money for the trip back.

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:05.800
-Just report me.
-What?

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.344
Jeez. What do you take me for?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:20.147
But why are you looking for Han Tae-sul?
Do you know him?

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.775
Or is there money involved?

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.111
Or is it a love affair?

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.244
Is he really going to die?

01:04:33.327 --> 01:04:36.205
Is he an illegal immigrant too?
Or is he in the Control Bureau?

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:38.165
-No.
-Then what?

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:47.884
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:15.448
What?

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.159
What the…

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:27.293
Damn it.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:43.142
Hey! Are you in here?

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.531
Damn it.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.038
Hey!

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:10.211
Damn it!

01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:24.100
Damn it.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:03.681
<i>Hasn't this ever happened to you?</i>

01:09:03.764 --> 01:09:07.518
<i>Seeing a photo of something
that hasn't happened yet. for example.</i>

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.770
The future is already here.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:13.023
<i>It's just not widely in use yet.</i>

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:16.569
<i>The company decided not to give in
to the kidnapper's demands.</i>

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:19.446
<i>But how. when Tae-sul is still missing?</i>

01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:21.073
We still have you.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.741
<i>We need to make a move now.</i>

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.618
You almost had us killed!

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.287
Who put you up to this?

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.956
Are you stalking me?
Is this like a one-night stand?

01:09:29.039 --> 01:09:30.291
As if.

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:33.419
I'm the owner of Asia Mart.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:38.507
<i>What we do here is…
We're like the unofficial embassy.</i>

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:44.180
<i>We take care of people who came here
from other places.</i>

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.557
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:50.936
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

01:09:52.608 --> 01:09:54.219
