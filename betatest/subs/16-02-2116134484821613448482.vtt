00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:34.450
- Sir...
- Master Keegan.

00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:35.484
this is a letter
to your parents

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.322
explaining the circumstances
of your suspension.

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:44.060
That's mental.

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:45.528
<i>You're</i> mental.

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.097
You disrupted
an entire block during class.

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:51.736
You absolutely
terrified Mrs. Stapleton.

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:55.004
OK. Well. I'm glad
I got this opportunity

00:01:55.037 --> 00:01:56.140
to tell my side of the story.

00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:57.507
There is no story.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.009
[boy] I disagree.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:00.277
I think there is a story.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.780
I think there's a story
of when a faculty

00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:04.882
repeatedly hands out
detentions to students

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.084
for sitting on top
of dangerous lockers

00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:08.919
that could fall over
at any moment.

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:12.121
when actually it's a health
and safety management issue.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:14.191
and if you just screwed
the lockers to the walls.

00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:16.859
they wouldn't be dangerous.
but you don't.

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:20.163
And I think it's because you're
worried about reducing the value

00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:22.064
of your grade-whatever
listed building.

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:24.067
that one day you'll probably
sell for billions

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.037
and then divide that amongst
the shareholders.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.508
[chuckles]

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:36.980
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:38.816
You haven't been
in Mrs. Stapleton's class.

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:41.584
You don't give a toss
about the lockers. Lee.

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:46.556
You just like to cause trouble.
It's childish.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.594
This is St. Mark's. We don't
indulge children. we make men.

00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:54.530
You of all people
should appreciate that.

00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:57.334
A scholarship here is rare. Lee.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.304
Very rare.

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:02.906
You don't realize
how lucky you are.

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:05.975
Hopefully you will now.

Is there something else?

00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:09.939
Oh. Lee.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.647
Home. For good this time.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.621
No.

00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:36.992
That's mental.

00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:39.362
Yeah. it wasn't
for the prank. either.

00:05:39.396 --> 00:05:40.764
Oh. and if you want
your weed back.

00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:44.067
you'll have to go and have
a chat with the Headmaster.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.371
- Zero tolerance policy.
- Lee. Get in.

00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:49.673
Wait. wait. wait.
I can do something.

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:52.275

- He won't want you involved.

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:53.576
Lee!

- Sorry?

Such a waste.

he was still here.

and never said a word about it.

But he must
have really missed her.

00:20:20.308 --> 00:20:23.980
Funny. he was always such
a pervert when she was around.

00:20:25.114 --> 00:20:27.048
We?

pretty clear now.

00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:12.028
Anyway. we are going
to take the lesser routes.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.597
because the main roads
will be blocked or dangerous.

00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:20.403
I will take this. just in case.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:46.162
OK. remember. we're looking
for food with a long shelf life.

00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:47.562
That's packaged goods.

00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:49.597
So. forget organic.
forget fresh.

00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:51.968
It's the opposite of everything
you've been taught in food tech.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.237
And I suggest we go out in...

00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:56.571
Yes. Lee?

00:21:56.605 --> 00:21:58.641
Sorry. sir. it's just.

00:21:58.673 --> 00:22:02.310
how do we know there's
anything left at Tesco?

00:22:02.344 --> 00:22:05.213
It's just that
it's pretty mad out there.

00:22:05.247 --> 00:22:06.716
I passed a few shops
on the way here

00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:07.884
and they were empty already.

00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:11.553
And Tesco's is. like. the first
place you'd go to. so...

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:15.758
Well. we have to try. Lee.

- [Bates] I'm in charge.

Who are you?

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:26.288
I represent Worham Town.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.658
and the authority
of Georgina Baker...

00:24:33.795 --> 00:24:39.634

of Worham Parish Council.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.672
Yes.

00:24:43.704 --> 00:24:47.409
Actually St. Mark's falls
within the parish borders.

The two people
you're hiding are thieves.

They stole from Worham Town.

00:25:07.195 --> 00:25:08.630
Are you serious?

00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:11.333
We have to enforce
the rule of law.

00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:12.535

00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:15.703

to do that around here.

you know?

00:25:19.942 --> 00:25:21.743

Is Mr. Hammond going to die?

This isn't a hospital.
We can keep it clean. drain it.

00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:18.820
But we don't have the drugs
for infection

00:28:18.854 --> 00:28:20.556

don't have any blood.

- Yeah.

00:28:22.656 --> 00:28:23.625
Well. can we use ours?

That's not how it works. Lee.
There are types.

in class...

- Mac. what blood type are you?
- No idea. mate.

Great. thanks.
Matron. what blood type are you?

00:28:30.699 --> 00:28:31.866
- O negative.
- Sir?

I want nothing more in the whole
world than to see her again.

01:05:59.211 --> 01:06:02.148
So I understand. I do.

01:06:04.117 --> 01:06:05.752
I have a very vested interest

01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:08.955
in figuring some sort
of way out of this.

01:06:10.289 --> 01:06:12.893
So can we find
a way out of this?

01:06:14.059 --> 01:06:16.195
It's Lee. isn't it?

01:06:17.163 --> 01:06:19.865
Did she call you that?

01:06:19.898 --> 01:06:22.034
- [Lee] I guess.
- Hmm. Well...

01:06:23.068 --> 01:06:24.871
OK. Lee.

01:06:24.903 --> 01:06:28.108
If you can prove to me that
my daughter isn't in there.

01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:30.644
maybe we can.

01:06:30.677 --> 01:06:32.245
Your move.

01:06:46.025 --> 01:06:47.894
I can't prove that.

01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:51.664
Because she is in there.

01:06:55.702 --> 01:06:58.004
Go on.

01:06:58.036 --> 01:07:02.107
There's something you have
to understand. She started it.

01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:04.411
Nobody here
is responsible for this.

01:07:04.443 --> 01:07:06.779
She was just doing her job.

01:07:06.813 --> 01:07:07.681
Her job's shooting at children?

01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:10.750
Look. I have no doubt
she buggered it up.

01:07:10.782 --> 01:07:13.420
But that doesn't change
anything for me. Lee.

01:07:16.289 --> 01:07:19.726
In the days after the virus hit.
I saw panic.

01:07:19.759 --> 01:07:23.963
And then I saw panic
change very quickly to savagery.

01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:27.334
in people that I'd lived with
and worked with.

01:07:29.101 --> 01:07:31.403
But it must have always
been there. right?

01:07:31.436 --> 01:07:33.139
Beneath the surface.

01:07:33.172 --> 01:07:37.744
So someone somewhere dropped
the wrong petri dish. Fine.

01:07:37.777 --> 01:07:41.313
But in a world
of mobile pornography.

01:07:41.347 --> 01:07:45.151
open borders
and franchise bakeries.

01:07:45.184 --> 01:07:49.222
you were heading for a collapse
one way or another.

01:07:49.255 --> 01:07:52.759
I can remember a time
when things were better.

01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:56.163
but it wasn't right before
the virus.

01:07:58.396 --> 01:08:02.268
<i>Have you asked yourself
how this place looks?</i>

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.237
<i>To us? To outsiders?</i>

01:08:06.438 --> 01:08:09.141
<i>This used to be a fine school.</i>

01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:15.481
<i>But now. like everything else.
it's... broken.</i>

01:08:15.514 --> 01:08:17.250
<i>Corrupted.</i>

01:08:20.485 --> 01:08:23.890
<i>I have no faith anymore. Lee.</i>

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:26.493
<i>No faith in people.</i>

01:08:26.525 --> 01:08:29.095
<i>No faith in the future.</i>

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:32.297
<i>All you can do
is look after your own.</i>

01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:35.335
<i>Because even if we rebuild.</i>

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:36.770
it's still going to be there.

01:08:36.802 --> 01:08:39.404
this awful thing
that I see here now.

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:42.475
in a boy called Lee
with a gun at his feet.

01:08:50.048 --> 01:08:51.917
Now's your chance.

01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:53.418
[Baker tries to speak
through gag]

01:08:53.452 --> 01:08:55.155
Both of you.

01:09:03.095 --> 01:09:05.132
You can't be a virgin anymore.

01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:08.134
[gasps]

01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:10.336
[muffled shrieks]

01:09:10.368 --> 01:09:11.537
Wylie. you want to get involved?

01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:13.506
What the hell are you doing?

01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:22.081
I wouldn't want
to trouble you with it. sir.

01:09:24.617 --> 01:09:27.354
How bloody dare you?

01:09:35.094 --> 01:09:37.264
Who the hell are you?

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:41.501
You're not one of <i>our</i> boys.

01:09:43.235 --> 01:09:44.903
[grunts]

01:09:44.936 --> 01:09:47.506
More than you are.

01:09:47.539 --> 01:09:50.176
You stop this right now.
Sean MacKillick!

01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:54.881
[Georgina]
Let me offer you this.

01:09:54.913 --> 01:09:57.250
Give me my daughter now.

01:09:57.283 --> 01:10:00.220
and maybe we don't
come in and take her.

01:10:04.457 --> 01:10:06.192
OK.

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:08.395
That's good. that's really good.

01:10:10.029 --> 01:10:12.532
One last thing
before we do that.

01:10:12.564 --> 01:10:15.201
I want to warn you
of some changes to Claire

01:10:15.234 --> 01:10:19.439
that you may find
slightly upsetting.

01:10:20.338 --> 01:10:21.407
During the incident...

01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:24.176
If you've hurt one hair
on her head.

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:27.314
I swear by the God
who left us a long time ago...

01:10:29.614 --> 01:10:32.318
I'll wear your skin as a onesie.

01:10:40.326 --> 01:10:42.427
[boys laugh]

01:10:42.461 --> 01:10:46.164
Hold... and up.

01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:48.401
- [gasps]
- [boys laugh]

01:10:48.434 --> 01:10:51.337
[coughing]
This is madness. boys!

01:10:51.369 --> 01:10:53.405
It's a rite of passage.
actually. sir.

01:10:53.439 --> 01:10:55.608
Believe it or not.
I've been there myself.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.909
Back in the day.

01:10:56.943 --> 01:10:58.578

01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:05.217
[Bates gasps]

01:11:06.452 --> 01:11:10.023
Now. be a man
and do the right thing.

01:11:12.257 --> 01:11:14.027
[chuckles]

01:11:16.429 --> 01:11:18.131
You're insane.

01:11:21.367 --> 01:11:23.637
This must be exhausting for you.

01:11:25.438 --> 01:11:27.073
All of you.

01:11:28.274 --> 01:11:30.610
Being so right all the time.

01:11:32.243 --> 01:11:34.480
How can everyone be so right?

01:11:35.613 --> 01:11:40.152
I agree. nothing's changed.

01:11:40.185 --> 01:11:42.087
The whole world dies

01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:45.992
and somehow now there are more
people telling me what to do.

01:11:47.659 --> 01:11:49.528
Fuck you.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.632
Fuck you!

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:54.867
I can promise you this.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.704
If you don't pack up
and fuck off. she <i>is</i> gonna die!

01:11:59.704 --> 01:12:01.975
And it won't be my doing.

01:12:04.243 --> 01:12:09.048
He's almost finished.
It's a baker's dozen. [growls]

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.219
- Go on. boys.
- Don't you dare.

01:12:14.619 --> 01:12:16.155
Last one.

[Matron] Let him go.

01:12:37.143 --> 01:12:38.644
Hold.

01:12:38.676 --> 01:12:40.112
You stop now.

01:12:40.145 --> 01:12:43.215
- Hold! Hold!
- Stop now!

01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:45.118
Stop!

Get off him! Now! Get off!

01:13:03.836 --> 01:13:05.771
He's not breathing!

01:13:13.779 --> 01:13:16.383
- I have to help him.
- Nobody move.

01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:20.119
- Please.
- Stay where you are!

01:14:19.177 --> 01:14:21.847
On your knees and stay there!

01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:26.251
You. untie her.

01:14:28.621 --> 01:14:30.789
She isn't tied.

01:14:30.823 --> 01:14:33.259
Don't try to mess with me. son.

01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:36.096
She can't move.

01:14:37.896 --> 01:14:39.631
She can't move at all.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:45.304
