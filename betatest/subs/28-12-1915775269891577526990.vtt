(breath whooshing)

52
00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:51.423
- And we've got action.

53
00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:02.601
(coffee mug clattering)

54
00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:05.437

00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.014
Oh. you stupid fucker.

61
00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.524
And so it begins.

62
00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:15.540
Surprise.

63
00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:20.512
Wakey wakey. eggs and bakey.

64
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.683
Rise and shine?

65
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.520
Yeah. no good.

66
00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:31.490
I hate wakey wakey and
rise and shine. too.

67
00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:32.891
There's really no good
phrase to start the morning

68
00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.760
unless you're a morning person.

69
00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:36.895
I guess you'd be fine
with any old greeting.

70
00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:41.032
You a morning person. Brad?

71
00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:42.367
Don't need an alarm clock.

72
00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.701
you just wake up with a gleam in
your eye

73
00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:46.471
and a pep in your step.
ready for a brand new day?

74
00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.508
Yeah. I bet you're one of those
people.

75
00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:54.146
(snorts) Not this guy. though.
am I right?

76
00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:55.514
Needs his beauty sleep.

77
00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:03.722
(smelling salt cracking)

78
00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:04.689
Isn't that right. Dylan?

79
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:06.558
(Dylan coughing)
You need a good nine to 10

80
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.560
hours before you start your day?

81
00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:11.163
(Brad sniffing)

82
00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:13.732
- Help!

83
00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.467
- Uh. help!

84
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.536
¶ Help! ¶

85
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.807
Come on. we almost had a
good harmony going there.

86
00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:22.741
That was nice.

87
00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:25.677
Yell all you want.

88
00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.747
There ain't nobody out
there but us chickens.

89
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:31.850
- What the fuck?

90
00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:35.887
- Yes indeed. what the fuck.

91
00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.856
That is the question.

92
00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:39.724
So glad you finally asked.

93
00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:40.976
- Yeah. what the fuck?

94
00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:42.227
- Yeah. the question's
already been established

95
00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.462
by your buddy here.

96
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.164
- What the fuck?

97
00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.166
- It's been established.

98
00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:51.102
- What the. what the fuck is
this?

99
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:56.608
- So here's your "what the
fuck."

100
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.513
You're both gonna help me
answer a really big question.

101
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.515
You've been selected to be a
part

102
00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:07.085
of a truly important study. an
experiment.

103
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.187
(Dylan groaning)

104
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.756
(breath whooshing) Oh. my
God. I'm so sorry. Dylan.

105
00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:13.925
I knew that words like
experiment or study

106
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.560
would make you agitated.

107
00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:16.728
- Fuck you. bitch.

108
00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:19.798
- Good one.

109
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:27.739
I won't use words like
study or experiment anymore.

110
00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:30.675
We're gonna play a little game.

111
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.644
- Holy shit. what is this?

112
00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:33.745
- Oh. shit. what?

113
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.516
- My legs. I can't feel my legs.

114
00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:39.718
What did you do to my legs?

115
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.952
- Yeah. what did you do to my
legs?

116
00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:46.024
(electricity sizzling)
(Brad and Dylan yelping)

117
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.562
- Okay now. everybody just calm
down.

118
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:52.564
You're asking a lot of
questions. and rightfully so.

119
00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:55.000
but we've gotta have some order

120
00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:57.102
if anything's gonna get done
around here.

121
00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:59.271
You haven't even given me a
chance

122
00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:00.805
to address your concerns.

123
00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:02.641
- Well then. start answering.
you bitch.

124
00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.109
- Yeah. bitch.

125
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.944
(electricity sizzling)
(Dylan yelping)

126
00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:08.146
- God. he's so much worse than I
imagined.

127
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:11.983
- What's your deal?

128
00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:18.757
- Let's get on the same
page here. shall we?

129
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.561
Very good. now.

130
00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:26.965
Ask me a question. just one.

131
00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:30.168
- Who are you. like for real?

132
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.102
- Yeah.

133
00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.022
- I'm your abductor.

134
00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:36.140
- Great. and what should
we call our abductor?

135
00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:37.642
(Meg laughs)

136
00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:39.110
Sorry. abductress.

137
00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.180
- General rule to live by.

138
00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:45.216
when going to a bar and
trying to take a girl home.

139
00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:47.018
it might be considered rude

140
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.688
to not even have a clue
as to what her name is.

141
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.924
- You were taking us to your
place.

142
00:09:55.896 --> 00:10:00.599
- My name's Meg. but that's not
important.

143
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:01.666
Next question.

144
00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:03.668
- Where are we?

145
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.706
- Deep end of an empty pool
in an empty neighborhood.

146
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.742
Next question.

147
00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.812
- Which neighborhood. where?

148
00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:15.780
- Not important.

149
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.083
- Fucking bitch.

150
00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.752
(electricity sizzling)
(Dylan yelping)

151
00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:21.753
- Do go on.

152
00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.056
- What is this?

153
00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.959
- A study. an experiment.

154
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.194
I already told you that.

155
00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:33.131
- Ask her if she'll let us go.

156
00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:39.938
- Have you. have you maimed me.
maimed us?

157
00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:42.741
Will I walk again?

158
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:49.381
- (laughing) Oh God. no
(laughing).

159
00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.086
No. no. no. I didn't maim you.

160
00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.722
I. this isn't one of those long
stings.

161
00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:00.058
In fact. let's just say
that we'll be done with this

162
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.328
by the time the sun drops
behind that hill over there.

163
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.764
We'll be done one way or
another.

164
00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:09.401
That much I promise you. next?

165
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.303
- Why?

166
00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:18.343
- Fancy Pants! (laughing)

167
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.713
(electricity buzzing)
(Dylan squealing)

168
00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:22.747
- And?

169
00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:23.682
- Know him?

170
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:25.950
- Sure. Aaron.

171
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.219
- Orin.

172
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.055
- Orin. whatever. so what?

173
00:11:31.058 --> 00:11:33.124
- And who is Orin to you. Brad?

174
00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.359
- He's a kid at school.

175
00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:37.796
- Who is Orin to the two of you?

176
00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:40.031
- He's just some kid.

177
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.268
- Just some kid?

178
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.339
In the interest of brevity

179
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:49.974
and moving this soiree right
along.

180
00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:53.745
I'm gonna read some brief and
blatantly painful excerpts

181
00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:55.113
from Orin's journal.

182
00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.282
- Who the fuck keeps a journal
(laughing)?

183
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.854
- October 8th. last year.

184
00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.823
My ear continues to ring
from the punch I took

185
00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:06.057
from Dylan in the hall today.

186
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.258
December 5th. last year.

187
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.461
Brad and his bulldog. Dylan.

188
00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:10.929
are transferred out of my gym
glass.

189
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.397
This is big news for me as it
means

190
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.266
I won't be tortured after
lunch on the regular anymore.

191
00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:17.102
December 13th. this year.

192
00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:20.004
I miss being able to schedule
my abuse and humiliation.

193
00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:22.507
Now that Brad and the animal
are no longer in my gym class.

194
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:24.476
they find me whenever they
can throughout the day.

195
00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:26.511
I never know when the attacks
are coming.

196
00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:28.780
Once I graduate and move
on from this hellhole.

197
00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:30.632
they will. too.

198
00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:32.483
I'm sure they'll learn to mask
their hatred to an extent.

199
00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:33.418
but they'll still be out there.

200
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.153
as others will like them.

201
00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.887
They'll always find ways
to scourge the undeserving

202
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.356
and make lives miserable in
their wake.

203
00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:39.891
I really don't see an end.

204
00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:42.193
No light at the end of this
tunnel.

205
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.865
(pages clapping)

206
00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:49.167
(journal thudding)

207
00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:52.504
- (snickers) Dude's
obsessed with us (laughing).

208
00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:55.073
- Where exactly was the
brevity in all of that?

209
00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:56.875
- Yeah. brevity.

210
00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:58.460
What is that?

211
00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:00.044
- Pretty long-winded and
dramatic. if you ask me.

212
00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:01.980
- I didn't.

213
00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:10.421
Do you think that homosexuality
is a choice. Brad?

214
00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:11.422
- A choice?

215
00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:13.124
- Yeah.

216
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.825
Do people choose to be gay. or
don't they?

217
00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:18.062
- We've all got free will. so
yeah.

218
00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:19.998
I guess it's totally a choice.

219
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:21.900
- Right.

220
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.269
Let me ask you this. Brad.

221
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.005
Think your parents are proud?

222
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.042
Parents. older sister?

223
00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:32.310
Two older sisters. right?

224
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.213
- Stalker.

225
00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.048
It's not the first time some
chick

226
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.082
has stalked me.

227
00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:40.151
- Ugh. get over yourself.

228
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.519
Think they're proud?

229
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.123
- Yeah. I'd like to think so.

230
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.958
- Yeah. I bet they're proud.

231
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.161
Bet your mom and dad. older
sisters Susan and Judy.

232
00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.231
are so proud of their
all-American son.

233
00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.366
little brother. making his way

234
00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:57.602
through the high school ranks so
amicably.

235
00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:00.071
- You could say that.

236
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.309
- What about you?

237
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:05.844
- What about me?

238
00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:10.982
- No siblings. no dad to
make him proud or look up to.

239
00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:14.219
Had to go find a chum to follow
at school.

240
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.620
- I don't follow shit!

241
00:14:17.224 --> 00:14:18.857
- Is homosexuality a choice?

242
00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:24.195
- Yeah. it is.

243
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.865
- No siblings. raised by your
grandma.

244
00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.032
with a double-digit IQ.

245
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.236
Must be so difficult for you.

246
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:35.139
- Yeah. well. fuck you.

247
00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.411
- Something that's always
made so little sense to me

248
00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:42.297
about people like you

249
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.182
is your absolute opposition
to people of color.

250
00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:45.283
religion hooking up.

251
00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.352
but when it comes to the sexes.

252
00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:49.487
they have to be opposite
by their very definition.

253
00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:51.589
- So now. we're bigots. too?

254
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:53.057
Hey. don't listen to her.

255
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.225
She's trying to mind fuck you.

256
00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.660
trying to mind fuck the both of
us.

257
00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:57.662
Don't know why yet. but
that's what she's doing.

258
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.065
- Dylan asked me if was
the Mayor of Queertown

259
00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.133
before slapping me across
the face in the quad.

260
00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:03.401
(Dylan snickering)

261
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.236
(electricity sizzling)
(Dylan squealing)

262
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.138
Brad and Dylan followed
me to my car. got in.

263
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.407
and demanded that I take
them to the liquor store.

264
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.175
I did. and they adhered rainbow
stickers

265
00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:13.177
all over my windows as I drove
them there.

266
00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:16.347
I can't peel them off without
tearing my window tint.

267
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:19.250
Brad held me down and spit in my
mouth.

268
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.418
- All right. all right.

269
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.287
So we had some fun with this
guy.

270
00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:24.055
Normal high school stuff.

271
00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:25.523
It happens every day.

272
00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:26.691
What's it to you?

273
00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:28.993
Is he your little brother or
some shit?

274
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.934
Great. so we fucked with
your little brother.

275
00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.335
So what. it happens.

276
00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:39.203
Shit like that happens.

277
00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.406
Doesn't mean you go out and
capture.

278
00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:44.075
you kidnap people and tie them
up

279
00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:45.727
like you're part of some kind

280
00:15:45.728 --> 00:15:47.378
of underground military
operation.

281
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.048
Plus being his sister.
I bet you have an idea

282
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.183
of what an insufferable prick he
can be.

283
00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:54.319
I'm gonna ask you again.

284
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.988
what the fuck do you want from
us?

285
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.556
- Yeah. just tell us what you
want.

286
00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.158
and we'll give it to
you. anything you want.

287
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.659
- Shut your fucking face.

288
00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:02.593
- Sorry. Brad.

289
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:07.231
- We won't give her anything she
wants.

290
00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:08.433
We won't give her shit.

291
00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:12.236
- Right. nothin' is what she'll
get.

292
00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:14.706
We won't give you shit
(snickers).

293
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:21.346
- (laughs) Tell me. Dylan. do
you know what a hate crime is?

294
00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.715
- Of course I do.

295
00:16:23.717 --> 00:16:26.150
And now you're doing this to us.

296
00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:29.654
so this is a hate hate crime
crime.

297
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.557
You're hate hate crime criming
us.

298
00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.463
- That checks out. that actually
works.

299
00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:40.431
This is a hate hate crime crime.

300
00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:43.334
because you hate hate
crimes. and this is a crime.

301
00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.235
- Totally.

302
00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:48.639
- You done (snickering)?

303
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:54.512
Orin was always a really
smart kid. you know.

304
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.081
(ominous electronic music)

305
00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:58.483
When he decided to do it.

306
00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:01.719
he knew not to do it like
they do in the movies.

307
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.056
You know. east to west.

308
00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:10.495
Instead. he dragged the blade
southbound.

309
00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:12.463
parallel to the vein.

310
00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:16.200
What would you say if I told
you this was your fault?

311
00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:21.172
- Again. what do you want from
us?

312
00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:24.275
- I'm gonna give you the
opportunity

313
00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.077
to test your theory.

314
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.445
You know. very few theorists
ever get

315
00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:29.864
the opportunity to do that.

316
00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:32.282
but you guys are gonna prove
or disprove your theory

317
00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:33.818
that you have so much faith in.

318
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:36.654
And by doing so.

319
00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.488
you'll also be helping me
with my thesis project.

320
00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:39.757
Isn't that great?

321
00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:41.692
- What's the bitch talking about
now?

322
00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.327
- No idea.

323
00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:47.532
- Brad. Dylan. you two
aren't going anywhere

324
00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.100
until you prove to me.

325
00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.335
for our audience over there.

326
00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:54.806
that sexual proclivity is a
choice.

327
00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:57.458
- What's that mean?

328
00:17:57.459 --> 00:17:59.309
What the fuck is this
crazy bitch talking about?

329
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.817
- I think she wants us to have
sex.

330
00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:07.585
- Fuck that. with her?

331
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.352
No way. I'd never touch that
skank.

332
00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:11.589
- Logistically speaking. that
would be damn near impossible.

333
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.858
given your bondage and whatnot.

334
00:18:15.195 --> 00:18:16.127
- Not her. Dyl.

335
00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:18.863
- Then what?

336
00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:25.336
Oh. you mean. me and you?

337
00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:28.639
She wants you and me to fuck
each other?

338
00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.809
Well. I'd have big problems with
that.

339
00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:36.747
- What I have in store
for you is much more fun.

340
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.868
See that one over there?

341
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.452
That one's you. streamed live.

342
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.490
And this one over here. that's
you.

343
00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:47.658
also streaming live.

344
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.759
Wave hello.

345
00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:50.862
Oh. I forgot. you can't.

346
00:18:50.864 --> 00:18:53.464
Well. nod or something. don't be
rude.

347
00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:57.535
And don't worry about the word
live here.

348
00:18:57.537 --> 00:18:59.437
Yes. they're both live.

349
00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.338
but nobody's been alerted
to their existence yet.

350
00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.274
It's just. you know. floating
around there on the internet.

351
00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:05.143
It's like a bunch of other dumb
shit.

352
00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.813
Right now. they're live for
the sake of documentation.

353
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.648
So nothing to worry about.

354
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.851
- Sure. why would we worry
about that minor detail?

355
00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:15.219
- No. I'm serious.

356
00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:16.576
I've got a guy who's really good

357
00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:17.932
with the whole face-blurring
thing.

358
00:19:17.933 --> 00:19:19.288
so if you play your cards right.

359
00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:21.659
you can keep your anonymity

360
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.162
even if this study
garners any recognition.

361
00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:31.669
Oh. over here.

362
00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:38.709
Just hold that thought.

363
00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:41.312
and I will be right back.

364
00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.188
- [Brad] Well. this is fuckin'
weird.

365
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.924
- [Dylan] Totally. but boobs.
right?

366
00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:56.360
- [Brad] I think I got a
concussion.

367
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.829
- [Dylan] Uh. like drugs?

368
00:19:58.831 --> 00:19:59.764
- [Brad] No.

369
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:02.600
Oh. fuck.

370
00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:05.603
- [Dylan] Is that your neck?

371
00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:06.604
- [Brad] I think so.

372
00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:09.373
- [Dylan] I thought it was your
nose.

373
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.942
- [Brad] You can see?

374
00:20:10.944 --> 00:20:12.276
- [Dylan] Yeah. I see
black. what about you?

375
00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:13.544
- [Brad] Oh. you fuckin' idiot.

376
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.946
I fuckin' hate you so much.

377
00:20:14.948 --> 00:20:16.714
- [Dylan] What. I'm
telling you what I see.

378
00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:18.282
- [Brad] Just leave me alone.

379
00:20:18.284 --> 00:20:20.284
- [Dylan] Why are you being like
this?

380
00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:23.354
- [Brad] Listen. shut up.

381
00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:24.388
- Sorry about that.

382
00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:28.226
Now. where were we. oh. yes.

383
00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:33.898
Mysterious third stream. ah.

384
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.499
- Where'd you just go?

385
00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:39.237
- Not important. but the third
stream is.

386
00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.938
Where could it be. what could it
be?

387
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.908
What. you're not even curious?

388
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.344
Sorry. I'm having way too much
fun.

389
00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.779
Ah. it's a classic case
of trickle-down abuse.

390
00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:50.281
- I'm not playing your game.

391
00:20:50.283 --> 00:20:52.550
- It's like when the
victim becomes the bully.

392
00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:53.884
and then they relish in it way
too much.

393
00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:55.653
except for I'm the de facto
victim

394
00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.421
because the actual
victim's in the hospital.

395
00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:00.825
Anyway. third stream
is coming from a camera

396
00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:04.662
that sits right down there.

397
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.332
Don't you kinda wanna see it?

398
00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:09.500
- Yes. show us.

399
00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.374
Fuck is that. whore?

400
00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:17.942
What the fuck is that?

401
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:21.012
- [Meg] (laughing) Care to see?

402
00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:23.981
All you have to do is look
right down. it's right there.

403
00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:27.852
(swelling suspenseful music)

404
00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:35.760
(laughing) Fantastic. isn't it?

405
00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:44.302
All you two have to do to
get out of here is make

406
00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:49.373
this little bell here chime.
(bell chiming)

407
00:21:50.943 --> 00:21:53.711
And I've got it rigged so that.
let's say.

408
00:21:53.713 --> 00:21:56.314
when you two meet.

409
00:21:57.617 --> 00:21:59.417
then it'll lift off of its
platform.

410
00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.786
and we'll hear its sweet little
bell.

411
00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.487
But the catch is.

412
00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:06.324
it has to be both members
and at the same time.

413
00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:07.792
You both following this?

414
00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:11.362
- No. members. what's
she talking about now?

415
00:22:11.364 --> 00:22:13.497
Who's a member. member of what?

416
00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:15.366
- Do you want to explain
it to him. or should I?

417
00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:18.569
Your dicks. honey.

418
00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:20.471
We're talkin' about your dicks.

419
00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.340
Need you to get a boner. a hard
on.

420
00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.709
a stiffy. wood. hard weiner.

421
00:22:24.711 --> 00:22:27.445
We need you to do this
at the same time together

422
00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:28.913
while looking into each other's
eyes

423
00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:30.748
because if homosexuality is a
choice.

424
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.451
like you two have claimed it
to be over and over again.

425
00:22:33.453 --> 00:22:37.555
then this shouldn't be too hard
(clears throat). difficult.

426
00:22:37.557 --> 00:22:38.889
shouldn't be too difficult.

427
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.593
By the way. this was no easy
task

428
00:22:42.595 --> 00:22:44.762
as the difference in length and
girth

429
00:22:44.764 --> 00:22:47.598
between you two is quite
significant.

430
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.037
Sorry. Brad. your buddy
here puts you to shame.

431
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:55.740
- I've got a big dick?

432
00:22:56.976 --> 00:22:58.676
Is she sayin' I got a big dick?

433
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.748
- Shall we begin with phase
one of the experiment?

434
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.651
- Oh God. I'm sorry. I got
nervous.

435
00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:09.053
- My. my.

436
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.454
- Sorry. bro. I get
bones when I get nervous.

437
00:23:10.456 --> 00:23:11.372
it just happens.

438
00:23:11.373 --> 00:23:12.289
(Brad groans)
- I guess now is as good

439
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.206
a time as any. you wanna
tell him. or should I?

440
00:23:13.207 --> 00:23:14.123
- Tell him what?

441
00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:15.293
- What. tell who what?

442
00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:16.460
- If you don't tell
him. I'm gonna tell him.

443
00:23:16.462 --> 00:23:17.862
- Okay. okay. I'll tell him.

444
00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:20.765
I always get boners when I'm
nervous.

445
00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.066
- [Meg] I suspected this
would happen at some point.

446
00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:24.135
but I didn't expect it
to happen so quickly.

447
00:23:24.137 --> 00:23:25.870
- When I get scared. it just
pops up.

448
00:23:25.872 --> 00:23:27.805
It just happens.

449
00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.739
- Truth is. when you get
nervous or you get scared.

450
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.676
your heart flutters.

451
00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:33.611
You know. the whole fight
or flight syndrome thing.

452
00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:35.579
This makes getting an
erection nearly impossible.

453
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.681
- Why the fuck is your dick
hard?

454
00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:39.750
- This is a different kind of
excitement.

455
00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:40.751
- This is fuckin' brutal.

456
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:42.420
- Well. I've got some good news.

457
00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:43.888
and I've got some bad news.

458
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.090
Good news is. you guys are half
way there.

459
00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.859
Brad just needs to chub up.
and you guys are good to go.

460
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:53.864
Bad news is. turns out Dylan's
one of those awful people.

461
00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:57.001
You know. you hear about it all
the time.

462
00:23:57.003 --> 00:24:00.905
(dramatic electronic music)
Politicians. CEOs. priests.

463
00:24:00.907 --> 00:24:03.040
Usually people in a power
position.

464
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.944
They repress their own sexual
desires

465
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:08.746
and instead turn it into
aggressive acts

466
00:24:08.748 --> 00:24:12.149
toward others that have similar
inclinations to their own.

467
00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:17.621
Didn't have to do much
searching to find out

468
00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:19.557
that your buddy here is clearly
gay.

469
00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:21.492
Always has been.

470
00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:24.695
- You're a fag?

471
00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:26.247
(electricity sizzling)
(Brad grunting)

472
00:24:26.248 --> 00:24:27.798
- She's lying. I love chicks.

473
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.069
- So cowardly. just looking
at that clueless face

474
00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:35.039
makes me ponder the mistakes of
evolution.

475
00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:37.174
Hell. I'd be real hard pressed

476
00:24:37.176 --> 00:24:39.743
not to get super sadistic on you
right now

477
00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:41.479
if you weren't so goddamn slow.

478
00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:43.147
Sad. really.

479
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.954
- Holy fuck. I can feel it
touching me.

480
00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:51.255
and it's getting bigger.

481
00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:53.958
- Told you he was a big boy.
- Oh. my God.

482
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.760
Anyway. should we get back
at the task at hand. guys?

483
00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:04.568
Oh. poor thing. you look awfully
thirsty.

484
00:25:11.177 --> 00:25:12.243
- Get the fuck away.
- Want some water?

485
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.046
(sighing) How about you. Dylan?

486
00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:17.781
- I've got the opposite problem.

487
00:25:18.918 --> 00:25:21.118
- Okay. give me some of that.

488
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.254
(water trickling)

489
00:25:23.256 --> 00:25:24.889
Oh. you fucking bitch.

490
00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:27.658
- Ask nicely.

491
00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.025
- Please give me some water.

492
00:25:29.829 --> 00:25:30.861
- Good. Baby Bird.

493
00:25:31.998 --> 00:25:33.697
- [Dylan] I've got to take a
leak.

494
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:36.700
- I put a hole in your
sleeve. just let 'er rip.

495
00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:40.704
(urine trickling)

496
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:42.806
(Brad coughing)

497
00:25:42.808 --> 00:25:44.542
- Dude. you're pissin' on my
dick!

498
00:25:44.544 --> 00:25:46.143
- Sorry. bro. couldn't help it.

499
00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.845
- Get me the fuck. what the
fuck.

500
00:25:47.847 --> 00:25:49.447
get me the fuck out of this.

501
00:25:49.448 --> 00:25:51.048
- Calm down. it's just
urine. it's sterile.

502
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.249
- I don't like it.

503
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:53.551
- Hm. I don't blame you.

504
00:25:53.553 --> 00:25:54.752
but you know what?

505
00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:55.953
Sooner we get to it.

506
00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:57.153
the sooner you two can get out
of here.

507
00:25:57.156 --> 00:26:00.024
So I'll give you two the full
hour

508
00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:02.760
to complete this simple little
task.

509
00:26:02.762 --> 00:26:04.451
It's a choice. after all.

510
00:26:04.452 --> 00:26:06.141
so it should be pretty simple.

511
00:26:06.142 --> 00:26:07.831
Just choose to like each other
sexually.

512
00:26:08.935 --> 00:26:10.200
Brad. it's all up to you.

513
00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:15.039
- All right. I'll play. what the
fuck.

514
00:26:20.613 --> 00:26:22.846
So you handled me?

515
00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:24.381
Really got your hands all up on
me.

516
00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:25.915
getting my dick into
that absurd contraption.

517
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.085
(electricity sizzling)
(Brad grunting)

518
00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:30.120
- It's not how this works.

519
00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:33.090
Each other. you have to choose
each other.

520
00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:36.026
If I don't hear the
tingling of this little bell

521
00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.128
in one hour's time.

522
00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:40.229
then we're gonna have
to move on to stage two.

523
00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:43.634
- What's stage two?

524
00:26:43.636 --> 00:26:45.769
- Oh. stage two is forced.

525
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.104
Yeah. at stage two. I'm gonna
release

526
00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:49.590
a whole bunch of new pictures

527
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:52.075
and show everybody about your
recently acquired interests.

528
00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:58.248
Well. Brad's recently acquired
interests.

529
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.883
- I'm just nervous.

530
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:05.623
- I'll leave you guys to get to
it.

531
00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:07.858
Give you some alone time.

532
00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:18.135
Found this little baby inside
the house.

533
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:21.372
It's amazing what some
people will abandon.

534
00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:24.808
This cut runs about a half hour.

535
00:27:25.778 --> 00:27:27.094
(moody orchestral music)

536
00:27:27.095 --> 00:27:28.411
just to give you an
idea of where you're at.

537
00:27:31.384 --> 00:27:33.651
One hour. then we share.

538
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.841
(cellphone bleeps)

539
00:28:04.884 --> 00:28:07.951
(boot heel tapping)

540
00:28:09.989 --> 00:28:12.222
(supersonic plane booming)

541
00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:15.959
(supersonic plane booming)

542
00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:32.009
(rhythmic drum music)
(wheels whirring)

543
00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:49.960
(phonograph needle hissing)

544
00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:54.998
Time's up. bitches.

545
00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:57.101
Let's see what we got.

546
00:28:58.003 --> 00:28:59.770
Dylan's still strong like bull.

547
00:28:59.772 --> 00:29:02.372
and Brad is not so much.

548
00:29:03.476 --> 00:29:04.408
- Whatever.

549
00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:07.377
(Meg sighing)

550
00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:08.879
- Subject D shows visible signs

551
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:10.147
of continued excitement by means

552
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:11.348
of a healthy and prolonged
erection

553
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.050
at the one hour and six minute
mark.

554
00:29:13.052 --> 00:29:16.086
while Subject B remains
flaccid and sexually dormant.

555
00:29:18.157 --> 00:29:20.891
Okay. well. time to post the
latest.

556
00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:26.396
And post and publish.

557
00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:33.070
(cellphone dings)

558
00:29:33.072 --> 00:29:35.773
Always gotta stay current
with your latest updates.

559
00:29:35.775 --> 00:29:39.009
- And you really think anyone
would take this seriously

560
00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:41.145
with a Chinese dick trap

561
00:29:41.147 --> 00:29:43.380
at the center of your little
experiment?

562
00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:45.783
- Yeah. I do.

563
00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:47.251
I think that the smart people

564
00:29:47.253 --> 00:29:49.236
will see the bigger picture.

565
00:29:49.237 --> 00:29:51.220
and that's your friend's
dick at the moment.

566
00:29:53.159 --> 00:29:54.958
So on to phase two.

567
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.026
Phase two's a little bit longer.

568
00:29:56.028 --> 00:29:58.362
but with newer consequences.

569
00:29:58.364 --> 00:29:59.229
- What now. bitch?

570
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.831
- Good one. again.

571
00:30:03.035 --> 00:30:04.401
Next step is physical.

572
00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:07.371
So if you don't make the right
choice.

573
00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:10.574
you're both gonna lose
something.

574
00:30:10.576 --> 00:30:11.508
- Oh. God.

575
00:30:23.022 --> 00:30:27.391
- And what would you do
if you had that knife?

576
00:30:27.393 --> 00:30:29.159
Don't you worry about
that rusty old thing.

577
00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:31.028
It won't come into play here.

578
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.031
But I will give you a
sneak peek into what will.

579
00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:39.269
I'm really good with
knots. all kinds of knots.

580
00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:40.137
Dad was a seaman.

581
00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:41.071
- Semen (chuckling).

582
00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:45.409
(playful electronic music)

583
00:30:45.411 --> 00:30:48.512
- So you got your basic Figure
Eight.

584
00:30:49.548 --> 00:30:51.215
Alpine Butterfly.

585
00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:56.320
and then there's the
Constrictor.

586
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.923
- Where'd you even get that?

587
00:30:59.925 --> 00:31:02.492
- Fun fact. see this flimsy.

588
00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:04.995
nearly invisible piece of
string?

589
00:31:04.997 --> 00:31:07.464
It can do just as much
damage as that there knife.

590
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.301
(string zipping)

591
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:13.136
- Oh.

592
00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:17.374
- I'll leave these here for
motivation.

593
00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:25.315
- I can't. I just. I can't do
it.

594
00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:26.516
- He's trying.

595
00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:32.089
- Sorry.

596
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.933
(handle cranking)

597
00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:48.005
(needle scratching)
(playful orchestral music)

598
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.175
- It's not nearly as fun

599
00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:53.577
as I thought it would be.

600
00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:55.145
Kind of pathetic. actually.

601
00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:58.282
Yeah. it's just like you said.

602
00:31:58.284 --> 00:31:59.583
One guy broke almost
immediately.

603
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:01.685
and the other one's totally
devastated.

604
00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:05.022
But you can see that yourself.

605
00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:12.396
(chuckling) Yeah. if I
didn't know any better.

606
00:32:12.398 --> 00:32:14.131
I'd feel kind of bad. actually.

607
00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:20.203
I'll be right here until
I'm not anymore (sighs).

608
00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:27.210
(coffee mug shattering)

609
00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:28.178
Oh. shit.

610
00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:32.082
Oh.

611
00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:33.417
- [Brad] Really?

612
00:32:40.025 --> 00:32:44.695
(music drowns out Brad's faint
speaking)

613
00:32:47.733 --> 00:32:50.400
- [Brad] These fake IDs
are gonna get us laid.

614
00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:51.635
- [Dylan] All right.

615
00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:52.636
Why are we traveling
all the way across town

616
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:53.854
just to hunt cougars?

617
00:32:53.855 --> 00:32:55.071
- 'Cause the bartender doesn't
look up

618
00:32:55.074 --> 00:32:56.039
when he checks your ID.

619
00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:57.107
Just stares at his phone.

620
00:32:57.109 --> 00:32:59.009
- Yeah. really. fuck yeah. dude.

621
00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:00.444
- [Announcer] Your regimen.

622
00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:03.113
Now. you can look every day as a
Friday.

623
00:33:03.115 --> 00:33:04.047
- What is that?

624
00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:06.316
- It's a cougar's man.

625
00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.584
- Cougar's man. just
like females. but older.

626
00:33:08.587 --> 00:33:09.942
Cougars.

627
00:33:09.943 --> 00:33:11.298
- [Announcer] Well. you
can make that a reality

628
00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:12.654
at the Coke Company Limited.

629
00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:15.025
With our gel coma-inducing
technology--

630
00:33:15.995 --> 00:33:17.227
- You ready?

631
00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:18.261
- Hell. yeah. let's go.

632
00:33:18.263 --> 00:33:19.663
(Brad grunts)
(Dylan grunts)

633
00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:21.531
- [Dylan] Yeah.

634
00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:23.150
- [Brad] Kick some ass.

635
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:24.768
- [Announcer] You can choose
anything here to be your--

636
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.703
- Bye. grandma. be home
whenever.

637
00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:28.388
- [Announcer] For the next 20
minutes.

638
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:30.072
our trained deep slumber
specialists are--

639
00:33:30.075 --> 00:33:32.776
- [Brad] Wow. you're
grandma's so not a cougar.

640
00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:33.710
- Are these?

641
00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:37.114
(rhythmic rock music)

642
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.161
- We have made it. my friend.
we're in.

643
00:33:51.163 --> 00:33:53.764
(mugs clinking)

644
00:33:59.438 --> 00:34:00.704
- Hey. Dylan. stop acting odd.

645
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:01.805
You'll get us busted.

646
00:34:01.807 --> 00:34:03.490
Just drink your drink.

647
00:34:03.491 --> 00:34:05.174
and keep your eyes peeled for
some dimes.

648
00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:06.643
- Dimes. right.

649
00:34:06.645 --> 00:34:10.047
(rhythmic rock music)

650
00:34:22.127 --> 00:34:23.760
- Boom. found one.

651
00:34:23.762 --> 00:34:25.395
And she looks interested.

652
00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:26.596
and she's not a cougar.

653
00:34:26.598 --> 00:34:30.067
- That right there is a
full-blown puma.

654
00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:33.637
- Shit. she's comin' over here.
be cool.

655
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:45.082
- Hey.

656
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:47.851
- Hey.

657
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:51.321
- So which one of you guys

658
00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:54.091
is gonna buy the thirsty girl a
drink?

659
00:34:54.093 --> 00:34:56.560
- Oh shit. right. of course. uh.

660
00:35:00.365 --> 00:35:03.567
Uh. excuse me. barkeep.

661
00:35:06.338 --> 00:35:07.270
Sir.

662
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:09.706
- What can I get you?

663
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:10.874
- The lady would like a.

664
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.146
what would the lady like?

665
00:35:16.148 --> 00:35:19.282
- Adios motherfucker. if you.

666
00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:20.217
- Got it.

667
00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:22.652
- You'd like to what?

668
00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:25.422
- It's really cheap and
it gets really fucked up.

669
00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:28.425
(liquid splashing)

670
00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:32.863
(ice rattling)

671
00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:36.666
Tip the guy. come on.

672
00:35:36.668 --> 00:35:40.270
(electronic dance music)

673
00:35:48.547 --> 00:35:50.147
- Damn. she's a bad slut.

674
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.652
(van door closing)

675
00:35:57.189 --> 00:35:58.421
- This chick is all in.

676
00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:02.292
- Yup. she's crazy yo.

677
00:36:02.294 --> 00:36:04.628
- Yeah. you ever been
in a devil's threesome?

678
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:05.562
- Nah.

679
00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:08.298
- Of course you haven't.

680
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.434
Neither have I. but that's
all about to change.

681
00:36:11.436 --> 00:36:13.503
This is about to go down. like
for real.

682
00:36:14.373 --> 00:36:15.805
- What's a devil's threesome?

683
00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:19.609
- What do you mean. what's
a devil's threesome?

684
00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:21.545
We're gonna bang this girl.

685
00:36:21.547 --> 00:36:23.580
and at the same time and
together.

686
00:36:24.483 --> 00:36:25.415
- We are?

687
00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:27.934
- God. that's awesome.

688
00:36:27.935 --> 00:36:29.418
We're gonna make this puma
airtight.

689
00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:31.221
that's what we're gonna do.

690
00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:33.456
Just hope I can get it
up. I'm so fucked up.

691
00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:37.861
I'm gonna get this party
started.

692
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.232
- Careful. Brad.

693
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.635
- [Brad] At you now.

694
00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:47.493
(seatbelt clicking)

695
00:36:47.494 --> 00:36:49.350
(Brad grunting)
(tires squealing)

696
00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:51.207
(ominous electronic music)

697
00:36:57.649 --> 00:36:58.782
- [Meg] Brad.

698
00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:04.454
(playful orchestral music)

699
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.270
(moody orchestral music)
(needle scratching)

700
00:37:20.272 --> 00:37:23.907
- I need you to sound more like
a woman.

701
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:25.308
More feminine.

702
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.843
- Like this. baby?

703
00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:28.245
Do I sound real good?
- No.

704
00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.646
- Just like that?
- No. that's not helping. no.

705
00:37:29.648 --> 00:37:31.481
- You like this?

706
00:37:31.483 --> 00:37:33.683
Oh God. not again.

707
00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:35.018
I got a new problem.

708
00:37:36.255 --> 00:37:40.423
Uh. chick. lady. ma'am?

709
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:45.495
- Meg. just call me Meg.

710
00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:50.900
Oh. what now. Dylan?

711
00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:54.804
- My contacts need out of
my head. or they'll stick.

712
00:37:55.807 --> 00:37:56.806
- Come again?

713
00:37:56.808 --> 00:37:58.575
- Sorry. ma'am. Meg.

714
00:37:58.577 --> 00:38:00.477
My contact lens. they're
sticking.

715
00:38:00.479 --> 00:38:01.645
Time to take 'em out.

716
00:38:01.647 --> 00:38:03.913
- You wear contacts. since when?

717
00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:05.915
- Since always. and they're
sticking to my eyeballs.

718
00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:07.617
They need out.

719
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.686
- Yeah. I don't do that.

720
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.856
- But--
- What happens

721
00:38:12.858 --> 00:38:13.957
if nothing happens?

722
00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:14.924
- CLARE.

723
00:38:14.926 --> 00:38:16.926
- Claire. who's Claire?

724
00:38:16.928 --> 00:38:20.330
- Contact lens acute red-eye.
CLARE.

725
00:38:20.332 --> 00:38:21.298
I could go blind.

726
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.932
- Ah. seriously?

727
00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:24.367
- Dude. seriously?

728
00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:25.735
- Totally seriously.

729
00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:28.438
It's happened before.
like five times before.

730
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.708
Lots of close calls. but I
think this is a record for me.

731
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.076
Gotta get them out.

732
00:38:33.078 --> 00:38:35.612
- Yeah. I told you. I
don't . I don't do that.

733
00:38:35.614 --> 00:38:37.580
- Yeah. well. please?

734
00:38:39.718 --> 00:38:42.886
- Ugh. er. do I use my fingers?

735
00:38:42.888 --> 00:38:46.790
- Yeah. just a pinch. and on
your tip.

736
00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:47.724
- Uh. oh.

737
00:38:55.534 --> 00:38:57.701
(Brad groaning)

738
00:38:57.703 --> 00:38:58.852
- [Brad] Oh.

739
00:38:58.853 --> 00:39:00.002
- That was unexpectedly easy.

740
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:03.940
- [Dylan] Uh. oh.

741
00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:07.944
(Brad groaning)

742
00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:10.113
- Easy peasy. anything else?

743
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.586
- It's like I don't even know
you.

744
00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:21.658
- Very good. all right. back to
it.

745
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.793
- Oh. that was just awful.

746
00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:26.096
- It's all right. pal.
we'll get out of this.

747
00:39:26.098 --> 00:39:28.398
Everything's gonna be cool.

748
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.101
- How. exactly. is
everything going to be cool?

749
00:39:31.103 --> 00:39:33.670
We're being held captive by a
crazy bitch.

750
00:39:33.672 --> 00:39:36.439
We're tied together. our
dicks are smashed together.

751
00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:38.408
and yours is rock hard and
throbbing.

752
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.611
So how the fuck is
everything going to be cool?

753
00:39:41.613 --> 00:39:44.981
- There's a good chance that all
of this

754
00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:47.717
is just a dream.

755
00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.020
I got a good feeling about this.

756
00:39:51.022 --> 00:39:52.889
We're gonna wake up any minute
now.

757
00:39:55.394 --> 00:39:57.527
- This is no dream. Dyl.

758
00:39:57.529 --> 00:40:02.098
This is a very real nightmare.
that's what this is.

759
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:06.403
(supersonic plane booming)

760
00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:08.104
(supersonic plane booming)

761
00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:10.106
- [Dylan] I think this might be
a dream.

762
00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:11.358
- [Brad] What was that noise?

763
00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:12.609
- It's part of the dream. man.

764
00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:14.878
You know what?

765
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.579
I get boners in my sleep a lot.

766
00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:17.747
I bet this is a dream right now

767
00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:18.782
'cause I have one right now.

768
00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:19.849
Right now. I have a--

769
00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:22.719
- I know. I can feel it.
remember?

770
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:23.653
- Right.

771
00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:33.029
So do you think you could. like.
fake it?

772
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:37.100
You know. pretend to like me
like that?

773
00:40:38.904 --> 00:40:40.570
- Your legs asleep?

774
00:40:40.572 --> 00:40:42.806
- Yeah. totally tingly.

775
00:40:42.808 --> 00:40:43.740
- Yeah. mine too.

776
00:40:44.576 --> 00:40:45.809
This can't be good for us.

777
00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:47.066
- I know. right?

778
00:40:47.067 --> 00:40:48.322
How do they expect us to get
boners

779
00:40:48.323 --> 00:40:49.578
if our legs are all asleep?

780
00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:51.514
- Oh. I don't know. Dyl.
but you've managed somehow.

781
00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:53.033
- I know. right?

782
00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:54.551
So maybe you can. too. right?

783
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.453
Maybe?

784
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.890
- Maybe.

785
00:41:00.892 --> 00:41:02.759
You know. maybe I should have
known.

786
00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:04.761
There was time at Casey's house

787
00:41:04.763 --> 00:41:07.130
when you were deep throating hot
dogs.

788
00:41:08.233 --> 00:41:09.499
And that time at Julie's

789
00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:10.967
when you wouldn't play strip
poker

790
00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:11.835
with it just us dudes.

791
00:41:11.837 --> 00:41:13.236
- I'm just nervous.

792
00:41:15.507 --> 00:41:17.907
- It's okay. I guess.

793
00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:22.846
Part of me. the vain part.
is flattered. but this?

794
00:41:25.884 --> 00:41:27.050
This is no way to find out

795
00:41:27.052 --> 00:41:29.118
that your best friend is a
fucking fag.

796
00:41:30.622 --> 00:41:32.655
Sorry. a fucking homo. is that
better?

797
00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:36.092
Fine. a fucking homosexual.
then.

798
00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:40.763
Oh. shit. are you all fucking PC
now. too?

799
00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:41.698
- Look.

800
00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:45.201
- Dyl. you're freaking me out.
what is it?

801
00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:46.870
- Some dude.

802
00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.538
- What dude. where. what's he
doing?

803
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.806
- Just chillin'.

804
00:41:51.877 --> 00:41:53.142
- Are you sure?

805
00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:54.511
You're not wearing your
contacts.

806
00:41:54.513 --> 00:41:56.613
and you're totally squinting.

807
00:41:56.615 --> 00:41:59.249
- Yeah. some dude is just
chillin'.

808
00:41:59.251 --> 00:42:00.750
Right there. 'sup?

809
00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:09.192
- Hey. bro. bro. what's your
deal?

810
00:42:09.194 --> 00:42:10.627
State your deal.

811
00:42:10.629 --> 00:42:12.996
If you can hear me. do you
think.

812
00:42:12.998 --> 00:42:14.764
think you could help us out
here?

813
00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:17.534
You're sure?

814
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.275
Holy shit. there really is a
dude.

815
00:42:25.277 --> 00:42:27.877
- Told you. he was just
chillin'.

816
00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:30.813
- Hey. bro. are you with that
chick?

817
00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:31.781
- Hey there.

818
00:42:31.783 --> 00:42:32.682
- Okay. look.

819
00:42:32.684 --> 00:42:34.651
You gotta help us. bro.

820
00:42:34.653 --> 00:42:35.952
There's this chick inside.

821
00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:38.555
You're not with her. right?

822
00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:41.891
I'll assume that's a no.

823
00:42:41.893 --> 00:42:43.610
She took us. kidnapped us.
really.

824
00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:45.328
and strung us up like this.

825
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.797
(grunting) No. no. no. no. no.

826
00:42:49.134 --> 00:42:50.767
Untie us first.

827
00:42:50.769 --> 00:42:52.869
then you can take whatever you
want.

828
00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:56.205
(coffee mug shattering)

829
00:43:03.214 --> 00:43:04.247
(Brad sighing)

830
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:06.583
(laughing) Really?

831
00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:09.586
- Dude's gone.

832
00:43:10.855 --> 00:43:13.356
- (breath whooshing) Yes. Dylan.

833
00:43:13.358 --> 00:43:14.891
(blinds rustling)
- Creepy dude is gone.

834
00:43:14.893 --> 00:43:15.948
- You think I can't see

835
00:43:15.949 --> 00:43:17.004
that he's no longer looming

836
00:43:17.005 --> 00:43:18.060
in the fucking pool with us?

837
00:43:18.063 --> 00:43:19.228
- I was just sayin'.

838
00:43:23.234 --> 00:43:25.101
Hey. maybe he went to get help.

839
00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:30.974
Maybe. well. he could be getting
help.

840
00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:32.241
- I'm sorry. Dyl.

841
00:43:32.243 --> 00:43:34.978
but did that fucking
freak show have a tail?

842
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.112
He was wearing pants.

843
00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.245
so I couldn't get a good look.

844
00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:39.048
- I don't think so.

845
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.050
- Was that dude covered in fur?

846
00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:43.853
Was he walkin' on four legs?

847
00:43:43.855 --> 00:43:46.823
Oh. my God. perhaps you're
right.

848
00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:48.224
Do you think he might come back

849
00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:49.692
if we called him by name?

850
00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:52.629
Well. shit. let's give it a
shot.

851
00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:56.733
Lassie!

852
00:43:58.336 --> 00:43:59.969
- Lassie!

853
00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:01.237
- Lassie. here boy!

854
00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:02.238
- Lassie. here boy!

855
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.376
(Brad laughing maniacally)

856
00:44:06.378 --> 00:44:08.244
- See. it's not so bad.

857
00:44:09.214 --> 00:44:12.315
(Brad weeping)

858
00:44:12.317 --> 00:44:13.249
Lassie!

859
00:44:14.352 --> 00:44:16.285
- They're fucking serious.

860
00:44:16.287 --> 00:44:18.137
- Not a word about the dude.

861
00:44:18.138 --> 00:44:19.988
- Unless calling to a
TV dog from the 1960s

862
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:21.090
gets your dicks hard.

863
00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:24.160
I suggest you stop doing that.

864
00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:26.162
Wasting time. that's all you're
doing.

865
00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:31.801
I already told you. nobody
out here but us chickens.

866
00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:37.040
And Lassie was a girl. not a
boy.

867
00:44:37.042 --> 00:44:38.441
and she lived in the
countryside.

868
00:44:38.443 --> 00:44:39.709
not in the burnt-out suburbs.

869
00:44:39.711 --> 00:44:41.678
- Wrong. Lassie's a weird dude.

870
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.412
- Hey. sh.

871
00:44:47.385 --> 00:44:49.786
- What in God's name
are you talking about?

872
00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:53.423
- I don't know. just sayin'
stuff

873
00:44:53.425 --> 00:44:55.858
and odd things like that.

874
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.296
- Uh huh. record's winding down

875
00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:01.364
and the sun's starting to set.

876
00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:02.999
so you guys better get to it.

877
00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:05.234
- Hey. Dyl.

878
00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:10.339
When I tell you not to say
anything. don't say anything.

879
00:45:10.341 --> 00:45:12.375
- Got it. sorry.

880
00:45:13.845 --> 00:45:16.979
It's just. what if Lassie
decides to come back?

881
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.882
- And (laughing). and what?

882
00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:23.386
- Well. how we know
his name's even Lassie?

883
00:45:23.388 --> 00:45:26.289
- Fuck. oh my God. we don't.
Dyl.

884
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:27.790
It's a fucking guess.

885
00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:29.275
Are you always like this

886
00:45:29.276 --> 00:45:30.759
when you're not high or drinking
or both?

887
00:45:30.762 --> 00:45:33.830
- I don't know. I guess so.

888
00:45:33.832 --> 00:45:36.866
I'm usually high or
drinking or both. yeah.

889
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:47.810
(stately orchestral music)

890
00:45:47.812 --> 00:45:49.312
- Just get hard with me.

891
00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:50.813
and she'll let us go. and
no one will ever know.

892
00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:52.281
- I'm not gay. you fuck.

893
00:45:52.283 --> 00:45:54.217
- Neither am I. I'm just goin'
along.

894
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:57.153
- How could you not have told
me?

895
00:45:57.155 --> 00:45:58.287
You're my best friend.

896
00:45:58.289 --> 00:46:00.156
- I still am. I'm your bro.

897
00:46:01.326 --> 00:46:02.425
- We were gonna be cops.

898
00:46:02.427 --> 00:46:03.960
- We still can be cops. I'm
just--

899
00:46:03.962 --> 00:46:06.462
- Nervous. I know.

900
00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:10.900
(needle scratching)

901
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.271
- Phase three?

902
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.939
- That's what she said.

903
00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.141
- That's what she said.

904
00:46:18.143 --> 00:46:20.510
So just get hard with me.
(fist banging)

905
00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:21.528
- Where is she?

906
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:22.545
- Don't know. get hard with me.

907
00:46:22.547 --> 00:46:23.479
- Quiet.

908
00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:26.282
Can you hear that?

909
00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:27.150
- Get hard with me.

910
00:46:27.152 --> 00:46:28.217
- Sounds like banging.

911
00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:30.086
- I don't care. get hard with
me.

912
00:46:30.088 --> 00:46:31.954
(fist banging)

913
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:33.156
(knob rattling)

914
00:46:33.158 --> 00:46:35.892
(fist banging)

915
00:46:39.397 --> 00:46:42.431
(needle scratching)

916
00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:54.944
- All right. fuck it.

917
00:46:58.116 --> 00:46:59.415
I'm goin' in (breath whooshing).

918
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:01.484
Let's do this.

919
00:47:01.486 --> 00:47:03.269
- What do you need from me?

920
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.053
- Nothing. please just say
nothing.

921
00:47:11.229 --> 00:47:13.229
- [Dylan] Oh. that's
it. you can do it. man.

922
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:19.836
You can do it.
- Shut up.

923
00:47:19.838 --> 00:47:20.570
- [Dylan] Sorry.

924
00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:32.515
- Shit.

925
00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:37.520
But I thought it was just us
chickens.

926
00:47:37.522 --> 00:47:39.455
(drum booming)

927
00:47:39.457 --> 00:47:41.858
- [Orin] How are my two
favorite homophobes?

928
00:47:42.927 --> 00:47:44.077
- Aaron?

929
00:47:44.078 --> 00:47:45.228
- [Orin] It's Orin. it's always
been Orin.

930
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.596
and I know that you know that.

931
00:47:46.598 --> 00:47:48.898
- [Dylan] Hey. look. it's
Fancy Pants on the screen.

932
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.300
- [Orin] Fuck you. it's Orin.

933
00:47:57.909 --> 00:47:59.342
- You really think this'll hold
them?

934
00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:01.577
- Yeah. I've tested them.
they're good.

935
00:48:03.548 --> 00:48:05.381
- You're one sick. twisted kid.

936
00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:08.618
but I like it.

937
00:48:09.621 --> 00:48:10.553
- Oh. my God.

938
00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:13.522
I'm so happy you said that. so
you're in.

939
00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:16.559
- Yes. but you have to keep a
cool head through everything.

940
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:18.261
- Of course.

941
00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.962
- No flying off the handle
like you usually do.

942
00:48:19.964 --> 00:48:20.630
- Never.

943
00:48:20.632 --> 00:48:22.565
- Cool. calm. collected.

944
00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:24.133
- Always.

945
00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:25.902
- And I'm gonna pick them up on
my own.

946
00:48:25.904 --> 00:48:28.170
- No. no.

947
00:48:28.172 --> 00:48:29.906
- You have to stay here
and lock the place down

948
00:48:29.908 --> 00:48:31.007
and wait until I come back.

949
00:48:31.009 --> 00:48:32.174
- No way.

950
00:48:32.176 --> 00:48:33.276
I'm helping with the abduction.

951
00:48:33.278 --> 00:48:34.594
What kind of brother would I be

952
00:48:34.595 --> 00:48:35.911
if I left you to do that by
yourself?

953
00:48:35.914 --> 00:48:37.680
- Ugh. you sound like
every man in my life.

954
00:48:37.682 --> 00:48:39.181
What. because I'm a girl.

955
00:48:39.183 --> 00:48:40.516
I can't fend for myself. you
know what--

956
00:48:40.518 --> 00:48:42.985
- Stop with the feminism crap.
okay?

957
00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:43.920
Just stop it.

958
00:48:43.922 --> 00:48:47.089
You don't know these
mouth breathers like I do.

959
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:48.658
They're strapping.

960
00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.694
Plus. abduction's number
seven on my bucket list.

961
00:48:51.696 --> 00:48:53.462
- What's number six?

962
00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:54.463
- The Grand Canyon.

963
00:48:58.403 --> 00:49:00.169
- You're not coming.
and they can't see you.

964
00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:01.570
We have to make them at least
believe

965
00:49:01.572 --> 00:49:04.106
that you tried to off yourself.

966
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:05.508
- But I could hide.

967
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:06.676
- Take it or leave it.

968
00:49:08.513 --> 00:49:09.445
- Okay.

969
00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:14.617
Okay. okay. I'll take it.

970
00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:16.619
You can be such a bully
sometimes. you know that?

971
00:49:16.621 --> 00:49:19.021
- Just don't be a dick.

972
00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:20.589
- Won't be a dick. promise.

973
00:49:21.392 --> 00:49:23.025
- You are such a dick.

974
00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:23.960
- Sorry.

975
00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:31.200
(hand thudding)

976
00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:34.337
(cell phone pecking)

977
00:49:34.339 --> 00:49:38.574
- [Young Woman] Damn. she's a
bad slut.

978
00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:42.311
(bag rustling)

979
00:49:45.249 --> 00:49:48.517
(ominous techno music)

980
00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:52.254
- I'm gonna get this party
started.

981
00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:53.556
- [Dylan] Careful. Brad.

982
00:49:53.558 --> 00:49:57.126
(Orin grunting)

983
00:49:57.128 --> 00:50:00.129
(engine roaring)
(Brad grunting)

984
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:01.063
- [Orin] Bravo.

985
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.467
It's me. it's me. it's me.

986
00:50:07.205 --> 00:50:08.070
(hand smacking)

987
00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:09.505
- Can't believe you.

988
00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:11.507
- Just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

989
00:50:16.247 --> 00:50:18.247
- Feet off the dash. this is a
rental.

990
00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:21.050
(feet thudding)

991
00:50:24.155 --> 00:50:27.423
(ambient techno music)

992
00:50:32.063 --> 00:50:32.795
- [Meg] Jesus.

993
00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:39.101
- Well done. safety first.

994
00:50:39.103 --> 00:50:40.703
Wouldn't want them to go
cartwheeling down the highway.

995
00:50:40.705 --> 00:50:41.570
now would we?

996
00:50:41.572 --> 00:50:44.373
Although. although.

997
00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:48.477
that would be spectacular.

998
00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:54.417
(imitates Brad and Dylan
cartwheeling)

999
00:50:54.419 --> 00:50:55.518
But. but what a waste.

1000
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.452
What a waste that would be.

1001
00:50:56.454 --> 00:50:57.887
what a fucking waste.

1002
00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:59.321
(fist pounding)
No. no. no. we do this now.

1003
00:50:59.323 --> 00:51:01.257
we do this now. we do this
fucking now.

1004
00:51:01.259 --> 00:51:02.675
- [Meg] Jesus.

1005
00:51:02.676 --> 00:51:04.092
- Get the door.
- Shh. please tell me

1006
00:51:04.095 --> 00:51:05.361
you're not off your meds.

1007
00:51:05.363 --> 00:51:07.463
- I'm on my meds.

1008
00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:09.165
- What did we say about loose
cannons

1009
00:51:09.167 --> 00:51:11.133
and how you can't be one?

1010
00:51:11.135 --> 00:51:12.501
- I'm totally fine.

1011
00:51:12.503 --> 00:51:14.236
The Addies help me with my
narcolepsy.

1012
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:15.771
You don't know what it's like.

1013
00:51:15.773 --> 00:51:17.339
- Narcolepsy?

1014
00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:19.008
You never had narcolepsy.

1015
00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:20.676
- Yeah. that's like your
opinion. move.

1016
00:51:20.678 --> 00:51:24.814
Oh. my God.
- Oh. my God.

1017
00:51:24.816 --> 00:51:26.215
- Oh my. fuck.

1018
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.227
Who's in charge now?

1019
00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.230
(Brad grunting)
Oh. fuck.

1020
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:45.134
(Brad grunting)

1021
00:51:47.205 --> 00:51:48.304
(liquid sloshing)

1022
00:51:48.306 --> 00:51:51.107
(Brad grunting)

1023
00:51:53.111 --> 00:51:55.845
(liquid sloshing)

1024
00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:04.253
(Meg sighing)

1025
00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:08.257
- Let's move these piles into
position.

1026
00:52:08.259 --> 00:52:10.860
- [Orin] Hey. you look like
shit.

1027
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:13.662
Do you want some shit?

1028
00:52:14.599 --> 00:52:16.765
(pills rattling)
I got some shit.

1029
00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:20.569
- No. I don't want some
shit. I want a nap.

1030
00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:21.737
Now. get your skinny ass in here

1031
00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:23.672
and help me move these pieces.

1032
00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:26.675
- Fine. be that way.

1033
00:52:26.677 --> 00:52:30.479
(dramatic orchestral music)

1034
00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:35.718
(footfalls thudding)

1035
00:52:40.291 --> 00:52:44.260
(suspenseful electronic music)

1036
00:52:58.476 --> 00:53:00.376
(fist thudding)

1037
00:53:00.378 --> 00:53:04.380
(suspenseful electronic music)

1038
00:53:11.189 --> 00:53:16.225
(cell phone bleeping)
(dramatic orchestral music)

1039
00:53:16.227 --> 00:53:20.529
(suspenseful electronic music)

1040
00:53:25.336 --> 00:53:27.203
- Fuck. I'm so bored.

1041
00:53:30.508 --> 00:53:34.510
(suspenseful electronic music)

1042
00:53:36.847 --> 00:53:39.481
- The time is near.

1043
00:53:39.483 --> 00:53:43.219
After weeks of hints and clues.

1044
00:53:43.221 --> 00:53:46.689
this hooded homo shall out a
closeted jock

1045
00:53:46.691 --> 00:53:48.958
who has been masquerading about
the halls

1046
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.292
of this high school

1047
00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:53.395
as not only a straight star
athlete.

1048
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:54.863
but a gay basher. as well.

1049
00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:58.667
Sometimes push comes to shove.

1050
00:53:58.669 --> 00:53:59.835
and this hooded homo

1051
00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:02.771
is poised and ready to shove
motherfucker

1052
00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:06.542
all over the internet. stand by.

1053
00:54:13.284 --> 00:54:14.883
Go on. do something.

1054
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:28.464
(door sliding)

1055
00:54:38.542 --> 00:54:41.343
(coin rattling)

1056
00:54:48.886 --> 00:54:51.687
(coin rattling)

1057
00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:04.767
(coin rattling)

1058
00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:08.537
I'm not a believer. but
that always seems to work.

1059
00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:11.073
(bell chiming)

1060
00:55:14.879 --> 00:55:17.446
Here we go. it's happening.

1061
00:55:17.448 --> 00:55:21.417
(suspenseful electronic music)

1062
00:55:30.995 --> 00:55:31.860
- [Meg] Orin.

1063
00:55:31.862 --> 00:55:33.729
- Sure. Aaron.
- Orin.

1064
00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:36.365
- That's right.

1065
00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:38.066
- Orin. whatever. so what?
- That's right.

1066
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:40.402
- [Brad] Gonna ask you again.

1067
00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:41.937
What the fuck do you want from
us?

1068
00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:43.505
- [Dylan] Yeah. just
tell us what you want.

1069
00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:45.107
and we'll give it to
you. anything you want.

1070
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:47.426
- [Brad] Shut your fuckin' face.

1071
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.744
- [Brad] Sure. why would we
worry about that minor detail?

1072
00:55:49.747 --> 00:55:51.046
- [Meg] Listen. I'm serious.

1073
00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:52.348
I've got a guy who's really good

1074
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.900
with the whole face-blurring
thing.

1075
00:55:53.901 --> 00:55:55.451
So if you play your cards right.

1076
00:55:55.453 --> 00:55:57.720
you can keep your anonymity.

1077
00:55:57.722 --> 00:56:00.522
even if the study garners any
recognition.

1078
00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:01.824
- Fuck that.

1079
00:56:01.826 --> 00:56:04.126
Anonymity is not an option for
you at all.

1080
00:56:05.563 --> 00:56:07.796
In fact. you know what?

1081
00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.631
(ominous electronic music)

1082
00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:12.501
(pills rattling)

1083
00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:16.004
(Orin grunting)

1084
00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:17.106
(Orin snarling)

1085
00:56:17.108 --> 00:56:18.540
- [Meg] Guys. over here.

1086
00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:23.779
(Orin snarling)

1087
00:56:27.818 --> 00:56:30.419
- [Brad] Well. this is fucking
weird.

1088
00:56:30.421 --> 00:56:32.821
- [Dylan] Totally. but boobs.
right?

1089
00:56:34.158 --> 00:56:37.860
(ominous electronic music)

1090
00:56:40.431 --> 00:56:41.096
(door opening)

1091
00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:42.164
- You fucking kidding me?

1092
00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:43.465
(hand slapping)

1093
00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:44.733
You kidding me right now?

1094
00:56:47.872 --> 00:56:49.438
They almost saw you. they almost
saw you.

1095
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.006
I had to flash those morons my
tits

1096
00:56:51.008 --> 00:56:52.941
for them to not see you or.

1097
00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:55.978
Oh. my God.

1098
00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:59.014
Orin. I am absolutely
down to do this with you.

1099
00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:01.150
for you. and about you and your
cause.

1100
00:57:01.152 --> 00:57:03.786
but you have to meet me halfway.

1101
00:57:03.788 --> 00:57:05.754
We must stick with the script.

1102
00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:07.423
Do I make myself clear?

1103
00:57:08.125 --> 00:57:09.057
- Yes.

1104
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.627
- No more loose cannon shit.

1105
00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.597
Keep it up. and I pull the plug.

1106
00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:16.865
And I will untie them.

1107
00:57:16.867 --> 00:57:18.767
and we will all go out to
breakfast.

1108
00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:26.141
(Orin sobbing)

1109
00:57:29.146 --> 00:57:30.679
- I'm so stupid.

1110
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:36.051
(Meg sighing)

1111
00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:38.987
(hand thudding)
- Come here.

1112
00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:39.922
Come here.

1113
00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:44.526
(Orin sobbing)

1114
00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:48.230
(melancholy electronic music)

1115
00:57:48.232 --> 00:57:49.231
Look at me.

1116
00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:52.568
I know you're excited.

1117
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:54.470
We're all excited.

1118
00:57:54.472 --> 00:57:57.139
But a lot's gone into this
crazy and fucked up plan.

1119
00:57:57.141 --> 00:57:58.841
and I need you to stay focused

1120
00:57:58.843 --> 00:58:01.677
if we're going to see this
through and done correctly.

1121
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.112
- I know.

1122
00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:07.816
- Just sit tight. let me do my
thing.

1123
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.919
- Okay.

1124
00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:15.057
(introspective electronic music)

1125
00:58:18.896 --> 00:58:20.929
Do you think they'll sign your
contract?

1126
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:23.665
- (laughs) See. that's
what I'm talking about.

1127
00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:25.534
You don't need to sweat that
stuff.

1128
00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:31.874
(sighing) To answer your
question. yeah. I do.

1129
00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:35.344
I'm gonna get them to sign

1130
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:37.112
exactly what I need them
to sign for my thesis.

1131
00:58:37.114 --> 00:58:42.184
and then. you can have
your sweet. sweet revenge.

1132
00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:45.654
- It shall be sweet.

1133
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.924
- What do you say in the
meantime.

1134
00:58:48.926 --> 00:58:51.760
just take it easy. you know?

1135
00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:54.129
Lay off the pills for a shift
or two. maybe take a nap.

1136
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:55.597
let me work on 'em a bit?

1137
00:58:59.136 --> 00:59:00.068
- Deal.

1138
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:02.738
(hand patting)

1139
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.672
- Good deal.

1140
00:59:06.677 --> 00:59:08.143
You just keep cool.

1141
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.712
Let me go to work.

1142
00:59:14.685 --> 00:59:15.817
Love you. mean it.

1143
00:59:15.819 --> 00:59:17.119
- Love you. mean it.

1144
00:59:17.955 --> 00:59:18.921
(door closing)

1145
00:59:18.923 --> 00:59:22.658
(ominous electronic music)

1146
00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.895
- Fuck your deal. bitch.
this is my operation.

1147
00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:29.197
Just kidding. love you.

1148
00:59:30.334 --> 00:59:32.334
Now do my bidding. you little
bitch.

1149
00:59:32.336 --> 00:59:33.652
I don't mean that.

1150
00:59:33.653 --> 00:59:34.969
- [Orin Voiceover] Spit
in my fucking mouth.

1151
00:59:34.972 --> 00:59:36.204
Fuck you. fuck. fuck you.

1152
00:59:36.206 --> 00:59:38.206
fuck everyone. fuck. fuck. fuck!

1153
00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:39.174
- [Meg] Love you.

1154
00:59:41.345 --> 00:59:45.080
(playful electronic music)

1155
00:59:57.895 --> 00:59:59.294
- Son of a bitch.

1156
01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.167
This was not the plan.

1157
01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:07.836
This has never been the plan.

1158
01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:09.638
You're gonna ruin everything
that we've worked for

1159
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.073
with this stupid kid shit.

1160
01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:14.676
What we're doing is way bigger
than this.

1161
01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.845
way more important than that.

1162
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.682
- You just don't get it.

1163
01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.785
- Don't get it. nobody gets it.

1164
01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:27.189
That's the problem with
you. nobody ever gets it.

1165
01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.890
Orin knows best.

1166
01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:30.642
Look at yourself.

1167
01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:32.393
Does this look like the life
of somebody who knows best?

1168
01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.763
- If I show you. you'll
understand.

1169
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.935
- Show me what. show me what.
Orin?

1170
01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:41.803
- All of me.

1171
01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:53.849
- So what am I supposed
to understand. exactly?

1172
01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.017
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!
(gasps)

1173
01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.218
(door slams)
(key clicking)

1174
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.085
Orin. you better open up
(fist thudding)

1175
01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:58.937
this fucking door.

1176
01:00:58.938 --> 01:01:00.788
You've lost your fucking
mind. are you kidding me?

1177
01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:02.057
- You just don't get it.

1178
01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:03.692
(fist thudding)

1179
01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:06.128
- Ugh. let me fuck out.
(fist thudding)

1180
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.796
- I wanna go viral.

1181
01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:09.297
- Orin!

1182
01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:11.233
- I need to go viral.

1183
01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.235
(fist thudding)

1184
01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.703
- Un-fucking-believable.

1185
01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:15.704
(doorknob rattling)

1186
01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:18.173
(Meg sighing)

1187
01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:26.782
- Who's in charge now. me.
that's who.

1188
01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.686
(fist thudding)

1189
01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:32.054
I just can't hear this right
now.

1190
01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.722
Fuck. fuck it. fuck.
(fist thudding)

1191
01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:36.258
It's okay. everything's okay.
mm.

1192
01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.429
Going to my happy place.

1193
01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:45.934
(intense orchestral music)

1194
01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.219
(fist thudding)
- Let me the fuck out.

1195
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.154
(doorknob rattling)

1196
01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.189
(Meg screaming)

1197
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:10.058
(Orin breathing)

1198
01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:15.030
- Show time.

1199
01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:19.000
(suspenseful electronic music)

1200
01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.237
Show time.

1201
01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:26.108
(key rattling)

1202
01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:30.445
- [Orin] How are my two
favorite homophobes?

1203
01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:31.680
- [Brad] Aaron?

1204
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.914
- It's Orin. it's always been
Orin.

1205
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.883
and I know that you know that.

1206
01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:35.984
- [Dylan] Hey. look. it's
Fancy Pants on screen.

1207
01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.887
- Fuck you. it's Orin.

1208
01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:41.289
Oh God. stop. stop. your moment.

1209
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.925
not theirs. your moment. your
moment.

1210
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.996
Ooh. ooh. okay.

1211
01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.435
I wanna thank you both so much

1212
01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.271
for being a part of this
experience.

1213
01:02:56.273 --> 01:03:00.308
The last few hours have
been quite educational.

1214
01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:05.013
Oh yes. I've been watching
and on the edge of my seat

1215
01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:07.315
absolutely riddled with
anticipation.

1216
01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.184
The results are in.

1217
01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:16.024
Dylan did quite well. as we all
know.

1218
01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:18.927
Hell. by now. just about
everybody knows that much.

1219
01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:23.298
As for you. Brad. you gave it
your best.

1220
01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:26.835
That much was evident.

1221
01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:29.971
There was even a little bit of
movement

1222
01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:34.276
down there at one point.
but unfortunately.

1223
01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:37.312
it wasn't enough to make
contact with your gay pal there.

1224
01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.815
Turns out you were wrong.

1225
01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:45.253
homosexuality isn't as simple
as a choice (laughing).

1226
01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:53.028
Your failure pleases me greatly.

1227
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.131
One. it proves what
most of us already knew.

1228
01:03:56.133 --> 01:04:00.202
And two. it means we get to move
on

1229
01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:04.973
to my favorite phase of all
the phases. phase three.

1230
01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:11.346
Oh. I just love this part so
much.

1231
01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:13.515
(glass shattering)

1232
01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.516
(glass eye thudding)

1233
01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.619
(suspenseful electronic music)

1234
01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:18.920
Oh. what the fuck?

1235
01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:36.338
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1236
01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.272
Get the fuck off of them!

1237
01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.642
(doorknob rattling)
- Orin!

1238
01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:41.643
- Fuck!

1239
01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:45.647
(suspenseful electronic music)

1240
01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.955
(curtain rod ripping)

1241
01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:59.661
- [Meg] You've lost your fucking
mind.

1242
01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:00.562
You don't wanna do this.
(fists thudding)

1243
01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:01.496
- Quiet. you!

1244
01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.001
Do stop that. do stop that.

1245
01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:09.437
Do stop that. do stop that. do
stop that.

1246
01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:12.073
Do stop that. do stop that. do
stop that.

1247
01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.309
do stop that. do stop that. do.

1248
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.478
These damn things are so fickle.

1249
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.380
Always falling off the runner.

1250
01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:27.322
So much better.

1251
01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:30.458
(glass door sliding)

1252
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:33.495
Let's do this!

1253
01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:37.565
(clock ticking)

1254
01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:41.036
(outlaw country music)

1255
01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.138
- [Frank] Just why won't he let
me ride?

1256
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.840
He never lets me ride.

1257
01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:46.541
- [Hank] Oh. I don't think
he learned how to share.

1258
01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.243
- Yeah. he was probably a
fucking only child. man.

1259
01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.394
I should fuck you up.

1260
01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:50.544
- Oh yeah. he's definitely
an only fuckin' child.

1261
01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.080
He couldn't be doing it.

1262
01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.249
So Talkie. what the
fuck are we doin' here?

1263
01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:56.151
What are we doin'?

1264
01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.020
You know. usually. I'm able to
pick up

1265
01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:01.423
what the fuck you're ever it
is you're trying to put down.

1266
01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:04.025
but this time. this time.
I'm a little stumped.

1267
01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.328
to be quite honest. you know?

1268
01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.229
I mean. don't get me wrong. I
mean.

1269
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.731
it's not like I don't appreciate
you

1270
01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:11.700
comin' to us first. though.

1271
01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.069
whatever the fuck this is.

1272
01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:17.472
but I would just like to
know before we get there.

1273
01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.275
you know. maybe. he's not even
listening.

1274
01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:21.643
(wheels whirring)

1275
01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:22.744
Hey. when the fuck you gonna let
us

1276
01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:23.678
ride that thing. anyway?

1277
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.846
- Hey. man. sharing is caring.

1278
01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.013
When are you gonna let us ride
it?

1279
01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:27.315
- Ever?
- Yeah. man.

1280
01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.900
- Talkie. when are you
gonna let us ride it?

1281
01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:30.484
- Talkie. don't act
like you can't hear me.

1282
01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:32.253
- Talkie.
- Hey. fuck you.

1283
01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:35.190
(wheels whirring)

1284
01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.126
Mute bitch.

1285
01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.769
- And it's never anything that--

1286
01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.210
- Sometimes it works out.
- means anything.

1287
01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:43.651
- Yeah. people to pay me--
- Shut the fuck up.

1288
01:06:43.652 --> 01:06:45.092
- You're gonna be fine.

1289
01:06:45.093 --> 01:06:46.533
- Talkie. Talkie.
- Fuck.

1290
01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.237
- What. Talkie. what?

1291
01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:50.722
- What now?

1292
01:06:50.723 --> 01:06:52.206
- What's the big deal?
- It's an empty yard.

1293
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:53.942
- That's it. man.

1294
01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:54.775
you can do it.
- Not helping.

1295
01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:55.710
- Sorry.

1296
01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.555
- Come on. right there. almost.

1297
01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:08.423
You can do it.

1298
01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.357
- Shut up!

1299
01:07:12.396 --> 01:07:13.495
- Faggot shit.

1300
01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:17.565
- Shit.

1301
01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:21.069
Oh. but I thought it was just us
chickens.

1302
01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:27.409
- [Hank] Oh. ooh. what?
(laughing)

1303
01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.578
- Oh. please don't.

1304
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.715
- [Orin] How are my two
favorite homophobes?

1305
01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:36.418
- Aaron?

1306
01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.019
- [Orin] It's Orin. it's always
been Orin.

1307
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.620
and I know that you know that.

1308
01:07:39.621 --> 01:07:41.221
- [Dylan] Hey. look. it's
Fancy Pants on the screen!

1309
01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.391
- [Orin] Fuck you. it's Orin.

1310
01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.594
Oh. God. stop. stop.
your moment. not theirs.

1311
01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:49.164
Your moment. your moment. ooh.

1312
01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:52.100
I wanna thank you both so much

1313
01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.769
for being a part of this
experience.

1314
01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:58.440
The last few hours have
been quite educational.

1315
01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:01.943
- Hey.

1316
01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.610
- [Orin] I've been watching
it on the edge of my seat

1317
01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:04.646
absolutely riddled with
anticipation.

1318
01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:05.580
- Talkie.

1319
01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:07.549
- Psst. come here.

1320
01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:11.286
(suspenseful twangy music)

1321
01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.157
- Give me your eye.

1322
01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:17.625
Hand over the eye.

1323
01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:21.596
Hey. how about I use
the other fuckin' eye?

1324
01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:22.998
- Yeah. probably fly a little
better.

1325
01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:24.399
- Yeah.
- Yeah. bro shit.

1326
01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:26.334
- [Orin] Wasn't enough to
make contact with your gay--

1327
01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.402
- Atta boy.

1328
01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:31.406
(suspenseful electronic music)

1329
01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.815
- [Orin] And two. it means
that we get to move on

1330
01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.751
to my favorite phase. phase
three.

1331
01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.556
Oh. I just love this part so
much.

1332
01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:50.859
(glass shattering)

1333
01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:51.726
Oh. fuck.

1334
01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:55.396
(Hank and Frank laughing)

1335
01:08:56.333 --> 01:08:57.765
- Hi.

1336
01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:58.700
- Hey.

1337
01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:00.401
- [Hank] Hi there.

1338
01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:01.269
- [Frank] Hello.

1339
01:09:01.271 --> 01:09:02.203
- [Hank] Go fuck yourself.

1340
01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:05.140
- [Orin] No. no. no. no. no. no.
no!

1341
01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:06.908
Get the fuck off of them!

1342
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.510
- That guy. he's gonna
come through that door.

1343
01:09:08.512 --> 01:09:09.744
- Yeah?
- When he does.

1344
01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:12.814
bean him with that sink.

1345
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:14.782
- Can do.

1346
01:09:16.753 --> 01:09:17.919
- [Orin] Quiet. you!

1347
01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:21.523
Do stop that. do stop that. do
stop that.

1348
01:09:21.525 --> 01:09:23.791
do stop that. do stop that. do
stop that.

1349
01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:26.294
(door rattling)

1350
01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.795
These damn things are so fickle.

1351
01:09:27.797 --> 01:09:30.498
Always falling off the runners.

1352
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.668
Ah. ah.
(door sliding)

1353
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.671
Oh. it's so much better.

1354
01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:42.810
Let's do this!

1355
01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:46.414
(sink crashing)

1356
01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.348
- Woo!

1357
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.616
- Woo.

1358
01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.818
- That was awesome.

1359
01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:56.324
(playful electronic music)

1360
01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:08.836
(water gurgling)

1361
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.756
- All right. guys. we get it.

1362
01:10:11.757 --> 01:10:12.973
You're in charge. now. shut it
off.

1363
01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:14.375
- But I don't wanna wait for it

1364
01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.510
to get over their heads. man.

1365
01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:16.611
That's gonna take forever.

1366
01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:17.745
- So what?

1367
01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.230
Where do you gotta be?

1368
01:10:19.231 --> 01:10:20.714
- Nowhere. I just think that
electrocution

1369
01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:21.950
would be so much better.

1370
01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:26.354
- So. go find a toaster.

1371
01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:30.558
And also an extension cord.

1372
01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.860
- Oh. shit.

1373
01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:36.297
Please tell me that you guys
are just fucking with us.

1374
01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:37.265
- What the fuck?

1375
01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.633
- There's that question again.

1376
01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:39.734
- What the fuck is this?

1377
01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.803
- Hey. new socks.

1378
01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:44.339
The homo has joined us.

1379
01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:45.373
- [Orin] It's Orin.

1380
01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:48.576
- What do you think would happen

1381
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.812
if I knocked this thing in?

1382
01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:53.281
- Fucked if I know.

1383
01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.250
- Should I do it. Talkie?

1384
01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:56.251
- Please don't.

1385
01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:57.418
- I'm doin' it.

1386
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.353
- Please don't.

1387
01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:02.357
- What. what. use your words.
shit.

1388
01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:05.593
All right. all right. all right.

1389
01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.497
- Seriously. there's like
real equipment in here.

1390
01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:11.399
- No. no. no. no. no.

1391
01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:14.302
Talkie doesn't go in for
that newfangled shit.

1392
01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.637
He's old school.

1393
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.278
(generator whirring)

1394
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.348
- Yeah. well that just sounds
horrible.

1395
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.417
- [Frank] Fuck this. I'm
gonna go find a toaster.

1396
01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:36.658
- All right. so what exactly is
going on?

1397
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.360
- This crazy fucking bitch--

1398
01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:40.762
- She's super nuts.
- These motherfuckers--

1399
01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:41.629
- This crazy bitch--
- She's super nuts.

1400
01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.563
- Shut up.

1401
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.899
Not all everybody at once.

1402
01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.934
You sound like a bunch of
cluckin' hens.

1403
01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:48.870
Jesus. I just can't.

1404
01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:51.372
(distorted orchestral music)

1405
01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.307
Now. you.

1406
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:55.026
Why you hangin' there

1407
01:11:55.027 --> 01:11:56.643
with your dick avatared to that
kid?

1408
01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.380
- [Brad] Avatared?

1409
01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:00.448
- Yeah. you know.

1410
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.917
Like the movie. the blue one.

1411
01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:07.622
Your dick is like connected.

1412
01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:09.691
It's like they did with the
tails.

1413
01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:12.827
You know. you're avatarted
(laughing).

1414
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.065
Avatarted. get it. that's
a good one (laughing).

1415
01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.402
Hey. Frank. you missed it.

1416
01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:22.804
I just called 'em avatarted.

1417
01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:26.007
- [Brad] Anyways. this crazy
bitch--

1418
01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:27.075
- Shut the fuck up.

1419
01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.009
Frank?

1420
01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:31.713

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:32.680
(Hank laughing)

1422
01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.815
- [Hank] Yes. I know.

1423
01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:34.783
(Frank and Hank laughing)

1424
01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:35.750
- Don't tell them about Meg.

1425
01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:37.652
- Maybe I will. maybe I won't.

1426
01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.953
- That sounds pretty rad.

1427
01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:40.822
- [Brad] Does it?

1428
01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:43.825
- Dude. the homo was holding out
on us.

1429
01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:44.692
We got Adderall up here.

1430
01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.860

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.696
Crushed blue dust up in here.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.666
crushed addies. yeah.

1434
01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:52.834
- Fuck yes!

1435
01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:55.937
Hey. hey. bring that shit down
here.

1436
01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:58.539
- Will do. Hank.

1437
01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:00.708
- Wait a minute.

1438
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:04.679
His name is Frank. and yours is
Hank?

1439
01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:05.613
Frank and Hank?

1440
01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:07.582
- (laughing) That's so gay.

1441
01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:09.650
- Oh yeah. is it?

1442
01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.152
As gay as your dick right now.

1443
01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:12.954
touchin' his dick. huh?

1444
01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.924
- This crazy bitch picked
us up at a bar last night.

1445
01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.093
led us on. and then kidnapped
us.

1446
01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:22.497
- (blows raspberry) Kidnapped by
a girl?

1447
01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.049
You guys are pussies.

1448
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:25.600
- Listen. she used her van
against us.

1449
01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.603
and she had tear gas and a gas
mask. and--

1450
01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:30.505
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
wait.

1451
01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:31.506
What crazy bitch?

1452
01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:32.640
- [Dylan] His sister.

1453
01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:36.511
- Pigs in a Blanket.

1454
01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:37.629
- [Orin] It's Orin.

1455
01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:38.746
- [Hank] Is he speakin' the
truth?

1456
01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.916
- Yeah. she's kinda crazy.

1457
01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.684
- And she's your sister?

1458
01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:45.186
- Yes.

1459
01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:48.423
- Yeah. see now we're gettin'
somewhere.

1460
01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:54.462
All right. and so where
is this crazy bitch now?

1461
01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:57.899
- I'm telling you. your
guess is as good as ours.

1462
01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.934
We're just pawns in their little
game.

1463
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.536
Now. will you please turn off
the spigot?

1464
01:14:01.538 --> 01:14:03.905
- Ooh. that's racist.

1465
01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.740
- Spigot is not racist.

1466
01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:08.476
And would you please just turn
it off?

1467
01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:10.511
- Pigs in a Blanket. where
is your sister right now?

1468
01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.146
- Name is Orin.

1469
01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:13.981
- Sweet.

1470
01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:15.683
(hands clapping)

1471
01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:16.935
- [Frank] Bam.

1472
01:14:16.936 --> 01:14:18.186
- Ooh. welly welly welly well.

1473
01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:21.556
- Welly welly well.
- Yes. yes.

1474
01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:24.225
(Hank sniffing)

1475
01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:27.595
(Hank vocalizing)

1476
01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:28.863
Ugh. ai ai ack.

1477
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:31.466
Particulate hairs.

1478
01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:34.769
(Frank vocalizing)
(Hank vocalizing)

1479
01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:36.237
(Frank coughing)

1480
01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.539
- Okay.
- Well.

1481
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.840
- That is--
- So. all right. fine.

1482
01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:42.109
- So help me understand this.

1483
01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.980
Where. where is this
crazy bitch sister now?

1484
01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.782
She just. she just disappeared?

1485
01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:49.150
- Who disappeared?

1486
01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:52.787
- All right. Pigs in a Blanket's
got

1487
01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.088
a crazy bitch sister.

1488
01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.790
She kidnapped these two
pussies--

1489
01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:56.958
- A girl. what pussies.

1490
01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.125
- (laughs) That's what I'm
sayin'. they're pussies.

1491
01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:00.628
- Hm.

1492
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:03.130
- And who made you all up to
look like fag marionettes?

1493
01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:04.232
- She did.

1494
01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:05.166
- She did.

1495
01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:09.487
Why?

1496
01:15:09.488 --> 01:15:11.004
- Because she's a crazy bitch.
that's why.

1497
01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:13.274
- Fair enough.

1498
01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:14.509
- This shit is boring.

1499
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.743
I'm gonna go find a toaster.

1500
01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.977
- All right. you do what you
gotta do.

1501
01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.581
- She said it was for an
experiment for her class.

1502
01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.116
- She said.

1503
01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.135
- Trying to prove some point

1504
01:15:24.136 --> 01:15:26.153
about homosexuality not
being a choice or some shit.

1505
01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:28.189
- (laughing) That's hilarious.

1506
01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.790
Of course. it's a fucking
choice.

1507
01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:30.858
- That's what I said.

1508
01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:31.993
But she said we had to prove it

1509
01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.027
before she'd let us go.

1510
01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.028
- She said.

1511
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.831
- What. what?

1512
01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:43.170
- She said if we got hard for
each other.

1513
01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.305
she'd let us go.

1514
01:15:46.276 --> 01:15:49.243
(Hank laughing)

1515
01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:52.113
- That is also hilarious.

1516
01:15:52.115 --> 01:15:54.115
Like the day's really lookin'
up.

1517
01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:58.252
All right. so she said
she picked you two. why?

1518
01:15:58.254 --> 01:15:59.587
- She said (laughing).

1519
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.090
- Kid. why do you keep sayin'
that?

1520
01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:05.159
- I don't know. 'cause
that's what she said.

1521
01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.260
It's funny and stuff.

1522
01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:08.029
- Is it?

1523
01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.232
Friend's retarded.

1524
01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:13.384
- He is.

1525
01:16:13.385 --> 01:16:14.167
- Shut the fuck up.
- Shut up.

1526
01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:15.636
- Merely agreeing.

1527
01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:17.622
- Anyway. what I was getting at

1528
01:16:17.623 --> 01:16:19.607
is that we might have fucked
with this dude in school.

1529
01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:21.175
It's up for debate.

1530
01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.742
- Up for debate. fuck you. up
for debate.

1531
01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.346
You fucked with me. you
both fucked with me daily.

1532
01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:27.715
- All right. I can see that.

1533
01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:30.685
So how'd it go?

1534
01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:33.321
- How did what go?

1535
01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.289
- You know. the experiment.

1536
01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.092
- I don't know. ask him.

1537
01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:38.960
- Pigs in a Blanket.

1538
01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:40.173
- [Orin] It's Orin.

1539
01:16:40.174 --> 01:16:41.385
- [Hank] How'd the experiment
go?

1540
01:16:41.386 --> 01:16:42.597
- One of them failed miserably.

1541
01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.132
The other flourished.

1542
01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:50.204
- Oh. good for you.
brother. good for you. eh?

1543
01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:51.973
Way to put up a fight
(laughing).

1544
01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.676
Uh. you know. that's a problem
these days.

1545
01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:57.111
I mean. the gays are fuckin'

1546
01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.781
takin' over everything.
you know? (blows raspberry)

1547
01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:02.149
You know. there's this guy.

1548
01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.018
lives around these parts. all
right.

1549
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.052
runs around here

1550
01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:09.190
and he's a little funny. you
know.

1551
01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:11.058
a little funny. know what I
mean?

1552
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.629
Huh. I mean. can you
imagine that. a gay dude

1553
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.930
walkin' around thinkin' he's in
charge

1554
01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:17.932
of this fucked-up situation?

1555
01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:18.833
- Like to hear you talk that way

1556
01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.034
when he's around.

1557
01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:22.069
- Hey. shut the fuck up. Frank.

1558
01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.304
Hey. why don't you be fuckin'
useful?

1559
01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.739
Bring me some more fuckin' drugs

1560
01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.807
and better yet. fix this fuckin'
spigot.

1561
01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.342
- I'm still lookin' for a
toaster.

1562
01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.777
- He actually tried.

1563
01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.178
- Wait. tried. tried what?

1564
01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:36.183
- Brad attempted to cross over.

1565
01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.153
- It's true. asked me to
talk like a chick. even.

1566
01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.187
- Dude.

1567
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:42.189
(Hank laughing)

1568
01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:44.759
(Brad mimicking laughing)

1569
01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.727
- Fuck you.
- You tried to get it up

1570
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:50.264
for your bro. (laughing)

1571
01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:53.300
Oh. this is great. this is
fucking great.

1572
01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:55.102
Frank. come down here.

1573
01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:56.404
Your water's gushin' now.

1574
01:17:56.406 --> 01:17:58.205
(distorted orchestral music)

1575
01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:01.008
(water gushing)

1576
01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:06.714
- Brad. Dylan.

1577
01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:08.182
- [Brad] The fuck do you want?

1578
01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:13.821
- I'm only gonna say this once.
I'm sorry.

1579
01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:16.824
- [Brad] Fantastic for all of
us.

1580
01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:17.892
Fancy Pants is sorry.

1581
01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:18.959
Well. that doesn't do
any good for any of us.

1582
01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:20.294
now does it?

1583
01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:21.328
- [Orin] It's Orin.

1584
01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:24.699
And this wasn't the plan.

1585
01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:27.101
- [Brad] Yeah. well what
exactly was the plan?

1586
01:18:27.103 --> 01:18:28.369
I'm racking my brain over
here tryin' to figure it out.

1587
01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:31.005
- I just wanted a taste of
vengeance.

1588
01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.673
Heard it was sweet.

1589
01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.340
Wanted to humiliate you
two for fucking with me.

1590
01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:37.144
- [Brad] Well. feel good about
yourself.

1591
01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.447
I'm absolutely and utterly
humiliated at the moment.

1592
01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:41.482
- [Dylan] Fuck that.
I'm not. just nervous.

1593
01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:44.719
- Dyl. please.

1594
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.020
- What do you think
they're gonna do to us?

1595
01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:47.188
- I don't know. Aaron.

1596
01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:48.422
Your guess is as good as mine.

1597
01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:49.724
- It's Orin.

1598
01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:50.791
- Whatever.

1599
01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:51.492
(Orin growling)

1600
01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:52.727
Where's your sister?

1601
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:54.061
- She's gone. she took off.

1602
01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:54.929
- She left?

1603
01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:55.830
- Yeah.

1604
01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:57.264
- That seems odd.

1605
01:18:57.266 --> 01:18:58.933
- Bitch got scared (laughing).

1606
01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.402
- Dylan. shut the fuck up.

1607
01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:04.772
- Brad. do you think you
could take those guys?

1608
01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.807
- These clowns. of
course I could take 'em.

1609
01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:09.143
- Do you really think you could
take 'em?

1610
01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:12.813
- Yes. if my hands weren't
hog-tied to my legs

1611
01:19:12.815 --> 01:19:14.849
and if I wasn't suspended
by a series of ropes

1612
01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:17.051
in an empty pool with my dick
looped to my friend here.

1613
01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:19.386
then yeah. I could take
these drug-addled bitches.

1614
01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:21.756
- Listen to me very carefully.

1615
01:19:23.493 --> 01:19:25.326
You should be able to free
yourself.

1616
01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:26.878
- And how's that?

1617
01:19:26.879 --> 01:19:28.429
- That's a Chinese finger trap
down there.

1618
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.619
- Yeah.

1619
01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.808
- The secret to its release--

1620
01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:31.997
- Holy shit. dude. my boner's
gone.

1621
01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.033
- [Brad] Great. Dyl. not now.

1622
01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:34.268
- Oh.

1623
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.038
- If you submit to it. give in.

1624
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.007
then it releases. and you'll be
free.

1625
01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:41.876
- I'm so serial. it's soft now.

1626
01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:43.878
- Not now. please.

1627
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.545
- Oh.

1628
01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:45.880
- What does that mean?

1629
01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:46.947
How do we submit?

1630
01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.883
- Just do exactly what I tell
you.

1631
01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:50.084
- I fuckin' hate the sound of
that.

1632
01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:52.219
- It's gone. really.

1633
01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.487
- You're not going to like it.

1634
01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:55.089
but you're going to have to
trust me.

1635
01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:56.591
- Great. go.

1636
01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:58.092
- Smash your groins together
with force.

1637
01:19:58.094 --> 01:19:59.126
- Fuck you.

1638
01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.245
- Not kidding.

1639
01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:03.363
The knots I have you in
will release with slack.

1640
01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:06.267
And I knew you'd never do it on
your own.

1641
01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.369
and it was going to be awesome.

1642
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.404
And I'd let you know that
the secret to your release

1643
01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.373
was always right there in front
of you.

1644
01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:13.841
but your own homophobia

1645
01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.308
would have never afforded such a
scenario

1646
01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.128
for you to do this on your own.

1647
01:20:17.129 --> 01:20:18.946
And it would have been
awe-inspiring and meaningful

1648
01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:20.848
and poetic and all that shit.

1649
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:21.982
But then these guys showed up.

1650
01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.684
and everything went to shit

1651
01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.385
just like everything
always does in my life.

1652
01:20:25.386 --> 01:20:27.086
And I wanna fucking smash
and obliterate everything

1653
01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:28.088
and all this bullshit. it's so--

1654
01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:31.025
- Shut up. shit.

1655
01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:33.127
So things got fucked. all right?

1656
01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:35.112
How do we fix it?

1657
01:20:35.113 --> 01:20:37.096
And I swear to God. if you
are fucking with me. I'll--

1658
01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:38.499
- You'll what?

1659
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.900
Wait for the water to rise to a
level

1660
01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:41.902
where you might be able to
float in my general direction

1661
01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:43.871
and nudge me as you pass by?

1662
01:20:43.873 --> 01:20:47.074
Just do it. smash your groins
together.

1663
01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:51.045
- You ready?

1664
01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:52.213
- This better work. faggot.

1665
01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.849
- Faggot. really?

1666
01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:57.017
You're the one with a fucking
hard-on.

1667
01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.520
- It's gone. I already
told you. it's gone.

1668
01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:00.855
Oh wait. maybe not.

1669
01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.295
- Okay. we're mashed. now what?

1670
01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.965
- Okay. now roll your shoulders
back

1671
01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:14.201
at the same time.

1672
01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:16.871
And your straps should release.

1673
01:21:16.873 --> 01:21:18.439
- Shit. my boner's back.

1674
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.211
- Not now. Dyl. just roll
your shoulders on three.

1675
01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:28.549
Oh. I hate this so much.

1676
01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:31.619
One. please work.

1677
01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:36.991
Two. fuck you. three.

1678
01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:40.427
(Brad and Dylan groaning)
(intense electronic music)

1679
01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:43.297
(ropes snapping)

1680
01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:46.967
- What's happening. did it work?

1681
01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:49.470
- Kind of. we're on our sides
now.

1682
01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:51.205
But our arms and legs are
still--

1683
01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:52.139
- What?

1684
01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:53.007
- [Brad] Shit. shit. shit.

1685
01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:54.241
- [Orin] What. what. what?

1686
01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.977
- Looks like I won.

1687
01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:57.978
- Hey. Aaron.

1688
01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.380
- It's Orin.

1689
01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:01.215
- We're still tied up.

1690
01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:02.249
- Really?

1691
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.217
- Just really.

1692
01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:04.418
- Brad's dick is out. though.

1693
01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.086
- Not relevant in the least!

1694
01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.960
- Found a toaster and an
extension cord.

1695
01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:13.661
- Great.

1696
01:22:13.663 --> 01:22:14.528
- Holy fuck.

1697
01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.130
- What?

1698
01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:17.164
- No. no. no. no. no!

1699
01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:20.968
(dramatic orchestral music)

1700
01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.439
(cords popping)

1701
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.041
(cords thudding)
(Brad grunting)

1702
01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:27.975
- Rude.

1703
01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:34.581
- What the fuck are you doin'?

1704
01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:36.717
- Sorry. I thought it was.

1705
01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:37.952
thought the cord was long
enough.

1706
01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:38.986
If I didn't throw it so far.

1707
01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.019
I think it probably would have--

1708
01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:41.388
- Would. would have what?

1709
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.258
- You know. electrocute them.

1710
01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:48.395
- No. no we're not doin' that.

1711
01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:50.230
We're not. we're not doin'
murder.

1712
01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:53.667
God. what's wrong with you?

1713
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:55.336
- [Frank] Nothing.

1714
01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:57.037
I just thought that we
were gonna have some fun

1715
01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:58.405
and fry these fuckers. man.

1716
01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.474
(fingers snapping)

1717
01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:01.742
- Yeah. Talkie's right.

1718
01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:03.677
What about all the fuckin'
equipment?

1719
01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.611
I mean. there's actual
value shit down there.

1720
01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:07.681
- I thought since they were
trespassing. we could just--

1721
01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:10.451
- Trespassing. trespassing?

1722
01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:13.220
We are all trespassing. all
right?

1723
01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:15.222
And none of this shit is ours.

1724
01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:17.524
It's fuckin' nobody's.

1725
01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:19.226
We were just gonna steal the
shit.

1726
01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:21.729
scare the fuck out of
'em. and bail. all right?

1727
01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:23.097
Like. that's it.

1728
01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.464
- [Orin] Please don't
steal my sister's shit.

1729
01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:25.432
She'll kill me.

1730
01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.468
- Shut up you. Pigs in a
Blanket.

1731
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.269
- He's right. she's crazy.

1732
01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:30.437
Probably track you down and
string you up

1733
01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:32.473
or some shit.

1734
01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:34.508
- Yeah well. how about you
shut the fuck up. Tiny Dick?

1735
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:35.976
(Brad humming)

1736
01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.443
- [Orin] You know. she's
probably gonna break out

1737
01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:40.080
of that drum room upstairs any
minute now

1738
01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:41.448
and be down here raisin' hell.

1739
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.716
- You locked her up?

1740
01:23:42.718 --> 01:23:44.685
- [Orin] Totally. she
was being such a snatch.

1741
01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:48.422
- Wait. what. she's here?

1742
01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:49.656
- [Orin] Upstairs. in the drum
room.

1743
01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.792
- She's upstairs in the drum
room.

1744
01:23:51.794 --> 01:23:53.694
Thought you did a sweep
of the house. Frank.

1745
01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:55.379
- I did. I did. Hank. I did.

1746
01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.063
It's just that one of the
rooms was locked. okay?

1747
01:23:57.066 --> 01:23:58.732
- Oh. one of the doors was
locked.

1748
01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:02.503
Oh God. does it ever end with
you?

1749
01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:04.638
Geez. your level of
incompetence.

1750
01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:09.343
it continues to astound and
amaze me.

1751
01:24:09.345 --> 01:24:10.444
- Thank you.

1752
01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:11.678
- It wasn't a compliment.

1753
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:16.350
- Oh look. yeah. now the water's
drainin' out of the pool.

1754
01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:19.319
- Good. good. 'cause
we're not doin' murder.

1755
01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:21.588
- So boring. so then what?

1756
01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:28.195
- All right. I don't know.

1757
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:38.105
(fingers snapping)

1758
01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:40.240
- No way. no way. no way.

1759
01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:41.508
Not that giant pufta.

1760
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:43.210
No. he gets way too much credit

1761
01:24:43.212 --> 01:24:44.445
for this kind of shit as it is.

1762
01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:46.346
- I don't know. man. he might be
right.

1763
01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.083
Durant would probably
know what to do with this.

1764
01:24:50.453 --> 01:24:52.686
- No. wait. you sayin'
I don't know what to do?

1765
01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:54.822
- You literally just said that
you didn't

1766
01:24:54.824 --> 01:24:56.690
and that Durant's got his.
what do people call it.

1767
01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.492
you know. his fist in the pulse.

1768
01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:01.728
- God. finger. finger
on the pulse. you fool.

1769
01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:04.932
Fuckin' idiot. he doesn't.

1770
01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.234
He doesn't have his finger
on the pulse of anything.

1771
01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:09.770
He might his finger jammed
up some dude's ass. huh?

1772
01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:12.306
Yeah. might have it like
that. you know. come on.

1773
01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:15.375
That's funny. he does.
finger. up some dude's ass.

1774
01:25:15.377 --> 01:25:16.510
(mouth clicking)

1775
01:25:16.512 --> 01:25:17.377
(hand slapping)

1776
01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:19.746
(clock ticking)

1777
01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.882
- [Worker] This old girl.
she's cleanin' up real nice.

1778
01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:24.718
Hey. this chandelier. I
got this at a garage sale.

1779
01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.687
- Gonna put that right here.
(mellow electronic music)

1780
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:29.156
I like that right there. I like
that.

1781
01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:31.008
- [Worker] Whoa. whoa. what the
fuck?

1782
01:25:31.009 --> 01:25:32.859
- Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. hey. Talkie. Talkie.

1783
01:25:32.862 --> 01:25:34.628
Right. right. right. yeah. yeah.

1784
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.296
I have no idea what you're doing

1785
01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.465
or what you're saying. man. all
right?

1786
01:25:39.435 --> 01:25:40.601
What do you want?

1787
01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:41.768
Can't you see we're busy right
now?

1788
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:43.237
We're tryin' to work on these
houses.

1789
01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:44.705
Hey. hey. hey. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1790
01:25:44.707 --> 01:25:46.673
We just painted this wall.

1791
01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:49.810
Like I said. I'm a very
busy man at the moment.

1792
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.314
Talkie. yes. but can't you
just write this out for me

1793
01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.749
on a pad or something?

1794
01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:56.683
Listen. Lake. can y'all give me.
give me--

1795
01:25:56.685 --> 01:25:57.885
- [Talkie] Mm.

1796
01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:04.158
- Wait. oh. shit.

1797
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.425
You're illiterate. too.

1798
01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:08.095
A one-eyed mute motherfucker.

1799
01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.763
and you can't read or write.
neither?

1800
01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:12.566
Damn. son. what the hell
happened to you?

1801
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:17.304
So. eh. Talkie. eh. I'm sorry.

1802
01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.739
Look. hey. look at me. man.

1803
01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.408
Don't you got an address for me.
at least?

1804
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.676
Gimme an address. right.

1805
01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:26.914
No. no. Talkie. I meant
with a pen and paper. man.

1806
01:26:26.916 --> 01:26:28.582
No. fuck it.

1807
01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.653
All right. so you're illiterate.

1808
01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:36.323
and you can still do
this whole numbers thing.

1809
01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:38.225
Shit's fascinating.

1810
01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:41.228
237. okay. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. wait a minute.

1811
01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:42.896
You're not talkin' about
my drum pad. are you?

1812
01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:44.898
- Whoa. what about the drum pad.
boss?

1813
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.936
- Let me try and decipher
this whole cave scroll shit

1814
01:26:48.938 --> 01:26:50.737
that you're doin' on my wall
here.

1815
01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:53.307
I gotcha three people here.

1816
01:26:53.309 --> 01:26:54.308
Are they dancing?

1817
01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:56.510
Are they fighting?

1818
01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:01.448
They're fucking?

1819
01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:03.917
In my drum house?

1820
01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:07.754
Wait. so three people are kind
of fucking

1821
01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:09.456
in my empty swimming pool?

1822
01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:12.726
Well. well. oh shit. Talkie.

1823
01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:15.329
Please tell me no one's
gettin' raped right now.

1824
01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:21.468
All right. yeah. I got it. I got
it.

1825
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:23.637
Yeah. this is interesting. for
sure.

1826
01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:25.505
All right. it's concerning as
hell.

1827
01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:26.773
But it's not pressing. all
right?

1828
01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:28.575
All right. yeah Talkie.

1829
01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.244
go lookin' out. man. all right?

1830
01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:31.712
Listen. you're gonna be rewarded
for this

1831
01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:33.847
if this turns out to
be anything. all right?

1832
01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:36.950
But right now. we gotta get
back to work. all right?

1833
01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:37.985
Talkie. gotta get back--

1834
01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:39.987
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1835
01:27:39.989 --> 01:27:42.889
You don't advance on a man
unless you can back it up.

1836
01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.524
Can you back it up. Valkyrie?

1837
01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:46.994
(fist slamming)

1838
01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.562
- Hey. whoa. hey. chill.
chill. chill. man.

1839
01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:49.563
- [Worker] What does he want?

1840
01:27:49.565 --> 01:27:50.781
- What the fuck. dude?

1841
01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:51.998
You hit him in his only good
eye.

1842
01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:54.601
Dude. you're fucked up.

1843
01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.304
- Yeah. I'm fucked up.

1844
01:27:57.306 --> 01:28:00.007
- [Durant] Don't be pesky. all
right?

1845
01:28:00.009 --> 01:28:01.708
Nobody likes pesky.

1846
01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:03.577
I told you. I'll get to this
matter

1847
01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:04.745
when I'll get to it.

1848
01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:05.912
Right now. I just need you to
get the fuck

1849
01:28:05.914 --> 01:28:06.980
out of my house.

1850
01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:13.720
Uh. uh. uh. Talkie. not
before you fix this shit.

1851
01:28:16.292 --> 01:28:17.891
The wall ain't gonna paint
itself.

1852
01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:22.429
(supersonic plane booming)
Oh. shit.

1853
01:28:22.431 --> 01:28:25.532
(supersonic plane booming)

1854
01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:28.001
What y'all doing. don't
y'all know what that was?

1855
01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:31.938
- I ain't scared to
death. you know. I wasn't.

1856
01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.775
- Yeah. yeah. don't nobody read
here?

1857
01:28:34.777 --> 01:28:37.678
Yo. that was one fast-assed
jet breakin' the sound barrier

1858
01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.046
was what that was.

1859
01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:41.481
Yeah. a huge pressure that moves
in front

1860
01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.383
and behind the moving object.

1861
01:28:43.385 --> 01:28:45.886
and it causes a huge burst of
energy.

1862
01:28:45.888 --> 01:28:47.754
That shit is fascinating.

1863
01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:49.756
It was right on time. too.

1864
01:28:49.758 --> 01:28:50.991
But yeah. we behind schedule.

1865
01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:52.893
so y'all. let's get back to
work.

1866
01:28:52.895 --> 01:28:56.697
You too. Talks. paint that shit
up.

1867
01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:05.505
Huh. people kinda fucking
in my swimming pool.

1868
01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:09.109
It's interesting for sure.
but it's not pressing.

1869
01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:10.043
(rhythmic drumming)

1870
01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:11.078
Got it?

1871
01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.012
- Yeah. boss.

1872
01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:14.114
Gentral fa cation. we go
inside--

1873
01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:17.651
- No. man. gentrification. all
right?

1874
01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:19.419
It's when upscale hipsters move
in

1875
01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:20.854
and prices everyone else out.

1876
01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:25.559
- So is that why we're fixin'
up all these old houses?

1877
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:26.493
- Exactly.

1878
01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:28.006
- All right.

1879
01:29:28.007 --> 01:29:29.518
- We're squattin' in all these
shitholes

1880
01:29:29.519 --> 01:29:31.030
and makin' some improvements
wherever we can. all right.

1881
01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.899
and then when the economy
recovers.

1882
01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:34.768
property values in the area
rise.

1883
01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:38.472
- Thanks to generalication.

1884
01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:39.573
Could we go in there. we relax--

1885
01:29:39.575 --> 01:29:42.476
- Gentrification. yes.
- Jesus.

1886
01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.044
- We'll be the rightful owners.

1887
01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:45.979
and then we cash in. all right?

1888
01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:48.648
We're squattin' and flippin'
like motherfuckers now.

1889
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:50.550
We cash in later. it's all
cyclical.

1890
01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:53.019
- It's all cycle skull

1891
01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.422
'cause he. 'cause crazy smart.

1892
01:29:55.424 --> 01:29:56.957
That's why he's the boss.

1893
01:29:56.959 --> 01:29:59.393
- Look. you ain't gotta
worry about that. all right?

1894
01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:01.528
Just squattin'. flip with me.

1895
01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:04.030
and you'll be just fine. trust
me.

1896
01:30:04.032 --> 01:30:05.699
- Can do. boss.

1897
01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:09.436
- Boys. but I don't know
what we about to see in here.

1898
01:30:09.438 --> 01:30:11.004
but my interested is piqued.

1899
01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:13.807
When was the last time
y'all heard me say that?

1900
01:30:13.809 --> 01:30:14.674
- I don't remember.

1901
01:30:14.676 --> 01:30:15.976
- Exactly.

1902
01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:18.712
People kinda having sex in my
pool?

1903
01:30:18.714 --> 01:30:19.679
Makes one wonder.

1904
01:30:21.617 --> 01:30:22.816
- Makes me kinda horny.

1905
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.521
- Finger. finger on the pulse.
you fool.

1906
01:30:27.523 --> 01:30:29.022
And he doesn't. he doesn't have
his finger

1907
01:30:29.024 --> 01:30:30.991
on the pulse of anything.

1908
01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:33.660
He might have his finger
jammed up some dude's ass. huh?

1909
01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:35.195
Yeah. might have it like that.

1910
01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:38.532
but he doesn't have his finger
on the pulse of nothin'.

1911
01:30:38.534 --> 01:30:40.867
What. what. that was a little
funny.

1912
01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:43.603
Finger. up some dude's
ass. 'cause he's gay?

1913
01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:44.671
(mouth clicking)

1914
01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:47.057
(hand slapping)
(Hank groaning)

1915
01:30:47.058 --> 01:30:49.442
- Wrong. my finger's a-dancin'
through the victorious breeze

1916
01:30:49.445 --> 01:30:52.779
in the crushing defeat in the
wake of your punk-ass face.

1917
01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:55.449
- But it was just us chickens.

1918
01:30:57.019 --> 01:30:59.786
- What the fuck.

1919
01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.888
- That is the question.
(Frank grunting)

1920
01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.090
- (laughing) Oh. hold on.

1921
01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:06.159
You have got the littlest dick

1922
01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:07.661
I have ever seen. my man.

1923
01:31:07.663 --> 01:31:08.962
Hold on. hold on. now hold it.

1924
01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:12.599
(camera clicks)
You are just a little fella.

1925
01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:14.868
Know that I've got you now and
forever

1926
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.770
up in my cloud (laughing).

1927
01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:18.538
Hey. cover yourself up.

1928
01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:21.842
- Thank you.

1929
01:31:22.845 --> 01:31:24.544
- None of this is right.

1930
01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:27.113
It don't look right.
and it don't feel right.

1931
01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:29.316
- No. no. you're right.

1932
01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:31.518
This is a completely fucked-up
situation.

1933
01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.787
But Frank and I were handling
it.

1934
01:31:33.789 --> 01:31:35.555
- You call this handling it?

1935
01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:38.058
These white boys laying
on the bottom of my pool?

1936
01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.693
My man over here with his dick
out.

1937
01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:41.345
Look like he's sunbathing for an
up

1938
01:31:41.346 --> 01:31:42.996
and coming nudist event.
(fist thudding)

1939
01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:46.199
Listen. what the fuck is this
noise

1940
01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:47.567
comin' from my house?

1941
01:31:47.569 --> 01:31:48.835
- Told you I heard something.

1942
01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.270
- Hey. shut the fuck up.

1943
01:31:50.272 --> 01:31:51.771
No one's talkin' to you.

1944
01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:53.857
- Who is that. what's going on?

1945
01:31:53.858 --> 01:31:55.942
- You motherfuckers don't
know how to end shit. do you?

1946
01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:58.245
You got closing skill issues.

1947
01:31:58.247 --> 01:32:01.047
- Oh God. I think I know what
that means.

1948
01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:05.051
- Uh. what do you think that
means?

1949
01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:07.821
- You're gonna kill us. aren't
you?

1950
01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:12.259
- That's hilarious.

1951
01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:14.227
The fag's a racist.

1952
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:15.161
- [Orin] Fuck you!

1953
01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:16.263
- What did you just say?

1954
01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:20.600
- Yeah. no. no. before you got
here.

1955
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.186
the fruit roll-up there.

1956
01:32:23.187 --> 01:32:24.703
he was talkin' about black dudes

1957
01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.207
and how they like to kill people
for fun.

1958
01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.209
- No. what. no I wasn't.

1959
01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:32.846
- Yeah. yeah. he was using
the Nig word and everything.

1960
01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:34.348
- Yeah.

1961
01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:35.849
- I'm not takin' sides here. but
he was.

1962
01:32:36.818 --> 01:32:37.784
- Bullshit. shut the fuck up.

1963
01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:38.985
- Shut the fuck up. Tiny Dick.

1964
01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:41.004
- Yeah. no. no. no.

1965
01:32:41.005 --> 01:32:43.022
All of this. all of this
is the fruit roll-up's

1966
01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:45.191
some sort of revenge scheme. you
know.

1967
01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:46.793
against the two jocks.

1968
01:32:46.795 --> 01:32:50.764
That and some sort of
a fucked-up experiment.

1969
01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.567
- Experiment?

1970
01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.335
- Yeah. experiment. a fag
experiment.

1971
01:32:55.337 --> 01:32:57.304
And one of 'em's a fag.

1972
01:32:57.306 --> 01:32:59.239
Look at him. check the boner.

1973
01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:00.206
He gets. wha!

1974
01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.942
(Hank grunting)

1975
01:33:01.944 --> 01:33:02.976
- We got a closet homo on our
hands?

1976
01:33:02.978 --> 01:33:04.294
(Hank grunting)

1977
01:33:04.295 --> 01:33:05.611
- Shut your filthy. fuckin'
mouth.

1978
01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:09.883
We don't use the fag word
around here any more.

1979
01:33:09.885 --> 01:33:10.750
- Okay.

1980
01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:11.985
- Where's the closet homo?

1981
01:33:12.988 --> 01:33:14.054
- [Dylan] I'm just nervous.

1982
01:33:14.056 --> 01:33:15.839
- Fuck you. Nervous.

1983
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.623
You're a latent homosexual.
you're fucking gay.

1984
01:33:18.627 --> 01:33:20.143
- He's right.

1985
01:33:20.144 --> 01:33:21.660
- You love dicks. and you lie
about it.

1986
01:33:21.663 --> 01:33:24.698
- [Orin] Oh. yes Brad. ah. ah.
ah. ah--

1987
01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.067
- Okay. yeah. yeah. enough.
enough!

1988
01:33:28.637 --> 01:33:30.770
What's with this one. is
he on drugs or something?

1989
01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:31.938
- Adderall.

1990
01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:33.607
- Fuckin' white boy drugs.

1991
01:33:33.609 --> 01:33:35.642
All right. y'all
motherfuckers done fucked up

1992
01:33:35.644 --> 01:33:37.344
by choosing my crib to do
whatever it is the fuck

1993
01:33:37.346 --> 01:33:38.612
y'all doin' here.

1994
01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:39.346
- [Brad] Yup.

1995
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:45.785
- Damn (laughs). the dicks
be busy up in this bitch.

1996
01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:47.554
(Frank and worker laughing)

1997
01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.322
God. y'all playin some
cowcocks and lesbians.

1998
01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:51.024
Yeah. but there's a problem.

1999
01:33:51.026 --> 01:33:53.393
'Cause this here is my bitch.

2000
01:33:53.395 --> 01:33:55.996
- [Hank] Bullshit. you don't
own this house (grunts).

2001
01:33:55.998 --> 01:33:59.265
- About to. ever heard
of squatter's rights?

2002
01:33:59.267 --> 01:34:03.203
- Yeah. and um. what's that
genification?

2003
01:34:04.339 --> 01:34:06.806
- Listen. y'all depraved
motherfuckers

2004
01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.342
are currently desecrating my
drum pad.

2005
01:34:09.344 --> 01:34:12.345
- Drum room. what is this.
what is the drum room?

2006
01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:14.914
- Explain it to him.

2007
01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:16.916
- We got a drum room upstairs.

2008
01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:18.652
It's soundproofed and
everything.

2009
01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:20.332
- Really?

2010
01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:22.011
- Yeah. we like to
relax with a drum circle

2011
01:34:22.012 --> 01:34:23.690
after a long day of flippin'.
you know.

2012
01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:24.708
- It's important.

2013
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:25.725
- Yeah.
(Frank squealing)

2014
01:34:25.727 --> 01:34:27.160
- Hey. yo. Talkie. Talkie.

2015
01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:29.129
Hey. shut the shit down. will
you?

2016
01:34:30.365 --> 01:34:32.332
What I'm getting at is this. all
right?

2017
01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:34.100
As fucked up as all this is

2018
01:34:34.102 --> 01:34:35.702
with your dicks hangin' out.

2019
01:34:35.704 --> 01:34:37.404
all right. these Chinese finger
traps.

2020
01:34:37.406 --> 01:34:40.440
this is just a footnote and for
what we're doin'. all right?

2021
01:34:40.442 --> 01:34:43.343
Just a tiny blip on the
proverbial map.

2022
01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:46.379
What we're doing is gonna
change this neighborhood.

2023
01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:47.981
Not just talk about for a day.

2024
01:34:47.983 --> 01:34:51.251
and not just shared with
a link for a quick laugh.

2025
01:34:51.253 --> 01:34:54.287
You small-time bitches think too
small.

2026
01:34:55.257 --> 01:34:58.725
So get the fuck out of my house.

2027
01:34:58.727 --> 01:34:59.893
(generator whirring down)

2028
01:34:59.895 --> 01:35:02.429
(drum booming)

2029
01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:04.464
what the fuck was that?

2030
01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:05.832
(drum booming)

2031
01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:07.467
- Here she comes.

2032
01:35:10.305 --> 01:35:12.338
- And here who comes?

2033
01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:17.410
(Meg snarling)
(ominous electronic music)

2034
01:35:17.412 --> 01:35:20.847
- Who the fuck are you?

2035
01:35:20.849 --> 01:35:23.083
- Okay. not my djembe.

2036
01:35:23.085 --> 01:35:24.417
Listen. of all the drums up
there.

2037
01:35:24.419 --> 01:35:26.219
you gotta grab my djembe?

2038
01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:27.821
- You like this drum. do you?

2039
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.157
- There's just cowcocks and
lesbians.

2040
01:35:31.159 --> 01:35:32.726
- I'm not a lesbian.

2041
01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:34.427
- Yeah. well. whatever.

2042
01:35:34.429 --> 01:35:36.196
- Well. this drum's about to be

2043
01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:38.131
a really difficult puzzle

2044
01:35:38.133 --> 01:35:39.866
if you do not let my brother go.

2045
01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:41.234
- Oh. that's savage.

2046
01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:43.203
No need for savagery.

2047
01:35:43.205 --> 01:35:45.138
No. eh. whoa. whoa. whoa.

2048
01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.173
What is this. huh?

2049
01:35:47.175 --> 01:35:49.109
Is this an experiment in my
pool?

2050
01:35:49.111 --> 01:35:51.511
Hey. science fascinates me. it
always has.

2051
01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:58.918
- These two animals have
been tormenting my brother

2052
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.487
for years with their homophobia.

2053
01:36:00.489 --> 01:36:02.922
- Oh. oh. oh. that's just fucked
up.

2054
01:36:02.924 --> 01:36:04.357
I've pounded on a lot of dudes.

2055
01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:05.525
- Yeah. he has (grunting).

2056
01:36:05.527 --> 01:36:06.977
- You know. I'm not gay

2057
01:36:06.978 --> 01:36:08.428
in the conventional sense. all
right?

2058
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.097
I'm just so hyper-masculine

2059
01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:11.765
that chicks just don't
do it for me anymore.

2060
01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:14.167
- Oh. I get that. that makes
sense.

2061
01:36:14.169 --> 01:36:15.535
- That's not a thing.

2062
01:36:15.537 --> 01:36:17.303
- You care for me to
demonstrate?

2063
01:36:17.305 --> 01:36:18.938
- Maybe.

2064
01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.507
- Look. look. I beat on a lot of
dudes

2065
01:36:20.509 --> 01:36:22.208
especially when I was ploughin'
bitches.

2066
01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.811
But I never beat on a man
for bein' gay. all right?

2067
01:36:24.813 --> 01:36:26.396
That's just weak.

2068
01:36:26.397 --> 01:36:27.980
- Well. aren't you
motherfuckin' Teresa up there.

2069
01:36:27.983 --> 01:36:30.049
you tall motherfucker. sorry.

2070
01:36:30.051 --> 01:36:32.819
- Well. um. I'm in grad school
now. so--

2071
01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:35.155
- No shit. where?
- Yeah. AVC.

2072
01:36:35.157 --> 01:36:37.023
- Nice. they got a hell of a--

2073
01:36:37.025 --> 01:36:40.026
- Psychology program.
- psychology program (laughs).

2074
01:36:40.028 --> 01:36:41.494
Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

2075
01:36:42.998 --> 01:36:44.464
- All right. so?

2076
01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:48.501
- Yeah. so my brother and I
hatched a plan

2077
01:36:48.503 --> 01:36:52.806
to subdue this jock and
his closeted friend here.

2078
01:36:54.376 --> 01:36:56.843
- Well. looks like you
succeeded.

2079
01:36:56.845 --> 01:36:57.577
- Yeah. I did.

2080
01:36:57.579 --> 01:37:00.013
- So boring. who cares?

2081
01:37:00.015 --> 01:37:01.581
So she stuck our dicks in this
thing

2082
01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:02.933
that is still on my dick

2083
01:37:02.934 --> 01:37:04.284
and said we had to get
boners for each other.

2084
01:37:04.286 --> 01:37:06.052
and I got nervous and I sprouted
one.

2085
01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:07.087
and Brad couldn't.

2086
01:37:07.088 --> 01:37:08.121
and now you're here and now
there's water.

2087
01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.155
and I'm tired of hearing about
it.

2088
01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:10.540
I'm just tired and hungry.

2089
01:37:10.541 --> 01:37:11.924
and I'm just really. who cares?

2090
01:37:15.096 --> 01:37:16.162
- You done?

2091
01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.229
- Been done. I passed the test.

2092
01:37:17.232 --> 01:37:18.848
so get me out of here.

2093
01:37:18.849 --> 01:37:20.465
- Hey listen. yo. don't
make me come down there.

2094
01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:22.468
You wouldn't like it if I
were to come down there.

2095
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:23.403
- Might.

2096
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.474
- My uh--

2097
01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:29.909
- Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Wait a minute. whoa.

2098
01:37:29.911 --> 01:37:33.613
- As I was saying. my
thesis was simple enough.

2099
01:37:33.615 --> 01:37:35.582
Set out to prove or disprove

2100
01:37:35.584 --> 01:37:38.284
whether or not homosexuality was
a choice

2101
01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.153
or a predisposition at birth.

2102
01:37:40.155 --> 01:37:42.205
- And to go viral.

2103
01:37:42.206 --> 01:37:44.256
- Not to go viral. it
was never to go viral.

2104
01:37:44.259 --> 01:37:46.926
It was for my thesis and
for your vengeance. sure.

2105
01:37:46.928 --> 01:37:49.362
but never to go fucking viral.

2106
01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:50.780
- It's not too late.

2107
01:37:50.781 --> 01:37:52.197
Anyone who wants to go
viral. stand up now.

2108
01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.333
We can overpower them.

2109
01:37:54.236 --> 01:37:57.303
(crickets chirping)

2110
01:38:03.078 --> 01:38:04.077
- You suck.

2111
01:38:12.153 --> 01:38:15.288
- All right. y'all. just
let him go. all right?

2112
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:17.190
He'll come back. he always does.

2113
01:38:17.192 --> 01:38:19.459
It's not like he's gonna
be talkin' to anybody.

2114
01:38:19.461 --> 01:38:22.045
(worker laughing)

2115
01:38:22.046 --> 01:38:24.630
- You know. we might have
actually gotten some good stuff.

2116
01:38:24.633 --> 01:38:26.366
If it wasn't for this one.

2117
01:38:26.368 --> 01:38:29.669
locking me up over his
own ridiculous agenda.

2118
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:31.571
- Hey well. you're out. now.

2119
01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:33.439
- I couldn't get the subjects
to sign the releases.

2120
01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:37.343
- Releases. no. no. we
can get you releases.

2121
01:38:37.345 --> 01:38:39.112
- Oh God. I know what that
means.

2122
01:38:39.114 --> 01:38:40.947
He's gonna cut off their
hands and sign for them.

2123
01:38:40.949 --> 01:38:43.149
then what. cut off mine
just 'cause he can?

2124
01:38:46.454 --> 01:38:49.155
- Listen. your brother is an
idiot.

2125
01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:51.324
- Yeah. I know.

2126
01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:53.993
It's the drugs.

2127
01:38:53.995 --> 01:38:55.695
I had no idea how bad it had
gotten.

2128
01:38:57.432 --> 01:39:00.099
coupled with the trauma.
(melancholy violin music)

2129
01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:02.502
family and personal for the both
of us.

2130
01:39:02.504 --> 01:39:05.071
I got my period when I was 12.

2131
01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:07.307
It was a traumatic time for me.

2132
01:39:07.309 --> 01:39:09.108
For Orin. too.

2133
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:10.977
Tried to explain to him that.
you know.

2134
01:39:10.979 --> 01:39:13.179
my parts are my parts and
his parts are his parts.

2135
01:39:13.181 --> 01:39:14.681
but he had a really hard time

2136
01:39:14.683 --> 01:39:16.349
understanding and accepting
that.

2137
01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:18.985
- Like. that's. that's
unfortunate.

2138
01:39:21.222 --> 01:39:22.555
- Sorry. baby brother.

2139
01:39:29.531 --> 01:39:31.731
(Frank laughing)

2140
01:39:31.733 --> 01:39:33.566
- But I won't get into that
right now.

2141
01:39:33.568 --> 01:39:35.335
- Yeah. all right. well look.

2142
01:39:35.337 --> 01:39:37.170
This is how this is gonna go
down.

2143
01:39:37.172 --> 01:39:39.505
All this stuff here. it's now
mine.

2144
01:39:41.376 --> 01:39:42.608
- Then the drum goes down.

2145
01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:45.645
- Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa. let me
finish.

2146
01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:48.147
Except for what's yours. all
right?

2147
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:49.749
I'm assuming you got. like. a
laptop

2148
01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:52.085
with all your important
docs and such shit?

2149
01:39:53.088 --> 01:39:54.254
- I do.

2150
01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:55.421
- Okay. well. you keep that.

2151
01:39:55.423 --> 01:39:58.057
Your brother's shit. it's now
mine.

2152
01:39:58.059 --> 01:39:59.726
It's probably all stolen.
anyhow.

2153
01:39:59.728 --> 01:40:01.094
- Might be (laughing).

2154
01:40:10.071 --> 01:40:15.074
- Hey. yo. what the fuck. man?
(bell clanging)

2155
01:40:15.076 --> 01:40:16.376
- Woo. now I got the knife.

2156
01:40:16.378 --> 01:40:18.378
now. I'm in charge.
motherfuckers.

2157
01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.313
- Yeah. yeah. Frank.
you got this! (grunting)

2158
01:40:20.315 --> 01:40:21.247
- Thank Hank.

2159
01:40:22.117 --> 01:40:26.285
First of all. all this. ours.

2160
01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:27.653
All this shit is ours.

2161
01:40:27.655 --> 01:40:30.590
Even your little school laptop.
you bitch.

2162
01:40:30.592 --> 01:40:33.226
Second of all. who wants
to get cut first. huh. hm?

2163
01:40:33.228 --> 01:40:34.794
(ominous techno music)

2164
01:40:34.796 --> 01:40:37.430
What about you. a little bit
of the old in and out. eh?

2165
01:40:37.432 --> 01:40:40.033
How about you. you wanna
get cut. faggot. huh?

2166
01:40:40.035 --> 01:40:41.734
It's what I thought. scared
little bitch.

2167
01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:45.038
- Yeah he is. he's a
bitch. you got this Frank.

2168
01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.339
- Does he?

2169
01:40:46.341 --> 01:40:48.541
I know I should care. but I
don't.

2170
01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:50.410
I got no stake in anybody down
here.

2171
01:40:50.412 --> 01:40:51.444
- Oh. yeah?

2172
01:40:51.446 --> 01:40:53.579
Yeah. you don't care. okay.

2173
01:40:53.581 --> 01:40:55.681
He don't care. Hank. he don't
care. huh?

2174
01:40:55.683 --> 01:40:58.718
See if you care about your
little boyfriend here. huh?

2175
01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.453
- Don't you touch him. you son
of a bitch!

2176
01:41:00.455 --> 01:41:04.557
- Boyfriend. son. you're all
fucked up.

2177
01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:09.195
- I just did the math.
you got no angle. Frank.

2178
01:41:09.197 --> 01:41:10.329
We're fucked.

2179
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:11.697
- I will smash this drum.

2180
01:41:13.234 --> 01:41:14.834
- I don't care.

2181
01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.435
- I do. I care more about that
drum

2182
01:41:16.438 --> 01:41:17.770
than anybody down here.

2183
01:41:17.772 --> 01:41:19.572
No need to be so. oh. shit.

2184
01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:21.574
Oh. does that make me a terrible
person?

2185
01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.209
- Yes. yes. it does.

2186
01:41:23.211 --> 01:41:25.478
- Boss. no it doesn't.
(poignant violin music)

2187
01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.347
That drum is very important to
you.

2188
01:41:28.349 --> 01:41:30.933
so fuck them.

2189
01:41:30.934 --> 01:41:33.518
- No. those drums are
important to all of us.

2190
01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:37.356
You know. just in case. I'm
gonna go check

2191
01:41:37.358 --> 01:41:40.393
to make sure they're okay.

2192
01:41:42.197 --> 01:41:44.831
- Look. you carve this boy. and
then what?

2193
01:41:44.833 --> 01:41:46.332
You got no recourse.

2194
01:41:47.202 --> 01:41:48.701
- He's right. Frank.

2195
01:41:48.703 --> 01:41:49.802
You got no resource.

2196
01:41:50.805 --> 01:41:52.171
- Well. I'm not really sure

2197
01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:54.140
what the word fuckin' recourse
means.

2198
01:41:54.142 --> 01:41:56.676
but I'm pretty sure I
got the drum recourse.

2199
01:41:56.678 --> 01:41:58.277
- [Hank] You know what.
you're right. Frank.

2200
01:41:58.279 --> 01:41:59.679
You got the drum recourse. use
it.

2201
01:41:59.681 --> 01:42:01.981
- [Frank] I plan to.

2202
01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:04.282
- Hey. you ever think
about bad things happening

2203
01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:05.318
to bad people?

2204
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.986
- Huh. what?

2205
01:42:06.987 --> 01:42:08.653
- Yeah. I think that's
what we're about to see.

2206
01:42:08.656 --> 01:42:13.259
But the idea. please. be
careful with my djembe.

2207
01:42:14.562 --> 01:42:17.864
- Ow. ow. fuck! (screaming)

2208
01:42:20.435 --> 01:42:22.802
(Meg grunting)
(string slashing)

2209
01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:23.903
- And there it is.

2210
01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:26.572
- Frank. Frank. you okay?

2211
01:42:26.574 --> 01:42:27.573
- Fuckin' asshole.

2212
01:42:27.575 --> 01:42:31.577
- I'm disfigured. the Nazi has
marked me!

2213
01:42:31.579 --> 01:42:33.613
He's disfigured me. he's ruined
me. he's--

2214
01:42:33.615 --> 01:42:35.181
- Hey. you believe in fate?

2215
01:42:35.183 --> 01:42:36.516
- [Orin] It's not just
a scratch. fuck you.

2216
01:42:36.518 --> 01:42:38.151
- What?
- it's just a scratch.

2217
01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:39.385
- No.

2218
01:42:39.387 --> 01:42:41.771
- Me neither.

2219
01:42:41.772 --> 01:42:44.156
but all of this. all of this is
fortuitous

2220
01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:45.258
if not serendipitous.

2221
01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:50.530
- Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

2222
01:42:50.532 --> 01:42:51.831
hey. hey. hey. hey.

2223
01:42:51.833 --> 01:42:52.865
(boot thudding)
Like. whoa.

2224
01:42:52.867 --> 01:42:54.500
- You tryin' to run boy?

2225
01:42:54.502 --> 01:42:57.436
No. we're not nearly done with
you.

2226
01:42:58.573 --> 01:43:02.308
(melancholy strings music)

2227
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:43.749
- [Orin Voiceover] What the fuck
is this?

2228
01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:47.887
Dylan. I would fuck you before
I would fuck this loser.

2229
01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:51.857
Dylan. I would fuck you
in a box. in my socks.

2230
01:43:51.859 --> 01:43:55.561
in a bar. in a car. this is
fucking bullshit. this is.

2231
01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:58.664
I just turned him into a gay
celebrity.

2232
01:44:01.502 --> 01:44:04.020
(laptop slamming)
- While some may view

2233
01:44:04.021 --> 01:44:06.539
this method as provocative
or needlessly elaborate.

2234
01:44:06.541 --> 01:44:08.741
I can assure you that
this scenario proved to be

2235
01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:12.278
the most direct and effective
means of drawing a conclusion

2236
01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.881
to this sensitive and ultimately
controversial question.

2237
01:44:15.883 --> 01:44:17.850
(Hank grunting)

2238
01:44:17.852 --> 01:44:20.519
- Fuck you. you black bastard.

2239
01:44:20.521 --> 01:44:23.823
No. no. no (yelping)
(electricity whirring)

2240
01:44:23.825 --> 01:44:26.525
- It's science. baby. I love it.

2241
01:44:26.527 --> 01:44:28.894
(Hank gasping)
(Durant laughing)

2242
01:44:28.896 --> 01:44:32.331
- Oh. fuck. oh. fuck you. fuck
you.

2243
01:44:32.333 --> 01:44:33.933
- You lucky I'm not sadistic.

2244
01:44:33.935 --> 01:44:35.885
I'd be strappin' your dicks

2245
01:44:35.886 --> 01:44:37.836
into this urine-soaked
dingletrap if I were.

2246
01:44:37.839 --> 01:44:39.839
You get a freshie.

2247
01:44:39.841 --> 01:44:41.474
- Is that right. Mandingo?

2248
01:44:41.476 --> 01:44:43.509
Well. if I wasn't
strapped all to this shit.

2249
01:44:43.511 --> 01:44:45.945
I'd fuckin' Shaka Zulu this
shit right up your ass. huh?

2250
01:44:45.947 --> 01:44:47.614
What do you think about that?

2251
01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:49.282
- Shut up. shut up. shut up.

2252
01:44:49.283 --> 01:44:50.950
- Actually. you know what?
- No. no. man. come on. man.

2253
01:44:50.952 --> 01:44:53.386
- Dude. come on. no. no. no.
- Yes.

2254
01:44:53.388 --> 01:44:54.987
- No. no. no. no.
- Guys. yeah.

2255
01:44:54.989 --> 01:44:57.523
- Oh. oh God.
- Oh. God.

2256
01:44:57.525 --> 01:44:58.791
- It's really bad.
(Durant laughing)

2257
01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.058
It's really bad. Hank.
- Oh (moaning).

2258
01:45:00.061 --> 01:45:01.560
- We're just about set down
here.

2259
01:45:01.562 --> 01:45:02.928
(rhythmic drumming)

2260
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:05.231
- Now while my initial aim

2261
01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:07.533
was to answer a question
that is largely rhetorical.

2262
01:45:07.535 --> 01:45:10.403
"Is homosexuality a choice?".

2263
01:45:10.405 --> 01:45:12.105
I stumbled upon a new query.

2264
01:45:12.106 --> 01:45:13.806
- To prove or disprove that
homosexuality is a choice

2265
01:45:13.808 --> 01:45:15.808
like you say it is.

2266
01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:16.742
Hit it. Talkie.

2267
01:45:19.414 --> 01:45:20.513
(playful orchestral music)
This next track here

2268
01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:22.048
runs about 22 minutes long.

2269
01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:22.982
- With both control groups.

2270
01:45:22.984 --> 01:45:24.750
a common result occurred.

2271
01:45:24.752 --> 01:45:27.987
Closeted homosexuality
resulted in latent aggression

2272
01:45:27.989 --> 01:45:31.590
and overt violence towards
others that are openly gay.

2273
01:45:32.694 --> 01:45:35.027
- Science. baby. I love it.

2274
01:45:36.064 --> 01:45:37.363
(rhythmic drumming)
- Fuck.

2275
01:45:37.365 --> 01:45:38.898
- Whoa. whoa. what. what. what?

2276
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.334
Did I screw something up down
here?

2277
01:45:41.336 --> 01:45:43.336
- We have another sprouter.

2278
01:45:43.338 --> 01:45:45.805
And while this is.
admittedly. a limited sample.

2279
01:45:45.807 --> 01:45:47.773
it does beg the question of
whether or not

2280
01:45:47.775 --> 01:45:50.009
this is worthy of further study.

2281
01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:51.811
(rhythmic drumming)
- Uh. what. what is that.

2282
01:45:51.813 --> 01:45:54.113
what is touching me. what is
touching me?

2283
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:56.882
Hank?

2284
01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:01.988
- That's little Hank.

2285
01:46:01.989 --> 01:46:03.456
- God no. no. get me out of
here.

2286
01:46:03.458 --> 01:46:05.024
get me out of this right now.

2287
01:46:05.026 --> 01:46:06.759
Get me out. you fucker.
(Durant laughing)

2288
01:46:06.761 --> 01:46:08.361
- Would you shut the fuck up?

2289
01:46:08.363 --> 01:46:10.085
I'm havin' a moment here. do you
mind?

2290
01:46:10.086 --> 01:46:11.808
- No. there's no moment.
there's not a moment.

2291
01:46:11.809 --> 01:46:13.531
- Now. I'd like to open
the floor to any questions.

2292
01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:16.602
(rhythmic drumming)

2293
01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:27.880
- Yeah. um (sighing). you put
their. um.

2294
01:46:29.684 --> 01:46:32.985
their genitals in what?

2295
01:46:36.591 --> 01:46:40.893
(ambient techno music)
- Shit then.

2296
01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:45.931
(rhythmic drumming)
(Durant laughing)

2297
01:46:49.003 --> 01:46:51.103
- Come on. man. Talks back
there.

2298
01:46:51.105 --> 01:46:53.072
Check out my man Talks back
there.

2299
01:46:53.074 --> 01:46:54.106
- [Drummer] Yeah.

2300
01:46:54.108 --> 01:46:57.042
(Durant laughing)

2301
01:46:59.414 --> 01:47:00.513
- Just feel it.

2302
01:47:00.515 --> 01:47:03.048
- Uh. I'm tellin' you all. man.

2303
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:06.152

be a joint.

2304
01:47:06.154 --> 01:47:07.870
- [Drummer] It's fine.

2305
01:47:07.871 --> 01:47:09.587
- Oh. this joint right
here's gonna be the joint.

2306
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:11.107
You know what I'm sayin'?

2307
01:47:11.108 --> 01:47:12.625
- You got it. you got it back.

You all got it.

2310
01:47:16.631 --> 01:47:18.548
- [Drummer] Can do.

2311
01:47:18.549 --> 01:47:20.466
(drummers chattering)
(drummers laughing)

2312
01:47:20.468 --> 01:47:21.734
- I'm tired of it. man.

2313
01:47:21.736 --> 01:47:23.469
I don't know. I'm tired. but
yeah.

2314
01:47:23.471 --> 01:47:25.471

money with us if you can.

2315
01:47:25.473 --> 01:47:28.941
(rhythmic drumming)

2316
01:47:28.943 --> 01:47:31.877
(heads squeaking)

2317
01:47:39.887 --> 01:47:41.053
(image whooshing)

2318
01:47:41.055 --> 01:47:41.987
(bells trilling)

2319
01:47:41.989 --> 01:47:45.724
(playful electronic music)

2320
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:17.022
(rhythmic drumming)

2321
01:48:17.024 --> 01:48:19.024
More than you can tell.

2322
01:48:20.528 --> 01:48:22.194
Boy get it done. man.

2323
01:48:28.069 --> 01:48:30.536

2324
01:48:30.538 --> 01:48:31.203
We could go on the road.

2325
01:48:31.205 --> 01:48:32.137
Cash money bag.

2326
