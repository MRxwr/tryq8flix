3
00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:59.168
- We've got two or three.
- Is that a good thing?

4
00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:04.584
See the summit of the mountain?
Look at the ridge on the left.

5
00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.834
Does it cause avalanches?

6
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.876
Yeah. if it breaks up
it can cause big avalanches.

7
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:13.751
On the plus side
it's not the only mountain.

8
00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:15.001
Yeah.

9
00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.084
It's bloody freezing.

10
00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:51.418
But we're all kitted out
in our wetsuits.

11
00:14:45.668 --> 00:14:49.251
I've never seen anything like it.

12
00:14:49.376 --> 00:14:52.209
Mountains and sea at the same time.

13
00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:55.376
I just followed the pros.

14
00:25:28.251 --> 00:25:33.001
Being in the river isn't just seeing
nature. it's belonging to nature.

15
00:25:33.126 --> 00:25:37.084
It's an incredible feeling
that you just can't explain.

16
00:25:37.209 --> 00:25:38.459
It's like...

17
00:25:38.584 --> 00:25:41.626
It's like a church
that wasn't made for humans

18
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:45.043
and you can feel everything inside it.

19
00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:47.668
All the feelings are incredible.

20
00:25:54.543 --> 00:25:58.084
Agua Azul is one of the most
incredible rivers I've been in.

21
00:25:58.209 --> 00:26:00.334
It's wonderful. it's beautiful...

22
00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:05.626
but it's not only beautiful.
it's also a monster.

23
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:10.709
there's a lot of hidden danger
behind the beauty.

24
00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:18.418
I came to Agua Azul

25
00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:23.334
to discover a branch of this river
that hadn't yet been explored.

26
00:26:24.001 --> 00:26:26.293
where it runs beside this special rock

27
00:26:27.293 --> 00:26:29.959
which gives the river
its fantastic color.

28
00:27:29.001 --> 00:27:33.793
I met Ã‰ric five years ago when
he came to Mexico for the first time.

29
00:27:33.918 --> 00:27:38.751
Ever since then I've wanted
to be as passionate as he is.

30
00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:51.793
ZAPATISTA COUNTRY

31
00:27:51.918 --> 00:27:54.584
The Zapatistas are good people

32
00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:57.209
who try to do their best
for their community.

33
00:27:57.334 --> 00:28:00.584
All they want
is to protect their land.

34
00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:05.751
They let us cross part of their land.
which is very important to them.

35
00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:09.876
to reach some incredible places
where very few people have been.

36
00:28:35.918 --> 00:28:38.293
We were far from everything.
no phones.

37
00:28:38.418 --> 00:28:44.084
so no helicopters would be coming
to find us in half an hour.

38
00:28:44.209 --> 00:28:46.626
It would be a whole day's walk.

39
00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:12.543
I met Sofia five years ago

40
00:29:12.668 --> 00:29:16.126
when she'd just started kayaking.

41
00:29:16.626 --> 00:29:21.126
Now she's got
a lot of rivers under her belt.

42
00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:31.251
I've no doubt she'll be
one of the best in the world.

43
00:31:57.751 --> 00:32:01.626
I felt a bit like a skier
planting his pole on a slope.

44
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:04.001
You never know
if you'll take off or not

45
00:32:04.126 --> 00:32:08.334
so you need to stay alert
and hold it all together.

46
00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:14.043
It's an amazing sensation. you feel
like you're skiing down a mountain

47
00:32:14.168 --> 00:32:16.834
but you're
in the middle of the jungle.

48
00:32:35.168 --> 00:32:37.709
This river is truly incredible.

49
00:32:37.834 --> 00:32:41.084
You can understand
why the Zapatistas want to protect it.

50
00:32:49.001 --> 00:32:52.418
I've never seen an ecosystem like it.
It's so pure.

51
00:32:52.543 --> 00:32:56.668
To have something like that
on our planet today is really unique.

52
00:32:57.959 --> 00:33:01.876
It's a huge privilege
to be in touch with nature.

53
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:05.459
By not only seeing it but experiencing
it when you're in the river.

54
00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:06.834
you become part of it.

55
00:33:06.959 --> 00:33:09.834
It's not just something
that you can see.

56
00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:12.834
it's something that you can belong to.

57
00:33:40.043 --> 00:33:45.876
I hope the snow's good. It rained
yesterday and didn't freeze overnight.

58
00:33:46.876 --> 00:33:47.709
We'll see.

59
00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:50.751
We started shooting in the Aravis.
where I'm from.

60
00:33:50.876 --> 00:33:53.334
I was really happy
to be filming at home.

61
00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:34.043
I was really nervous
because of last year's shoot.

62
00:34:34.168 --> 00:34:37.209
I had my biggest crash ever
on the first run.

63
00:34:42.584 --> 00:34:46.959
Once you're up on a face
to shoot the film

64
00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:51.709
you're up there on your own.
sometimes waiting 10 or 15 minutes.

65
00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:00.168
It's definitely not the same approach.

66
00:35:00.293 --> 00:35:03.918
The stress builds up and
there's nobody there to reassure you.

67
00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:12.084
I'm a bit nervous about the shoot
and being alone on the face.

68
00:35:20.168 --> 00:35:22.793
I feel good on my skis.
I'm happy up on the face

69
00:35:22.918 --> 00:35:27.293
so I hope we'll have good conditions
over the next few days for riding.

70
00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:44.168
It was a glorious day.

71
00:37:44.293 --> 00:37:48.709
We were here in the Aravis.
in my mountains.

72
00:37:48.834 --> 00:37:52.834
It was an absolutely perfect day.
More than perfect.

73
00:37:53.376 --> 00:37:56.793
Hopefully we'll have
more days like this.

74
00:37:56.918 --> 00:37:58.376
It's brilliant.

75
00:38:17.626 --> 00:38:20.376
We've been good friends
for a long time.

76
00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:24.959
It's the first time
we've ridden together.

77
00:38:25.084 --> 00:38:27.959
We skied together a few years ago.

78
00:39:23.793 --> 00:39:26.043
From that moment on. there was snow.

79
00:39:26.168 --> 00:39:27.834
The conditions were crazy.

80
00:39:27.959 --> 00:39:31.418
it was a proper winter.
the kind we hadn't seen for ages.

81
00:41:04.084 --> 00:41:06.334
There was even more snow
than last year.

82
00:41:06.459 --> 00:41:11.543
You think. "It's going to be twice as
heavy as last year. I'll be crushed."

83
00:41:14.751 --> 00:41:17.126
You need more than courage to try it.

84
00:41:23.376 --> 00:41:27.793
You can't afford to make any mistakes.
You mustn't fall on this mountain.

85
00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:31.376
We didn't know
if the snow was stable or not.

86
00:41:31.501 --> 00:41:35.126
I decided to let them do a run
and watch them.

87
00:42:54.418 --> 00:42:57.543
Wille was lucky enough
to do the first run on Le Buet.

88
00:42:57.668 --> 00:42:59.084
I was watching his line.

89
00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:02.793
It was amazing. fantastic conditions.
really stable snow.

90
00:43:02.918 --> 00:43:04.418
He just let himself go.

91
00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:22.959
It's pretty impressive today.

92
00:43:23.084 --> 00:43:26.084
But I'd rather be in my machine
than down there.

93
00:43:37.001 --> 00:43:39.584
Seb. I think we should go there.

94
00:43:39.709 --> 00:43:41.959
Sure. Thierry. I'm on my way.

95
00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:46.793
I just saw Wille and Matt riding
and they blew my mind.

96
00:44:46.918 --> 00:44:49.001
They did some crazy lines.

97
00:44:49.126 --> 00:44:52.959
It's nothing like the freeriding
I know. it's not the same sport.

98
00:44:53.084 --> 00:44:57.626
You've got all these huge faces.
drops of over 800 meters.

99
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:03.376
I've never done freeriding
like this before. It's spectacular.

100
00:45:10.043 --> 00:45:12.876
All I wanted was for it to be my turn.

101
00:46:50.001 --> 00:46:53.751
Made it! Second run. We're
getting closer to last year's line.

102
00:46:53.876 --> 00:46:55.918
We'll end up going there. I think.

103
00:49:31.959 --> 00:49:34.793
It was my turn.
I was at the top of the face.

104
00:49:34.918 --> 00:49:38.918
It felt weird
being in the same place as last year

105
00:49:39.043 --> 00:49:42.584
and about to do the line
where I broke my back.

106
00:49:51.543 --> 00:49:53.584
You need to focus on the line.

107
00:50:33.793 --> 00:50:36.376
There's so much going on in your head.

108
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:40.709
If you're not focused on the line
you can't do it. you can't ride.

109
00:52:32.543 --> 00:52:37.043
It's the only time in my life
that I've seen conditions like that.

110
00:52:37.168 --> 00:52:39.418
All that snow and so stable.

111
00:52:39.543 --> 00:52:43.543
It was incredible. I don't know
if we'll ever see that again.

112
00:59:11.918 --> 00:59:13.459
Have you seen those waves?

113
00:59:13.584 --> 00:59:16.709
Karsten's with us in Tahiti now.

114
00:59:16.834 --> 00:59:21.918
He took us surfing in freezing water.
I couldn't tell you how cold it was.

115
00:59:23.168 --> 00:59:24.418
Now he's in Tahiti

116
00:59:24.543 --> 00:59:30.293
it's our turn. with Tika.
to show him our daily routine.

117
01:00:07.543 --> 01:00:10.084
Filming <i>La Nuit de la Glisse</i>
every year

118
01:00:10.209 --> 01:00:11.876
is a huge pleasure for us

119
01:00:12.001 --> 01:00:16.668
because we've built up
some really strong friendships.

120
01:03:11.418 --> 01:03:13.501
Teahupoo is the village where I live.

121
01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:18.251
I do most of my surfing there.
It's where my best surf spots are.

122
01:03:19.543 --> 01:03:22.709
I grew up in this environment.

123
01:03:24.876 --> 01:03:30.084
In 2015
I won the Tube of the Year award

124
01:03:30.209 --> 01:03:31.709
in front of my idols.

125
01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:34.918
which was so cool.

126
01:03:35.043 --> 01:03:37.251
Thanks to Teahupoo

127
01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:42.459
all the best surfers in the world
have heard about us

128
01:03:42.584 --> 01:03:46.668
and when they come to Tahiti
they know who I am and who Tika is.

129
01:04:08.543 --> 01:04:13.126
In April 2011 there was a massive
swell. the first one I'd ever seen.

130
01:04:13.251 --> 01:04:16.584
I was swimming in the sea
and there were tow-in waves.

131
01:04:18.793 --> 01:04:22.334
I got hit on the head
by one of the biggest waves.

132
01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:26.084
There was another one behind it.
then another one.

133
01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:33.668
I couldn't reach the lagoon because
I was trapped in the impact zone.

134
01:04:33.793 --> 01:04:36.293
As the last wave came
I fell and I thought.

135
01:04:36.418 --> 01:04:40.584
"You've got no strength left.
you can't even dive or swim.

136
01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:42.626
"Just give up."

137
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:44.584
I was absolutely done in.

138
01:04:44.709 --> 01:04:46.668
Then the water patrol came.

139
01:04:46.793 --> 01:04:50.334
I was floating on the surface
and they grabbed me.

140
01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:54.668
I coughed up blood. I opened my eyes
but everything was white.

141
01:04:54.793 --> 01:04:57.084
I was in Teahupoo.
where the boats are.

142
01:04:57.209 --> 01:04:59.543
but I didn't know where I was.

143
01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:09.584
I couldn't speak for a few hours.
I just cried. I was in a bad way.

144
01:05:10.626 --> 01:05:12.001
And my big brother said.

145
01:05:12.126 --> 01:05:14.918
"Either you go back to Teahupoo

146
01:05:15.043 --> 01:05:18.459
"knowing that nothing
can be worse than this.

147
01:05:18.584 --> 01:05:21.209
"or you don't go back to Teahupoo."

148
01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.543
That's when I got it about big waves.

149
01:05:24.668 --> 01:05:29.918
I want to surf the biggest waves
in the world. that's my goal.

150
01:05:32.668 --> 01:05:36.168
A massive swell was forecast
for Hawaii.

151
01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:40.126
When I got to the Jaws break I was
scared but couldn't wait to surf.

152
01:05:40.251 --> 01:05:44.709
It was huge.
between 12 and 15 meters high.

153
01:05:55.001 --> 01:05:57.001
When you surf dangerous waves.

154
01:05:57.126 --> 01:06:00.168
your line is very important.

155
01:06:00.293 --> 01:06:03.501
That's what has made
a lot of surfers successful.

156
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:07.001
They approached one single wave
in a particular way

157
01:06:07.126 --> 01:06:12.626
and now they're renowned
for being great surfers.

158
01:06:51.209 --> 01:06:54.459
As we crossed over to the peninsula

159
01:06:54.584 --> 01:07:00.376
we noticed a track of foam
breaking behind us

160
01:07:00.501 --> 01:07:02.668
and knew there would be big waves.

161
01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:09.084
We went straight into the water.

162
01:08:14.668 --> 01:08:18.209
We realized that surfing
would be quite tricky.

163
01:08:18.334 --> 01:08:20.543
You needed good positioning.

164
01:08:20.668 --> 01:08:25.834
You'd either come out smiling
or come out injured.

165
01:08:27.251 --> 01:08:30.376
There's always danger.
it never goes away.

166
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:32.376
There's a meter of water

167
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:37.418
and if you fall you're going
to hit the reef sooner or later.

168
01:08:37.543 --> 01:08:40.043
You can see it on our skin now.

169
01:08:40.168 --> 01:08:45.334
I've got scars everywhere. on my arms.
on my back. sometimes even on my face.

170
01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:48.668
It comes with the territory.

171
01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:21.543
I think there are three levels
when you practice sport.

172
01:10:21.668 --> 01:10:23.543
There's a physical level.

173
01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:28.626
You usually focus most on this. with
training playing an important part.

174
01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:31.751
but you reach a point
where your body gets tired.

175
01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:43.876
Then mental strength takes over.

176
01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:48.209
the willpower which helps you
to push yourself

177
01:10:48.334 --> 01:10:51.626
beyond this physical fatigue.

178
01:11:16.751 --> 01:11:22.251
If you don't give up. a kind of
spiritual energy comes into play.

179
01:11:22.376 --> 01:11:27.168
giving you the strength you need

180
01:11:27.293 --> 01:11:30.126
to reach your goal.

181
01:11:34.043 --> 01:11:37.043
We are able to live
in a space between life and death

182
01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:40.043
which gives us immense freedom.

183
01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:16.334
I'm a child of the sea.

184
01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:19.584
I feel more at home
in the sea than on land.

185
01:12:23.584 --> 01:12:26.959
I've felt like a child of the sea
ever since I was little.

186
01:12:27.084 --> 01:12:30.251
When I'm in the water
I feel free and happy.

187
01:12:42.918 --> 01:12:45.626
I met Jesse Richman a few years ago.

188
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:52.376
He's an amazing guy because he's
always so positive. always smiling.

189
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:57.168
He's got this incredible calmness
and fantastic energy.

190
01:13:43.584 --> 01:13:48.668
It's wonderful being able to share
magical moments in the water.

191
01:13:48.793 --> 01:13:54.251
Yesterday we did a dive at the
drop-off beyond the reef with Jesse

192
01:13:54.376 --> 01:13:57.418
as a practice for my next competition.

193
01:14:39.959 --> 01:14:43.709
I've always been really moved
ever since I first heard them.

194
01:16:12.251 --> 01:16:15.793
Look. 100 meters. 200 meters.

195
01:16:15.918 --> 01:16:18.168
- 200 meters.
- 100 with the whale calf.

196
01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:22.543
Wow. it's the same one as just now.

197
01:16:23.126 --> 01:16:27.793
We're in September. one of the seasons
for whales here in Polynesia.

198
01:16:27.918 --> 01:16:30.043
They come to Polynesia to give birth.

199
01:16:30.751 --> 01:16:33.459
It's a great source of pride
for us Tahitians.

200
01:17:46.001 --> 01:17:49.084
I tried to approach
as softly as I could

201
01:17:49.209 --> 01:17:53.959
to show that I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

202
01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:57.084
It was such an incredible feeling.

203
01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:07.418
I talked to a shaman a few years ago

204
01:18:07.543 --> 01:18:11.251
and she told me
I was a whale in a previous life.

205
01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:15.459
I didn't know
whether to believe her or not.

206
01:18:31.334 --> 01:18:37.168
I think the mother let her calf
play with me.

207
01:18:37.293 --> 01:18:41.584
He became interested in my movements
and started playing with me.

208
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:44.459
It really was an incredible feeling.

209
01:19:35.876 --> 01:19:39.043
I think we athletes have a mission

210
01:19:39.168 --> 01:19:42.709
to inspire young people

211
01:19:42.834 --> 01:19:45.876
to become passionate
about sport and nature.

212
01:19:46.001 --> 01:19:50.918
It's very important
to respect our planet nowadays.

213
01:19:51.043 --> 01:19:54.918
Those of us who are privileged
enough to explore its depths

214
01:19:55.043 --> 01:19:58.084
understand how important it is
to respect it.

215
01:27:48.376 --> 01:27:53.293
I'd have liked to do a run. for sure.
But we are working. you know!
