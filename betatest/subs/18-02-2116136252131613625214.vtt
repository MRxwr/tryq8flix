00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.417
Him again

2
00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:43.459
What's he up to?

3
00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:45.416
I've sent you the data link.

4
00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:46.209
Let's go

5
00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:47.042
COPY

6
00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:58.084
This is the China Air Force

7
00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:00.625
You're entering Chinese airspace

8
00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:04.916
Please indicate your nationality.
ID and purpose of your flight

9
00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.751
Change course immediately

10
00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:08.626
I can't hear you

11
00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.166
I can't hear you

12
00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:11.959
Stop pretending you don't understand

13
00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:14.750
Save it. words are no use

14
00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:15.667
how about this

15
00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.625
His English is getting a little better. isn't it?

16
00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:24.625
Maybe he got himself a tutor.

17
00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:25.834
Continue surveillance.

18
00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:29.834
Hey these guys can stick with us
til the day I learn Chinese.

19
00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:33.667
Watch out! Avert!

20
00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:36.626
You're just asking for it!

21
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:38.251
Keep on him.

22
00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:50.376
Where is the other guy?

23
00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:58.875
You're entering Chinese Air Space

24
00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:00.541
- Change course. change course
- Son of a bitch

25
00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:02.834
Looks like someone's gonna be learning Chinese.

26
00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.416
What? You like this guy now?

27
00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:05.916
He is kind of cute.

28
00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.084
Cuter than you.

29
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:10.834
Your maneuvers reminded me of a movie.

30
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.834
Shut up. We're Chinese Air Force.

31
00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:16.416
Sky Hunter. this is Red Shore. Mission complete.

32
00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:17.251
Return to base

33
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:20.916
Two unidentified aircraft
approaching at high speed

34
00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:22.208
from your <i>2</i> 0-clock.

35
00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:23.501
Stay alert

36
00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.376
What do they want?

37
00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:27.209
Unfriendless. Be ready.

38
00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:40.666
Bandits 12 o'clock. 2 miles

39
00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.125
co-altitude. cold

40
00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:43.291
Let's show force

41
00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:45.084
They've locked on. Evading!

42
00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.958
They've gone too far.

43
00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.208
Teach them a lesson.

44
00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:56.251
Got it.

45
00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:03.001
Blind Blind.

46
00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:04.376
Keep radar tracking.

47
00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:15.834
I saw it. here it is. there's only one plane.

48
00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:30.167
See you in the next life!

49
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.250
Shit. 6 o'clock.

50
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:34.334
chaff flares. chaff flares!

51
00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:40.375
Drop fuel tanks. drop fuel tanks.

52
00:05:40.376 --> 00:05:42.542
it's not fun anymore. let's get out of here.

53
00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.376
Leaving so soon?

54
00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:51.583
How about that!

55
00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.875
Anything just to feel alive!

56
00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:54.334
Be rude not to give some back.

57
00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:55.917
All done!

58
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:40.750
South-east entrance in 25 meters

59
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:42.666
Control room. north-east corner.

60
00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.209
You'll have to go the long way around

61
00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:46.334
But I just go through this window

62
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.166
and straight on to the target

63
00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:49.001
because I can fly.

64
00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:50.251
Just open the door!

65
00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.376
Are you done?

66
00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:00.501
Don't rush me.

67
00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:02.041
I don't mean to. but someone's coming.

68
00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:03.126
Stall him.

69
00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:04.792
Huh? How can I stall him?

70
00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:09.751
Ooh! Shit.

71
00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:15.459
It's too late.

72
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.708
If your number's up. it's up.

73
00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:18.001
See you in the next life!

74
00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:22.167
Oh man!

75
00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:24.709
Are you OK?

76
00:07:25.292 --> 00:07:25.876
Ha ha. sorry pal.

77
00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:36.791
Kill the alarm! Get me outta here.

78
00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.584
Exit trough

79
00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:42.167
Go that way. There's nobody there.

80
00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:54.958
Did a dog eat your brains?

81
00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:56.500
You said there was no one there!

82
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:57.792
I meant no human!

83
00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:21.000
Our mission was to get the enemy's information.

84
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.792
They didn't say to bring back a pet!

85
00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:40.250
The last rescue mission didn't get everyone clear

86
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:41.708
We think they're trapped in the building.

87
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:43.666
Another landslide
could take the building at anytime.

88
00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:44.917
Its extremely dangerous

89
00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:53.917
The Wind's too strong

90
00:08:53.918 --> 00:08:55.209
I'm not sure this bird can take it.

91
00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:58.251
Hold on

92
00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:06.209
Watch out for the...

93
00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:26.917
Please! Help!

94
00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:27.792
Found them.

95
00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.250
We're down here!

96
00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:31.458
Command center. come in

97
00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:32.958
How long until the landslide hits?

98
00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:34.583
Rain getting heavier upstream.

99
00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:36.708
means you've probably got about 5 minutes.

100
00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.708
Yali. the stairs have collapsed

101
00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:40.126
We don't have the conditions for landing

102
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.667
There's no time. Hover here.

103
00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:47.876
Prepare for rescue.

104
00:09:47.877 --> 00:09:50.001
Rescue has priority.
but your safety's important too

105
00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:51.916
There's no telling what might happen

106
00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:52.876
If there's a sudden change

107
00:09:52.877 --> 00:09:54.167
you're life could be at risk

108
00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:56.334
Worse than my Morn.

109
00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:20.458
Where are you?

110
00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:21.751
Call out to me

111
00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:23.834
We're in here

112
00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:25.709
Please help us

113
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.626
In here

114
00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:29.834
In here. in here

115
00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.292
The door is stuck and we can't get out.

116
00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:36.167
It still won't budge

117
00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:39.126
Stay calm. take care of the kid

118
00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:45.334
Stand back

119
00:10:46.584 --> 00:10:47.791
Yali. what's going on?

120
00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:48.875
The landslide's almost on you

121
00:10:48.876 --> 00:10:49.584
Hurry.

122
00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:58.459
OK. the kid first

123
00:10:58.709 --> 00:10:59.542
Careful now

124
00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:02.251
Hold on tight

125
00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:04.667
The hillside's crumbling.
that building's gonna go soon

126
00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:09.751
Bring her down

127
00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:11.084
We're coming out

128
00:11:11.167 --> 00:11:11.834
COPY

129
00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:22.209
Faster. faster. faster

130
00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:27.959
Now!

131
00:12:16.292 --> 00:12:17.709
I've flown for 30 years

132
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:20.416
I used to be where you are

133
00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:21.834
Below the podium

134
00:12:22.251 --> 00:12:24.376
Witnessing a former generation's heroes

135
00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.459
farewell the blue skies. with great honor

136
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:32.876
But I never let myself think of
when my day would come

137
00:12:35.459 --> 00:12:37.292
The sky is always for new fighters

138
00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:41.167
New pilots to be trained up and sent up

139
00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:44.667
It's time to pass these blue skies
into your ready hands.

140
00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:46.959
But it's hard to say goodbye.

141
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.209
Because the life stories

142
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:51.792
of my generation

143
00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:55.084
are written in these skies

144
00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:57.875
Every flight path we left up there

145
00:12:57.876 --> 00:12:59.917
testifies our devotion to

146
00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:01.917
protecting of our country's air space

147
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:04.083
Even these last few days

148
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:05.958
- Your goddess.
- as I laid in bed at home.

149
00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:08.251
- Cut it out!
- I kept listening to the radio transmissions

150
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.125
It was quite impressive. How he got from

151
00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:13.334
their 9 to their 6 before they
even knew what happened.

152
00:13:15.001 --> 00:13:15.792
Am I awesome?

153
00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:16.667
Yes. Sir!

154
00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:17.959
How about you?

155
00:13:19.084 --> 00:13:20.250
Are you awesome too?

156
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:21.334
Yes. Sir!

157
00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:22.626
That's right.

158
00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:25.667
You're even better than me.

159
00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:28.458
Every time I look at you

160
00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:30.167
I am honestly astounded

161
00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:32.001
not only because of your courage.

162
00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:33.917
your skill.

163
00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:35.126
actions

164
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:36.292
and thought

165
00:13:37.834 --> 00:13:38.667
but because

166
00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:41.959
the blood that beats in your veins
beats in time with this new era

167
00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:45.334
yours is new blood fit
for a new generation of fighter planes

168
00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:47.167
And because you are better

169
00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:48.876
more perfect

170
00:13:49.584 --> 00:13:51.000
and used to succeeding

171
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:52.001
there is something

172
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:54.126
that I must tell you all today

173
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.500
You all need to be prepared

174
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:58.417
not only to meet with victory

175
00:13:59.584 --> 00:14:01.376
but also to face your failures

176
00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:05.501
This is the true greatness of a soldier

177
00:14:05.751 --> 00:14:07.667
You must learn to treat the skies with reverence

178
00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:09.376
This is the only way

179
00:14:09.834 --> 00:14:12.459
can you shoulder the responsibility.

180
00:14:13.376 --> 00:14:14.459
All rise!

181
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.459
Salute.

182
00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:23.084
At ease.

183
00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:24.542
Sit.

184
00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:31.834
My dear wife.

185
00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:37.126
Thank you for all your understanding
and support all these years

186
00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:38.792
In my heart. you

187
00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:41.376
Will always be my true blue sky

188
00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:04.208
Three. two. one.

189
00:15:04.209 --> 00:15:06.251
cheese.

190
00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:09.500
Another. another. get us in too

191
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:11.208
Is it a selfie? Voice-activated.

192
00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:11.917
OK.

193
00:15:11.918 --> 00:15:13.833
Right. ready? 3. 2...

194
00:15:13.834 --> 00:15:15.125
Mr. Lu's handsome. yeah?

195
00:15:15.126 --> 00:15:16.209
Yeah!

196
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.626
OK. come here. Have a look.

197
00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:21.001
Yali

198
00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:22.083
How is it? Show me

199
00:15:22.084 --> 00:15:22.709
How's it look?

200
00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:24.126
Very nice!

201
00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:24.751
Mr Lu looks great

202
00:15:24.752 --> 00:15:26.166
Why didn't you smile. Mr Lu?

203
00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:27.251
I smiled

204
00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:30.626
That's a good one

205
00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:43.334
I think Yali's even better looking
than she was at flight school

206
00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.126
What's it to you. anyway?

207
00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:47.541
You'd better send me that photo

208
00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:48.791
Who needs photos when she's right here?

209
00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:50.709
Stop kidding. I'm being serious

210
00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:52.084
I even think

211
00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:53.459
Maybe Yali has a crush on you

212
00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:56.709
I'm going left. pulling up

213
00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:26.334
Can you tell me where the world full of flowers is?

214
00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:33.292
If it's a real place then
I will find a way to get there.

215
00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:39.500
I have never given up on what I believe

216
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:44.667
Even when days were full of melancholy

217
00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:48.959
Stop staring

218
00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:51.542
This is the best chance you've ever had

219
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:55.167
Why do I feel like you're a total imbecile?

220
00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:02.167
Only you can determine your fate!

221
00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:18.791
Fate will never leave us grovelling for mercy

222
00:17:18.792 --> 00:17:25.167
We'll embrace through the blood. sweat and tears

223
00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:32.042
No compromise through the years

224
00:17:38.126 --> 00:17:38.667
Have some more.

225
00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:39.667
There's a fruit tart.

226
00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:42.292
These two pieces of cake are enough for me

227
00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:43.626
I'm right behind you

228
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:45.084
- I'll just grab these two
- OK. I'll wait over there

229
00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:50.667
Though time goes by

230
00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:52.334
We'll never part

231
00:17:57.584 --> 00:17:59.042
Can't believe. after so many years

232
00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:01.084
You're still looking as great as ever

233
00:18:02.209 --> 00:18:03.876
As I listened to you sing that song

234
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.917
It was like my 18 year old self
was brought back to life

235
00:18:08.626 --> 00:18:09.751
You know. it's like

236
00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:11.959
once you've been through the struggles
as comrades in arms

237
00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:13.834
no matter how much time passes

238
00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:15.584
that sense of affection

239
00:18:16.126 --> 00:18:17.834
it never really changes

240
00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:20.167
You are...

241
00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:22.376
Wu Di.

242
00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:24.376
Who Di?

243
00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:28.376
Wu Di. we were classmates. In Mr. Lu's class.

244
00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:29.959
I don't remember

245
00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:33.250
Yali. come on now!

246
00:18:33.251 --> 00:18:35.792
You sang the same song at our graduation ceremony

247
00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:38.001
You wore a red dress

248
00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.126
Yeah

249
00:18:39.127 --> 00:18:40.709
And someone smeared cake on your face?

250
00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:42.501
Who did that?

251
00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:43.459
Me!

252
00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:45.209
Damn right it was you!

253
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:48.209
Hey. you there!

254
00:18:49.751 --> 00:18:50.584
Is that you. Yali?

255
00:18:50.585 --> 00:18:52.251
Keep it UP

256
00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:54.542
How have you been. bro?

257
00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:58.251
Long time no see.

258
00:19:05.626 --> 00:19:06.459
<i>Yaâ.</i>

259
00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:09.166
I thought I taught you everything

260
00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:10.875
Yet you still don't remember not
to offend women. did you?

261
00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:11.667
Mr. Lu.

262
00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:14.000
You wanted to fly overseas. its been approved

263
00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:15.292
It's good pay. don't spend it all

264
00:19:16.084 --> 00:19:17.208
Do drop by before you leave

265
00:19:17.209 --> 00:19:18.667
My wife wants a proper send-off

266
00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:20.583
For sure. I'll drop by

267
00:19:20.584 --> 00:19:22.584
Mr. Lu. what are you going to do?

268
00:19:23.417 --> 00:19:24.584
There's many ways to fly

269
00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:26.876
UAV's are also aircraft. right?

270
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.292
Can't wipe it off. hey?

271
00:19:34.376 --> 00:19:36.626
When did you make this decision?

272
00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.292
A while ago.

273
00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:41.709
I wasn't sure it'd go through.
so I didn't tell you.

274
00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:44.709
Flying overseas

275
00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:46.542
You didn't even run it by me?

276
00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:49.626
It's not like you're my guardian

277
00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:51.916
I'm...

278
00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:53.334
Then what am I to you?

279
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:56.709
You're like my brother

280
00:19:57.292 --> 00:19:59.417
have been since we graduated from flight school.

281
00:20:00.417 --> 00:20:01.834
But I've thought this through

282
00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:03.917
I want a different kind of life

283
00:20:05.126 --> 00:20:06.834
You can find another wingman.

284
00:20:07.209 --> 00:20:09.084
Not just anyone can be my wingman

285
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.167
We've always been the best of thenpilots

286
00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:13.292
If you give up now. you'll regret it

287
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:14.459
The best.

288
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:17.126
there can only be one

289
00:20:18.501 --> 00:20:19.542
It's you.

290
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:24.626
This again.

291
00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:29.917
All dynamic duos have a hero and a sidekick

292
00:20:31.376 --> 00:20:32.792
One of them has to pay the price

293
00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:36.459
Just like you and Yali.

294
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:39.041
All these years

295
00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:40.334
both of you so proud

296
00:20:40.751 --> 00:20:42.292
you never managed to get together

297
00:20:43.667 --> 00:20:45.542
That isn't even the same thing!

298
00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:48.459
If you are my brother. you'll respect my decisions

299
00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.126
Hey. What's with you two?

300
00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.667
We're leaving.

301
00:20:54.042 --> 00:20:55.126
We'd better get moving.

302
00:20:59.959 --> 00:21:00.709
Let's go.

303
00:21:03.584 --> 00:21:04.626
Not me.

304
00:21:05.626 --> 00:21:06.792
It's your time.

305
00:21:22.417 --> 00:21:25.084
Sky Hunter is our airforce's covert unit.

306
00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:27.709
We exist to hone airforce combat-readiness

307
00:21:28.167 --> 00:21:30.417
We represent the airforce elite

308
00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:33.875
Those we have defeated gave us a name

309
00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.667
Battlefield Grindstone

310
00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:37.084
Joining Sky Hunter

311
00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:39.541
requires you to pay a price.

312
00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:40.833
Once you're in.

313
00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:43.958
your current positions including all benefits

314
00:21:43.959 --> 00:21:44.751
will be forfeit

315
00:21:45.334 --> 00:21:47.250
You'll be leaving your comfort zone

316
00:21:47.251 --> 00:21:49.459
Taking on the most dangerous missions

317
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:51.041
and challenges

318
00:21:51.042 --> 00:21:52.542
You'll only have each other

319
00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:54.334
and the possibility of death.

320
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:57.000
You can still change your mind.

321
00:21:57.001 --> 00:21:58.959
just turn around now and leave

322
00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:01.001
Smoke and mirrors

323
00:22:11.792 --> 00:22:13.209
All of you

324
00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:15.876
were handpicked by me from the airforce's elite

325
00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:19.251
I have brought you all together here

326
00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:22.667
to undergo my personal stringent selection

327
00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:25.626
Personally. I'm your biggest fan

328
00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:29.542
I love seeing your faces full of such confidence

329
00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:31.751
your pride

330
00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:33.959
that you think you're all that

331
00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:37.209
Now I look forward to seeing what you're made of

332
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:41.626
This might be the only pleasure I derive.
in this wilderness

333
00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:45.334
lam the head of Sky Hunter Special Brigade

334
00:22:45.626 --> 00:22:46.958
My name

335
00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:48.042
Ling Weifeng.

336
00:23:51.751 --> 00:23:52.626
Look at this place!

337
00:23:53.292 --> 00:23:55.208
It's made to withstand a third world war!

338
00:23:55.209 --> 00:23:57.291
It's 3 kilometers walk to the valley

339
00:23:57.292 --> 00:24:00.750
You are now entering a top secret military facility

340
00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:03.833
If you're not up to the task. go no further

341
00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:04.542
Remember.

342
00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.792
this place doesn't exist.

343
00:24:10.501 --> 00:24:11.334
Your ID

344
00:24:15.917 --> 00:24:17.792
Hey. that photo there. can I take it with me?

345
00:24:23.042 --> 00:24:23.834
Yes.

346
00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:27.834
You can't take your phone or wallet with you

347
00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:33.916
That. you may as well leave behind

348
00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:35.501
For sure won't be needing it

349
00:24:36.459 --> 00:24:38.416
This was assigned to me by my troop

350
00:24:38.417 --> 00:24:39.709
What troop are you from?

351
00:24:40.042 --> 00:24:41.501
So considerate.

352
00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:44.417
Field Troop issue for emergency use

353
00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:46.708
For water storage and sand-proofing

354
00:24:46.709 --> 00:24:47.959
I know that.

355
00:24:49.542 --> 00:24:51.416
Books are the stairway to enlightenment

356
00:24:51.417 --> 00:24:53.000
Ebooks are like an elevator

357
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:53.959
Not allowed

358
00:24:55.417 --> 00:24:56.001
Anything else?

359
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:56.959
No.

360
00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:00.625
What is this?

361
00:25:00.626 --> 00:25:01.917
Cold medicine.

362
00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:12.542
Do you want to keep this picture too?

363
00:25:21.459 --> 00:25:22.833
Helicopter pilot Zhao Yali.

364
00:25:22.834 --> 00:25:23.958

365
00:25:23.959 --> 00:25:25.083

Qinghua Degree in Data Security and Automation

371
00:25:31.959 --> 00:25:34.041
Good with guns. combat. and explosives

372
00:25:34.042 --> 00:25:36.708
Unfamiliar terrain and complex weather
conditions are no problem

373
00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:39.791
Sky Hunter needs a tech-savvy
and multitalented person like myself

374
00:25:39.792 --> 00:25:40.667
I'm confident I'll pass

375
00:25:40.876 --> 00:25:41.792
and be a Sky Hunter

376
00:25:42.042 --> 00:25:43.042
I've come here

377
00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.833
to become the best pilot I can be.

378
00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:46.333
I can handle all kinds of weather

379
00:25:46.334 --> 00:25:48.083
proficient in 3 types of jets.

380
00:25:48.084 --> 00:25:48.876
I have been awarded...

381
00:25:48.877 --> 00:25:51.416
You pulled off an expulsion mission out at sea

382
00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:53.042
a few days ago. right?

383
00:25:53.626 --> 00:25:56.376
As far as I'm concerned. that was a piece of cake.

384
00:25:56.709 --> 00:25:57.542
Not even worth mentioning

385
00:25:57.542 --> 00:25:58.251
After all. at the time...

386
00:25:58.251 --> 00:25:59.042
Alright

387
00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:05.709
Even though I don't know what I'm doing here

388
00:26:05.792 --> 00:26:06.875
I just want to say

389
00:26:06.876 --> 00:26:08.708
every second spent on the ground

390
00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:10.834
I consider a waste of my time.

391
00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:12.292
Tell me

392
00:26:12.584 --> 00:26:13.876
when can I get in a plane?

393
00:26:17.251 --> 00:26:17.834
Right now.

394
00:26:18.917 --> 00:26:20.209
I've got this

395
00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:25.251
I can do it. I can

396
00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:29.709
Ling Weifeng.

397
00:26:30.126 --> 00:26:31.126
F...

398
00:26:31.542 --> 00:26:33.167
This is training for survival

399
00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:36.250
You're a pilot. downed behind enemy lines

400
00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:38.458
You need to get to the assigned rendezvous point

401
00:26:38.459 --> 00:26:40.626
There'll be a rescue squad waiting for you.

402
00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:44.709
Turn on your Beidou Navigation
and Positioning System when needed

403
00:26:44.876 --> 00:26:46.542
Only your rescue team will be

404
00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:48.084
able to see your location

405
00:26:48.209 --> 00:26:49.416
Up until then.

406
00:26:49.417 --> 00:26:52.667
you'd better make sure you're not captured
by the pursuing enemy.

407
00:26:58.542 --> 00:26:59.625
Rescue One. Rescue One.

408
00:26:59.626 --> 00:27:00.958
Do you copy? Do you copy.

409
00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:02.001
Reading you loud and clear

410
00:27:02.084 --> 00:27:04.334
My current position is S1H45

411
00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:06.209
After the pilot reaches the ground

412
00:27:06.376 --> 00:27:08.709
they should maintain radio silence

413
00:27:08.876 --> 00:27:11.001
until reaching the planned time and location

414
00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:12.876
to avoid discovery by the enemy

415
00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:15.876
This is a perfect example of how to fail

416
00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:18.001
It seems this guy can disappear

417
00:27:19.876 --> 00:27:21.959
But it shows the signal at this location

418
00:27:34.292 --> 00:27:35.917
Here's the signal source we've been tracking

419
00:27:55.126 --> 00:27:56.251
So sneaky

420
00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:03.625
They still managed to find me

421
00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:05.250
Based on Wu Di's landing position

422
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:06.626
the rate at which he's moving

423
00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:08.459
and my calculations of the terrain

424
00:28:08.501 --> 00:28:10.084
the rescue team should pick him up here

425
00:28:18.084 --> 00:28:19.417
Why the random running?

426
00:28:20.584 --> 00:28:21.542
Cap'n Ling

427
00:28:21.543 --> 00:28:24.167
Wu Di'd be dead by now
if it was the real battlefield. right?

428
00:28:25.251 --> 00:28:27.208
I thought the Golden Helmet was a real big deal.

429
00:28:27.209 --> 00:28:28.751
He lost it in such a short time

430
00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:29.959
Crazy

431
00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:33.959
He's up to something

432
00:29:08.959 --> 00:29:10.042
That'll do it.

433
00:29:17.584 --> 00:29:20.375
Rescue Two continue on to the planned
rescue point.

434
00:29:20.376 --> 00:29:21.709
I have a new location

435
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:28.291
Show me Wu Di's Beidou signal trajectory

436
00:29:28.292 --> 00:29:29.376
Yes. sir.

437
00:29:31.626 --> 00:29:32.626
Zoom in.

438
00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:34.834
A bit more.

439
00:29:36.251 --> 00:29:37.626
What is he doing

440
00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:39.417
He was writing with his navigator

441
00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:46.291
Nanshan south

442
00:29:46.292 --> 00:29:47.292
I'm here.

443
00:30:02.751 --> 00:30:04.209
I'm the man!

444
00:30:11.917 --> 00:30:13.001
Buddy

445
00:30:16.834 --> 00:30:18.459
You're quite the runner

446
00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:19.834
Running Man?

447
00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:22.001
I count three mistakes you made

448
00:30:22.084 --> 00:30:22.626
One

449
00:30:22.627 --> 00:30:24.375
You threw away all your comms devices

450
00:30:24.376 --> 00:30:24.792
Two

451
00:30:24.793 --> 00:30:25.833
You left behind a trail

452
00:30:25.834 --> 00:30:27.125
made with your own footprints

453
00:30:27.126 --> 00:30:28.167
Three

454
00:30:30.876 --> 00:30:31.792
See for yourself

455
00:30:31.793 --> 00:30:33.208
The command center sent us this

456
00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:36.084
Using your nav to send a location
Props for thinking of that

457
00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.416
Your guys are cheaters!

458
00:30:37.417 --> 00:30:38.876
Need eyes in the back of your head

459
00:30:39.084 --> 00:30:40.876
Welcome to Sky Hunter.

460
00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:42.251
Surrender

461
00:30:59.876 --> 00:31:02.251
Yali. that was perfect

462
00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:06.458
Emergency rescue code states

463
00:31:06.459 --> 00:31:08.416
until your identity is confirmed

464
00:31:08.417 --> 00:31:09.626
you must be treated as hostile

465
00:31:12.001 --> 00:31:12.876
Nice

466
00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:21.709
Admit it. you want to be taken too.

467
00:31:31.459 --> 00:31:33.750
With fresh air and sunshine like this

468
00:31:33.751 --> 00:31:37.583
This assignment is turning out
to be like heaven on earth for me.

469
00:31:37.584 --> 00:31:38.916
And I gotta tell ya

470
00:31:38.917 --> 00:31:39.709
You and Ya Li

471
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.416
had better start picking up the pace

472
00:31:41.417 --> 00:31:42.666
Don't let me beat you to it

473
00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:45.625
Cause I plan on being surrounded
by a brood of mixed-blood kids soon.

474
00:31:45.626 --> 00:31:46.666
In short.

475
00:31:46.667 --> 00:31:48.083
Don't be too envious

476
00:31:48.084 --> 00:31:50.417
Don't be jealous of me and don't miss me too much.

477
00:31:50.751 --> 00:31:53.251
You need to focus on you and Yali...

478
00:31:54.709 --> 00:31:55.709
Just a minute

479
00:31:59.209 --> 00:31:59.917
This is war!

480
00:32:06.334 --> 00:32:07.791
Hi. Can anyone see me?

481
00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:10.376
Are you the friend Uncle Haochen talks about?

482
00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.584
510p

483
00:32:19.792 --> 00:32:21.167
Duoduo. Xiaoqing.

484
00:32:21.292 --> 00:32:22.625
- Are you making mischief again?
- Come on.

485
00:32:22.626 --> 00:32:24.626
Run for it. I'll cover you.

486
00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:26.667
Run faster.

487
00:33:23.792 --> 00:33:25.251
Not brute force

488
00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:27.501
This takes smarts

489
00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:14.751
<i>Yaâ.</i>

490
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:21.417
catching you

491
00:35:21.959 --> 00:35:22.959
is really hard

492
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.751
But you did catch me in the end

493
00:35:55.001 --> 00:35:56.792
Why did you join the Sky Hunters

494
00:35:57.084 --> 00:35:58.167
Because

495
00:36:00.167 --> 00:36:02.459
I want to become a better pilot

496
00:36:07.167 --> 00:36:08.792
And why else?

497
00:36:14.792 --> 00:36:16.333
Haochen.

498
00:36:16.334 --> 00:36:18.375
You were a fool

499
00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:22.042
To miss out on coming here!

500
00:36:30.542 --> 00:36:32.126
But no. there's another reason

501
00:36:32.292 --> 00:36:33.376
Another thing

502
00:36:33.542 --> 00:36:34.792
It's fine

503
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:37.042
Forget it.

504
00:37:02.334 --> 00:37:03.875
Come on.

505
00:37:03.876 --> 00:37:05.667
Get up here!

506
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:37.001
Flying. Flying.

507
00:37:40.334 --> 00:37:44.751
My comrade named this tatic
the marsh mellow tatic.

508
00:37:45.584 --> 00:37:49.708
Now. I must not forget my comrade.

509
00:37:49.709 --> 00:37:51.416
He is my best friend.

510
00:37:51.417 --> 00:37:54.084
And he knows me better than my girlfriend.

511
00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:57.834
even though I don't have a girlfriend yet.

512
00:38:00.376 --> 00:38:02.542
By the way. he is my wingman.

513
00:38:03.417 --> 00:38:06.583
Then I think to be a great fighter pilot.

514
00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:10.959
you must have a equally great relationship
with your wingman.

515
00:38:12.709 --> 00:38:13.417
Class is over.

516
00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:15.334
Good luck.

517
00:38:21.167 --> 00:38:22.709
Your class is very exciting.

518
00:38:22.959 --> 00:38:24.666
You are not only a good pilot

519
00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.376
also a good teacher.

520
00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:30.583
I have had a lot of flying experience.

521
00:38:30.584 --> 00:38:31.751
so I know a lot.

522
00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:35.542
But I still don't understand one point.

523
00:38:35.959 --> 00:38:37.084
Which point?

524
00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:41.459
The trainees said you used to be
a great fighter pilot

525
00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:44.917
and you don't understand such a simple tatic.

526
00:38:45.167 --> 00:38:46.626
I just don't understand

527
00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:48.292
when enemy found you

528
00:38:48.584 --> 00:38:51.209
and seized you at an excellent position
at 6 o'clock.

529
00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:54.792
why would they allow you to hide in the clouds?

530
00:38:57.417 --> 00:39:00.459
Your country haven't been
into a war for decades now.

531
00:39:01.417 --> 00:39:03.251
What if we start a war tomorrow?

532
00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:06.334
Are you guys even ready?

533
00:39:11.084 --> 00:39:12.750
I just assumed a situation.

534
00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:14.376
I don't mean to get trouble.

535
00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:17.667
See you the next day.

536
00:40:31.834 --> 00:40:34.209
Steady. Steady

537
00:40:41.001 --> 00:40:43.376
Go Go Go!

538
00:40:43.959 --> 00:40:45.125
Get 'em on the right

539
00:40:45.126 --> 00:40:46.834
They're getting away. shoot them

540
00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:54.626
- In here. in here
- Get me a perimeter

541
00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:19.251
- Help me.
- Get In the car.

542
00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:33.542
- Move. move. move. move
- Hurry up!

543
00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:35.959
Get on the ground

544
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.041
Nobody move! You move and I'll kill you

545
00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:38.834
It'll be alright

546
00:41:38.835 --> 00:41:40.584
Don't touch my baby. Don't touch

547
00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:41.834
Duoduo.

548
00:41:42.042 --> 00:41:42.876
Duoduo.

549
00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:43.792
Duoduo.

550
00:41:44.917 --> 00:41:45.751
Dad.

551
00:41:45.917 --> 00:41:47.042
Dad.

552
00:41:48.334 --> 00:41:49.251
Duoduo.

553
00:41:53.709 --> 00:41:54.833
Please.

554
00:41:54.834 --> 00:41:56.709
please don't kill my daughter.

555
00:42:09.459 --> 00:42:10.417
Don't move.

556
00:42:10.418 --> 00:42:11.834
I'll shoot you

557
00:42:15.709 --> 00:42:16.917
Let them go!

558
00:42:18.542 --> 00:42:19.751
Let them go!

559
00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:22.417
I'll shoot you

560
00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:23.459
Let them go!

561
00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:25.042
Shoot him!

562
00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:34.209
Let them go!

563
00:42:39.626 --> 00:42:41.334
If you want to save more lives.

564
00:42:42.167 --> 00:42:43.917
you'd better drop your gun.

565
00:42:49.584 --> 00:42:51.334
It has nothing to do with you.

566
00:42:52.376 --> 00:42:54.751
Dad.

567
00:42:57.667 --> 00:43:01.334
Dad.

568
00:43:09.584 --> 00:43:10.501
Duoduo.

569
00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.626
Duoduo.

570
00:43:21.876 --> 00:43:23.251
Hunter en route to target location

571
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:25.626
Hunter

572
00:43:25.834 --> 00:43:27.501
We are approaching target location

573
00:43:27.709 --> 00:43:28.584
COPY

574
00:43:33.042 --> 00:43:34.501
Approaching target location

575
00:43:35.167 --> 00:43:36.459
Switch target location

576
00:43:41.376 --> 00:43:42.001
Hunter

577
00:43:42.002 --> 00:43:43.251
You have a new target

578
00:43:43.417 --> 00:43:44.667
You have 200 seconds.

579
00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:46.209
Target has moved

580
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.876
New target is Point C. 5 clicks on vector 30

581
00:43:50.334 --> 00:43:52.001
Roger. Changing heading

582
00:44:00.459 --> 00:44:01.667
Pick up the pace

583
00:44:16.376 --> 00:44:17.167
Hunter Hunter

584
00:44:17.168 --> 00:44:19.791
You now have one hundred and fifty seconds

585
00:44:19.792 --> 00:44:21.208
Hunter. target confirmed

586
00:44:21.209 --> 00:44:22.376
Heading 1-3-5

587
00:44:22.792 --> 00:44:24.292
Prepare laser guidance

588
00:44:26.584 --> 00:44:29.126
Target is locked. Laser guidance is in place.

589
00:44:29.459 --> 00:44:30.209
Roget

590
00:44:32.292 --> 00:44:33.209
Hunter Firing

591
00:44:33.792 --> 00:44:35.708
Shut down laser guidance remotely

592
00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:36.501
Yes. Sir

593
00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.667
Training requires increased challenge

594
00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:48.792
What the hell did you do?

595
00:44:53.376 --> 00:44:54.251
Hunter

596
00:44:54.252 --> 00:44:56.042
Mission failure. return to base

597
00:44:56.667 --> 00:44:58.917
Mission is incomplete. requesting second pass

598
00:45:08.542 --> 00:45:10.709
Mission complete. returning now.

599
00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:12.916
A good result

600
00:45:12.917 --> 00:45:14.584
With that time he almost beat your record

601
00:45:14.959 --> 00:45:15.792
Almost

602
00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:17.959
Means he still needs some work then

603
00:45:21.792 --> 00:45:22.459
You see that?

604
00:45:23.209 --> 00:45:24.501
Still full of himself.

605
00:46:08.417 --> 00:46:09.792
Sir. sir!

606
00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:14.166
The terrorist organization Light Group
has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

607
00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:17.375
What's the situation of the Chinese staff
located at the airport?

608
00:46:17.376 --> 00:46:19.126
Don't know sir. Still missing.

609
00:46:20.417 --> 00:46:23.458
Then how will I explain it to the general?

610
00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:25.416
We don't know. They've probably been kidnapped

611
00:46:25.417 --> 00:46:27.541
Probably. probably. damn it!

612
00:46:27.542 --> 00:46:30.917
Then your military career could also be over.
You got that?

613
00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:37.001
You'd better come up with a good answer
for the General

614
00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:42.084
General.

615
00:46:43.126 --> 00:46:44.791
...helicopter during a routine en route
has been shot down. casualties unknown

616
00:46:44.792 --> 00:46:46.083
Government forces admitted that

617
00:46:46.084 --> 00:46:50.583
the air strike against occupation forces
at the Hara airport to be a major failure

618
00:46:50.584 --> 00:46:55.333
Government forces have officially
escalated the situation to a Level One Terrorist attack.

619
00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.834
Prior to this. the government has already...

620
00:47:02.292 --> 00:47:04.541
I've heard enough tragedy today.

621
00:47:04.542 --> 00:47:06.834
I hope you're bringing me good news.

622
00:47:07.417 --> 00:47:12.833
General. some Chinese staff stationed
at the airport were kidnapped earlier today.

623
00:47:12.834 --> 00:47:16.084
They are still missing
and out of touch at the moment.

624
00:47:20.084 --> 00:47:22.125
I have to warn you. general.

625
00:47:22.126 --> 00:47:24.708
This is the last call of us.

626
00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:27.416
You have 36 hours to release our leader

627
00:47:27.417 --> 00:47:29.791
before I fulfill my promise.

628
00:47:29.792 --> 00:47:31.833
I'm warning you. too.

629
00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:34.166
This is no joke.

630
00:47:34.167 --> 00:47:37.000
Even if you control the missile silo.

631
00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:41.333
you do not have the technical ability to
launch that monster.

632
00:47:41.334 --> 00:47:43.708
You better act before its too late

633
00:47:43.709 --> 00:47:45.500
My granny told me

634
00:47:45.501 --> 00:47:48.000
when the Goddess of Mount Chess cries.

635
00:47:48.001 --> 00:47:51.626
it's the time of our nation to decline.

636
00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:02.126
Contact the Chinese government immediately.

637
00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:07.292
Everything is ready.

638
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:16.251
I am Gorula Rachman

639
00:48:17.917 --> 00:48:20.292
responsible for the airport military base.

640
00:48:21.626 --> 00:48:23.791
As a professional soldier.

641
00:48:23.792 --> 00:48:24.958
I hereby confirm

642
00:48:24.959 --> 00:48:27.208
that they still have the launch authorization

643
00:48:27.209 --> 00:48:30.251
and encrypted key to a long-range
ballistic missile.

644
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:35.251
which can likely reach an area
within a radius of 1500km.

645
00:48:37.292 --> 00:48:40.959
Do not approach...
The hostages are kept near the silo.

646
00:48:41.417 --> 00:48:43.709
A total of 37 people have gone missing

647
00:48:43.917 --> 00:48:46.750
A total of 9 Chinese. <i>2</i> of whom are kids

648
00:48:46.751 --> 00:48:49.417
We believe they are
all in the hands of the terrorists

649
00:48:49.792 --> 00:48:51.791
The priest they have demanded be released

650
00:48:51.792 --> 00:48:54.083
is leader of the terrorist group Holy Light.

651
00:48:54.084 --> 00:48:57.125
He masterminded several
large-scale terrorist attacks

652
00:48:57.126 --> 00:48:59.876
and was captured in Mahbu just four months ago.

653
00:49:00.584 --> 00:49:02.291
Now the Mahbu airforce base has been

654
00:49:02.292 --> 00:49:04.208
confirmed as controlled by the terrorists

655
00:49:04.209 --> 00:49:06.791
Mahbu has officially requested our assistance

656
00:49:06.792 --> 00:49:09.708
Two Chinese jet fighters
will take back control of the air

657
00:49:09.709 --> 00:49:12.125
and assist their ground forces in
launching a rescue effort.

658
00:49:12.126 --> 00:49:14.916
Give terrorists an inch and they'll take a mile

659
00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:16.583
Our superiors have made it clear

660
00:49:16.584 --> 00:49:19.167
its to be a joint anti-terror operation

661
00:49:21.876 --> 00:49:23.541
Who's my wingman on this mission?

662
00:49:23.542 --> 00:49:26.416
According to current statistics.
Wu Di is your best choice

663
00:49:26.417 --> 00:49:29.583
Based on the capacity graphs
for pilots on this base

664
00:49:29.584 --> 00:49:32.166
Wu Di's stats are clearly ahead
of the other pilots

665
00:49:32.167 --> 00:49:34.250
But I would not suggest choosing him
for this mission

666
00:49:34.251 --> 00:49:37.166
because Wu Di's former wingman
is one of the terrorists' hostages

667
00:49:37.167 --> 00:49:39.875
and our mission orders are just to assist.
not to rescue

668
00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:42.542
I'm afraid his emotions may cause erratic behavior

669
00:49:47.209 --> 00:49:49.251
Who is the pilot on duty right now?

670
00:49:49.834 --> 00:49:51.126
It's me.

671
00:49:56.376 --> 00:49:57.292
No-one else?

672
00:50:01.834 --> 00:50:03.291
I want to take part in this mission

673
00:50:03.292 --> 00:50:04.541
I'm a professional

674
00:50:04.542 --> 00:50:07.459
Soldiers don't allow emotions to interfere
with a mission

675
00:50:17.876 --> 00:50:19.166
Thunder ready to go

676
00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:20.541
Hunter ready to go

677
00:50:20.542 --> 00:50:21.751
You're good to go

678
00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.791
Thunder. Hunter. tactical formation

679
00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:32.709
Copy that.

680
00:50:38.501 --> 00:50:40.459
How long have you known Haochen?

681
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:44.751
I am asking you.

682
00:50:45.792 --> 00:50:47.291
We've been together
since we were in the aviation school.

683
00:50:47.292 --> 00:50:49.375
He's always been your wingman. right?

684
00:50:49.376 --> 00:50:51.041
Yep.

685
00:50:51.042 --> 00:50:52.375
before I joined Sky Hunter.

686
00:50:52.376 --> 00:50:54.875
I've read the report of your
expelling mission on the sea.

687
00:50:54.876 --> 00:50:56.376
He's smart.

688
00:50:56.501 --> 00:50:58.751
Don't worry. It would be OK.

689
00:50:58.792 --> 00:51:00.041
The course chosen by Captain Ling

690
00:51:00.042 --> 00:51:02.209
is completely consistent
with the plan preferred by the computer.

691
00:51:02.376 --> 00:51:03.751
and it's even more effective.

692
00:51:12.667 --> 00:51:14.875
Thunder. This is UAV reporting.

693
00:51:14.876 --> 00:51:17.458
An air defence radars
searching right in front of you.

694
00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:19.458
It might be supportive.

695
00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:20.958
Don't rule out other possibilities.

696
00:51:20.959 --> 00:51:23.000
Lower the altitude
and pay a close attention on it.

697
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:23.917
Copy that.

698
00:51:23.918 --> 00:51:26.500
Pay attention to the radar. Position 225 degrees.

699
00:51:26.501 --> 00:51:29.333
It's not in the report
and its power-on time is very strange.

700
00:51:29.334 --> 00:51:30.458
Do you think theres any problem?

701
00:51:30.459 --> 00:51:33.250
The system of Mabul has always been
on the brink of breaking down.

702
00:51:33.251 --> 00:51:34.792
Why is it activated now?

703
00:51:49.959 --> 00:51:51.958
Rahman. I made it!

704
00:51:51.959 --> 00:51:54.208
Now it's time to show them

705
00:51:54.209 --> 00:51:57.333
They'll release my older brother at once.

706
00:51:57.334 --> 00:51:59.458
We are surrounded by the military.

707
00:51:59.459 --> 00:52:01.876
Two Chinese fighters are coming in fast.

708
00:52:13.584 --> 00:52:14.376
Take them down.

709
00:52:14.377 --> 00:52:16.000
Yes. sir.

710
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:19.626
Guys. we'll use all of the machines... go. go. go

711
00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:32.584
The Guidance radar on the ground is initiated.

712
00:52:46.334 --> 00:52:48.292
Sam missiles are launched.

713
00:52:50.626 --> 00:52:52.458
Scatter and dodge.

714
00:52:52.459 --> 00:52:53.708
Roger that.

715
00:52:53.709 --> 00:52:56.166
Descending altitude increases speed

716
00:52:56.167 --> 00:52:57.292
Chaff flares!

717
00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:30.709
Pull up for a 30 degrees recovery.

718
00:53:33.084 --> 00:53:34.625
They are too close to get rid of.

719
00:53:34.626 --> 00:53:35.666
Do a crossover

720
00:53:35.667 --> 00:53:38.459
That maneuver you used at your graduation ceremony

721
00:53:38.751 --> 00:53:39.792
Copy that.

722
00:53:42.292 --> 00:53:44.001
I fly to the left

723
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:54.126
What are you gonna do?

724
00:53:54.127 --> 00:53:55.959
Shut up. Just follow my instruction.

725
00:53:56.417 --> 00:53:57.417
Take a reverse maneuver.

726
00:54:01.459 --> 00:54:02.834
The missile is right behind you.

727
00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:06.917
Thunder.

728
00:54:08.834 --> 00:54:09.834
Let's go.

729
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:15.834
Hundredth

730
00:54:17.001 --> 00:54:18.167
Hundredth

731
00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:39.501
Sky Hunter. mission canceled. Return immediately.

732
00:54:40.084 --> 00:54:41.750
Evaluate the damage condition.

733
00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:43.791
Hundredth

734
00:54:43.792 --> 00:54:45.708
Can you operate the plane?

735
00:54:45.709 --> 00:54:47.626
I can't see clearly.

736
00:54:48.209 --> 00:54:50.584
I can see nothing.

737
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:52.250
Hundredth

738
00:54:52.251 --> 00:54:54.291
It seems that your canopy. left and right elevator.

739
00:54:54.292 --> 00:54:56.333
The left end of the rudder are damaged.

740
00:54:56.334 --> 00:54:57.500
Copy that.

741
00:54:57.501 --> 00:54:58.666
Hundredth

742
00:54:58.667 --> 00:55:01.667
If you can't make it. you can parachute.

743
00:55:06.126 --> 00:55:08.209
I've been a pilot for years.

744
00:55:08.584 --> 00:55:10.791
Have you ever seen me parachuting?

745
00:55:10.792 --> 00:55:13.376
And besides. it's beyond Chinese territory.

746
00:55:13.709 --> 00:55:15.875
I've know the damages.

747
00:55:15.876 --> 00:55:17.708
Ready for return.

748
00:55:17.709 --> 00:55:21.042
Sky Hunter I've sent you the data link.

749
00:55:21.876 --> 00:55:23.417
You lead me back.

750
00:55:24.126 --> 00:55:25.167
Remember.

751
00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:27.751
from now on.

752
00:55:28.751 --> 00:55:30.751
you'll be my eyes.

753
00:55:31.876 --> 00:55:32.917
Roget

754
00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:34.958
Mountain ahead.

755
00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:36.292
Push leftward.

756
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:38.750
Push leftward.

757
00:55:38.751 --> 00:55:39.667
Level off.

758
00:55:41.167 --> 00:55:42.126
Level off.

759
00:55:42.127 --> 00:55:43.417
Hold on.

760
00:55:44.001 --> 00:55:45.292
Hold on.

761
00:55:52.042 --> 00:55:53.292
Don't slop leftward.

762
00:55:54.209 --> 00:55:55.126
Push rightward.

763
00:55:56.917 --> 00:55:58.542
Push rightward.

764
00:56:08.417 --> 00:56:10.292
You're too fast. Slow your throttle to 75.

765
00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:11.667
Decelerating.

766
00:56:12.542 --> 00:56:13.209
Decelerating.

767
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:18.292
Aligning the runway.

768
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.626
Release the landing gear.

769
00:56:21.501 --> 00:56:22.834
OK!

770
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:27.709
Hold on.

771
00:56:28.126 --> 00:56:28.959
40

772
00:56:29.084 --> 00:56:30.416
40

773
00:56:30.417 --> 00:56:31.376
30

774
00:56:31.501 --> 00:56:32.875
30

775
00:56:32.876 --> 00:56:33.584
<i>'20</i>

776
00:56:33.751 --> 00:56:35.209
<i>'20</i>

777
00:56:45.167 --> 00:56:46.251
landing

778
00:57:10.417 --> 00:57:11.292
Captain Ling.

779
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:12.417
Captain Ling.

780
00:57:23.167 --> 00:57:24.709
Hold on. Captain Ling.

781
00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:27.751
Open the door.

782
00:57:38.251 --> 00:57:41.584
Scatter and dodge. Chaff flares.

783
00:57:46.501 --> 00:57:49.251
Lower the altitude. Dive and increasing load.

784
00:57:51.417 --> 00:57:53.916
Pull up for a 30 degrees recovery.

785
00:57:53.917 --> 00:57:54.958
What do you want to do?

786
00:57:54.959 --> 00:57:56.334
Shut up. Listen to me.

787
00:58:11.292 --> 00:58:14.333
Your incompetence embarrassed the President

788
00:58:14.334 --> 00:58:15.875
No matter how you do it.

789
00:58:15.876 --> 00:58:19.375
You must guarantee the safety
of the Chinese hostages.

790
00:58:19.376 --> 00:58:21.959
The Chinese government will take action.

791
00:58:31.542 --> 00:58:32.334
Are we

792
00:58:32.667 --> 00:58:35.126
gonna leave here alive?

793
00:58:39.584 --> 00:58:40.251
Don't worry.

794
00:58:42.501 --> 00:58:44.416
They dare not do anything to us.

795
00:58:44.417 --> 00:58:46.042
We'll be saved.

796
00:58:47.542 --> 00:58:48.334
Trust me

797
00:58:48.334 --> 00:58:49.001
shut up

798
00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:54.376
He needs a doctor.

799
00:59:03.501 --> 00:59:05.126
You'd better eat something.

800
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:07.959
You have a long way to run

801
00:59:08.917 --> 00:59:12.625
because you have to send a message
to the Chinese government for us.

802
00:59:12.626 --> 00:59:15.626
To be honest. you impressed me.

803
00:59:22.626 --> 00:59:24.542
If you have something to say.

804
00:59:26.459 --> 00:59:28.084
tell it to me straightly.

805
00:59:30.167 --> 00:59:31.209
Tell me.

806
00:59:32.376 --> 00:59:35.666
how you felt facing death for the first time?

807
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:37.459
Especially after you killed someone.

808
00:59:38.167 --> 00:59:39.626
Isn't it fascinating?

809
00:59:41.667 --> 00:59:42.542
No!

810
00:59:45.042 --> 00:59:46.626
It's disgusting.

811
00:59:49.584 --> 00:59:51.334
It makes me realize

812
00:59:53.792 --> 00:59:56.751
that the soldier is the guard of peace.

813
00:59:57.042 --> 01:00:00.167
It seems you are a qualified soldier as I am.

814
01:00:00.792 --> 01:00:02.875
You betrayed your country and your people.

815
01:00:02.876 --> 01:00:04.458
How dare you talk about

816
01:00:04.459 --> 01:00:06.751
what a qualified soldier does.

817
01:00:07.709 --> 01:00:10.791
You are from a powerful and peaceful country.

818
01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:12.500
You have never been to a war

819
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:14.666
or experienced humiliation and hurt.

820
01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:17.916
You are like a spoiled child enjoying all the love

821
01:00:17.917 --> 01:00:21.083
while spreading compassion to the people
suffering in the world.

822
01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.250
I didn't betray my people.

823
01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:25.542
But my government betrayed me.

824
01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:34.626
It's time for you to go.

825
01:00:35.584 --> 01:00:37.666
Your country's made the wrong decision.

826
01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.542
Since you are a Chinese soldier.
you should take all the responsibility.

827
01:00:56.917 --> 01:01:00.375
We officially warn the Chinese government.

828
01:01:00.376 --> 01:01:04.458
If you dare to intervene with our action again.

829
01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:08.917
this will be the end of the Chinese hostages.

830
01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:10.334
Wait!

831
01:01:15.876 --> 01:01:17.376
We made it.

832
01:01:18.209 --> 01:01:19.334
We made it.

833
01:01:35.334 --> 01:01:37.042
You are a lucky boy.

834
01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:50.334
Yet we meet again.

835
01:03:14.376 --> 01:03:16.292
You'd better keep your promise.

836
01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:22.251
I smell freedom.

837
01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:37.334
Hey convict.

838
01:03:40.084 --> 01:03:41.917
You killed my wife and unborn child.

839
01:03:43.042 --> 01:03:45.501
You abominating piece of shit. You deserve this.

840
01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:47.709
No!

841
01:03:48.584 --> 01:03:50.084
Get down. down!

842
01:03:50.501 --> 01:03:54.041
He tried to b... I'm gonna kill every...

843
01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:55.959
You need medical right here.

844
01:05:01.917 --> 01:05:03.376
Can anyone see me?

845
01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.209
Are you the friend Uncle Haochen talks about?

846
01:05:06.334 --> 01:05:07.876
There is nothing here.

847
01:05:08.042 --> 01:05:09.708
There's nothing good to eat

848
01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:11.333
No good games to play

849
01:05:11.334 --> 01:05:13.126
not even cartoons to watch

850
01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.709
You don't want to come here

851
01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.084
2 hours 45 minutes ago.

852
01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.251
a Chinese fighter jet

853
01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:32.709
involved in a joint
anti-terrorist mission came under attack

854
01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:35.708
one of the pilots injured and a fighter damaged

855
01:06:35.709 --> 01:06:37.334
Our intelligence reports have confirmed

856
01:06:37.376 --> 01:06:38.416
the Mahbu military

857
01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:42.042
has lost control
of some of its military facilities.

858
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:46.083
At this point. 5 hours after the incident

859
01:06:46.084 --> 01:06:48.708
we are approaching the deadline set
by the terrorists

860
01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:50.625
Because the group's leader was killed

861
01:06:50.626 --> 01:06:53.416
the terrorists are sure to
launch ballistic missiles.

862
01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:55.041
and kill hostages.

863
01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:56.416
A fifteen hundred kilometer radius of Asia.

864
01:06:56.417 --> 01:06:58.376
including Western China

865
01:06:58.459 --> 01:07:00.750
will be vulnerable to ballistic strike

866
01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:04.416
So we must. with all haste.
attempt our own rescue operation

867
01:07:04.417 --> 01:07:05.917
It must be sudden and precise

868
01:07:06.334 --> 01:07:08.375
Its essential that we free the hostages

869
01:07:08.376 --> 01:07:09.667
without alerting the terrorists

870
01:07:10.834 --> 01:07:12.626
The problem we are currently facing is

871
01:07:13.126 --> 01:07:15.291
the two surveillance radars
near the Chess mountains

872
01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:18.041
effectively block almost
all the possible flight paths

873
01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:20.334
And the SAM missiles used in the attack
on our planes have

874
01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:21.916
been moved and concealed

875
01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:24.126
We have a powerful backup force and support system

876
01:07:24.459 --> 01:07:28.083
The key will be in how to suppress
the enemy's guided missiles

877
01:07:28.084 --> 01:07:29.584
so our jets can make their incursion

878
01:07:29.792 --> 01:07:30.833
According to surveillance

879
01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:33.875
the terrorists have no blind spot
radar coverage in the valley.

880
01:07:33.876 --> 01:07:37.041
so there is a 10-second scan vacancy
between the two radars.

881
01:07:37.042 --> 01:07:38.416
During this 10-second window

882
01:07:38.417 --> 01:07:41.125
our fighters will need to fly through
a narrow 20 meter valley

883
01:07:41.126 --> 01:07:43.708
no higher than 30 meters off the ground

884
01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:46.083
Since the valley is broken up by several ridges

885
01:07:46.084 --> 01:07:48.500
our pilots must traverse two mountain crests

886
01:07:48.501 --> 01:07:50.001
avoiding detection by their SAM radars

887
01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.958
crossing the Chess Mountains

888
01:07:51.959 --> 01:07:54.208
It's an extremely difficult low-altitude flight

889
01:07:54.209 --> 01:07:55.625
Worse. it's a night flight

890
01:07:55.626 --> 01:07:57.667
Any error. we lose both plane and pilot

891
01:07:58.209 --> 01:07:59.834
and the whole mission is forfeit

892
01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:10.626
Today. when I was evading their missiles.
I noticed

893
01:08:11.042 --> 01:08:13.250
that though the SAM guidance radar reacts quickly.

894
01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:14.959
the array's sidelobe level is too high.

895
01:08:15.001 --> 01:08:16.416
Our latest anti-radiation missile

896
01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.709
can capture the weak signal behind the antenna.

897
01:08:19.584 --> 01:08:20.958
I can fly out just after dawn

898
01:08:20.959 --> 01:08:24.001
go through the Chess mountains
at low altitude to the missile silo

899
01:08:24.292 --> 01:08:25.751
As soon as I pull up.

900
01:08:26.251 --> 01:08:28.541
and the guidance radar has got a lock on me

901
01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:31.083
my wingman can get in the blind spot
behind their antenna

902
01:08:31.084 --> 01:08:32.459
and take out their radar

903
01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:35.000
so that SAM would be useless.

904
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:37.126
Then I can destroy the missile silo with a bomb

905
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:39.917
Mahbu made a mess of the handover of their leader

906
01:08:40.376 --> 01:08:41.709
The death of their leader

907
01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:43.626
Means we don't have the time to wait for daylight

908
01:08:46.917 --> 01:08:48.042
Then I will fly at night.

909
01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:57.167
Air Bus 500 in the air. heading for the target

910
01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.416
Assignments from command

911
01:09:03.417 --> 01:09:05.958
Ground combat team will be led by Batu and Gaoyuan

912
01:09:05.959 --> 01:09:07.833
Zhao Yali is hands down the obvious choice

913
01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:09.584
for the Helicopter Rescue Squad

914
01:09:09.959 --> 01:09:12.292
Zhang Li will take the wingman position
for this flight

915
01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:14.126
And the leading pilot...

916
01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:16.584
Wu Di

917
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:18.541
Do we have a problem?

918
01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:21.084
I worry he is not recovered
from his previous mission

919
01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:24.167
A hero wears his scars with honor

920
01:09:24.542 --> 01:09:25.792
The mission takes precedence

921
01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:28.375
If he is a true pilot

922
01:09:28.376 --> 01:09:29.417
we have no problem

923
01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:35.167
I know now

924
01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:38.126
lam not the most outstanding pilot

925
01:09:39.251 --> 01:09:41.709
But I am the person most
suited to carry out this task

926
01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:44.375
Because I've flown there before

927
01:09:44.376 --> 01:09:46.792
My knowledge of the conditions
will help our mission

928
01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:48.917
I'm not making promises

929
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:52.292
Because when a person makes a promise

930
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:54.876
they don't understand what they have committed to

931
01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.667
Our people are undergoing suffering

932
01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:01.292
If we cannot fight for our own people

933
01:10:02.167 --> 01:10:03.501
then who can we fight for?

934
01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.084
Today.

You are about to set out to rescue your brothers

Go and defeat them

954
01:11:00.001 --> 01:11:01.167
They need to understand

955
01:11:01.626 --> 01:11:02.834
offending us

956
01:11:03.751 --> 01:11:05.751
was their stupidest decision

957
01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:07.709

- Kids. you need to listen to me now

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.500
You must open your mouths and cover your ears

1117
01:27:37.501 --> 01:27:39.000
Do you understand me?

1118
01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:39.459
Shut up!

01:30:39.126 --> 01:30:40.042
Grenade!

Take him!

1163
01:34:08.792 --> 01:34:10.000
All teams. be on the alert

1164
01:34:10.001 --> 01:34:11.501
Unknown fighter jet just went airborne

1165
01:34:12.501 --> 01:34:13.584
In here. quickly!

1166
01:34:18.167 --> 01:34:19.625
Who's flying the J-10?

1167
01:34:19.626 --> 01:34:21.166
It's Wu Di. who else

1168
01:34:21.167 --> 01:34:22.583
You tell Wu Di

1169
01:34:22.584 --> 01:34:24.250
there's an ace pilot flying the Mirage

1170
01:34:24.251 --> 01:34:26.375
He was the mastermind of the whole thing

1171
01:34:26.376 --> 01:34:28.000
Hunter Hunter Did you hear that?

1172
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:29.291
Watch out for that Mirage

1173
01:34:29.292 --> 01:34:30.084
Hunter Copy

1174
01:34:30.085 --> 01:34:31.500
Take the valley and get those

1175
01:34:31.501 --> 01:34:32.791
hostages back to China

1176
01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:33.417
COPY

1177
01:34:54.667 --> 01:34:55.542
Release decoys

1178
01:37:06.959 --> 01:37:09.375
You have nothing left. little boy.

1179
01:37:09.376 --> 01:37:11.708
I devoted everything for this land.

1180
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:14.541
Who do you think you are? Disturbing my plan?

1181
01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:16.041
You've lost.

1182
01:37:16.042 --> 01:37:17.250
As a soldier.

1183
01:37:17.251 --> 01:37:18.709
you can protect nobody.

1184
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.584
You don't have the power to be a pilot now.

1185
01:37:22.876 --> 01:37:24.250
You're just a terrorist

1186
01:37:24.251 --> 01:37:26.750
and you're not qualified to be a soldier!

1187
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:28.709
You think you're better than me. don't you?

1188
01:37:30.042 --> 01:37:32.000
You have got only one missile.

1189
01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:33.166
Come on!

1190
01:37:33.167 --> 01:37:34.417
Take me down

1191
01:37:36.959 --> 01:37:39.917
I want you to watch while I shoot them down.

1192
01:37:40.417 --> 01:37:41.583
and you.

1193
01:37:41.584 --> 01:37:43.251
are going to be hopeless.

1194
01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:45.292
Soldier.

1195
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:48.417
you see the sunrise.

1196
01:37:51.001 --> 01:37:53.709
The light always belonged to us.

1197
01:38:22.209 --> 01:38:23.375
Listen up everyone

1198
01:38:23.376 --> 01:38:24.875
We've used up all of our decoy bombs

1199
01:38:24.876 --> 01:38:26.251
We're in for a bumpy ride

1200
01:38:28.667 --> 01:38:30.292
Game over.

1201
01:38:39.376 --> 01:38:40.167
Wu Di.

1202
01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:44.876
Wu Di.

1203
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:48.084
Wu Di?

1204
01:38:52.001 --> 01:38:53.834
Where'll you go after graduation?

1205
01:38:55.542 --> 01:38:56.917
He'll go wherever you go.

1206
01:39:02.042 --> 01:39:03.042
Yali!

1207
01:39:09.751 --> 01:39:14.126
People with dark hearts
shall never gaze upon the light!

1208
01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:26.542
Hunter

1209
01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:27.834
Hunter

1210
01:39:28.167 --> 01:39:29.459
do you COPY?

1211
01:39:29.917 --> 01:39:31.209
Do you COPY?

1212
01:39:32.792 --> 01:39:34.084
Please respond

1213
01:39:35.626 --> 01:39:37.708
Hunter. Hunter. do you copy?

1214
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:39.001
Please respond

1215
01:39:40.167 --> 01:39:42.250
Your flight path and altitude are erratic

1216
01:39:42.251 --> 01:39:44.625
If the engine stutters. parachute out

1217
01:39:44.626 --> 01:39:46.042
Immediately

1218
01:39:46.584 --> 01:39:48.001
do you COPY?

1219
01:39:48.459 --> 01:39:49.917
Are you able to return to base?

1220
01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:51.542
Can you get her back here?

1221
01:39:52.917 --> 01:39:54.375
We have already cleared the runways

1222
01:39:54.376 --> 01:39:57.667
You can land at the Number 13 airfield
on the border as planned

1223
01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:14.250
There'll be turbulence in the mountains tonight

1224
01:42:14.251 --> 01:42:17.084
When making the pass... be careful

1225
01:42:17.917 --> 01:42:18.709
I Will be

1226
01:42:20.792 --> 01:42:23.000
The guidance radar will lock on in 4 seconds.

1227
01:42:23.001 --> 01:42:25.334
So you must be prepared
with your evasive maneuvers

1228
01:42:26.751 --> 01:42:29.792
Don't worry. I'm gonna make it back

1229
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:32.751
I'm sorry

1230
01:42:34.917 --> 01:42:36.167
I owe you an apology.

1231
01:42:38.917 --> 01:42:41.126
I've just been doing everything wrong
all these years

1232
01:42:42.376 --> 01:42:45.292
I've tried expressing myself
in some inexplicable ways.

1233
01:42:46.334 --> 01:42:48.001
What was I thinking?

1234
01:42:50.876 --> 01:42:54.042
It took having a guided missile
on my tail that I couldn't shake

1235
01:42:54.876 --> 01:42:56.501
for me to realize

1236
01:42:58.709 --> 01:43:00.542
There is something that

1237
01:43:01.251 --> 01:43:03.126
I should have said ages ago

1238
01:43:12.292 --> 01:43:13.542
Though time goes by

1239
01:43:14.917 --> 01:43:16.251
We'll never part

1240
01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:21.167
I want to be with you forever

1241
01:43:36.959 --> 01:43:38.251
And you are...?

1242
01:43:41.584 --> 01:43:42.626
Me?

1243
01:43:43.626 --> 01:43:44.876
Wu Di

1244
01:45:35.834 --> 01:45:43.292
"There is no peace without sacrifice"

1245
01:45:44.167 --> 01:45:52.709
"Dedicated to our national sky heroes"

1246
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:56.500
During this mission. Wu Di's maneuver

1247
01:45:56.501 --> 01:45:59.041
was first performed in nineteen eighty seven

1248
01:45:59.042 --> 01:46:02.250
It's called the Barron Sea Scalpel

1249
01:46:02.251 --> 01:46:05.250
Personally. I think it was a totally insane.

1250
01:46:05.251 --> 01:46:06.750
unwisely chosen.

1251
01:46:06.751 --> 01:46:08.458
kamikaze style action

1252
01:46:08.459 --> 01:46:10.041
Never attempt

1253
01:46:10.042 --> 01:46:11.792
this maneuver yourselves

1254
01:46:15.917 --> 01:46:17.500
Because

1255
01:46:17.501 --> 01:46:19.333
Its not just any man

1256
01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:20.917
who could pull it off

1257
01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:23.167
28th this month

1258
01:46:23.168 --> 01:46:26.625
The firt high-speed rail that China aid
and build for Mahbu has been put into operation

1259
01:46:26.626 --> 01:46:29.000
The high-speed rail project. which symbolizes
the friendship between the two countries.

1260
01:46:29.001 --> 01:46:32.250
will open a new chapter for
communication and cooperation

1261
01:46:32.251 --> 01:46:34.417
between countries along the border
