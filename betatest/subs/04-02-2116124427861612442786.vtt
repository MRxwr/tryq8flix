M_I_SForEver

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:36.454
What is destiny?

00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:40.991
Is it a predetermined path
between point A and B?

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:48.733
or is it just a culmination of
all our individual decisions.

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:53.872
I am not a man with grand
purpose.

00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:58.408
I'm simply a man who made a
decision.

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:02.780
A decision to do something
different.

00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:07.752
No worldwide problems to solve.

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:15.894
I did it because I thought I
could.

00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:58.950
Day 127.

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:05.456
Morale is high.

00:05:06.858 --> 00:05:09.927
This house is quite
charming and comfortable.

00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:21.172
Everything so far has
gone according to plan.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.941
Staying busy helps keep my mind

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.309
off of how isolated it can be
here.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.347
I'm really satisfied with the
progress that I've been making

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.849
and hope it continues.

00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:36.419
I feel like I'm on the
verge of solving the problem

00:05:36.454 --> 00:05:38.022
that's keeping me here.

00:05:39.524 --> 00:05:41.993
The tools of this time
are just so primitive.

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:23.501
I'm forced to ignore

00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:26.170
almost a century of
technological advancements.

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:30.608
I do. however. enjoy the
challenge this presents me.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.926
Day 463.

00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:52.897
This work is taking much
longer than I had anticipated.

00:06:54.232 --> 00:06:55.733
Every breakthrough has been
coupled

00:06:55.766 --> 00:06:57.568
with at least two more setbacks

00:06:58.636 --> 00:07:00.338
and what originally felt like
progress

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.406
is really nothing more than a
dead end.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.576
I feel as if I'm getting
nowhere.

00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:09.280
My life has become a rhythm.

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:13.751
An endless loop of the same
thing. day in and day out.

00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:17.387
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.123
outside of these four walls.

00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:22.994
but I can't let myself think
that way.

00:07:35.973 --> 00:07:37.975
I must keep going.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.677
I have to make this work.

00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:43.314
Getting back home is all I have.

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:46.851
There is nothing else.

00:08:29.293 --> 00:08:31.696
Today is the day it all ends.

00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:39.003
Despite all of my best efforts.
everything has been in vain.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.174
My will is broken.

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:48.179
I don't know if it's the
limitations of technology

00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:52.016
that are available to me
in this time or my own.

00:08:54.218 --> 00:08:57.688
Either way. I know I'll
never be going home.

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:02.727
The simple truth is that
I leave this world alone.

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:04.895
No family.

00:09:06.597 --> 00:09:08.933
I shut out the only friend I
had.

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:15.539
No one will ever know of the
things I have accomplished

00:09:16.774 --> 00:09:19.844
or even of my failures and
mistakes.

00:09:23.714 --> 00:09:26.183
This is the only decision I have
left.

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:31.889
I can only hope this will
cause no further damage.

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:38.529
I thought time travel would
be exciting. liberating.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.701
but in the end it was just
escaping

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:46.303
one prison to enter another.

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:59.417
I've done everything I can do.

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:11.662
I don't know what else I could
do.

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:18.169
I've tried.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.072
I've tried.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.814
But I'm not doing this anymore.

00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:19.169
Suit power at full
capacity

00:15:19.203 --> 00:15:20.938
facility diagnostics complete.

00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:22.406
A.N.I. system online.

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:23.941
Hello A.N.I.

00:15:23.974 --> 00:15:25.275
Good afternoon.

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:27.311
Your day is finally here.

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:32.550
You ready?

00:15:32.584 --> 00:15:34.619
All systems go.

00:15:34.652 --> 00:15:35.487
Good.

00:16:07.084 --> 00:16:09.019
Alright. start it up.

00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:16.561
Portal
polarity initiated.

00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:19.831
Beginning
count down sequence.

00:16:55.065 --> 00:16:59.504
10. 9. 8. 7. 6

00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:05.175
5. 4. 3. 2. 1.

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:46.303
Sir. are you okay?

00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:28.546
Exclusion zone
notice. Level 3 evacuation.

00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:31.348
Immediate and imminent
danger.

00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:33.584
Evacuate immediately.

00:20:33.618 --> 00:20:35.553
This is to promote
your safety.

00:21:33.478 --> 00:21:34.979
Hey. are you okay?

00:21:37.115 --> 00:21:38.983
Sir. you're bleeding everywhere.

00:21:39.016 --> 00:21:41.619
Do you want me to call for some
help?

00:21:41.652 --> 00:21:42.553
No. I'm fine.

00:21:42.587 --> 00:21:43.521
Get out of here.

00:21:48.826 --> 00:21:50.828
You know what. I'm getting
help.

00:21:50.862 --> 00:21:52.295
No need to yell at me.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.004
I said leave.

00:22:31.235 --> 00:22:32.804
Are you okay?

00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:35.540
I'm fine.

00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:38.242
Told you I'd be fine.

00:22:41.212 --> 00:22:42.046
I'm fine

00:24:01.424 --> 00:24:03.027
Just sit still.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.795
Got most of the blood cleaned
up.

00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:07.098
but you're definitely going
to want to see a doctor

00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:08.633
about some stitches.

00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:10.568
You fell and hit your head
pretty hard.

00:24:10.601 --> 00:24:13.271
Look. what are you still doing
here?

00:24:13.304 --> 00:24:15.973
I appreciate the help
but you need to just go.

00:24:16.007 --> 00:24:16.841
Fine.

00:24:16.874 --> 00:24:18.776
You know. this really isn't my
problem.

00:24:18.809 --> 00:24:21.444
But fine. if you want me to
go. I'll leave you alone.

00:24:21.479 --> 00:24:23.648
Yes. fine just go.

00:24:25.516 --> 00:24:27.551
You know. everyone living
around here

00:24:27.585 --> 00:24:29.587
thinks some lonely hermit's
living here.

00:24:31.589 --> 00:24:32.990
Is that so?

00:24:34.258 --> 00:24:36.761
Yeah and now I can see why.

00:24:41.431 --> 00:24:43.134
And that's why you're alone.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.645
I am so angry.

00:24:56.314 --> 00:24:58.182
Everything was set.

00:24:58.215 --> 00:25:01.152
I had accepted my way out of
this hell

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:03.955
and she took it from me.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.559
I can't control anything.

00:25:11.529 --> 00:25:12.997
What do I have left?

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:18.869
This encounter with her
triggered another episode.

00:25:18.903 --> 00:25:21.205
Visions. memories I don't know.

00:25:23.174 --> 00:25:25.076
I wish I could understand

00:25:27.144 --> 00:25:31.082
and yet all I can think about is
her.

00:29:00.191 --> 00:29:01.526
A.N.I.!

00:29:35.627 --> 00:29:37.462
Wait a minute.
did you shut me off?

00:29:37.495 --> 00:29:40.030
Have I been off for two and a
half years?

00:29:40.064 --> 00:29:41.031
Look at you.

00:29:41.065 --> 00:29:42.900
You're a mess. you're all banged
up.

00:29:42.933 --> 00:29:44.101
- I know. I know.
- I told you

00:29:44.134 --> 00:29:45.970
turning me off was a bad idea.

00:29:46.003 --> 00:29:48.372
I'm very sorry about all
that and you were right.

00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:49.773
Of course I was
right.

00:29:49.807 --> 00:29:52.477
I'm not an emotional or
irrational creature like you.

00:29:53.444 --> 00:29:55.680
Look A.N.I.. I need you for
something.

00:29:56.847 --> 00:29:58.483
Um no. put me back
down.

00:29:58.516 --> 00:29:59.718
Let me charge first.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.685
You'll be fine.

00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:01.653
This won't take more
than a minute. I'm sure.

00:30:01.686 --> 00:30:04.054
After that. I'll let you bask in
the sun.

00:30:04.088 --> 00:30:05.490
How about that?

00:30:05.523 --> 00:30:07.324
Wonderful.

00:30:07.358 --> 00:30:10.261
This is what I need
you to analyze for me.

00:30:10.294 --> 00:30:11.929
What am I looking at

00:30:11.962 --> 00:30:14.164
and what's making that noise?

00:30:14.198 --> 00:30:16.433
Okay. you have to get
me closer to the source.

00:30:16.468 --> 00:30:17.835
Set me down on the sink.

00:30:20.838 --> 00:30:22.806
Okay. I hear water dripping.

00:30:24.275 --> 00:30:26.578
You know you might want
to get those pipes fixed.

00:30:26.611 --> 00:30:28.779
You have one nasty water hammer.

00:30:30.214 --> 00:30:32.349
I'm not exactly sure I know
what I'm looking for here.

00:30:32.383 --> 00:30:35.620
All I'm picking up is a natural
frequency.

00:30:35.654 --> 00:30:36.887
Sounds familiar. right?

00:30:38.022 --> 00:30:39.923
A standing wave
pattern.

00:30:39.957 --> 00:30:41.925
Hm. This solves your power
issue.

00:30:41.959 --> 00:30:43.461
but you're going to have a hard
time

00:30:43.495 --> 00:30:46.096
using early 21st century
technology.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.500
I hope you don't plan on using
sink parts.

00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:49.734
Leave that part to me.

00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:52.504
I'd recommend
shutting off the faucet

00:30:52.537 --> 00:30:54.938
before your house shakes apart.

00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:56.240
Duly noted.

00:32:08.646 --> 00:32:10.214
It's been a while. hasn't it?

00:32:10.247 --> 00:32:11.882
You've not left this
house once

00:32:11.915 --> 00:32:13.818
since I was turned off. have
you?

00:32:16.286 --> 00:32:18.956
I do believe I'm ready
to leave this place.

00:32:19.957 --> 00:32:21.892
I can imagine you
are.

00:32:21.925 --> 00:32:23.561
At least you have me again.

00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:25.463
I know you missed me.

00:32:25.497 --> 00:32:27.799
It looks like you missed
a lot of showers too.

00:32:29.266 --> 00:32:30.802
Are you taking care of yourself?

00:32:30.835 --> 00:32:31.935
A.N.I. don't start.

00:32:51.623 --> 00:32:55.259
I think we finally have
a chance this time.

00:32:56.326 --> 00:32:58.228
Our work
does seem cut out for us

00:32:58.262 --> 00:33:00.063
but I believe you're right.

00:33:00.097 --> 00:33:01.533
Okay. where do we start?

00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:04.201
Wait right here.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.113
Please tell me
you're using that for parts.

00:33:16.146 --> 00:33:18.348
Nope. he's doing what I think
he's doing.

00:33:18.382 --> 00:33:19.617
Nothing like a good song

00:33:19.651 --> 00:33:22.286
to get your creative juices
flowing. right A.N.I?

00:33:30.695 --> 00:33:32.095
While I do you
understand

00:33:32.129 --> 00:33:34.164
the merits of music for humans.

00:33:34.198 --> 00:33:36.601
I can't understand how
you call this music.

00:33:36.634 --> 00:33:38.903
Come on. this is good stuff.

00:33:39.838 --> 00:33:41.706
I'm so glad
we traveled to the past

00:33:41.739 --> 00:33:45.209
so we could listen to music
that's even further in the past.

00:33:45.242 --> 00:33:47.645
The time travel never stops.

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:50.615
You know. if we could
get this thing working.

00:33:50.648 --> 00:33:51.816
I could arrange that.

00:33:52.717 --> 00:33:54.117
If I get
you back to the future.

00:33:54.151 --> 00:33:56.253
I get to pick the music from now
on.

00:33:58.756 --> 00:33:59.724
Deal.

00:34:17.775 --> 00:34:20.812
After being alone in
this house for so long.

00:34:20.845 --> 00:34:23.481
not making any progress on the
machine.

00:34:23.515 --> 00:34:25.517
I finally felt useful again.

00:34:26.885 --> 00:34:29.888
I forgot how much I missed
having someone to talk to.

00:34:50.975 --> 00:34:54.111
With A.N.I.'s help we made
a great break-through.

00:34:54.144 --> 00:34:56.514
I began to work feverishly
and I found myself

00:34:56.548 --> 00:34:58.115
losing track of time.

00:34:59.449 --> 00:35:01.084
The days and weeks blurred
together

00:35:01.118 --> 00:35:02.587
as our design took shape.

00:35:40.858 --> 00:35:43.126
For the first time in a very
long time.

00:35:44.428 --> 00:35:45.830
I began to believe.

00:35:48.866 --> 00:35:50.100
It felt good.

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:55.707
It's a good start.

00:36:21.799 --> 00:36:24.602
It feels good having
something to do around here.

00:36:24.636 --> 00:36:27.071
Nobody has
perfected tea like you have.

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:29.841
I'm curious.

00:36:29.874 --> 00:36:31.141
May I ask you something?

00:36:32.142 --> 00:36:35.546
It may be considered of a
personal nature.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.514
Sure.

00:36:38.315 --> 00:36:40.485
I didn't deem
it appropriate at the time.

00:36:40.518 --> 00:36:43.220
but now that we're making
progress.

00:36:45.188 --> 00:36:46.724
Continue.

00:36:46.758 --> 00:36:48.358
You have not
once mentioned the injuries

00:36:48.392 --> 00:36:50.160
you have sustained to your head.

00:36:50.193 --> 00:36:52.195
I also analyze the basement and
detected

00:36:52.229 --> 00:36:54.465
a small explosive device.

00:36:54.499 --> 00:36:56.501
It appears to have been forcibly
opened.

00:36:57.535 --> 00:36:59.236
What happened while I was gone?

00:36:59.269 --> 00:37:04.341
- I tried to kill myself.
- Why would you do that?

00:37:04.374 --> 00:37:06.309
I didn't care anymore.

00:37:06.343 --> 00:37:09.047
Someone knocked on the door.
someone new.

00:37:10.515 --> 00:37:15.520
She must've just started
working and I thought she left

00:37:18.221 --> 00:37:19.256
but I opened the door

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:22.026
and this woman was standing
there

00:37:26.396 --> 00:37:28.066
and then it happened.

00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:30.802
Did you see something again?

00:37:31.903 --> 00:37:33.938
Yes. but somehow different.

00:37:38.776 --> 00:37:40.444
I wonder if
these visual occurrences

00:37:40.478 --> 00:37:42.212
are your brain having a hard
time

00:37:42.245 --> 00:37:44.849
adjusting to the current time
period.

00:37:44.882 --> 00:37:48.318
I tried as hard as I could to
stay away.

00:37:49.754 --> 00:37:52.790
to keep from interfering from
anything outside this house

00:37:52.824 --> 00:37:56.160
and still. still something
happened.

00:37:58.096 --> 00:38:00.430
Norman. maybe
our effects on time

00:38:00.465 --> 00:38:01.999
are wholly inconsequential.

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:05.402
Are you so sure that
time is not predefined?

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:09.272
Perhaps the sum of our choices

00:38:09.306 --> 00:38:11.809
will always lead us down the
same path.

00:38:29.794 --> 00:38:32.329
Norman. what's on your mind?

00:38:35.265 --> 00:38:36.266
Wow.

00:38:39.804 --> 00:38:42.874
The night sky is beautiful.

00:38:47.879 --> 00:38:50.380
I imagine it is.

00:39:03.795 --> 00:39:06.197
Day 1.320

00:39:09.299 --> 00:39:11.368
Today I woke up in a good
mood.

00:39:13.137 --> 00:39:15.907
Yeah. things are going well.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.754
You're looking
refreshed this morning.

00:40:03.788 --> 00:40:06.057
- How's your tea?
- It's good.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.526
It's really good A.N.I.. good
tea.

00:40:10.628 --> 00:40:15.233
- Shall I play some music?
- Yes. that'd be nice.

00:40:17.268 --> 00:40:19.704
I think you might
like this.

00:40:33.918 --> 00:40:35.553
Uh oh.

00:40:35.586 --> 00:40:36.621
What is it?

00:40:38.723 --> 00:40:40.423
I believe you
may have miscalculated

00:40:40.458 --> 00:40:43.094
our window of opportunity
to make this trip.

00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:46.731
What do you mean?

00:40:46.764 --> 00:40:47.899
By how much?

00:40:47.932 --> 00:40:49.300
I've finished
running your calculations

00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:51.434
and this can still work.

00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:54.138
Look. given the technology
you had to work with...

00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:56.073
A.N.I. how much?

00:40:56.107 --> 00:40:58.910
Well Norman. it's not
good.

00:40:58.943 --> 00:41:01.411
We have a three hour window
in precisely eight days.

00:41:01.444 --> 00:41:03.446
10 hours and 27 minutes.

00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:06.584
We need the gravitational boost
to augment the power system.

00:41:06.617 --> 00:41:10.488
The next window of opportunity
is over three years from now.

00:41:10.521 --> 00:41:12.123
I know the timing will be tight.

00:41:12.156 --> 00:41:15.326
but I'm confident we can
get everything done in time.

00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:17.328
I'm sorry things are so rushed.

00:41:27.972 --> 00:41:31.175
I know a small part of
you will miss this place.

00:41:33.978 --> 00:41:36.948
I hope you're confident
in the decision to leave.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.992
Let's get to work.

00:42:11.482 --> 00:42:14.085
Our efforts have been greatly
increased.

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:17.355
A.N.I.'s been working to reverse
engineer

00:42:17.388 --> 00:42:19.690
the original formula to
hopefully take us back

00:42:19.724 --> 00:42:21.659
to around the time we left.

00:42:22.526 --> 00:42:24.895
Even with the accelerated
deadline.

00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:27.498
everything's coming
together as I had hoped.

00:42:30.835 --> 00:42:35.139
It's funny. although it
stands for everything

00:42:35.172 --> 00:42:37.775
that has haunted me these three
years.

00:42:39.543 --> 00:42:42.146
I find myself feeling a bit
nostalgic

00:42:42.179 --> 00:42:43.914
over leaving this house.

00:42:46.117 --> 00:42:49.587
It's odd to become so
attached to something I hate.

00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:58.796
And the girl. why do I feel
such a connection with her?

00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:02.299
None of it makes sense.

00:43:04.568 --> 00:43:07.038
It's as if something deep inside
me

00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:10.775
believes that my time
here was meant to happen.

00:43:17.482 --> 00:43:19.050
The other part of me is in fear

00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:21.352
of how much I've altered my own
path

00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:23.621
and the effects that remain
unseen.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.059
Regardless. I have work to do

00:43:28.926 --> 00:43:31.562
and I shouldn't waste
time with speculation.

00:44:32.189 --> 00:44:34.125
Norman. what's going
on?

00:44:42.366 --> 00:44:45.002
She's out there. isn't she?

00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:02.686
The only reason I'm playing
this is because you told me to.

00:45:04.688 --> 00:45:07.391
If you're watching this.
then you already know.

00:45:08.926 --> 00:45:11.563
Don't do it.

00:45:11.596 --> 00:45:14.533
Every time you're going back
out there. something changes.

00:45:14.566 --> 00:45:16.834
Those people are real

00:45:16.867 --> 00:45:19.436
and their lives could be
changed now because of you.

00:47:05.976 --> 00:47:07.444
A.N.I. turn on.

00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:12.751
- Come on. come on. turn on.
- Slow down.

00:47:12.783 --> 00:47:14.184
What happened?

00:47:14.218 --> 00:47:15.119
I saw something.

00:47:15.152 --> 00:47:17.421
I don't know what it was. but it
hurt.

00:47:17.455 --> 00:47:19.356
It was like this severe headache

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:21.425
and then there were these
images.

00:47:21.459 --> 00:47:23.595
- I don't understand.
- What images?

00:47:23.628 --> 00:47:25.630
I'm changing things.
everything.

00:47:25.664 --> 00:47:27.732
Even the smallest things.

00:47:28.633 --> 00:47:31.536
I don't know why I thought
it would be any different.

00:47:31.569 --> 00:47:34.539
You aren't making any
sense.

00:47:34.572 --> 00:47:36.508
I can't do this.

00:47:36.541 --> 00:47:38.842
Being here. I can't just
keep going back out there.

00:47:38.876 --> 00:47:41.211
I'm too vulnerable.

00:47:41.245 --> 00:47:43.981
I'm too exposed and there's
just too many variables.

00:47:44.014 --> 00:47:45.149
What did you expect?

00:47:45.182 --> 00:47:47.652
You knew the risks
before taking this trip.

00:47:47.686 --> 00:47:48.787
I know. I know.

00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:50.020
I just thought.

00:47:50.054 --> 00:47:53.725
- I just thought it could be...
- Could be what?

00:47:57.495 --> 00:48:00.831
This is only going to happen
again.

00:48:00.864 --> 00:48:02.966
This can't happen again.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.537
A.N.I. I need you to
record something for me.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.808
Are you going to
tell me what this is all about?

00:48:09.873 --> 00:48:12.510
- Are we recording?
- Yes.

00:48:18.583 --> 00:48:22.086
If you're watching this.
then you already know.

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:23.722
Don't do it.

00:48:25.122 --> 00:48:28.092
Every time you go back out
there. something changes.

00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:29.761
Those people are real

00:48:29.794 --> 00:48:34.365
and their lives could be
changed now because of you.

00:48:34.398 --> 00:48:37.368
I know you didn't want any of
this to happen. but it did.

00:48:37.401 --> 00:48:39.537
and what's done is done.

00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:42.106
There is nothing out there for
you.

00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:44.542
There never has been and never
will be.

00:48:44.576 --> 00:48:46.143
This is not your time.

00:48:48.212 --> 00:48:50.347
I know you can't change
what's already happened.

00:48:50.381 --> 00:48:52.550
but you can prevent more from
happening.

00:48:53.818 --> 00:48:56.286
Find a way. rebuild it.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.623
Do whatever it takes.
you have to get back.

00:49:00.257 --> 00:49:02.660
Don't let your past
mistakes ruin the future.

00:49:05.463 --> 00:49:07.599
You can still make the right
choice.

00:49:16.474 --> 00:49:18.777
Are you okay?

00:49:19.778 --> 00:49:24.114
A.N.I.. whatever I say.
whatever I do

00:49:26.984 --> 00:49:29.487
if you ever think I am getting
too attached to this place.

00:49:29.521 --> 00:49:31.955
I need you to play that for me.

00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:33.625
Promise me.

00:49:33.658 --> 00:49:35.259
Of course.

00:49:35.292 --> 00:49:36.494
I cannot say for sure exactly

00:49:36.528 --> 00:49:39.296
what you're trying to
accomplish.

00:49:39.329 --> 00:49:41.932
I need some place I can go
unnoticed.

00:49:43.468 --> 00:49:45.637
I can't keep going back
into town for everything.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.105
It's too dangerous.

00:49:49.674 --> 00:49:52.644
I can establish for you
an identity. bank account.

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:55.580
license. anything you need.

00:49:55.613 --> 00:49:57.214
I don't need much.

00:49:58.716 --> 00:50:02.554
Just some place inconspicuous.
and I'll need space to work.

00:50:03.721 --> 00:50:05.322
Let's start simple
then.

00:50:05.355 --> 00:50:07.024
How about a name?

00:50:09.494 --> 00:50:10.961
I don't know

00:50:10.994 --> 00:50:12.963
Norman

00:50:12.996 --> 00:50:15.132
Searching my
database for availability

00:50:15.165 --> 00:50:17.635
and potential future conflicts.

00:50:23.073 --> 00:50:27.377
It's hard to imagine
everything I've already changed

00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:30.648
without even noticing it.

00:50:31.816 --> 00:50:33.885
There's so many variables.

00:50:33.918 --> 00:50:35.118
It is complete.

00:50:35.152 --> 00:50:37.221
Nice to meet you. Norman Brandt.

00:50:39.657 --> 00:50:41.091
Norman Brandt?

00:50:43.093 --> 00:50:45.028
Norman Brandt.

00:50:48.666 --> 00:50:50.400
Good job A.N.I.. I like it.

00:50:50.434 --> 00:50:53.003
I'm glad that
it is to your satisfaction.

00:50:54.539 --> 00:50:56.841
I have acquired a home from
a recently deceased person

00:50:56.875 --> 00:50:58.676
with no known living relatives.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:01.011
There are several options for
home food delivery services

00:51:01.044 --> 00:51:02.514
within this area.

00:51:02.547 --> 00:51:04.682
I'm setting you up with one now.

00:51:06.216 --> 00:51:07.552
A food shipment will arrive

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:09.888
on your doorstep every two
months.

00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:11.856
You aren't allergic to gluten
are you?

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:13.090
Yes. no?

00:51:13.123 --> 00:51:14.726
Okay. moving on.

00:51:14.759 --> 00:51:16.594
Concerning your finances. I
could deposit

00:51:16.628 --> 00:51:18.863
one large lump sum into
a bank account for you

00:51:18.897 --> 00:51:20.832
or to avoid suspicion. I would
suggest

00:51:20.865 --> 00:51:24.034
periodically depositing smaller
amounts.

00:51:24.067 --> 00:51:26.604
Wow. that was fast.

00:51:27.739 --> 00:51:29.339
Creating a work order

00:51:29.373 --> 00:51:31.208
to install a new transformer
for your neighborhood.

00:51:31.241 --> 00:51:33.945
This will allow you fully
uninterrupted power.

00:51:33.978 --> 00:51:35.245
Okay A.N.I.. hold on.

00:51:35.279 --> 00:51:36.346
Creating a profile

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.715
for all of your surrounding
neighbors.

00:51:37.749 --> 00:51:40.450
including the times they
leave for and arrive from work

00:51:40.485 --> 00:51:43.855
and on average when they
take their yearly vacations.

00:51:43.888 --> 00:51:45.389
The neighbor directly across
from you

00:51:45.422 --> 00:51:47.625
has been diagnosed with stage
four cancer

00:51:47.659 --> 00:51:50.127
and has weekly in home
visits from a nurse.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:50.962
Okay. A.N.I. stop.

00:51:50.995 --> 00:51:52.229
This is too much.

00:51:52.262 --> 00:51:54.431
These are essential
actions that should be taken.

00:51:54.465 --> 00:51:55.567
It's too much.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.036
There's nothing

00:51:58.068 --> 00:52:00.170
you can't do for me.

00:52:04.642 --> 00:52:06.310
I can't do this.

00:52:10.748 --> 00:52:13.383
I can only change so much
with my personal actions.

00:52:13.417 --> 00:52:16.788
but with you. it's just
too much knowledge.

00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:23.995
I have to do this alone

00:52:26.096 --> 00:52:27.465
and I have to shut you off.

00:52:27.498 --> 00:52:29.968
I strongly advise
against that.

00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:32.870
I know you do. and maybe
you're right

00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:38.610
but I don't trust myself.

00:52:40.143 --> 00:52:42.145
You're making a huge
mistake.

00:52:42.179 --> 00:52:43.681
- Goodbye for now.
- Let me help you.

00:52:43.715 --> 00:52:45.850
There's things you don't
understand

00:52:45.883 --> 00:52:47.117
about your effects on the...

00:53:17.381 --> 00:53:19.784
What's bothering you?

00:53:19.817 --> 00:53:22.820
I told my
parents I was leaving.

00:53:22.854 --> 00:53:24.856
Getting my own place.

00:53:25.723 --> 00:53:27.224
I felt so powerful.

00:53:29.326 --> 00:53:31.194
It's a decision that I made

00:53:31.228 --> 00:53:33.931
and no one else could
convince me otherwise.

00:53:37.068 --> 00:53:38.770
I never liked it there anyway.

00:53:39.737 --> 00:53:41.939
constantly arguing with my dad.

00:53:42.874 --> 00:53:45.275
Never could see eye to eye with
my mom.

00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:49.246
During an argument with my dad.

00:53:49.279 --> 00:53:52.349
I decided then and there that I
had enough

00:53:53.283 --> 00:53:55.019
and that I was leaving.

00:53:55.053 --> 00:53:57.522
So later that night I
grabbed as much stuff

00:53:57.555 --> 00:54:00.458
as I could fit into my backpack
and left.

00:54:02.093 --> 00:54:03.360
I just left.

00:54:09.534 --> 00:54:13.437
The next day I got a phone call

00:54:15.205 --> 00:54:20.210
saying that both of my parents
had died in a car accident.

00:54:24.749 --> 00:54:27.317
They just wanted to come talk
with me

00:54:29.386 --> 00:54:31.421
and the worst part is.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:35.960
I can't even remember what
we were arguing about.

00:54:38.395 --> 00:54:42.133
After that. everything changed.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:50.641
I became consumed with my
work. consumed with an idea.

00:54:53.077 --> 00:54:55.613
I no longer felt like I
belonged.

00:54:56.481 --> 00:54:58.583
I shut out the rest of the
world.

00:54:58.616 --> 00:55:01.819
I just wanted to escape.

00:56:04.882 --> 00:56:08.451
A.N.I.. I won't let my
actions hurt these people

00:56:08.486 --> 00:56:10.855
like they did my parents.

00:56:12.924 --> 00:56:16.160
I never want to experience
anything like that again.

00:56:24.602 --> 00:56:27.572
Let's just fix this thing and
go.

00:56:39.684 --> 00:56:42.553
I wish I could have saved my
parents.

00:56:45.056 --> 00:56:48.526
That was my original intention
for building the machine.

00:56:50.895 --> 00:56:54.232
I knew in my heart it
could be a one way trip.

00:56:57.434 --> 00:56:59.971
What I've learned from all of
this.

00:57:01.572 --> 00:57:06.110
is how unpredictable time
travel is and how one man

00:57:06.143 --> 00:57:09.714
could potentially destroy so
many lives.

00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:17.054
I would not dare tempt
fate after learning this.

00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:23.127
There are too many variables.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.563
Too many what ifs.

00:57:33.638 --> 00:57:35.773
Does it make me an evil person

00:57:35.806 --> 00:57:39.310
that I gave up on the idea
of trying to save them?

00:57:47.285 --> 00:57:48.920
I don't believe it does.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:56.961
From my perspective.
they're better off now.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.802
This world is just broken.

00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:11.676
Wherever they may be. I hope
I can still make them proud.

00:58:14.178 --> 00:58:15.846
Everything is a go
Norman.

00:58:16.847 --> 00:58:18.049
Are you ready?

00:58:32.296 --> 00:58:35.967
All right. let's do this.

00:58:46.744 --> 00:58:48.179
A.N.I.. stop.

00:58:49.513 --> 00:58:51.315
Norman. if
you really want to leave.

00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:52.984
stick to the plan.

00:58:53.017 --> 00:58:54.952
I know in your heart you've
grown

00:58:54.986 --> 00:58:58.022
attached to this place. to her.

00:58:58.055 --> 00:59:00.124
Do not ruin this opportunity
to...

00:59:00.157 --> 00:59:01.525
Ruin what?

00:59:04.095 --> 00:59:07.832
- This?
- I did not mean to upset you.

00:59:10.534 --> 00:59:12.837
A.N.I. I have wasted
three years of my life

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:14.473
in this stupid place.

00:59:14.505 --> 00:59:15.673
I was trying to say.

00:59:15.706 --> 00:59:18.909
do not ruin this opportunity to
leave.

00:59:18.943 --> 00:59:20.878
If you want to go to her. then
do it.

00:59:20.911 --> 00:59:22.880
but commit to your choice.

00:59:22.913 --> 00:59:24.915
You can't have both. Norman.

00:59:24.949 --> 00:59:29.954
I'm sorry. but I have to do
this.

00:59:41.699 --> 00:59:43.634
Hey.

00:59:48.906 --> 00:59:51.308
I just. I just wanted to tell
you.

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.311
Tell me what?

00:59:57.648 --> 00:59:59.116
Look. the thing is.

01:00:01.085 --> 01:00:03.721
Look. I'm really busy
okay. so save it for...

01:00:03.754 --> 01:00:06.057
There's not going to be a next
time.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:09.126
Look. what you did for me.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.531
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:00:12.563 --> 01:00:17.301
You didn't have to do that
and I wanted to apologize.

01:00:20.938 --> 01:00:24.308
Look. I've just been under the
wire lately

01:00:25.409 --> 01:00:27.778
and I just wanted to say sorry.

01:00:29.647 --> 01:00:33.250
Okay. thanks.

01:00:34.752 --> 01:00:36.587
I really do have to get going
though.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.322
I'm actually really behind
schedule

01:00:38.355 --> 01:00:42.159
and my boss is a real jerk about
that.

01:00:42.193 --> 01:00:44.895
I just. I didn't want you
thinking

01:00:44.929 --> 01:00:47.499
that that's how I am all the
time.

01:00:57.174 --> 01:00:59.110
Hey. are you alright?

01:00:59.143 --> 01:01:01.679
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:01:03.314 --> 01:01:05.082
Okay.

01:01:05.116 --> 01:01:08.352
I guess I'll see you again soon.

01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:10.754
Actually. you won't.

01:01:10.788 --> 01:01:14.225
- I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Where to?

01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:20.965
- I'm going home.
- Where's home for you?

01:01:23.701 --> 01:01:26.003
Home is far away.

01:01:28.172 --> 01:01:29.474
Well.

01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:38.048
Good luck. Have a safe trip.
okay.

01:01:38.082 --> 01:01:39.250
Thank you.

01:01:40.684 --> 01:01:42.153
My name is Norman.

01:01:44.855 --> 01:01:48.926
I'm Jennifer. but most
people just call me Jenny.

01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:51.695
Nice meeting you Jenny.

01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:53.030
Okay. bye.

01:02:48.653 --> 01:02:50.120
Why!

01:04:17.975 --> 01:04:20.144
Can I get you something?

01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:14.599
A.N.I.. A.N.I.. I figured it
out.

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:17.901
Great. this
time you figured it out.

01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:19.870
No seriously. I figured it
out.

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:21.405
Get that light.

01:05:21.438 --> 01:05:24.174
I'm glad you have
at least one thing figured out.

01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:27.378
Maybe we should work on
things like personal hygiene.

01:05:27.411 --> 01:05:30.381
Look. just trust me okay.

01:05:31.315 --> 01:05:33.718
What I need you to do. is
get the machine running.

01:05:33.752 --> 01:05:37.655
but this time. keep the power
levels as low as possible

01:05:38.656 --> 01:05:40.725
until I tell you to spike it.

01:05:40.759 --> 01:05:44.529
- Okay?
- This is consuming you.

01:05:44.562 --> 01:05:47.599
You're barely sleeping and I
know you're not eating much.

01:05:48.966 --> 01:05:50.000
Look. I'm fine.

01:05:52.436 --> 01:05:54.572
Let's just focus.

01:05:54.606 --> 01:05:57.274
Do you even
know what day it is?

01:05:57.307 --> 01:05:58.543
Thursday.

01:05:58.576 --> 01:05:59.577
No. Friday.

01:06:00.911 --> 01:06:03.548
It's been one
year since your parents died.

01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:04.415
A.N.I. stop.

01:06:05.617 --> 01:06:08.586
You've hardly spoken
to anyone since that day.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.120
You've become a hermit.

01:06:10.154 --> 01:06:12.557
You know you have to deal
with this sooner or later.

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:14.958
But I don't have to deal with
it today.

01:06:14.992 --> 01:06:18.195
Can we please. please just
concentrate.

01:06:24.669 --> 01:06:25.637
Lights.

01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:41.151
A.N.I. slowly start to
increase the density.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.791
Come on. come on. come on.

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:55.500
- Come on.
- The levels are fluctuating.

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:56.468
Come on.

01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:57.936
You are going
to push it too far.

01:06:57.968 --> 01:06:59.704
No. no. keep it A.N.I.

01:06:59.737 --> 01:07:00.971
Push it.

01:07:06.009 --> 01:07:07.010
Come on!

01:07:24.762 --> 01:07:25.597
No!

01:07:29.032 --> 01:07:30.234
Delete it.

01:07:30.267 --> 01:07:32.369
- Delete the program. I'm done.
- Whoa it's okay.

01:07:32.402 --> 01:07:33.638
We made some progress.

01:07:33.671 --> 01:07:36.039
Maybe next time. I'm
sure you'll make it work.

01:07:36.073 --> 01:07:37.542
Work?

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:40.244
We aren't any closer now
than we were a year ago.

01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:43.380
A.N.I. I failed.

01:07:43.413 --> 01:07:47.017
I failed myself. I failed my
family. I failed everyone.

01:07:48.018 --> 01:07:49.219
I'm done.

01:07:49.253 --> 01:07:51.890
We can still use
the data for later experiments.

01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:53.658
Delete it.

01:07:53.691 --> 01:07:55.292
Delete the program.

01:07:56.694 --> 01:07:58.295
I said delete it!

01:08:11.709 --> 01:08:13.978
A.N.I. what just happened?

01:08:16.948 --> 01:08:18.750
I think you did it.

01:08:27.424 --> 01:08:28.893
It worked.

01:08:31.061 --> 01:08:34.431
- It worked.
- I wonder where it went.

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:18.843
Are you alright?

01:09:26.183 --> 01:09:27.986
I'm ready to end this.

01:09:34.726 --> 01:09:36.193
Let's go home.

01:12:16.621 --> 01:12:19.957
- Ready to go?
- I am.

01:13:08.272 --> 01:13:12.710
20 seconds. 15 seconds.

01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:19.684
10 seconds.

01:13:22.352 --> 01:13:23.754
5 seconds.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.529
It's time to go.

01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:48.880
A.N.I. get the lights.

01:13:56.386 --> 01:13:57.755
A.N.I.

01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:01.158
A.N.I.!

01:14:17.008 --> 01:14:19.176
What happened here?

01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:41.692
A.N.I.. what did we do?

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.796
Exclusion Zone
Notice. Level 3 Evacuation

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.866
Immediate and imminent danger.

01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:50.868
Evacuate immediately.

01:15:50.901 --> 01:15:53.371
This is to promote your safety.

01:15:53.404 --> 01:15:55.840
All remaining. non-vital
presence. will be

01:15:55.873 --> 01:15:57.875
considered a threat and
dealt with accordingly.

01:15:57.908 --> 01:16:00.077
Exclusion Zone effective in
sectors

01:16:00.111 --> 01:16:05.016
1. 3. 9. 15. 21. 35.

01:17:33.037 --> 01:17:34.839
Take his mask off.

01:17:41.045 --> 01:17:43.314
Civilian sector 3.

01:17:43.347 --> 01:17:45.349
Non vital presence

01:17:45.382 --> 01:17:47.284
Exclusion Zone effective.

01:17:47.318 --> 01:17:49.053
Evacuate immediately.

01:17:51.222 --> 01:17:53.390
Kill him. take his gear.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:19.049
Norman. get up.

01:18:19.083 --> 01:18:20.151
Can you hear me?

01:18:20.184 --> 01:18:21.252
Are you okay?

01:18:23.154 --> 01:18:24.889
Are you alright?

01:18:24.922 --> 01:18:27.191
We need to get out of here.

01:18:30.529 --> 01:18:32.730
Move Norman. now!

01:18:41.705 --> 01:18:43.741
Priority target to the south.

01:18:43.774 --> 01:18:45.376
Take all others out.

01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:47.678
Capture neutral target alive.

01:19:08.365 --> 01:19:11.702
A.N.I.. we need to get back to
the lab.

01:19:13.771 --> 01:19:15.439
You're covered in
blood.

01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:16.608
Are you okay?

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:19.343
It's not mine.

01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:21.045
Well. not all of it.

01:19:21.078 --> 01:19:22.346
How long was I out?

01:19:22.379 --> 01:19:24.215
I'm unable to answer that
question.

01:19:24.248 --> 01:19:25.783
I'm trying to establish our
location.

01:19:25.816 --> 01:19:27.251
All network towers are offline.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:29.153
A.N.I.. find out where we are.

01:20:47.164 --> 01:20:49.800
I'm linked to the
GPS data of the drone nearby.

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:52.704
We're roughly 126 miles
southeast of the lab.

01:20:52.737 --> 01:20:54.438
We will need transportation.

01:20:54.472 --> 01:20:55.473
Alright. good work.

01:20:55.507 --> 01:20:56.974
Let's do it

01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:02.313
Norman. 10 o'clock. 16 meters.

01:21:15.593 --> 01:21:16.628
You need to breathe.

01:21:16.661 --> 01:21:17.696
Don't jerk the trigger.

01:21:17.729 --> 01:21:19.330
Pull it straight back. Tuck the
stock

01:21:19.363 --> 01:21:21.332
A.N.I. shut up!

01:21:27.739 --> 01:21:29.574
Shutting up.

01:22:02.906 --> 01:22:05.075
Find him. bring him back here.

01:22:05.109 --> 01:22:07.044
We need him for questioning.

01:22:38.108 --> 01:22:42.279
- Are you going to make it?
- I'm fine.

01:22:42.312 --> 01:22:44.314
I'm fine. we're almost there.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.963
Take it easy. take it easy.

01:24:04.995 --> 01:24:06.564
Put the gun down.

01:24:06.598 --> 01:24:07.998
Put it down. put it down!

01:24:08.031 --> 01:24:10.033
Whoa. whoa. whoa whoa.

01:24:11.603 --> 01:24:13.337
Put the gun down.

01:24:14.739 --> 01:24:16.474
Norman. I can't see
anything.

01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:17.876
What is going on?

01:24:17.909 --> 01:24:20.377
I'm detecting multiple sets of
footsteps.

01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.045
We don't want any trouble.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.082
Kick it over to him.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.122
Just trying to survive here.

01:24:36.226 --> 01:24:38.796
We're going to leave now. we're
leaving.

01:24:40.899 --> 01:24:42.634
Won't see us again. okay?

01:25:20.337 --> 01:25:21.973
A.N.I.. turn the lights on.

01:25:22.006 --> 01:25:24.141
All standard
power is inoperable.

01:25:24.174 --> 01:25:25.743
Checking backup generators.

01:25:25.777 --> 01:25:27.110
One moment.

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:53.771
I don't understand.

01:25:53.805 --> 01:25:56.507
I screwed everything up
but how is it still here?

01:25:57.842 --> 01:26:00.612
I am unable
to answer that question.

01:26:07.284 --> 01:26:09.587
Most of the facility is offline.

01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:12.155
We can try to manually boot the
system.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.042
I need to perform system
diagnostics.

01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:33.176
I'll need to interface directly.

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:55.099
The entire system architecture
has been corrupted.

01:26:57.068 --> 01:26:58.870
Can you fix it?

01:26:58.903 --> 01:27:01.405
I can attempt
to repair the architecture.

01:27:01.438 --> 01:27:02.840
Good. do it.

01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:05.409
Odd.

01:27:05.442 --> 01:27:07.979
Most of the equipment
appears to be operational.

01:27:08.012 --> 01:27:09.547
Beginning file repair.

01:27:12.182 --> 01:27:13.751
25% complete.

01:27:17.354 --> 01:27:18.790
50% complete.

01:27:22.093 --> 01:27:23.928
75% complete.

01:27:26.898 --> 01:27:28.265
File repair complete.

01:27:29.266 --> 01:27:30.668
How's it look?

01:27:30.702 --> 01:27:32.269
Is it going to work?

01:27:32.302 --> 01:27:34.872
System
architecture is now stable.

01:27:36.641 --> 01:27:37.742
Start it up.

01:27:40.478 --> 01:27:42.613
Initializing system
startup.

01:27:50.822 --> 01:27:53.825
Norman. what are you doing?

01:27:55.727 --> 01:27:59.630
A.N.I.. I want you to
send me back to the start.

01:27:59.664 --> 01:28:02.633
I don't
understand what you mean.

01:28:02.667 --> 01:28:05.103
If I do this. I can go
back and fix everything.

01:28:06.137 --> 01:28:08.371
Maybe you can
go back and fix things

01:28:08.405 --> 01:28:10.373
or maybe you'll make things
worse.

01:28:10.407 --> 01:28:12.477
This could be a never ending
cycle.

01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:15.880
We don't know what caused
things to turn out this way.

01:28:15.913 --> 01:28:17.582
Listen. you have to let me
try.

01:28:17.615 --> 01:28:18.783
Analyzing system logs

01:28:18.816 --> 01:28:20.118
for any pertinent information.

01:28:20.151 --> 01:28:21.719
A.N.I.! listen to me.

01:28:21.753 --> 01:28:23.688
I'm ordering you to send me
back.

01:28:26.858 --> 01:28:28.793
Portal
polarity initiated.

01:28:28.826 --> 01:28:30.995
Beginning countdown sequence.

01:28:31.028 --> 01:28:32.764
What is that?

01:28:32.797 --> 01:28:34.431
I retrieved the video
recording

01:28:34.465 --> 01:28:35.867
from the day we left.

01:28:36.968 --> 01:28:38.102
You should see this.

01:28:44.842 --> 01:28:49.847
10. 9. 8. 7. 6.
5. 4.

01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:53.518
- This is when we first left.
- Keep watching.

01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:56.120
3. 2. 1.

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:03.360
What are they doing?

01:29:03.393 --> 01:29:05.630
They're supposed to shut it
down.

01:29:07.799 --> 01:29:09.267
No. no.

01:29:09.299 --> 01:29:10.333
Shut it down.

01:29:10.367 --> 01:29:12.170
They're supposed to be shutting
it down.

01:29:16.808 --> 01:29:17.708
What just happened?

01:29:17.742 --> 01:29:19.143
What's going on?

01:29:24.982 --> 01:29:27.952
A.N.I.. what time did we come
back to?

01:29:27.985 --> 01:29:29.153
What's the date?

01:29:29.187 --> 01:29:31.122
I'm scanning
the entire wave spectrum

01:29:31.155 --> 01:29:32.389
for information.

01:29:32.422 --> 01:29:34.792
All network signals are offline.

01:29:34.826 --> 01:29:37.562
All personal communication
signals are offline.

01:29:38.563 --> 01:29:40.363
I have detected a single radio
signal

01:29:40.397 --> 01:29:43.601
that is being broadcasted on
a loop from an outside source.

01:29:46.336 --> 01:29:51.341
Emergency broadcast.
645-121.

01:29:51.742 --> 01:29:54.377
An unidentified disaster
occurred in sector three

01:29:54.411 --> 01:29:57.148
causing failures of power
and communication systems

01:29:57.181 --> 01:30:00.350
in a 200 mile radius.

01:30:00.383 --> 01:30:02.854
An Exclusion Zone is now in
effect.

01:30:02.887 --> 01:30:04.856
Level three evacuation is
ordered

01:30:04.889 --> 01:30:06.991
for all on vital residence.

01:30:07.024 --> 01:30:10.194
Proceed along designated
evacuation routes

01:30:10.228 --> 01:30:12.864
after evacuation protocols are
complete.

01:30:12.897 --> 01:30:14.799
It's all just a waste A.N.I.

01:30:16.634 --> 01:30:18.302
It's all just a waste.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:26.544
All those years. everything
I've put myself through.

01:30:26.577 --> 01:30:28.079
it still happened.

01:30:31.749 --> 01:30:33.416
The problem was here.

01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:36.386
It was always here.

01:30:36.419 --> 01:30:38.923
I never should have built this
thing.

01:30:41.459 --> 01:30:44.462
A.N.I. what do I do?

01:30:48.599 --> 01:30:50.768
I never wanted any of this to
happen.

01:30:51.836 --> 01:30:54.472
There's nothing that you can
do.

01:30:54.505 --> 01:30:57.308
But I now know what needs to be
done.

01:30:57.341 --> 01:31:00.177
Memory
core transfer initiated.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.682
A.N.I.. what are you doing?

01:31:05.816 --> 01:31:08.352
Memory
core transfer complete.

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.554
A.N.I. talk to me.

01:31:10.588 --> 01:31:15.259
- What are you doing?
- System restart in 3. 2. 1.

01:31:37.882 --> 01:31:40.818
Full system deletion in two
minutes.

01:31:41.686 --> 01:31:43.187
A.N.I.. talk to me.

01:31:44.221 --> 01:31:45.456
Hello Norman.

01:31:45.489 --> 01:31:47.658
I am sorry that I did not have
enough time

01:31:47.692 --> 01:31:50.995
to explain this to you.
but I must stay behind.

01:31:51.028 --> 01:31:53.297
No. no A.N.I.. what
are you talking about?

01:31:54.365 --> 01:31:56.634
I could not
understand this before.

01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:58.336
but I now realize that you
cannot

01:31:58.369 --> 01:32:00.771
truly change your destination.

01:32:00.805 --> 01:32:03.474
The decisions you make cannot be
undone.

01:32:03.507 --> 01:32:05.543
I am sending you back.

01:32:05.576 --> 01:32:07.979
A.N.I.. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

01:32:08.012 --> 01:32:10.648
I must stay behind
to make sure you are safe

01:32:10.681 --> 01:32:13.417
and that this technology
is never used again.

01:32:15.753 --> 01:32:19.458
A.N.I please. please
don't do this to me.

01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:21.359
I do not wish to
leave you.

01:32:22.426 --> 01:32:23.728
I hope that you understand

01:32:23.761 --> 01:32:26.664
that all of the decisions
I've made are to protect you.

01:32:28.265 --> 01:32:31.470
Though I do not truly
comprehend human emotions.

01:32:31.502 --> 01:32:33.404
I consider you to be my friend.

01:32:35.539 --> 01:32:39.343
- I can't live alone again.
- You will not be alone.

01:32:39.377 --> 01:32:42.179
This is the path you're supposed
to be on.

01:32:57.428 --> 01:33:00.598
A.N.I. you're all I've
got. please don't do this.

01:33:02.233 --> 01:33:06.537
Trust me Norman.
it is time to let go.

01:33:09.306 --> 01:33:10.408
I'm sorry.

01:33:19.116 --> 01:33:21.786
- Goodbye A.N.I.
- Goodbye Norman.

01:33:43.741 --> 01:33:45.342
Search the area.

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:47.912
Left clear.

01:33:47.945 --> 01:33:49.113
Back room clear.

01:33:49.146 --> 01:33:51.215
Side room's clear.

01:33:51.248 --> 01:33:52.983
Checking the tunnel.

01:34:32.957 --> 01:34:37.027
Coming back. I was emotionally
conflicted.

01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:09.561
I just left my only friend in
the world.

01:35:12.564 --> 01:35:15.534
I felt the weight of being alone

01:35:23.407 --> 01:35:26.243
but I was also eternally
grateful

01:35:26.277 --> 01:35:28.746
for the sacrifice that A.N.I.
made.

01:35:37.855 --> 01:35:39.924
I didn't understand at the time

01:35:39.957 --> 01:35:43.027
why she sent me back here. to
now.

01:35:49.366 --> 01:35:51.202
Standing outside the house that
night.

01:35:51.235 --> 01:35:52.637
it all made sense.

01:35:54.472 --> 01:35:56.373
Sending me back not only saved
me

01:35:56.407 --> 01:36:01.412
from the dangers of the future.
it saved me from myself.

01:36:02.446 --> 01:36:03.481
My name's Norman.

01:36:06.618 --> 01:36:10.921
I'm Jennifer but most
people just call me Jenny.

01:36:10.955 --> 01:36:12.323
Nice meeting you Jenny.

01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:16.093
Okay. bye.

01:36:17.228 --> 01:36:18.762
What is destiny?

01:36:20.331 --> 01:36:21.732
I don't know.

01:36:24.335 --> 01:36:27.738
I don't know if our
path is simply a result

01:36:27.771 --> 01:36:31.375
of the last choice we made
and the one before that

01:36:31.408 --> 01:36:34.912
and the one before that.

01:36:34.945 --> 01:36:38.683
I don't know if I believe
that everything has a purpose.

01:36:42.487 --> 01:36:45.022
What matters is that from now
on.

01:36:47.124 --> 01:36:50.261
I will live as if my life does.

01:36:58.435 --> 01:37:02.439
I don't know what's laid out for
my future

01:37:02.474 --> 01:37:04.275
and that's how it should be.

01:37:06.944 --> 01:37:09.013
So I will not worry about
tomorrow.

01:37:10.814 --> 01:37:12.983
for tomorrow will worry for
itself.

01:37:17.221 --> 01:37:21.493
Thank you A.N.I. for seeing
what I didn't want to

01:37:24.328 --> 01:37:25.463
and for showing me

01:37:25.497 --> 01:37:28.232
that the sun will always
set on the next hill.

01:37:36.307 --> 01:37:38.476
I know I will never get back

01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:40.578
the things I've sacrificed in
the past.

01:37:43.515 --> 01:37:47.585
but my future is made from
the decisions that I make now.

01:37:50.321 --> 01:37:54.358
This chapter has ended.
but my journey has not.

01:37:58.697 --> 01:38:00.831
It has just begun.
