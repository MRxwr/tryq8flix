00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:37.737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The title of this country has now become the past</font>

3
00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:42.145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">20 years ago. the Jiang of peace suddenly appeared.</font>

4
00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:44.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aliens from Outer space.</font>

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We call them "heaven and Man."</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heaven and man to develop Jiang</font>

7
00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:55.356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shogunate gave in to heaven. and gradually became a puppet</font>

8
00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:58.988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The busy war that once erupted to expel heaven and man</font>

9
00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many of the most valiant Patriots appeared.</font>

10
00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:05.664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the casualties. the final declaration of defeat</font>

11
00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:10.904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heaven and man worried about the uprising reappearance. promulgated the Waste Knife order</font>

12
00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:14.937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leading to a decline in the warrior's path</font>

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong! Wrong again!</font>

14
00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:32.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chimpanzees and amoeba are better than you to hit the cash register.</font>

15
00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:35.631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I've only learned fencing ...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention Samurai! Worse than dog poop!</font>

19
00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:54.679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without the sword and status. the warrior loses his dignity.</font>

20
00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:59.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boss. forget the cash register and get me some milk.</font>

21
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.080

00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:11.189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want? Not afraid to violate the Waste knife order!</font>

36
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a wooden knife.</font>

37
00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:19.667

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man said he was a samurai. too rough.</font>

47
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:59.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a rogue. The eyes are too righteous.</font>

51
00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:08.714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the cereal is too much to eat.</font>

52
00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:14.350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then they chew and they're all in the mouth.</font>

67
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:25.023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. the texture is too low.</font>

68
00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a karaoke band with Aru.</font>

69
00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:29.655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way. I cut it with my computer.</font>

70
00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:33.832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't put your computer cut on the big screen!</font>

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how many names do you have?</font>

72
00:05:36.404 --> 00:05:38.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are the main character.</font>

73
00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last one to read Aru.</font>

75
00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:44.709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't ask you to explain.</font>

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you talking about?</font>

78
00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The scene at the beginning of the restaurant was very unnecessary. Aru.</font>

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:54.582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God Le. some viewers may not have read the original.</font>

80
00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:59.018

147
00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:41.707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway. it's good to catch a unicorn.</font>

148
00:09:42.047 --> 00:09:43.310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Aru.</font>

149
00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:45.848

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for the advice. by the way.</font>

300
00:20:15.072 --> 00:20:18.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been a random homicide around here lately.</font>

301
00:20:18.609 --> 00:20:23.142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the wig looks like a chick.</font>

302
00:20:23.147 --> 00:20:24.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a wig. my name is Gui.</font>

303
00:20:25.348 --> 00:20:29.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not the one who's going to be chopped off.</font>

304

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. I'm not the Shogun's lackey.</font>

310
00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:16.097

311
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard there were random killers around here.</font>

312
00:21:23.841 --> 00:21:26.266

313
00:21:28.011 --> 00:21:29.445

318
00:21:52.002 --> 00:21:55.133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. that's so weak.</font>

319
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:03.278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The next one is a random homicide

327
00:22:21.096 --> 00:22:25.196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The killer is a random killer who's been spotted in the alley lately.</font>

328

335
00:22:44.786 --> 00:22:48.749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't go out tonight.</font>

345
00:23:40.474 --> 00:23:42.137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't talk about people inside.</font>

346
00:23:42.644 --> 00:23:44.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all about Q-Tai.</font>

347

00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:16.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're looking for wigs.</font>

745
00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:22.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to move!</font>

746
00:57:22.673 --> 00:57:26.636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's responsible for the cut?</font>

747
00:57:30.681 --> 00:57:32.878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kidding. huh?</font>

748
00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:38.313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're kidding.</font>

749
00:57:38.656 --> 00:57:39.715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has</font>

750
00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:43.754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not laughing.</font>

751
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ding Chun</font>

752
00:58:13.689 --> 00:58:16.456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only I had already saved her.</font>

753
00:58:17.693 --> 00:58:22.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's not bad. maybe even I was killed.</font>

754
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:26.799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elizabeth was cut in half and disappeared.</font>

755
00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:30.034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will extraterrestrial life die out?</font>

756
00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:31.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell me.</font>

757
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:35.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know the answer.</font>

758
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This big ship. huh?</font>

759
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a taste of cinnamon here?</font>

760
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So God is happy in there?</font>

761
00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:56.665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to save her.</font>

762
00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How to sneak in.</font>

763
00:59:03.272 --> 00:59:06.666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of ronin. each one face fierce</font>

764
00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. what are the kids and the big dogs doing here?</font>

765
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ship is so cool!</font>

766
00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. it's cool!</font>

767
00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go up.</font>

768
00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I adore the ancient times of the cosmic battleship.</font>

769
00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:25.418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really fake?
- Really</font>

770
00:59:25.661 --> 00:59:28.359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like the island you're the pie.</font>

771
00:59:29.531 --> 00:59:31.957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I envy the man who can ship.</font>

772
00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:35.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Ancient times. only you can hit the wave cannon."</font>

773
00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Island. you're right.</font>

774
00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Yes. please follow me."</font>

775
00:59:39.141 --> 00:59:41.270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forward!</font>

776
00:59:41.276 --> 00:59:43.576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's going to give you a lift?</font>

777
00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:46.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's better to give you a ride!
- Oops</font>

778
00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:49.181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inversion is important.</font>

779
00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:51.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to let you ride.</font>

780
00:59:53.856 --> 00:59:56.316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a really strong groove.</font>

781
00:59:56.325 --> 00:59:57.988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up! Four-eyed frog!</font>

782
00:59:58.527 --> 01:00:03.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not qualified to comment on my groove skill.</font>

783
01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:04.593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the hell out!</font>

784
01:00:05.634 --> 01:00:06.693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roller!</font>

785
01:00:06.702 --> 01:00:07.829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sudden rage ...</font>

786
01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:13.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the guard?</font>

787
01:00:15.377 --> 01:00:17.677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't hurry up. even God's music is in trouble ...</font>

788
01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:22.707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't talk to a.</font>

789
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to pay the rent.</font>

790
01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:33.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good</font>

791
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:36.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You first.</font>

792
01:00:36.898 --> 01:00:38.298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want</font>

793
01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:40.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a trauma patient.</font>

794
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:44.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As the saying goes. "help wounded Xianchan."</font>

795
01:00:45.273 --> 01:00:47.574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never heard of it.</font>

796
01:00:48.577 --> 01:00:52.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ... You help me find a reason to stall.</font>

797
01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:56.708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right</font>

798
01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:01.813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it comes</font>

799
01:01:03.357 --> 01:01:05.350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. not the mother-in-law.</font>

800
01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:08.226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter with you?</font>

801
01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:09.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me...</font>

802
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:11.222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're looking for a ...</font>

803
01:01:11.231 --> 01:01:12.597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am here</font>

804
01:01:15.769 --> 01:01:18.229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. come on in.</font>

805
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you'd come.</font>

806
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a real ugly fix.</font>

807
01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:41.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the red cherry and get hurt. and dare to escape.</font>

808
01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:44.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you ...</font>

809
01:01:44.598 --> 01:01:48.333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready to cut the belly apology? Okada</font>

810
01:01:48.735 --> 01:01:52.732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to take my red cherry back even if I lose my arm.</font>

811
01:01:52.739 --> 01:01:54.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could be praised.</font>

812
01:01:55.809 --> 01:01:59.077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's worth it to accumulate some experience.</font>

813
01:01:59.546 --> 01:02:03.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been so in love lately.</font>

814
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:08.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if the Shogun's lackeys knew about the existence of red cherry?</font>

815
01:02:08.488 --> 01:02:12.382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you were sparring with Bantian. there was a real choice.</font>

816
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will hinder Your Excellency's help!</font>

817
01:02:16.163 --> 01:02:17.358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really</font>

818
01:02:17.831 --> 01:02:19.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Gui to Bantian</font>

819
01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:22.431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A preference for an object that stimulates the help of a grown-up.</font>

820
01:02:22.803 --> 01:02:24.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you thinking?</font>

821
01:02:24.972 --> 01:02:30.142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're strong? Less narcissistic over there.</font>

822
01:02:30.476 --> 01:02:34.109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can win Gui and Ban Tian. all are red cherry ...</font>

823
01:02:36.616 --> 01:02:37.983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh</font>

824
01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:40.946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't blame me.</font>

825
01:02:42.689 --> 01:02:44.147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't do it.</font>

826
01:02:45.926 --> 01:02:48.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's red cherry.</font>

827
01:02:51.498 --> 01:02:55.495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The extent of its recent intrusion has increased</font>

828
01:02:56.869 --> 01:03:01.470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems to have taken my body as its own.</font>

829
01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd better pay attention to my speech.</font>

830
01:03:11.484 --> 01:03:14.513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came to me to tell the truth.</font>

831
01:03:15.888 --> 01:03:20.785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now. don't lie to me. it's just a demon knife.</font>

832
01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:23.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is that?</font>

833
01:03:24.563 --> 01:03:27.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who made the monster?</font>

834
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:34.901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okada. you ...</font>

835
01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:37.472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're too much of a hindrance.</font>

836
01:03:39.712 --> 01:03:43.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are gathered to be with the high firs</font>

837
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:45.773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Overthrow the corrupt government</font>

838
01:03:47.587 --> 01:03:48.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can also say</font>

839
01:03:50.356 --> 01:03:53.214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to be new legends.</font>

840
01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:56.662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those guys are always in front of the show.</font>

841
01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so unsightly.</font>

842
01:04:00.233 --> 01:04:02.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're blocking our way.</font>

843
01:04:03.102 --> 01:04:06.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to send them to old legends.</font>

844
01:04:07.206 --> 01:04:10.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then to build a new legend.</font>

845
01:04:11.845 --> 01:04:15.272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not going to be them next to that guy.</font>

846
01:04:17.116 --> 01:04:18.539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's us!</font>

847
01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:20.579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Red Cherry is ...</font>

848
01:04:21.487 --> 01:04:24.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To imitate my father's name.</font>

849
01:04:24.889 --> 01:04:27.349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons made for warships</font>

850
01:04:28.427 --> 01:04:31.092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It builds artificial intelligence.</font>

851
01:04:31.097 --> 01:04:33.988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can be parasitic on the user. manipulating its body.</font>

852
01:04:35.433 --> 01:04:38.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The battle process will be computerized.</font>

853
01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ability to upgrade by experience</font>

854
01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:43.533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a life knife.</font>

855
01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:45.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a parasitic beast.</font>

856
01:04:46.211 --> 01:04:48.238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can he talk later?</font>

857
01:04:48.246 --> 01:04:50.739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he say my name is Mickey?</font>

858
01:04:50.749 --> 01:04:54.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one of the Edo people would do that.</font>

859
01:04:55.287 --> 01:04:58.019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. stop my brother.</font>

860
01:04:58.824 --> 01:05:00.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaoshan those people.</font>

861
01:05:00.959 --> 01:05:04.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To use it to get Edo into war.</font>

862
01:05:05.664 --> 01:05:07.964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is crazy</font>

863
01:05:09.267 --> 01:05:13.230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the age of war with cannon. make this demon knife</font>

864
01:05:14.172 --> 01:05:18.237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you wanted to use it to overthrow the shogunate.</font>

865
01:05:18.242 --> 01:05:20.543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's crazy.</font>

866
01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:26.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The person who realizes the crazy pioneering. is heroes</font>

867
01:05:28.353 --> 01:05:30.813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not raving about what I can't do.</font>

868
01:05:32.324 --> 01:05:33.816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want them to know.</font>

869
01:05:34.692 --> 01:05:38.062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Samurai and the sword are not extinct.</font>

870
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:43.425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not interested in your calculations or your goals.</font>

871
01:05:44.402 --> 01:05:47.067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A knife maker is only born to forge a good knife.</font>

872
01:05:48.006 --> 01:05:50.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing I want to say is ...</font>

873
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:53.936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This knife</font>

874
01:05:54.879 --> 01:05:57.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing to chop!</font>

875
01:05:57.015 --> 01:05:59.076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know the ins and outs.</font>

876
01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:03.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your brother is involved in a very bad event.</font>

877
01:06:04.489 --> 01:06:05.388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So</font>

878
01:06:05.723 --> 01:06:11.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm being used by your brother.</font>

879
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:18.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted me to find a knife. but I was trying to suck my blood.</font>

880
01:06:18.669 --> 01:06:22.666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or do I have a grudge against him?</font>

881
01:06:22.973 --> 01:06:26.070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe both.</font>

882
01:06:26.911 --> 01:06:30.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is really too much.</font>

883
01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:34.040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know all about it?</font>

884
01:06:34.885 --> 01:06:38.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowing the purpose of his brother. he was silent.</font>

885
01:06:39.657 --> 01:06:42.458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you're begging me to stop your brother?</font>

886
01:06:43.093 --> 01:06:45.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is your cheek a phone book?</font>

887
01:06:45.929 --> 01:06:48.560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's using the phone book.</font>

888
01:06:49.199 --> 01:06:52.627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. it's my fault.</font>

889
01:06:53.937 --> 01:06:56.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right. I know all about it.</font>

890
01:06:57.974 --> 01:07:01.675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my brother will be in danger.</font>

891
01:07:03.013 --> 01:07:04.676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I haven't told anyone yet.</font>

892
01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:08.751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love my brother's sister.</font>

893
01:07:09.953 --> 01:07:13.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother's helping.</font>

894
01:07:13.857 --> 01:07:15.189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A!</font>

895
01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:18.788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swords are just chopping knives.</font>

896
01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:21.092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how hard you forge</font>

897
01:07:21.098 --> 01:07:22.623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't choose the holder.</font>

898
01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:26.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what my dead father said.</font>

899
01:07:27.237 --> 01:07:30.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This sentence is deep in our hearts</font>

900
01:07:31.808 --> 01:07:34.575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother is an idiot who knows how to forge a knife.</font>

901
01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:39.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was obsessed with his work and
wanted to surpass his father's achievements.</font>

902
01:07:39.982 --> 01:07:43.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a long way from master Ren Tie.</font>

903
01:07:43.686 --> 01:07:47.615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His dad's a teacher.</font>

904
01:07:47.623 --> 01:07:50.014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son probably can't count on it.</font>

905
01:07:52.462 --> 01:07:57.028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was obsessed and started studying mechanical electricians.</font>

906
01:08:05.575 --> 01:08:08.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when he started to mingle with strange people.</font>

907
01:08:09.512 --> 01:08:13.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm aware that those people are not good.</font>

908
01:08:13.683 --> 01:08:15.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But never stopped him.</font>

909
01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:24.583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told myself to concentrate on forging a knife.</font>

910
01:08:25.094 --> 01:08:27.257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do a good job of industry</font>

911
01:08:27.964 --> 01:08:31.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know knives are just chopping knives.</font>

912
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that knives are just props for killing.</font>

913
01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not reconciled.</font>

914
01:08:42.477 --> 01:08:48.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother's work is so bad.</font>

915
01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:50.514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's too late.</font>

916
01:08:51.253 --> 01:08:55.057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things are happening to situations I can't stop.</font>

917
01:08:55.925 --> 01:08:59.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what to do</font>

918
01:09:02.431 --> 01:09:06.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Needless to say you. I'm helpless.</font>

919
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:12.464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see. I'm seriously wounded.</font>

920
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confusion in the brain</font>

921
01:09:16.978 --> 01:09:18.037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey</font>

922
01:09:18.847 --> 01:09:22.548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want your condolences.</font>

923
01:09:23.185 --> 01:09:25.142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sick of it.</font>

924
01:09:25.353 --> 01:09:26.685

927
01:09:39.867 --> 01:09:43.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me another bowl of Aru.</font>

928
01:09:44.405 --> 01:09:46.034

01:09:56.885 --> 01:10:00.278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A girl of this age</font>

932
01:10:00.287 --> 01:10:04.318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The food looks most beautiful.</font>

933
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pathetic to eat alone.</font>

934
01:10:07.195 --> 01:10:08.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I arranged it.</font>

935
01:10:09.063 --> 01:10:12.958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God has finished eating again! To lead overwhelmingly!</font>

936
01:10:12.967 --> 01:10:14.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me another bowl!</font>

937
01:10:14.135 --> 01:10:17.266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The food on board will be eaten up.</font>

938
01:10:17.272 --> 01:10:18.866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill her!</font>

939
01:10:19.473 --> 01:10:23.538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you kill her without giving her information?</font>

940
01:10:24.079 --> 01:10:25.775

1284
01:35:40.843 --> 01:35:43.542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you this is not a place for kids.</font>

1285
01:35:47.617 --> 01:35:50.213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not a child. I am Gui</font>

01:35:55.624 --> 01:36:00.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. this is an unexpected visitor.</font>

1289
01:36:00.095 --> 01:36:03.899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't expect to see the dead here.</font>

1290
01:36:04.534 --> 01:36:07.097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still have a memento of the world.</font>

1291
01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back from the afterlife.</font>

1292
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Being framed by a former partner. I can't be reborn.</font>

1293
01:36:17.146 --> 01:36:19.309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that right. Gao Shan?</font>

1294
01:36:20.649 --> 01:36:23.109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We take turns talking about partners</font>

1295
01:36:26.388 --> 01:36:28.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a hat I can't afford.</font>

1296
01:36:29.825 --> 01:36:32.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still have that stuff.</font>

1297
01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:39.496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like we're all stupid.</font>

1298
01:36:43.439 --> 01:36:47.334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it block the red cherry from hitting you?</font>

1299
01:36:49.278 --> 01:36:52.238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The past should cherish</font>

1300
01:36:53.015 --> 01:36:58.014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether it's your instructions or the guy's arbitrariness.</font>

1301
01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:04.749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't turn a blind eye to your present behavior.</font>

1302
01:37:06.294 --> 01:37:07.227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sorry</font>

1303
01:37:08.029 --> 01:37:10.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To get you two involved in a dispute.</font>

1304
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:14.666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to decide this is my personal lockdown.</font>

1305
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:21.174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be found dead easier to snoop around.</font>

1306
01:37:21.176 --> 01:37:22.907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously. it's more obvious.</font>

1307
01:37:23.478 --> 01:37:25.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. wig.</font>

1308
01:37:26.514 --> 01:37:29.145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to make you run a special trip.</font>

1309
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:32.744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my ambition will not end here.</font>

1310
01:37:33.221 --> 01:37:36.113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute! Gaoshan! Let's Talk!</font>

1311
01:37:37.159 --> 01:37:38.616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is for us. Aru.</font>

1312
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to have a long conversation with the firs.</font>

1313
01:37:42.097 --> 01:37:43.030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two?</font>

1314
01:37:43.932 --> 01:37:46.027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going back will make you pay.</font>

1315
01:37:46.902 --> 01:37:50.193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If anything happens to you. I can't explain it to silver.</font>

1316
01:37:50.204 --> 01:37:52.071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it.</font>

1317
01:37:52.073 --> 01:37:55.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you lied to us.</font>

1318
01:37:55.177 --> 01:37:56.839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Add vinegar to kelp for one year</font>

1319
01:37:58.146 --> 01:37:59.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you!</font>

1320
01:38:24.372 --> 01:38:26.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like you're full of two.</font>

1321
01:38:27.108 --> 01:38:29.534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I knew. I'd kill you first.</font>

1322
01:38:29.544 --> 01:38:32.310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't underestimate the vice-Chief of the real-choice group.</font>

1323
01:38:40.822 --> 01:38:42.279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call myself a feminist.</font>

1324
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:43.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the devil.</font>

1325
01:38:43.892 --> 01:38:47.753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate people for messing up my delicate plans.</font>

1326
01:38:47.762 --> 01:38:49.629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is feminism.</font>

1327
01:38:50.298 --> 01:38:51.790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.</font>

1328
01:38:51.799 --> 01:38:54.622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

1329
01:38:54.635 --> 01:38:57.265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your position here?</font>

1330
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not busy. and it's not a real choice.</font>

1331
01:39:03.111 --> 01:39:05.069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Certainly not our accomplice.</font>

1332
01:39:05.879 --> 01:39:07.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of organization are you?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the stupidest warriors in the whole universe! You bastard!</font>

1335
01:39:20.995 --> 01:39:22.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you doing</font>

1336
01:39:27.401 --> 01:39:28.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys ...</font>

1338
01:39:32.106 --> 01:39:35.533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going to grab the cedar. so watch out.</font>

1339
01:39:35.875 --> 01:39:38.267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your body is still wounded ...</font>

1340
01:39:38.278 --> 01:39:40.339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're almost there.</font>

1341
01:39:40.814 --> 01:39:43.741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The police are going to do what the police do.</font>

1342
01:39:46.586 --> 01:39:47.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not the.</font>

01:40:10.476 --> 01:40:12.935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My eyes are completely invisible.</font>

1345
01:40:13.747 --> 01:40:16.138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can only feel the light</font>

1346
01:40:17.718 --> 01:40:21.145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a shining presence.</font>

1347

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very sharp silver.</font>

1348
01:40:27.426 --> 01:40:29.658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's so strange ...</font>

1349
01:40:30.130 --> 01:40:32.396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The light that you emit</font>

1350
01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:35.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even look at it.</font>

1351
01:40:41.007 --> 01:40:42.134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

1352
01:40:42.408 --> 01:40:44.332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the damage like?</font>

1353
01:40:44.343 --> 01:40:47.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you out of your mind?</font>

1354
01:40:48.047 --> 01:40:51.907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in bad shape. aren't you?</font>

1355
01:40:52.651 --> 01:40:55.919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look really bad. diarrhea?</font>

1356
01:40:55.921 --> 01:40:58.313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one with the stomach.</font>

1357
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:15.469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. what's wrong? You're bleeding.</font>

1358
01:41:19.177 --> 01:41:23.471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. what's wrong? You're bleeding.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see. Silver came.</font>

1361
01:41:59.484 --> 01:42:01.819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was stupid.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the flesh against the ship.</font>

1363
01:42:10.328 --> 01:42:12.696

1366
01:42:22.273 --> 01:42:23.434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know that.</font>

1367
01:42:25.176 --> 01:42:27.942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens when you use red cherry?</font>

1368
01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:30.673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's your partner.</font>

1369
01:42:31.683 --> 01:42:33.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you have a problem with that?</font>

1370
01:42:33.751 --> 01:42:38.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the way he chooses.</font>

1371
01:42:39.857 --> 01:42:42.624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the way he wants to die.</font>

1372
01:42:43.027 --> 01:42:44.052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The death of Hope?</font>

1373
01:42:44.262 --> 01:42:45.821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

1374
01:42:46.364 --> 01:42:51.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants a man with a knife.</font>

1375
01:42:52.637 --> 01:42:56.030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be the guardian of the high cedar.</font>

1376
01:42:56.408 --> 01:42:58.469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of going back to the dark</font>

1377
01:42:58.942 --> 01:43:02.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better to dive into the fire.</font>

1378
01:43:02.581 --> 01:43:04.181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His eyes were blinded by the fire</font>

1379
01:43:04.182 --> 01:43:05.776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So small. I can only see light.</font>

1380
01:43:06.284 --> 01:43:09.147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a pathetic. stupid man.</font>

1381
01:43:09.988 --> 01:43:15.351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there is beauty beyond good and evil.</font>

1382
01:43:15.893 --> 01:43:20.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a sword. his consciousness is beautiful.</font>

1383
01:43:21.432 --> 01:43:22.958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a beautiful place!</font>

1384
01:43:23.434 --> 01:43:25.826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That kind of monster is what brother wants to do?</font>

1385
01:43:26.303 --> 01:43:27.704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stop it.</font>

1386
01:43:28.272 --> 01:43:31.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to see your knife hurt anymore.</font>

1387
01:43:33.811 --> 01:43:34.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Case</font>

1388
01:43:35.645 --> 01:43:37.672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you bring that man up here?</font>

1389
01:43:38.749 --> 01:43:41.174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you bring him here to die?</font>

1390
01:43:42.419 --> 01:43:47.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think your blunt knife will win red cherry?</font>

1391
01:43:52.563 --> 01:43:53.826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can it be!</font>

1392
01:43:54.631 --> 01:43:56.589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's close to the red cherry!</font>

1393
01:43:57.768 --> 01:43:58.599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>

1394
01:43:59.537 --> 01:44:02.429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lot more powerful.</font>

1395
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:06.099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way...</font>

1396
01:44:07.078 --> 01:44:10.744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Tibetan adults. even if their physical energy
is consumed by the red tassel</font>

1397
01:44:11.014 --> 01:44:15.752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ability of the red tassel itself will be improved with the data.</font>

1398
01:44:21.592 --> 01:44:22.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way!</font>

1399
01:44:22.892 --> 01:44:26.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man grew faster than the red tassel!</font>

1400
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:28.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong...</font>

1401
01:44:29.199 --> 01:44:31.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a death fight.</font>

1402
01:44:31.735 --> 01:44:35.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To evoke the battle memory of the sleeping body?</font>

1403
01:44:36.138 --> 01:44:36.901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...</font>

1404
01:44:46.015 --> 01:44:46.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is ...</font>

1405
01:44:49.351 --> 01:44:50.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">... White Fork</font>

1406
01:45:04.566 --> 01:45:06.160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't swing ...</font>

1407
01:45:07.737 --> 01:45:09.603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The light of an eyesore ...</font>

1408
01:45:11.674 --> 01:45:15.136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get rid of this silver in any way.</font>

1409
01:45:16.545 --> 01:45:18.139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always lingering ...</font>

1410
01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:30.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess you used to practice in the dojo.</font>

1411
01:45:30.759 --> 01:45:33.959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is the first time in combat.</font>

1412
01:45:35.265 --> 01:45:37.656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your hands are shaking!</font>

1413
01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:41.959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1414
01:45:44.039 --> 01:45:48.435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the sword looks like a lot of it.</font>

1415
01:45:48.777 --> 01:45:53.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I used to play pencils like that.</font>

1416
01:45:53.783 --> 01:45:56.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incredible.</font>

1417
01:45:56.385 --> 01:46:00.348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. incredible.</font>

1418
01:46:00.356 --> 01:46:04.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see. there are many!</font>

1419
01:46:04.559 --> 01:46:07.189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to distract me?</font>

1420
01:46:14.969 --> 01:46:17.132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a terrible swordsman.</font>

1421
01:46:20.242 --> 01:46:23.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I win by the head.</font>

1422
01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:32.852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy's too weak to win.</font>

1423
01:46:34.923 --> 01:46:36.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm interested in this pain.</font>

1424
01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:06.012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Recruit</font>

1425
01:47:10.459 --> 01:47:11.586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's dead.</font>

1426
01:47:18.333 --> 01:47:23.070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">100 years before I tried to stab me in the back! You little brat!</font>

1427
01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:44.150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A!</font>

1428
01:47:44.425 --> 01:47:45.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A</font>

1429
01:47:51.599 --> 01:47:52.828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

1430
01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okada?</font>

1431
01:47:59.908 --> 01:48:03.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see the 3-year-old sister of God.</font>

1432
01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:05.038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Predecessors!</font>

1433
01:48:06.679 --> 01:48:09.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To hide. have you lost your mind?</font>

1434
01:48:10.785 --> 01:48:13.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His consciousness was diverted by the red cherry ...</font>

1435
01:48:13.554 --> 01:48:17.187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn. the last thing that's going to happen.</font>

1436
01:48:24.697 --> 01:48:27.863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's completely over the red cherry.</font>

1437
01:48:28.701 --> 01:48:32.471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The loss of self-possession. the whole body into a sword</font>

1438
01:48:33.607 --> 01:48:37.502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even the White Fork can't stop it.</font>

1439
01:48:38.779 --> 01:48:42.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the whole picture of red cherry!</font>

1440
01:48:42.783 --> 01:48:45.106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the strongest sword!</font>

1441
01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:50.815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only those who have a persistent mind
and no distractions can have</font>

1442
01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:57.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You people who are very ordinary can not stop it.</font>

1443
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't swing</font>

1444
01:49:00.266 --> 01:49:02.133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An eyesore of silver</font>

1445
01:49:04.405 --> 01:49:09.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lingering</font>

1446
01:49:12.078 --> 01:49:14.344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right there.</font>

1447
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:18.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiezi</font>

1448
01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:23.583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way! Can't let him die!</font>

1449
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:27.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't let this sword kill anyone else.</font>

1450
01:49:33.033 --> 01:49:36.096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get these tentacles loose.</font>

1451
01:49:41.774 --> 01:49:42.935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand</font>

1452
01:49:43.509 --> 01:49:47.301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me. iron son. why don't you understand me?</font>

1453
01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:50.912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been giving it all to the red tassel</font>

1454
01:49:51.717 --> 01:49:55.543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lose my conscience. my morals and everything.</font>

1455
01:49:56.455 --> 01:49:59.154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all I have.</font>

1456
01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:02.893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without it. I have nothing.</font>

1457
01:50:16.975 --> 01:50:18.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiezi</font>

1458
01:50:30.489 --> 01:50:32.823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brother ...</font>

1459
01:50:54.913 --> 01:50:56.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A!</font>

1460
01:50:56.448 --> 01:50:59.511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brother. cheer up.</font>

1461
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:07.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it</font>

1462
01:51:13.865 --> 01:51:16.358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I'd lost it.</font>

1463
01:51:18.236 --> 01:51:20.536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Outside the sword.</font>

1464
01:51:22.941 --> 01:51:24.899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mean to be human.</font>

1465
01:51:26.677 --> 01:51:28.271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A knife maker.</font>

1466
01:51:30.548 --> 01:51:34.215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Live to forge a sword</font>

1467
01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:40.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... At the end of the last ...</font>

1468
01:51:43.528 --> 01:51:48.493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the only one I can't lose</font>

1469
01:51:52.871 --> 01:51:55.399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A determination to show a flaw</font>

1470
01:51:57.575 --> 01:52:01.070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't play the strongest sword</font>

1471
01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:05.313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are not worldly possessions!</font>

1472
01:52:07.618 --> 01:52:10.214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no such thing as worldly possessions</font>

1473
01:52:13.223 --> 01:52:17.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you left everything to live for the sword?</font>

1474
01:52:17.661 --> 01:52:19.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the job?</font>

1475
01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:22.595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop pretending.</font>

1476
01:52:23.702 --> 01:52:26.298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just too much trouble.</font>

1477
01:52:27.671 --> 01:52:29.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way to carry a lot of responsibility.</font>

1478
01:52:31.575 --> 01:52:36.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy with the as face of life.</font>

1479
01:52:37.614 --> 01:52:38.947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a professional.</font>

1480
01:52:49.093 --> 01:52:50.459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see.</font>

1481
01:52:52.062 --> 01:52:55.866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much power do you have in your mouth?</font>

1482
01:52:56.567 --> 01:53:00.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How sharp is your sister's knife to the whole heart?</font>

1483
01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:06.501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better keep your eyes wide open.</font>

1484
01:53:06.509 --> 01:53:10.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A. don't be silly! Don't go head-to-head with red cherry!</font>

1485
01:53:10.548 --> 01:53:11.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A</font>

1486
01:53:35.539 --> 01:53:36.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiezi</font>

1487
01:53:38.175 --> 01:53:40.533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of sword do you want to play?</font>

1488
01:53:44.615 --> 01:53:45.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sword of The Guardian</font>

1489
01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:49.741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the? The voice is too small!</font>

1490
01:53:50.854 --> 01:53:53.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sword to protect.</font>

1491
01:54:16.379 --> 01:54:18.747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sword of the special protector.</font>

1492
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:24.618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like your style.</font>

1493
01:54:27.057 --> 01:54:28.787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I ...</font>

1494
01:54:30.726 --> 01:54:33.618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not enough skill.</font>

1495
01:54:41.537 --> 01:54:42.903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiezi</font>

1496
01:54:46.309 --> 01:54:48.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to be a</font>

1497
01:54:50.746 --> 01:54:51.702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good knife maker ...</font>

1498
01:54:57.786 --> 01:54:59.710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hear you</font>

1499
01:55:01.090 --> 01:55:06.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to yell like a regular hara. I can't hear you.</font>

1500
01:55:12.402 --> 01:55:13.334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaoshan</font>

1501
01:55:14.404 --> 01:55:18.298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate you. so far</font>

1502
01:55:20.409 --> 01:55:24.612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I've always been your partner.</font>

1503
01:55:26.381 --> 01:55:30.310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When do we start to be strangers?</font>

1504
01:55:30.319 --> 01:55:32.346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want to say?</font>

1505
01:55:36.458 --> 01:55:40.626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed. our starting point is the same place.</font>

1506
01:55:41.230 --> 01:55:46.662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But since then. we've been looking at different directions.</font>

1507
01:55:48.136 --> 01:55:50.629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's on their own.</font>

1508
01:55:52.341 --> 01:55:55.575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life in different directions</font>

1509
01:55:59.648 --> 01:56:02.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't changed since then.</font>

1510
01:56:06.654 --> 01:56:10.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you lose the heart of the blade</font>

1511
01:56:11.492 --> 01:56:13.758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems to be just a freak of destruction.</font>

1512
01:56:15.063 --> 01:56:17.829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The country can certainly overthrow</font>

1513
01:56:18.433 --> 01:56:21.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your methods endanger the residents of Edo.</font>

1514
01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:24.335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't sit on it.</font>

1515
01:56:28.877 --> 01:56:30.744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The things I look at</font>

1516
01:56:33.047 --> 01:56:35.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No different.</font>

1517
01:56:37.218 --> 01:56:38.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ...</font>

1518
01:56:38.219 --> 01:56:40.143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaoshan. how dare you!</font>

1519
01:56:44.426 --> 01:56:47.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gui's head can sell a good price.</font>

1520
01:56:56.571 --> 01:56:59.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaoshan! Are you allied with heaven?</font>

1521
01:57:03.110 --> 01:57:04.305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry</font>

1522
01:57:06.147 --> 01:57:07.673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't protect him.</font>

1523
01:57:24.097 --> 01:57:27.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please listen to me.</font>

1524
01:57:28.468 --> 01:57:30.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not dead.</font>

1525
01:57:30.804 --> 01:57:35.234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like this ship is going to be ruined.</font>

1526
01:57:35.776 --> 01:57:38.339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you help me take them back?</font>

1527
01:57:40.113 --> 01:57:43.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boss. you hurt yourself like that.</font>

1528
01:57:43.484 --> 01:57:45.147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means. ah. silver.</font>

1529
01:57:45.152 --> 01:57:47.145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really. silver. you're going to die.</font>

1530
01:57:47.421 --> 01:57:51.919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. that guy's my friend.</font>

1531
01:57:52.693 --> 01:57:53.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believe me</font>

1532
01:57:54.695 --> 01:57:56.494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll convince him.</font>

1533
01:57:59.732 --> 01:58:00.791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?</font>

1534
01:58:01.935 --> 01:58:03.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. please.</font>

1535
01:58:06.072 --> 01:58:07.267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good</font>

1536
01:58:11.111 --> 01:58:14.869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. you want me to leave the red cherry?</font>

1537
01:58:17.083 --> 01:58:19.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're working with heaven.</font>

1538
01:58:20.487 --> 01:58:23.014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaoshan. you don't even have a conscience.</font>

1539
01:58:28.528 --> 01:58:29.517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's funny.</font>

1540
01:58:31.497 --> 01:58:34.389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were seriously injured and you beat Red cherry?</font>

1541
01:58:37.404 --> 01:58:42.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we fighting to defeat heaven?</font>

1542
01:58:48.815 --> 01:58:49.976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silver Time</font>

1543
01:58:51.383 --> 01:58:57.954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I draw my sword to the country and the partners in your mouth.</font>

1544
01:58:59.325 --> 01:59:01.557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of that matters.</font>

1545
01:59:04.163 --> 01:59:05.597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think about it.</font>

1546
01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:10.859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who taught us to use swords?</font>

1547
01:59:12.471 --> 01:59:14.532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teach US Bushido?</font>

1548
01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:18.575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who is the man who lives?</font>

1549
01:59:19.579 --> 01:59:23.178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man who created the world for us is no doubt</font>

1550
01:59:24.317 --> 01:59:25.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Songyang Teacher</font>

1551
01:59:27.353 --> 01:59:28.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think</font>

1552
01:59:30.723 --> 01:59:34.184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world took the teacher from us.</font>

1553
01:59:35.895 --> 01:59:39.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we have to declare war on this world.</font>

1554
01:59:39.899 --> 01:59:44.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can only destroy this merciless world.</font>

1555
01:59:48.073 --> 01:59:49.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silver when I asked you</font>

1556
01:59:50.976 --> 01:59:53.903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your motivation for living?</font>

1557
01:59:55.847 --> 01:59:58.079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you do nothing?</font>

1558
01:59:58.083 --> 02:00:01.909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Living in the world of the teacher?</font>

1559
02:00:04.522 --> 02:00:06.219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sundae is delicious.</font>

1560
02:00:10.628 --> 02:00:16.733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think there's anything to be destroyed in the world.</font>

1561
02:00:19.238 --> 02:00:20.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead. I ...</font>

1562
02:00:23.275 --> 02:00:26.634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so much to protect!</font>

1563
02:00:35.687 --> 02:00:37.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaoshan!</font>

1564
02:00:40.859 --> 02:00:45.187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the hell out! Want to Die!
Be careful to be beaten into a beehive!</font>

1565
02:00:45.197 --> 02:00:46.597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help Your Excellency. let's go.</font>

1566
02:00:46.598 --> 02:00:47.623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Way</font>

1567
02:00:49.567 --> 02:00:51.935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm aware that one day I'll be on him.</font>

1568
02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:33.235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silver Time</font>

1569
02:03:00.096 --> 02:03:01.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bantian!</font>

1570
02:03:01.330 --> 02:03:02.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't meddle.</font>

1571
02:03:13.576 --> 02:03:15.034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on</font>

1572
02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you dare to kill me?</font>

1573
02:03:46.109 --> 02:03:48.375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still naive.</font>

1574
02:03:58.855 --> 02:04:01.315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe too much sugar.</font>

1575
02:04:03.125 --> 02:04:05.983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silver. that's the bomb I set up at the factory.</font>

1576
02:04:05.994 --> 02:04:08.864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The blast will blow the ship to pieces.</font>

1577
02:04:09.832 --> 02:04:11.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you.</font>

1578
02:04:28.651 --> 02:04:31.213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready to be so thoughtful</font>

1579
02:04:31.987 --> 02:04:33.945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you Lupin III's associates?</font>

1580
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:39.159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How else would we hide from the real election team now?</font>

1581
02:04:42.731 --> 02:04:43.824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just ...</font>

1582
02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:48.631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think he had it on his hands.</font>

1583
02:04:52.607 --> 02:04:54.440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone starts out in the same place.</font>

1584
02:04:56.611 --> 02:04:57.636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't think ...</font>

1585
02:04:59.181 --> 02:05:02.381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now it's so far away</font>

1586
02:05:16.864 --> 02:05:20.429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silver When you remember</font>

1587
02:05:20.935 --> 02:05:22.028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This?</font>

1588
02:05:26.708 --> 02:05:29.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well. I lost my ramen soup.</font>

1589
02:06:20.394 --> 02:06:21.552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sister</font>

1590
02:06:23.831 --> 02:06:25.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're back.</font>

1591
02:06:43.017 --> 02:06:44.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome back</font>

1592
02:06:57.631 --> 02:07:00.831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heaven and man occupy this city</font>

1593
02:07:01.269 --> 02:07:04.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alone in Edo.</font>

1594
02:07:08.141 --> 02:07:11.268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still looking for tonight</font>

1595
02:07:11.778 --> 02:07:16.173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where I live</font>

1596
02:07:18.652 --> 02:07:24.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the empty shuttle crowd</font>

1597
02:07:25.593 --> 02:07:29.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As if a stray dog</font>

1598
02:07:29.964 --> 02:07:31.353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight</font>

1599
02:07:32.198 --> 02:07:34.498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes against the teeth. blood boiling!</font>

1600
02:07:39.939 --> 02:07:41.897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1601
02:07:42.442 --> 02:07:44.537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can not this song concludes it!</font>

1602
02:10:49.593 --> 02:10:53.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the universe's most stupid warrior! You're darn!</font>

1603
02:10:53.932 --> 02:10:55.355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello there?</font>
