00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:52.083
It's not like I asked for them.

00:23:52.125 --> 00:23:53.500
Should we take a break?

00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:55.959
Oh. yeah. I'm actually starving.

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:57.500
I think there's a food truck
around here somewhere.

00:23:57.583 --> 00:23:58.458
Don't worry.

What's this?

00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:05.125
Well. when you're working
in the pasture all day.

00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:08.333
you make it a habit
to bring along lunch.

00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:10.208
otherwise you lose time.

00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:13.250
But personally.
I just prefer eating outside.

00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:16.500
I don't think this rain break
is gonna last.

00:24:16.583 --> 00:24:19.792
Thanks. How are you so sure
it's gonna rain again?

00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:23.917
[Leah] Mm. Of course.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.125
That's your forecast.

00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:27.375
You see. birds will fly high
during good weather.

00:24:27.458 --> 00:24:29.625
so you barely see them.

00:24:29.709 --> 00:24:31.667
but if there's
disruptive air pressures.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.792
they fly low to avoid it.

00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:35.165
like when rain
or a storm's coming.

00:24:35.166 --> 00:24:36.250
Where did you learn that?

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:37.667
My grandpa.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.333
Taught me a lot. actually.

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.667
Like about ants.

00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:42.166
You don't pay them
much attention.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.250
but if you did.

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:44.875
you'd notice that
they build their anthills

00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:46.208
higher and steeper

00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:48.000
when rain's coming.

00:24:48.041 --> 00:24:49.000
Well. that's great.

00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:50.667
but if all it took

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.375
were birds and bugs
to predict the forecast.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.834
well. then I wouldn't need
my new degree.

You know.
you can't beat science.

00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:59.917
You just have to work at it
to get the forecast right.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.583
and I plan on being the best.

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:02.750

Mother Nature
can be unpredictable.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.959

clues along the way.

the diehard country boy that.

an outlaw back home.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.709
Oh. Thank goodness. it's you.

00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:11.458
Wow. Did all the bachelors
in the city

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.792
find out you were
unavailable indefinitely?

00:56:13.875 --> 00:56:15.750
It's my birthday.

00:56:15.834 --> 00:56:16.709
How did I not know that?

00:56:16.792 --> 00:56:18.125
Uh...

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:19.291
I mean...

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.709
even your coffee vendor.
David. figured it out.

00:56:21.792 --> 00:56:24.291
Well. that's because you get
a free coffee on your birthday.

00:56:24.375 --> 00:56:25.834
And flowers. apparently.

00:56:25.875 --> 00:56:27.709
[Leah's dad] Knock-knock!

00:56:27.792 --> 00:56:29.917
- [overlapping] Hey!
- Happy birthday!

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.667
Thank you.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.250
What is all of this?

00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:35.834
Well. it is my birthday.

00:56:35.917 --> 00:56:36.834
Now. on normal days.

00:56:36.917 --> 00:56:38.166
she only gets
half as many deliveries.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:39.083
Really?

00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:40.291
Well. you know what they say.

00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:42.333
When it rains. it pours.

00:56:42.375 --> 00:56:43.500
I know.

00:56:43.542 --> 00:56:45.917
Mark. seeing as you're here.
why don't you join us?

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:46.917
We're taking Leah

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.750
for her birthday dinner
at Mallory's.

00:56:48.834 --> 00:56:50.917
It's where we celebrate
all the Waddell birthdays.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.375
I don't want to intrude.
if it's a tradition.

00:56:53.458 --> 00:56:54.750
Don't be silly.
We'll just make it for four.

00:56:54.834 --> 00:56:55.750
Yeah. it's settled.

00:56:55.834 --> 00:56:57.000
And we should hurry.

00:56:57.083 --> 00:56:58.709
We don't want them to run out
of their clam chowder.

00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:00.458
They make a fresh pot every day.

00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:02.125
and when it's gone. it's gone.

00:57:02.208 --> 00:57:04.500
so if they have it.
you really have to try it.

00:57:07.834 --> 00:57:10.542
All the other kids
had run inside already.

00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:11.917
but not this one.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.208
Fiona was outside.

00:57:13.291 --> 00:57:15.417
screaming like Auntie Em
in The Wizard of Oz.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.041
except. instead of "Dorothy."
she was yelling "Leah! Leah!"

00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:20.208
[all laughing]

00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:22.291
Finally. we saw her.

00:57:22.375 --> 00:57:24.875
strolling down the street.
looking up at the sky.

00:57:24.959 --> 00:57:26.458
head in the clouds. as usual.

00:57:26.542 --> 00:57:28.875
You would've loved
growing up on the farm then.

00:57:28.959 --> 00:57:31.208
'cause we got
some epic storms out there.

00:57:31.291 --> 00:57:34.291
Oh. I know
she would've loved that.

00:57:34.375 --> 00:57:35.583
Well. they couldn't have been
any bigger than the ones

00:57:35.667 --> 00:57:38.542
we saw on our storm-chasing
tour. right. Dad?

00:57:38.583 --> 00:57:39.709
I don't think so.

00:57:39.792 --> 00:57:40.959
Storm-chasing tour?

00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:42.500
I still can't believe

00:57:42.583 --> 00:57:44.083
you actually
went through with that.

00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:46.125
Can't go back
on a birthday promise.

00:57:46.208 --> 00:57:48.792
When Leah turned six years old.

00:57:48.875 --> 00:57:51.083
I foolishly promised
that. in ten years.

00:57:51.125 --> 00:57:52.250
if she was still
that interested in the weather.

00:57:52.333 --> 00:57:54.667
I would take her on this tour.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:57.083
Biggest rookie-Dad mistake
I ever made.

00:57:57.125 --> 00:57:58.583
[laughter]

00:57:58.625 --> 00:57:59.959
- Dad. it wasn't that bad.
- What?

00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:02.834
Your father told me that
when he saw those storm clouds.

00:58:02.917 --> 00:58:04.959
he wanted
to jump out of the van.

00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:06.625
- [laughter]
- Yeah. call me crazy.

00:58:06.709 --> 00:58:09.750
but I think that there is
something inherently wrong

00:58:09.834 --> 00:58:12.417
with driving into a storm.
instead of away from it.

00:58:12.458 --> 00:58:13.417
Yeah. I could see that.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.959
if you don't
like chasing storms.

00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:16.917
Yep. kind of makes my hair
stand on end.

00:58:16.959 --> 00:58:18.834
In a good way.

00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:21.417
So. Mark.

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.291
how is your job going?

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.417
Ah. it's all right.

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.458
I mean. I thought
I'd shared everything I know

00:58:26.542 --> 00:58:27.625
about dairy farming.

00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:30.291
but they seem to think
I have more to offer.

00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:32.834
so they've asked me to stay on.
more permanently.

00:58:32.917 --> 00:58:34.083
Really?

00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:35.625
Well. congratulations.

00:58:35.667 --> 00:58:36.583
Thanks.

00:58:36.667 --> 00:58:39.458
Are you gonna stay on
more permanently?

00:58:39.542 --> 00:58:40.709
I don't know yet.

00:58:40.792 --> 00:58:42.208
I'm a bit torn right now.

00:58:42.291 --> 00:58:46.125
I mean. the city does have
a lot to offer. of course.

00:58:46.208 --> 00:58:48.083
but the farm...

00:58:48.166 --> 00:58:50.166
well. that's where my heart is.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.458
But the city is growing on me.

00:58:56.125 --> 00:58:57.875
Ahh!

00:58:57.959 --> 00:59:00.000
Yeah!

00:59:00.041 --> 00:59:01.000
[Dad laughing]

00:59:01.041 --> 00:59:02.792
[Leah] Mom. Dad.

00:59:02.875 --> 00:59:03.834
What? It is tradition.

00:59:03.917 --> 00:59:06.291
and you are never
too old for that.

00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:08.041
Happy birthday. Dorothy.

00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:10.417
Make a wish.

00:59:16.542 --> 00:59:18.000
[overlapping] Yeah!

00:59:18.041 --> 00:59:20.667
- Thank you.
- Happy Birthday. honey.

00:59:20.709 --> 00:59:21.667
Mwah!

00:59:21.709 --> 00:59:22.667
Goodnight!

00:59:22.709 --> 00:59:23.834
- Goodnight.
- Thank you!

00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:25.500
- Love you!
- You too. honey.

00:59:25.542 --> 00:59:27.500
- Happy birthday. sweetheart.
- Thank you!

00:59:27.583 --> 00:59:29.041
[Leah chuckles]

00:59:29.125 --> 00:59:31.000
That was fun!
How was the clam chowder?

00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:32.417
It was actually really good.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:33.417
Yeah.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.792
I'm happy there was some left.

00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:36.500
[Mark] Yeah.

00:59:36.583 --> 00:59:38.041
Um...

00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:39.583
Thanks.

00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:40.583
For what?

00:59:40.667 --> 00:59:43.041
For being a sport
and coming to dinner.

00:59:43.125 --> 00:59:46.375
Actually. I was planning
on coming by tonight.

00:59:46.458 --> 00:59:47.458
to see what you were doing.

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:49.250
so I could give you this.

00:59:50.834 --> 00:59:52.875
I thought you said
you didn't know.

00:59:52.917 --> 00:59:54.125
Of course I knew!

00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:57.041
You have it circled
in bright red on your calendar.

00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:00.208
Mark. they're beautiful.

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.625
Just like you.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:05.583
And they're not
just pretty on the outside.

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:06.875
You see. with daisies.

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.166
when rain's on its way.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.917
the petals will close up

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.750
so not a single drop gets in.

01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:14.041
And when the sun's coming.
well...

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:16.291
they smile at it.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:18.542
So in a way. they're like...

01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:21.625
nature's rain predictor.

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:24.000
It's the perfect gift.

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:26.417
Well. I'd have to say
stormchasing's pretty awesome.

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:28.417
but. yeah. it's a close second.

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.166
Happy birthday.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:35.250
And. uh. hey...

01:00:35.333 --> 01:00:37.417
when's your birthday?

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:39.583
Friends should know that.

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:41.041
October 7th.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.500
Ah. A Libra.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:45.291
Now I get it.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.750
Get what?

01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:48.250
Goodnight.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:51.500
'Night.

01:00:52.709 --> 01:00:53.875
Hmm.

01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:57.333
[Brody whines]

01:00:57.417 --> 01:00:58.625
I'm telling you. bro.

01:00:58.709 --> 01:01:01.291
She "gets it" because
you always weigh your options.

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:04.375
You know. Libra.
sign of the scales.

01:01:04.458 --> 01:01:05.959
Like with this whole work thing.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.917
you won't make
a rushed decision...

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.125
or with her.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.625
You know. is she just a friend?
Isn't she?

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.458
Should I ask her out?
Shouldn't I?

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:14.291
We are just friends.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:15.625
Her decision.

01:01:15.709 --> 01:01:18.709
which. by the way.
is going on indefinitely now.

01:01:18.792 --> 01:01:21.291
So then.
you have nothing to lose.

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.375
What do you mean?

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:23.458
If you ask her out.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.625
she's either gonna say no.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.458
or break her resolve
and say yes.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.834
But I have everything
to lose. Darren.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.500
I mean...

01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:31.625
if I ask her out. that'll be it.

01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:33.667
It'll completely
change everything...

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.458
our whole dynamic.
our whole friendship.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.792
So what are you gonna do?

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:39.083
I guess
I wait until she's ready.

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:40.750
And when she is.

01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:43.834
I just have to hope
that I'll be the one.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:45.041
And if you're not.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.166
you've wasted a lot of time.
my friend.

01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:49.667
If I were you.
I would just start dating.

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:51.709
Maybe give this whole

01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:06.125
And I'd wait another year
if it meant I could be with you.

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:08.834
Really?

01:21:08.917 --> 01:21:10.208
You would wait for me?

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.208
I would.

01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:14.291
But I'd prefer not to.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:17.625
Me neither.
