00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:59.542
- Ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:02.234
welcome to the
Temple of Randicus.

5
00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:22.220
Thank you.

6
00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:23.497
Thank you.

7
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:25.015
Thank you all very much

8
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.948
for coming to
worship this evening

9
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.261
in the Temple of Randicus.

10
00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:32.920
We welcome all visitors
to this temple as equals.

11
00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.681
Your gender identity.
sexual preference.

12
00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:37.925
political beliefs.
fetishes and phobias

13
00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.893
are none of our
fucking business!

14
00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:45.035
Nor is your current address.

15
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.831
We welcome you regardless
of where you're from

16
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.868
or perhaps more importantly.

17
00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.939
regardless of which
bit of the earth

18
00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:54.597
your mother happened to be on.

19
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:56.771
when you were lifted
from her stomach

20
00:01:56.806 --> 00:01:59.188
or pushed out of
her vaginal canal.

21
00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.467
It doesn't bother us.

22
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:03.364
Seriously.

23
00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:07.230
We had someone in from
Ocean Shores last night.

24
00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:11.026
We let them have a
seat and everything.

25
00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:14.617
It's a very broad church.

26
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:16.550
It's a fucking broad church.

27
00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.251
Hello there. what's your name?

28
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:35.914
Am I looking at someone?

29
00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.883
Anyone in that general vicinity?

30
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.679
Am I too low?

31
00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:43.508
You. there.

32
00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:48.858
Hello?

33
00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:51.240
Fuck that side. hello
what's your name?

34
00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.655
- Wendy.
- What is it?

35
00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.070
- Wendy.
- Wendy!

36
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:57.487
How are you. Wendy?

37
00:02:57.522 --> 00:02:59.040
- I'm fantastic.
thanks for asking.

38
00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:00.801
- Oh. thank you for
coming to my show.

39
00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:04.218
Wendibles. where do you live?

40
00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:05.185
- At the end of the road.

41
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.877
- Just fucking. end of the road.

42
00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:09.913
You a local Wendy. you
been here a long time?

43
00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:12.192
- I ain't a local but
I'm here 12 years. so.

44
00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:14.124
- Ah. 12 years.
that's not local.

45
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.195
- No.

46
00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.093
- How long do you have to
live here before you a local?

47
00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:17.956
- [Crowd] 20.

48
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.509
- 20?

49
00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:20.890
What's that mate?

50
00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:24.031
Someones like. I didn't hear it.

51
00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:25.239
I'm a local. I am
sure you'll find

52
00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:27.897
I am born here and die here.

53
00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.072
Wendy. good on you.

54
00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:32.522
And you come to many shows here

55
00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:34.248
in the beautiful
Brunswick Picture House?

56
00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:35.905
- I try to come to
as many as I can.

57
00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.458
- Well. thank you for
choosing this one.

58
00:03:37.493 --> 00:03:40.392
I'm honored to have
you here. Wendy.

59
00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:41.221
Wow!

60
00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.257
Yeah. let's hear it for Wendy.

61
00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:44.879
If someone wants to clap.

62
00:03:44.914 --> 00:03:46.122
Let's do it.

63
00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:49.884
You're a bloody legend. Wendy.

64
00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:51.990
Hey. actually. as a local Wendy.

65
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:52.922
you can help me out with this.

66
00:03:52.956 --> 00:03:55.165
I came here through Byron Bay

67
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.927
and I just happened
to drive through

68
00:03:57.961 --> 00:03:59.998
at this moment
where the entire sky

69
00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:02.000
was just fucking full of bats.

70
00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:02.932
- Ah. yeah.

71
00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:03.933
- Does that happen often?

72
00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:05.279
- Every night. mate.

73
00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:07.108
- Mate. I've never seen. I've
been to Byron a bunch of times

74
00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:09.939
never seen the bats.
freaked me the fuck out.

75
00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:10.767
We have bats.

76
00:04:10.802 --> 00:04:12.286
I'm from Melbourne.

77
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:14.115
There's heaps of
bats in Melbourne but
this was phenomenal.

78
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.185
It was like.

79
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.808
coolest shit I've ever seen.

80
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.570
Just millions of. what's the
collective noun for bats?

81
00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:21.502
Anybody know?

82
00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:23.297
- Colony.
- A colony?

83
00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:25.610
- Cloud.
- A cloud?

84
00:04:25.644 --> 00:04:27.128
A what?

85
00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:28.923
- Bats.
- Bats?

86
00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:30.097
A bats.

87
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:32.202
Yeah. let's go with the bats.

88
00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.066
Just the bats of bats.

89
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.625
Yeah. so I saw this huge
fucking bats of bats. right?

90
00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:44.525
The whole sky full of bats
and then in the middle.

91
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.978
just one seagull. just
freaking the fuck out.

92
00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:50.359
What's going on?

93
00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:52.153
Too many bats.

94
00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:56.296
I think I got on
the wrong train.

95
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.987
Is this the way to the ocean?

96
00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:02.129
I don't speak bat.

97
00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:03.924
Can you speak any seagull?

98
00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:07.893
Ah. shit.

99
00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:11.241
Yeah.

100
00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:13.313
Byron's a very cool place.

101
00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:15.798
I feel a bit like a seagull
amongst the bats myself

102
00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:17.040
when I'm there. Wendy.

103
00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:18.179
It's a weird place you know.

104
00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:20.181
I was there. everyone's
fucking cool.

105
00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:23.323
There were kids on the beach
today just doing Nangs.

106
00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:26.843
just inhaling an
amount of balloons.

107
00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:28.189
I was like fuck. that's cool.

108
00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:31.020
You just having a Nang. mate?

109
00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:33.159
You gonna share?

110
00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:36.336
And I saw heaps of people
cruising around in sweet cars.

111
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.062
just cranking sweet
tunes. like five in a row.

112
00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:41.237
just [beat boxing]

113
00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:43.688
I was like. oh.
that's fucking cool!

114
00:05:43.722 --> 00:05:46.173
I wish I was that
cool. you know?

115
00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:49.210
But I just don't have the
playlist to back it up.

116
00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:52.386
This week's podcast is
brought to you by Pet Guns.

117
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:55.078
There's nothing cool about
driving around in your car

118
00:05:55.113 --> 00:05:56.666
with the windows rolled down.

119
00:05:56.701 --> 00:06:00.118
just cranking a
true crime podcast.

120
00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:01.740
And I always seem to
pull up at traffic lights

121
00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:04.398
and lock eyes with the
person in the car next to me.

122
00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:08.229
just at the most
horrific bit of detail

123
00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:09.886
and I have to nudge my head

124
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.511
like I'm listening to a
cool song just as like.

125
00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:17.031
that's when the murderer
disemboweled his 38th victim.

126
00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.792
I'm like. yeah!

127
00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:19.931
Have you heard this one?

128
00:06:19.965 --> 00:06:21.139
It's a classic.

129
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.108
You can get it on iTunes.

130
00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:27.076
You can get it on iTunes.

131
00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:33.323
I'm a living joke.

132
00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:35.291
But don't worry.
you're in safe hands

133
00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:36.396
my brothers and sisters.

134
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.881
I know the cloak and the candles

135
00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:40.779
particularly in
the current climate

136
00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:43.748
maybe a little triggering
for some people

137
00:06:43.782 --> 00:06:46.233
but we're in this
together tonight. okay.

138
00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:47.648
This is a group effort.

139
00:06:47.683 --> 00:06:49.270
It's about evolution.

140
00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:51.997
We're gonna collectively
re-write the rules tonight.

141
00:06:52.032 --> 00:06:55.069
my beautiful Brunswick
Heads parishioners.

142
00:06:55.104 --> 00:06:56.899
Starting with turning your
phones off. all right?

143
00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.453
Just if they're on. just
fucking switch 'em off.

144
00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:01.766
The show doesn't go for
that long. just be present.

145
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.146
It'll be fine.

146
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:06.460
And if you do leave your
phone on. fucking commit.

147
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.945
Take calls.

148
00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:13.156
Fucking make calls.

149
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.124
Come up here and make calls.

150
00:07:15.158 --> 00:07:16.574
Come up here and make calls

151
00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:19.542
with your wireless headphones
in like an asshole.

152
00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:21.441
Can't give a fuck!

153
00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:24.616
Don't take photos.

154
00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.931
Resist the temptation to
take a photo for an hour.

155
00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:30.484
How are you gonna
get through it?

156
00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:34.143
I mean. seriously. what are
you gonna do to those photos?

157
00:07:34.177 --> 00:07:36.145
Show them to your grandchildren?

158
00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:39.148
This is when I
went to see Randy.

159
00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:43.082
What the fuck--

160
00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:46.673
is a Randy?

161
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.815
Your memories are
worthless. grandpa.

162
00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:55.164
We had a meeting. you're
out of the family.

163
00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:59.133
So. take photos
at your own risk.

164
00:07:59.168 --> 00:08:02.205
Who's having a beverage this
evening. alcoholic style?

165
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.483
Yes!

166
00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:04.380
If you're having a
drink. that's great.

167
00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:06.693
If you're on drugs. even better.

168
00:08:08.108 --> 00:08:10.248
Apparently. I'm very
entertaining if you're high.

169
00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:13.216
There's a lot of color and
movement that goes on here.

170
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:15.184
It's like a live cartoon.

171
00:08:16.944 --> 00:08:20.189
So. now's the time to main
to that second cookie.

172
00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:22.156
I know you guys.

173
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:25.677
I've got your number here
on Northern coastage.

174
00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:30.268
So. we're gonna have
some fun tonight.

175
00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:32.338
It's gonna be a
loving experience.

176
00:08:32.373 --> 00:08:35.376
The only stipulation
is that we respect

177
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:38.655
each other's existing
belief systems. all right?

178
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.381
I know it's been
fucking churchy up here.

179
00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:43.107
But the idea is that
we all move towards

180
00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:45.214
a common collective belief.

181
00:08:45.248 --> 00:08:47.941
And to speed that process up
a bit. it's best that we have

182
00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:50.253
a prejudice-free
dialogue this evening.

183
00:08:50.288 --> 00:08:51.254
Unless you're a Scientologist.

184
00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:52.808
in which case. you
can go fuck yourself.

185
00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:07.408
People are very protective of
their faith and rightfully so.

186
00:09:08.306 --> 00:09:09.583
Faith is everything.

187
00:09:09.618 --> 00:09:13.311
Faith can provide purpose.
comfort. structure and meaning.

188
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:17.211
Faith can also protect
bigots. justify atrocities

189
00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:19.248
and perpetuate discrimination.

190
00:09:19.282 --> 00:09:21.319
But so can the Jackson
family apparently.

191
00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.183
So. let's concentrate on
the positive. shall we?

192
00:09:30.293 --> 00:09:32.468
The point is. the point is.

193
00:09:33.849 --> 00:09:36.403
the point is. you gotta
have faith. all right?

194
00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:37.507
You gotta have faith.

195
00:09:38.992 --> 00:09:40.649
You gotta have
faith. faith. faith.

196
00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:44.273
You've got to have
faith. faith. faith.

197
00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:45.343
Baby.

198
00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.551
Any George Michael
fans in the house?

199
00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:50.659
Strap in for his
piece of information.

200
00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:53.731
I actually own an autograph copy

201
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:57.389
of George Michael's
"Faith" on cassette tape.

202
00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:00.323
How cool is that?

203
00:10:00.358 --> 00:10:01.359
- Pretty cool.

204
00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.292
- How obsolete is that?

205
00:10:04.155 --> 00:10:05.190
Can't listen to it.

206
00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:06.778
Just own it.

207
00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:08.124
If I wanna listen to it.

208
00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.368
I'm gonna have to go
and buy a tape deck.

209
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.439
And then. wind a
meter and half of tape

210
00:10:12.473 --> 00:10:15.822
back into the cassette with
a pencil like we used to do

211
00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:18.203
when we wanted to
listen to Dire Straits

212
00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:20.067
on a road trip with our parents.

213
00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:22.622
With all the windows rolled down

214
00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:23.692
cause that's what we used to do

215
00:10:23.726 --> 00:10:26.453
before air conditioning
was invented.

216
00:10:26.487 --> 00:10:28.144
On our way to Sea World

217
00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:29.663
cause that's where
we went on holidays

218
00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:32.355
before animal rights
were invented.

219
00:10:33.702 --> 00:10:36.946
Eating ice creams on the way
cause that's what we used to do

220
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:39.639
before injecting
insulin was invented.

221
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.159
It was a different
time back then.

222
00:10:46.818 --> 00:10:51.167
I'm at that age now where I've
started using phrases like.

223
00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:52.341
I'm at that age now.

224
00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:57.864
I'm also at that age
now where I haven't yet

225
00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:02.523
and I don't believe I
ever will resort to vaping

226
00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:04.008
in any shape or form.

227
00:11:05.043 --> 00:11:06.251
I'm never gonna vape.

228
00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:08.046
I'm not gonna become
a fucking vaper.

229
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.740
It just feels like a
betrayal to all of those

230
00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:16.434
sweet. sweet cigarettes that
I smoked throughout my life.

231
00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:20.541
If you used to smoke
cigarettes and now you vape.

232
00:11:20.576 --> 00:11:22.923
you're a real piece of shit.

233
00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:26.409
You used to be cool man!

234
00:11:26.444 --> 00:11:29.240
Now you're standing there
just on some street corner

235
00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:34.279
fellating a mini exhaust pipe.
like Fonzie's shit sibling.

236
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:36.454
You used to be fucking cool!

237
00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:39.112
I remember the glory
days of smoking.

238
00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:41.942
this whole room would've
been full of cigarette smoke.

239
00:11:41.977 --> 00:11:43.461
We all would've stunk like shit

240
00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:47.189
but we didn't care cause
we were fucking cool.

241
00:11:47.223 --> 00:11:48.604
There would've been
ash trays everywhere.

242
00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:50.640
Couldn't move for ash trays.

243
00:11:50.675 --> 00:11:52.746
Now you can't fucking
find one anywhere.

244
00:11:52.781 --> 00:11:56.750
Spare a thought for the
ash tray manufacturers.

245
00:11:56.785 --> 00:11:58.752
They're all living
in their cars now.

246
00:11:58.787 --> 00:12:00.512
thanks to you fucking vapers.

247
00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:03.930
And it's not just
the ash tray people.

248
00:12:03.964 --> 00:12:06.415
what about the people
that make matches. hmm?

249
00:12:08.106 --> 00:12:10.039
Spare a thought
for the companies

250
00:12:10.074 --> 00:12:13.042
that used to print
night club logos

251
00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:15.493
onto those little
books of matches

252
00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.944
so that grizzled old
homicide detectives

253
00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:21.119
could fish one out of
the pocket of a corpse

254
00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:23.501
and know where to start
looking for the killer.

255
00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:28.609
Thousands upon thousands
of unsolved homicides

256
00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:30.922
just cause you
fuckers wanna vape.

257
00:12:32.613 --> 00:12:33.511
I'm bloody sick of it.

258
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.271
Thank you. solitary clapper.

259
00:12:36.169 --> 00:12:37.480
Just one person.

260
00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:39.551
Yes. I agree but no one
else though so I'll shut up.

261
00:12:51.978 --> 00:12:53.048
George Michael. eh?

262
00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:57.777
Where did George go?

263
00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.262
Hmm?

264
00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:01.608
- Dead.

265
00:13:01.642 --> 00:13:02.989
- Someone said to the bathroom

266
00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:06.786
and someone followed up
very quickly with he's dead.

267
00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:10.513
I'm aware of that but I
just want to know like

268
00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:12.377
where did George go?

269
00:13:13.344 --> 00:13:14.655
Where's George?

270
00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:17.831
Hmm?

271
00:13:17.866 --> 00:13:21.041
I mean. statistically speaking
around 50% of you believe

272
00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:24.010
that George Michael is
currently experiencing

273
00:13:24.044 --> 00:13:26.978
some variety of afterlife.

274
00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:30.533
Depending on your religious
flavor of choice. of course.

275
00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:32.673
Some of you believe he's
having a lovely time

276
00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:35.642
re-united with his
dead relatives.

277
00:13:35.676 --> 00:13:38.300
Some of you believe he's
awaiting resurrection

278
00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:40.543
to face his final judgment.

279
00:13:40.578 --> 00:13:41.855
And some of you believe

280
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.582
that George Michael's
extra-curricular activities

281
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.584
such as touching
other men's penises

282
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.551
with his own penis for example.

283
00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.174
will have earn him an eternity

284
00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:53.108
as a rotisserie chicken in
the kebab shop of damnation.

285
00:13:55.696 --> 00:13:57.319
Around 7% of you believe

286
00:13:57.353 --> 00:14:01.081
that George Michael is
currently making a comeback.

287
00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:03.704
Possibly as a platypus.

288
00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:06.086
Depends on his deeds. really.

289
00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:08.848
And the remaining 43%
of you either believe

290
00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:11.505
that George Michael
is slowly fertilizing

291
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.198
the soil in Highgate cemetery

292
00:14:14.232 --> 00:14:17.166
or you don't really
give a shit either way

293
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:21.895
or you didn't fill out
your 2016 census form.

294
00:14:24.553 --> 00:14:26.693
Who didn't fill out
their 2016 census form?

295
00:14:26.727 --> 00:14:27.728
Come on.

296
00:14:27.763 --> 00:14:28.591
Yes. only few.

297
00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:32.216
I didn't. fucking woo!

298
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.393
Wendy. did you fill out
your 2016 census form?

299
00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:38.187
- I did. indeed.

300
00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:39.637
- Oh. you did? Woo!

301
00:14:42.053 --> 00:14:44.642
Hey Wendy. what did you tick.

302
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.471
if you remember. it was
a couple of years ago.

303
00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:49.543
but what did you tick for
faith or religious beliefs?

304
00:14:49.578 --> 00:14:52.236
Just bearing in mind this is
a judgment-free environment

305
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.410
and everybody else in the
room has shared something

306
00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:56.757
intimately personal about
themselves. now it's your turn.

307
00:14:56.792 --> 00:14:58.898
Wendy.

308
00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.037
- It's a trap.

309
00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:00.796
- What's that mate?

310
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.590
- It's a trap.

311
00:15:01.624 --> 00:15:02.832
- It's a trap!

312
00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:05.283
No. there's no traps
here. my friend.

313
00:15:05.318 --> 00:15:07.803
It's just fun times.
what's your name. weapon?

314
00:15:11.807 --> 00:15:12.566
- Greg.

315
00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:13.671
- Greg?

316
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:14.499
Gregory?

317
00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:16.605
We're gonna come
back to you. Wendy.

318
00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:18.676
We just need to address
Greg for a moment.

319
00:15:20.126 --> 00:15:25.131
- Greg. did you fill out your
2016 census form. Gregory?

320
00:15:25.648 --> 00:15:26.442
- Too late.

321
00:15:26.477 --> 00:15:27.236
- Too late?

322
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:28.548
What do you mean. mate?

323
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:32.276
What happened?

324
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.242
- I missed it.

325
00:15:33.277 --> 00:15:35.003
- You missed the 2016 census?

326
00:15:35.037 --> 00:15:36.280
Where were you. mate?

327
00:15:36.314 --> 00:15:37.937
Just punching a
fucking cone somewhere.

328
00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:43.149
What happened. Greg?

329
00:15:43.183 --> 00:15:44.460
Were you over the seas?

330
00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:46.290
Where were you. man?

331
00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:47.084
Just in mullin'?

332
00:15:47.118 --> 00:15:48.395
Just fuckin'. a cig.

333
00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:51.951
Just off the grid. mate.

334
00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:56.645
No. Greg?

335
00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:58.612
What would you have ticked
for faith or religious belief

336
00:15:58.647 --> 00:15:59.786
if you have filled it out?

337
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.890
Do you have a faith system?

338
00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:01.857
- I'm a Jedi.

339
00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:03.134
- Oh. you're a Jedi.

340
00:16:03.169 --> 00:16:05.550
That's an option on
the census these days.

341
00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:07.138
Do you have a practicing faith

342
00:16:07.173 --> 00:16:08.760
that goes along
with your Jedism?

343
00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:11.487
- Only on Tuesdays.

344
00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:13.524
- Do you just. just using
the force on Tuesdays?

345
00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:17.493
The rest of the time you're
just fucking [noises]

346
00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:22.015
Just imagining you
just going like this

347
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.707
and the bong floating across
the room into your hand.

348
00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:30.713
I can't see Greg but I'm
making some assumptions

349
00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:32.577
about your character.

350
00:16:32.612 --> 00:16:34.683
I hope I'm in the ball park.

351
00:16:34.717 --> 00:16:36.340
In case the cameras pick you up.

352
00:16:36.374 --> 00:16:37.237
you're probably
just sitting there

353
00:16:37.272 --> 00:16:38.514
in a business suit going.

354
00:16:38.549 --> 00:16:41.138
I've never tried drugs
in my entire life.

355
00:16:41.172 --> 00:16:43.588
I'm merely on my way
from Sydney to Brisbane

356
00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:44.624
for a business trip.

357
00:16:45.763 --> 00:16:47.351
I am insulted.

358
00:16:47.385 --> 00:16:48.662
Is that right. Greg?

359
00:16:48.697 --> 00:16:50.906
Or are you just fucking
punching cones like a weapon?

360
00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:56.360
- Don't judge me.

361
00:16:56.394 --> 00:16:57.395
- I'm not mate.

362
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.741
But given the amount of
time you took to answer that

363
00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:00.088
I'm gonna say it was the latter.

364
00:17:01.917 --> 00:17:03.229
Now. Wendy.

365
00:17:03.263 --> 00:17:05.540
Yeah!

366
00:17:05.576 --> 00:17:06.369
Gregory!

367
00:17:09.234 --> 00:17:11.064
Wendy. what did
you tick for faith?

368
00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.272
You've had plenty of time
to think about it now.

369
00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:16.759
Did you tick anything for
faith or religious belief?

370
00:17:16.794 --> 00:17:18.106
- Yeah. I'm an atheist. mate.

371
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.934
- You're an atheist?

372
00:17:18.968 --> 00:17:19.762
- Yeah.

373
00:17:21.143 --> 00:17:24.250
Oh. we've got some
atheist fans in the house.

374
00:17:24.284 --> 00:17:26.147
Yeah. you just die!

375
00:17:28.737 --> 00:17:31.084
Just blackness and abyss!

376
00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:33.949
Never been here before.
never coming back!

377
00:17:35.123 --> 00:17:38.091
So. where do you think
George Michael went?

378
00:17:38.126 --> 00:17:39.092
- In the ground. I believe.

379
00:17:39.127 --> 00:17:39.920
- Just in the ground?

380
00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:41.405
Yeah. nice one.

381
00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:42.889
Personally. Wendy. I
believe that George Michael

382
00:17:42.923 --> 00:17:44.615
was abducted by aliens.

383
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.376
They were very active in 2016.

384
00:17:47.411 --> 00:17:48.895
the year that
George Michael died.

385
00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:50.828
Those musician abducting aliens.

386
00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.658
Fuck. they got some
rippers that year!

387
00:17:54.797 --> 00:17:55.764
George Michael.

388
00:17:55.798 --> 00:17:57.076
David Bowie.

389
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.318
Prince.

390
00:17:58.353 --> 00:17:59.733
Sharon Jones.

391
00:17:59.768 --> 00:18:00.941
Merle Haggard.

392
00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.943
Fucking Leonard Cohen!

393
00:18:02.978 --> 00:18:04.221
There must have
been some sort of

394
00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:07.638
alien university
o-week challenge.

395
00:18:07.672 --> 00:18:09.088
Scull a pint of hydrogen

396
00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:11.883
and bring back a popular
musician from planet Earth.

397
00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:36.874
So. this book here. my friends.
is the Book of Randicus.

398
00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:38.462
Okay?

399
00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:40.257
What the fuck is the
Book of Randicus?

400
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.637
Great question. Wendy.

401
00:18:41.672 --> 00:18:42.466
Thank you for that question.

402
00:18:45.193 --> 00:18:46.884
Always asking questions.

403
00:18:48.851 --> 00:18:50.681
Thanks for bringing your
own microphone too. Wendy.

404
00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:54.029
That was excellent forward
planning on your part.

405
00:18:56.031 --> 00:18:57.481
In case you haven't noticed.

406
00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.862
just to bring you
all up to speed.

407
00:18:59.897 --> 00:19:02.727
I have invented a
new religion. okay?

408
00:19:02.762 --> 00:19:04.004
Pretty straight forward.

409
00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:06.006
Keep up. it's not Frasier.

410
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:06.904
But this-

411
00:19:07.732 --> 00:19:09.078
One Frasier fan.

412
00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:14.049
This religion is based on the
philosophy that homo sapiens

413
00:19:15.257 --> 00:19:18.329
were elevated to the top of
the food chain 70.000 years ago

414
00:19:18.364 --> 00:19:22.885
via the intervention of
an intergalactic messiah

415
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.232
named Barrel.

416
00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:28.719
Because fucking. why not?

417
00:19:30.341 --> 00:19:32.343
Now. I have called it a religion

418
00:19:32.378 --> 00:19:33.931
because it seems like
the most effective

419
00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.243
method of recruitment.

420
00:19:35.277 --> 00:19:40.075
But the teachings are grounded
in scientific fact. okay?

421
00:19:41.352 --> 00:19:44.079
For example. we know that at
least 10 different species

422
00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:48.048
of human lived on planet earth.
many of them simultaneously.

423
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:51.051
That much at least
we know to be true.

424
00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:54.572
We also know that
70.000 years ago.

425
00:19:54.607 --> 00:19:58.956
homo sapiens shot inexplicably
to the top of the food chain

426
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.234
and they have remained
there ever since.

427
00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:03.685
There's varying theories
as to how that happened.

428
00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:06.860
My theory and this is where
the religion part kicks in.

429
00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:11.037
is that Barrel was an
intergalactic missionary.

430
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:13.281
traveling from planet to planet.

431
00:20:13.315 --> 00:20:16.249
choosing one species
from each planet.

432
00:20:16.284 --> 00:20:18.217
kick starting
their intelligence.

433
00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:21.392
leaving them to evolve
for several thousand years

434
00:20:21.427 --> 00:20:24.119
then later returning
to those planets

435
00:20:24.153 --> 00:20:27.743
and recruiting these
newly evolved species

436
00:20:27.778 --> 00:20:32.748
to help care for and
maintain the multiverse.

437
00:20:32.783 --> 00:20:34.025
Simple as that.

438
00:20:34.923 --> 00:20:37.408
The Book of Randicus teaches us

439
00:20:37.443 --> 00:20:41.792
that Barrel came to planet
Earth. chose homo sapiens

440
00:20:41.826 --> 00:20:44.967
and gave us 70.000
years to evolve.

441
00:20:45.002 --> 00:20:48.247
Which means. she could
be back here any day now

442
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:51.802
so we need to crack the fuck
on with becoming enlightened.

443
00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:54.149
Any questions?

444
00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:54.943
- [Crowd] No.

445
00:20:54.977 --> 00:20:55.909
- Wendy?

446
00:20:55.944 --> 00:20:56.979
- None whatsoever.

447
00:20:57.014 --> 00:20:58.498
- Excellent.

448
00:20:58.533 --> 00:21:00.604
- We are ready to crack on.

449
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:03.917
- Yeah. no.

450
00:21:03.952 --> 00:21:05.264
Yep. that's great.

451
00:21:08.163 --> 00:21:10.303
Smattering of applause.

452
00:21:10.338 --> 00:21:13.306
I am sensing a little
bit of cynicism.

453
00:21:13.341 --> 00:21:16.067
Particularly from the Greg
region of the audience.

454
00:21:22.695 --> 00:21:26.043
Just so you know. I've been
doing a bit of a missionary tour

455
00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.804
around the country to
promote this concept.

456
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:30.289
And you might be
surprised to learn

457
00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:33.188
that a lot of people are
getting on board with this shit.

458
00:21:40.747 --> 00:21:43.474
I've been on the road
for about a year now.

459
00:21:43.509 --> 00:21:45.165
I've met some wonderful people.

460
00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:50.170
I've also mastered the
art of making porridge

461
00:21:50.205 --> 00:21:53.070
in a motel room kettle.

462
00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.037
And I tell you. there's
nothing more inspiring

463
00:21:55.072 --> 00:21:58.627
than looking across a
carpark to a busy freeway

464
00:21:58.662 --> 00:22:01.665
whilst scrapping glutinous
oats off the bottom

465
00:22:01.699 --> 00:22:05.945
of a calcified electrical
appliance from the mid 1970s.

466
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:15.299
It goes well with a side of
suicide contemplation I've found

467
00:22:19.234 --> 00:22:22.168
I do like a road
side motel. though.

468
00:22:22.202 --> 00:22:25.344
Particularly. when
traveling in remote areas.

469
00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:27.104
Airbnbs in the middle of nowhere

470
00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:29.934
can be a little bit fucking
terrifying. can't they?

471
00:22:31.695 --> 00:22:35.388
I thought you said that this
was an adjoining dwelling.

472
00:22:35.423 --> 00:22:37.908
Well. the beds are adjoining.

473
00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:41.360
True story!

474
00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:48.159
Regional South Australia is a
chilling part of the country.

475
00:22:49.229 --> 00:22:50.127
I love being on the road.

476
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:51.749
I'm a big fan of it.

477
00:22:51.784 --> 00:22:54.131
I have a lot of fun and
there's not many downsides.

478
00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:57.065
But there is one thing
about constantly traveling

479
00:22:57.099 --> 00:22:59.895
and staying in different places.
one thing that I'm sick of.

480
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.105
Do you know what I'm fucking
sick of. Brunswick Heads?

481
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:03.899
- What are you sick of?

482
00:23:03.934 --> 00:23:05.176
- Thank you very much.

483
00:23:06.143 --> 00:23:08.145
Call and response.

484
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.974
I am fucking sick of.

485
00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:13.599
writing my experience.

486
00:23:16.118 --> 00:23:17.637
Fuck that.

487
00:23:17.672 --> 00:23:20.606
Why can't I just stay
somewhere or eat something

488
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.403
or travel somewhere. without
immediately having to fill out

489
00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:28.476
some customer survey to
reassure the business

490
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.720
I've just interacted with
like I'm trying to dig

491
00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:36.104
a co-dependent lover out of
the post-coital shame spiral.

492
00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:38.831
Did you have a nice time?

493
00:23:38.865 --> 00:23:39.832
How was it for you?

494
00:23:39.866 --> 00:23:41.834
What could we do better?

495
00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:43.491
What's wrong with us?

496
00:23:43.525 --> 00:23:45.216
What's wrong with us?

497
00:23:47.874 --> 00:23:48.634
Fuck that!

498
00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:51.878
Yeah!

499
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:57.988
I mean look. by all means.
provide an avenue for complaint.

500
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:00.197
Like if I'm unhappy.

501
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:02.510
I'll be the first to write
a strongly worded email

502
00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:07.376
or perhaps slip a crude
drawing into a suggestion box.

503
00:24:08.343 --> 00:24:10.345
But if you don't hear from me.

504
00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:13.141
just assume everything was fine.

505
00:24:13.175 --> 00:24:15.661
Our transaction is complete.

506
00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:17.870
Fucking back yourself.

507
00:24:18.698 --> 00:24:19.975
It's everywhere now.

508
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.288
There's touch screens
now at the airports.

509
00:24:22.322 --> 00:24:25.325
They feature like a
spectrum of emojis.

510
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.365
So. you press the face that's
closest to your own face

511
00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:35.888
having just experienced whatever
your face just experienced.

512
00:24:37.027 --> 00:24:37.890
They have them
outside the toilets

513
00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:39.857
at the international airports.

514
00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:40.686
Touch screens.

515
00:24:41.687 --> 00:24:43.033
Outside the toilets!

516
00:24:45.173 --> 00:24:46.899
Now. just for the moment
let's ignore the fact that

517
00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:48.901
that touch screen is
a giant Petri dish

518
00:24:48.935 --> 00:24:51.593
for literally thousands
of stool samples.

519
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.183
I still resent having
to write my experience

520
00:24:55.217 --> 00:24:57.357
of going to the fucking toilet.

521
00:24:57.392 --> 00:24:59.981
Oh. gosh. okay. I've
gotta do this scre-

522
00:25:00.015 --> 00:25:01.500
No. guys. I'll catch up!

523
00:25:01.534 --> 00:25:03.329
Yeah. no. I'll get
the next flight.

524
00:25:03.363 --> 00:25:05.124
I'll just have to
do this screen.

525
00:25:06.194 --> 00:25:07.506
Okay. here we go.

526
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.369
Okay. golly gosh.

527
00:25:09.404 --> 00:25:13.166
All right. which face
most accurately depicts

528
00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:17.861
my emotional state having just
taken a shit at the airport?

529
00:25:19.414 --> 00:25:20.691
Oh. this is tough.

530
00:25:20.726 --> 00:25:24.177
I can't choose between
tragically desperate

531
00:25:24.212 --> 00:25:27.249
or shamefully humiliated.

532
00:25:27.284 --> 00:25:30.770
Oh. bugger it. I'll just go
with. I didn't wash my hands!

533
00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:35.568
I can't tell if you guys are
on board with this or not

534
00:25:35.603 --> 00:25:36.914
just by round of applause.

535
00:25:36.949 --> 00:25:38.226
who here is sick
of doing surveys?

536
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.296
Who's with me?

537
00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:46.441
That was a survey.
you fucking idiots!

538
00:25:47.787 --> 00:25:49.375
I just surveyed the room.

539
00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:51.066
You're like. yeah.
we hate surveys.

540
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.380
That's how they get you.

541
00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:56.900
Stay on your toes.
Brunswick Heads.

542
00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:01.318
Stay for joint.

543
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:04.735
What was your name. man. sorry?

544
00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.047
- I'm John.

545
00:26:06.081 --> 00:26:07.324
- Why don't we do a
little photo together?

546
00:26:07.358 --> 00:26:08.877
- That would be so good.

547
00:26:08.912 --> 00:26:09.671
- Let's do that.

548
00:26:12.847 --> 00:26:15.332
- Me and John at
the petrol station.

549
00:26:18.162 --> 00:26:19.370
- Good on you. John.

550
00:26:21.476 --> 00:26:24.341
- My wife and my little
boy are gonna love this.

551
00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:25.307
He's six.

552
00:26:25.342 --> 00:26:26.481
- Oh. grouse.

553
00:26:28.034 --> 00:26:32.280
- And we loved your show. was
it something on Elm Street or?

554
00:26:32.314 --> 00:26:34.075
- Which one. oh.
the Ricketts Lane?

555
00:26:34.109 --> 00:26:35.904
- Ricketts Lane. yeah.
- Oh. grouse.

556
00:26:35.939 --> 00:26:37.837
- Oh. good on you. John.
- Ricketts Lane.

557
00:26:37.872 --> 00:26:39.011
We love Ricketts Lane.
- That's awesome.

558
00:26:39.045 --> 00:26:40.737
Oh. well. so do we.

559
00:26:40.771 --> 00:26:41.738
Well. bloody nice to meet you.

560
00:26:41.772 --> 00:26:42.739
- Oh. you too. man.

561
00:26:42.773 --> 00:26:44.016
- What an absolute delight?

562
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.535
- Are you still doing
things with Sammy J?

563
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.089
- Yeah. we're still
doing lots of stuff.

564
00:26:48.123 --> 00:26:49.642
We're working on a new show
- Oh. cool.

565
00:26:49.677 --> 00:26:52.921
- But I'm off overseas
next. in a couple of weeks.

566
00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:55.372
But yeah. we're
still doing stuff.

567
00:26:55.406 --> 00:26:56.684
Bring it in. yes.

568
00:26:58.202 --> 00:27:00.273
- Oh. Randy. it's been
so nice to meet you.

569
00:27:00.308 --> 00:27:01.516
- Mate. it's been
an absolute delight.

570
00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.518
Thanks very much
for saying good day.

571
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:12.561
I would now like
to take a reading

572
00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:15.185
from the Book of Randicus.

573
00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:18.498
Chapter seven verse 69.

574
00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:21.018
Oh. grow up.

575
00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:24.470
It just happens to be verse 69.

576
00:27:24.504 --> 00:27:25.782
It's pure coincidence.

577
00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:27.507
It's a good verse. all right?

578
00:27:27.542 --> 00:27:30.200
It could've been any verse.

579
00:27:30.234 --> 00:27:31.926
We're all adults here.

580
00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:34.273
Disgusting.

581
00:27:43.385 --> 00:27:45.629
69 is pretty funny
though isn't it?

582
00:27:46.872 --> 00:27:49.495
Totally impractical on
an evolutionary level

583
00:27:49.529 --> 00:27:53.326
but just fucking classic
comedy in the bedroom.

584
00:27:53.361 --> 00:27:54.534
Dinner for two. whoa!

585
00:28:02.128 --> 00:28:04.752
I always think of Pompeii
when I'm in that position.

586
00:28:09.377 --> 00:28:11.620
You know like when
Pompeii volcano erupted

587
00:28:11.655 --> 00:28:13.553
and everybody just go
frozen in the positions

588
00:28:13.588 --> 00:28:15.383
they were in at the time?

589
00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:17.385
I'm always worried I'm
gonna be in 69 position.

590
00:28:17.419 --> 00:28:19.421
there's gonna be a
volcanic eruption

591
00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:21.734
and I'm gonna get frozen
and 2.000 years from now.

592
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:25.531
school children will be giggling
at my undignified demise

593
00:28:25.565 --> 00:28:27.464
in their holographic
history books.

594
00:28:27.498 --> 00:28:30.087
Like. oh no. how humiliating?

595
00:28:37.232 --> 00:28:40.373
It's always a bit conflicting
the 69 position. isn't it?

596
00:28:40.408 --> 00:28:43.549
It's like doing your
tax on a carnival ride.

597
00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:45.447
You don't know whether to focus

598
00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:47.518
or just kick back
and enjoy the view.

599
00:28:48.657 --> 00:28:49.969
There's a lot going on.

600
00:28:50.004 --> 00:28:51.764
Genitals in your face.

601
00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:53.421
Face in your genitals.

602
00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:56.562
It's always a bit frantic.

603
00:28:56.596 --> 00:28:59.461
I've not have many relaxing
69s. is what I'm trying to say.

604
00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:03.017
You know. shut up Greg. I'm
trying to do a reading here.

605
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:23.554
Oh fuck. hang on. I'm
on the wrong page.

606
00:29:43.298 --> 00:29:44.506
- Want a man?

607
00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:46.129
- Don't fucking patronize me.

608
00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:09.911
All right. here we go.

609
00:30:11.844 --> 00:30:13.984
Oh. I was on the right page.

610
00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:16.607
And lo.

611
00:30:17.608 --> 00:30:20.680
Barrel held aloft her hand

612
00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:23.891
and spake she in a
voice that rippled

613
00:30:23.925 --> 00:30:26.652
through the tall grasslands.

614
00:30:26.686 --> 00:30:30.587
Like the uninvited breath
of the stranger's hound

615
00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:34.936
on the exposed leg beneath
the outdoor cafe table.

616
00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:40.597
Consider your
fingertip. spake Barrel

617
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:41.391
and onward she spake.

618
00:30:42.944 --> 00:30:44.739
Your fingertip.

619
00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:48.674
your fingertip is
currently harboring

620
00:30:48.708 --> 00:30:52.747
tens of millions of
living organisms.

621
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:54.680
Just the tip of your finger.

622
00:30:54.714 --> 00:30:56.371
Consider that for a moment.

623
00:30:56.406 --> 00:30:59.616
Now consider. that your
entire body is home

624
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.552
to 100 trillion non-human cells.

625
00:31:05.794 --> 00:31:09.660
Each of you carry around
4.4 million non-human genes.

626
00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:15.943
90% of who you are is not
actually. who you are.

627
00:31:17.496 --> 00:31:21.051
Her words rang out
across the valley.

628
00:31:21.086 --> 00:31:24.468
Microbes. my
brothers and sisters.

629
00:31:24.503 --> 00:31:26.401
I'mma talking about microbes.

630
00:31:27.955 --> 00:31:31.579
Now. consider your
fingertip is planet Earth

631
00:31:31.613 --> 00:31:36.204
and the rest of your body
is the surrounding universe.

632
00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:40.208
allowing for the
limitless possibilities
that that presents.

633
00:31:40.243 --> 00:31:43.280
given the choice. would
you doom your species

634
00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:46.939
to evolutionary stagnation
on the tip of a finger?

635
00:31:46.974 --> 00:31:50.943
Or would you prefer to see
some really fucking cool shit?

636
00:31:53.187 --> 00:31:54.567
- Cool shit.

637
00:31:54.602 --> 00:31:55.603
- Cool shit?

638
00:31:55.637 --> 00:31:56.707
Fair enough.

639
00:31:59.089 --> 00:32:00.366
I had a

640
00:32:03.818 --> 00:32:06.648
a really. a really
fucked up thing.

641
00:32:06.683 --> 00:32:08.167
stay with me. stay with me.

642
00:32:09.617 --> 00:32:11.308
A really fucked up
thing happened to me

643
00:32:11.343 --> 00:32:12.965
on this missionary tour.

644
00:32:14.208 --> 00:32:16.658
I had a near death experience.

645
00:32:16.693 --> 00:32:19.661
Recently. actually.
quite recently. I
genuinely nearly died.

646
00:32:19.696 --> 00:32:22.664
And what happened was. I nearly
died from food poisoning.

647
00:32:22.699 --> 00:32:25.253
Which is a bullshit way to die.

648
00:32:25.288 --> 00:32:27.290
What are people gonna say
about me when I'm gone.

649
00:32:27.324 --> 00:32:31.639
Ah. well he always did
make poor menu choices.

650
00:32:33.054 --> 00:32:35.988
What happened to me was
I ate something funky

651
00:32:36.023 --> 00:32:40.717
in that giant food court at
that massive shopping mall

652
00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:42.822
where all the
obnoxious bogans go

653
00:32:42.857 --> 00:32:44.997
and they're really
rude to the staff.

654
00:32:45.032 --> 00:32:46.723
You know. the big fucking
mall. what's it called?

655
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:47.966
The really big one?

656
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.312
- Westfield.
- No. not Westfield.

657
00:32:49.346 --> 00:32:50.658
The other one. what's it called?

658
00:32:50.692 --> 00:32:52.867
The massive. people
are asshole. you know?

659
00:32:52.901 --> 00:32:54.455
No. not that one.
fuck what's it called?

660
00:32:54.489 --> 00:32:55.318
Bali!

661
00:32:55.352 --> 00:32:56.077
It's called Bali.

662
00:32:58.666 --> 00:33:02.566
So. I was in - I ate
something in Bali. right?

663
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.745
It disagreed with me to the
point that I got salmonella.

664
00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:12.542
And it was so serious that I
got an abscess on my spleen

665
00:33:12.576 --> 00:33:15.752
and had to have my
fucking spleen removed.

666
00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:16.684
I know.

667
00:33:18.203 --> 00:33:19.652
If you don't know what the
spleen does. by the way.

668
00:33:19.687 --> 00:33:22.034
it filters your blood
and it helps in the fight

669
00:33:22.069 --> 00:33:24.140
against nasty bacteria.

670
00:33:24.174 --> 00:33:26.176
It's kinda like the
organ equivalent

671
00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:28.523
of a night club bouncer.

672
00:33:28.558 --> 00:33:31.733
You don't really need it
and no one really likes it.

673
00:33:31.768 --> 00:33:33.356
but if it's not there.

674
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.945
someone's gonna get their
dick out on the dance floor.

675
00:33:38.464 --> 00:33:41.191
I was in hospital for about
six weeks. just laying there.

676
00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:42.503
Six weeks.

677
00:33:42.537 --> 00:33:45.402
Just contemplating
my own mortality

678
00:33:45.437 --> 00:33:49.924
when a single thought struck
me with absolute clarity.

679
00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:55.895
I'm just a temporary microbe
made up of other microbes

680
00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:58.726
on a planet of microbes

681
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.455
in an ever expanding
universe of microbes.

682
00:34:03.489 --> 00:34:06.078
Suddenly. I was an empty shell.

683
00:34:06.113 --> 00:34:08.735
Open to limitless possibilities.

684
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.291
All I needed was a sign.

685
00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:13.913
And that's when the old man

686
00:34:13.947 --> 00:34:17.607
in the bed next to
mine. turn to me

687
00:34:17.641 --> 00:34:18.435
and died.

688
00:34:21.404 --> 00:34:23.751
And while riffling
through his possessions.

689
00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:29.308
I found a book of daily
Buddhist meditations.

690
00:34:29.342 --> 00:34:31.897
And I turn to that
day's date and it said.

691
00:34:31.931 --> 00:34:33.967
each morning we are born again.

692
00:34:34.002 --> 00:34:36.487
And I looked at him and
said. not today grandpa.

693
00:34:38.317 --> 00:34:39.422
Not today.

694
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:43.632
But it planted a seed. right?

695
00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:45.290
And I was already
kinda into Buddhism

696
00:34:45.324 --> 00:34:47.809
but this led me to get deeper
and deeper into Buddhism.

697
00:34:47.844 --> 00:34:49.431
I had dabbled. previously.

698
00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:51.158
I've spoken about
it onstage before.

699
00:34:51.192 --> 00:34:53.021
But after this. I
became quite devout.

700
00:34:53.056 --> 00:34:55.783
I had a meditation
practice everyday.

701
00:34:55.817 --> 00:34:58.958
a daily gratitude practice.

702
00:34:58.993 --> 00:35:02.824
I went to Myanmar
and slaughtered
thousands of Muslims.

703
00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:05.103
Yeah. I'm just trying
to be a good Buddhist.

704
00:35:06.828 --> 00:35:08.451
They lost a few karmic points

705
00:35:08.485 --> 00:35:10.522
when they started dabbling
in genocide. didn't they?

706
00:35:10.556 --> 00:35:13.111
But I did - I did genuinely.

707
00:35:13.145 --> 00:35:16.355
I did go and stay in a
Buddhist temple up in Japan.

708
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.427
Up in the mountains of
Koyasan for a couple of weeks.

709
00:35:19.462 --> 00:35:22.603
And I got up every
morning at like 5:00 A.M.

710
00:35:22.637 --> 00:35:24.846
And I prayed with the monks.

711
00:35:24.881 --> 00:35:26.779
And then. I go back
to my little room

712
00:35:26.814 --> 00:35:30.128
with its tatami mats
and it's simple.

713
00:35:30.162 --> 00:35:32.509
spiritually mindful design

714
00:35:32.544 --> 00:35:34.925
and I would masturbate
to internet pornography.

715
00:35:37.825 --> 00:35:42.174
And I thought. this
experience may be lost on me.

716
00:35:42.209 --> 00:35:43.002
This. this

717
00:35:44.763 --> 00:35:46.696
This is not connection.

718
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.043
This is total isolation.

719
00:35:49.077 --> 00:35:49.975
What am I doing?

720
00:35:50.009 --> 00:35:53.565
What the fuck am I doing?

721
00:35:54.773 --> 00:35:55.739
What is this?

722
00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:57.534
I mean. what are
we as a species?

723
00:35:57.569 --> 00:35:59.916
I mean. when did we
lose faith in ourselves

724
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.194
and decided that it was
more fun to own everything

725
00:36:02.229 --> 00:36:03.230
than take care of it?

726
00:36:03.264 --> 00:36:04.507
Let's face it.

727
00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:05.922
Humans were never
meant to be dominant.

728
00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:07.544
It doesn't make sense.

729
00:36:07.579 --> 00:36:09.753
We don't know how to behave
at the top of the food chain.

730
00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:11.065
We didn't earn it.

731
00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:14.931
You think lions and crocodiles
have existential crises?

732
00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:17.485
No. they just move quick.
get strong. eat shit.

733
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.869
They don't have time to
jerk off in a temple. right?

734
00:36:24.734 --> 00:36:27.909
And before you say. I'm more
disciplined than you. Randy.

735
00:36:27.944 --> 00:36:29.014
I'm not like that.

736
00:36:29.048 --> 00:36:30.912
Bullshit!

737
00:36:30.947 --> 00:36:33.984
You all wank in
your own temples.

738
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:36.849
Humans evolve to
be in the middle.

739
00:36:36.884 --> 00:36:39.266
That's why we're so
bad at running things.

740
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.371
We've got 2 million years
of chemical evolution

741
00:36:41.406 --> 00:36:44.719
telling us to run away from
everything or stab it to death

742
00:36:44.754 --> 00:36:46.065
or fuck it in ear.

743
00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:49.966
Barrel gave us the
opportunity for enlightenment

744
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.726
and we fucking wasted it.

745
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:53.349
We lost our way.

746
00:36:53.383 --> 00:36:54.971
And if you don't believe
me. look around you.

747
00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:56.352
Look at this room.

748
00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:59.527
Room full of magnificent
creatures with
limitless potential

749
00:36:59.562 --> 00:37:03.704
for symbiotic compassion
and spiritual perfection.

750
00:37:03.738 --> 00:37:05.568
paying good money to see a man

751
00:37:05.602 --> 00:37:07.259
that's dedicated the
best years of his life

752
00:37:07.294 --> 00:37:10.607
into finding a way to monetize
screaming at strangers.

753
00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:14.301
I mean. fucking look at my face.

754
00:37:14.335 --> 00:37:16.579
What are you even
watching right now?

755
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:19.961
And what the fuck do I
have to show for this?

756
00:37:19.996 --> 00:37:22.378
Fuck all. 38 years old.

757
00:37:22.412 --> 00:37:26.244
no partner. no kids.
no assets. no savings.

758
00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:27.797
The most expensive thing I own

759
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:29.971
is an autograph copy of
George Michael's "Faith"

760
00:37:30.006 --> 00:37:31.214
on cassette tape!

761
00:37:42.018 --> 00:37:44.158
Oh. I don't fucking know.

762
00:37:45.608 --> 00:37:48.127
I don't know. sometimes you do.

763
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.029
You do. you travel around
and you do shows and-

764
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.828
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know how I go here.

765
00:37:58.862 --> 00:37:59.622
I don't know.

766
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:06.249
- [Crowd] Aww.

767
00:38:07.077 --> 00:38:08.976
Aww. yeah. yeah.

768
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:09.942
- We love you.

769
00:38:09.977 --> 00:38:11.219
- Thank you. I love-
- I'd marry you!

770
00:38:11.254 --> 00:38:12.807
- That's the spirit.

771
00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:17.053
That's where we need to
start. bit of that shit.

772
00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:25.682
Yeah hey mum. no. I'm
still on the road.

773
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.996
Oh I don't even know
where I am right now.

774
00:38:30.204 --> 00:38:31.205
Yeah.

775
00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:33.172
Yeah. I will.

776
00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:35.209
All right.

777
00:38:36.486 --> 00:38:37.660
Yeah no. I'm good. I'm good.

778
00:38:37.694 --> 00:38:38.971
I'm just tired.

779
00:38:39.006 --> 00:38:40.663
Okay. love you too.

780
00:38:41.698 --> 00:38:42.492
Okay. bye.

781
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:50.983
You know actually.

782
00:38:51.018 --> 00:38:55.022
it was my uncle that got me
into comedy. inadvertently.

783
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.888
I got this uncle. he's
an amateur magician.

784
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.996
And by that I mean. he really
wants to be a magician.

785
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:06.033
But he's just fucking amateur!

786
00:39:07.137 --> 00:39:09.036
Just fucking awful!

787
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.385
And he always does these
Christmas shows for us.

788
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.008
He does Christmas magic
shows every Christmas.

789
00:39:16.043 --> 00:39:17.216
And when I say that.

790
00:39:17.251 --> 00:39:19.218
you're probably picturing
like card tricks

791
00:39:19.253 --> 00:39:21.117
and rabbits out of hats.

792
00:39:21.151 --> 00:39:22.394
None of that.

793
00:39:22.429 --> 00:39:25.742
He's like an amateur
escapologist. daredevil.

794
00:39:25.777 --> 00:39:28.089
illusionist kind of magician.

795
00:39:28.124 --> 00:39:32.404
Just doing dangerous.
dangerous shit with no training

796
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:35.234
and not a lot going on upstairs.

797
00:39:36.408 --> 00:39:38.410
One of my earliest
childhood memories right.

798
00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:42.725
he got up on top of the pergola
right. in a straitjacket

799
00:39:42.759 --> 00:39:46.867
and he's gonna jump off the
pergola into the swimming pool

800
00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:50.249
and not surface until he
got out of the straitjacket.

801
00:39:50.284 --> 00:39:52.700
None of us told
him not to do it.

802
00:39:52.735 --> 00:39:57.256
He's up there. on the pergola.
wrapped in his straitjacket

803
00:39:57.291 --> 00:39:59.086
and he does this thing
before he does any trick.

804
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.226
he goes. 3-2-1 ready.

805
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.469
It's like his
little catchphrase.

806
00:40:02.503 --> 00:40:04.402
So. he's up there he
goes. 3-2-1 ready.

807
00:40:04.436 --> 00:40:06.921
He takes a step back
to run up into the pool

808
00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:08.129
and just went

809
00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:10.649
straight through the pergola.

810
00:40:10.684 --> 00:40:14.239
impaled his shoulder
on a star picket.

811
00:40:14.273 --> 00:40:17.553
tore all the ligaments in
his ankle and when he landed.

812
00:40:17.587 --> 00:40:20.176
he made such a loud noise.
it frightened the dog

813
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.040
and the dog bit him on the face.

814
00:40:26.838 --> 00:40:29.944
So. Christmas was
always awesome.

815
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.259
And that year. he wouldn't let
us take him to the hospital.

816
00:40:34.293 --> 00:40:35.329
He's like. I'll be fine.

817
00:40:35.363 --> 00:40:36.641
He just

818
00:40:36.675 --> 00:40:38.263
pulled himself off
the star picket.

819
00:40:38.297 --> 00:40:41.266
cracked a stubby and
went to the barbecue.

820
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.612
you know what I mean?

821
00:40:42.647 --> 00:40:44.994
But as a result. he fucked
his shoulders so bad.

822
00:40:45.028 --> 00:40:46.996
he fucked all the
nerves in his arm

823
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.929
and he's got no feeling
in his left hand.

824
00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:51.310
He can still pick stuff up
but he can't feel things

825
00:40:51.345 --> 00:40:53.796
and he always says horrible.
horrible shit like.

826
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.040
Yeah. Randy. I don't even
need the missus anymore.

827
00:40:57.075 --> 00:41:00.354
I just close me eyes and
think of Mariah Carey.

828
00:41:01.666 --> 00:41:03.633
Yeah. the man's a fucking unit.

829
00:41:03.668 --> 00:41:04.462
So

830
00:41:05.704 --> 00:41:07.361
This one Christmas. this
is how I got into comedy

831
00:41:07.395 --> 00:41:10.053
This one Christmas. someone
from his local RSL club

832
00:41:10.088 --> 00:41:12.884
had given him a little
PeeWee 100 motor bike.

833
00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:15.127
like a little
children's motor bike.

834
00:41:15.162 --> 00:41:18.130
I'm not sure why. maybe
they wanted him dead.

835
00:41:18.165 --> 00:41:20.339
But anyway. he turned
up to Christmas

836
00:41:20.374 --> 00:41:22.894
He turned up to Christmas right.

837
00:41:22.928 --> 00:41:26.138
with this little
PeeWee 100 motor bike

838
00:41:26.173 --> 00:41:29.556
and he built a ramp in his ute.

839
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:33.387
He built a ramp that folded
out of the tray of his ute

840
00:41:33.421 --> 00:41:37.218
and then. up over the
cab of little truck.

841
00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:40.083
And he had this idea that he
was gonna drive his little ute

842
00:41:40.118 --> 00:41:43.501
around to school fetes
and county fairs and stuff

843
00:41:43.535 --> 00:41:48.160
and do jumps on his little
motor bike in his ute ramp.

844
00:41:48.195 --> 00:41:52.233
Again. none of us
told him not to do it.

845
00:41:52.268 --> 00:41:53.545
He turned up with his thing

846
00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.202
and he set it up
across the road.

847
00:41:55.236 --> 00:41:57.238
and we were having Christmas
at my family's house

848
00:41:57.273 --> 00:41:59.240
in the country in
central Victoria.

849
00:41:59.275 --> 00:42:00.656
There's heaps of
paddocks around.

850
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.933
We're in the middle of nowhere

851
00:42:01.967 --> 00:42:03.555
so he loves having
Christmas there

852
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.592
cause he can do dangerous
shit in the paddocks. right.

853
00:42:05.626 --> 00:42:07.248
and really spread out.

854
00:42:07.283 --> 00:42:09.596
So. he built this
obstacle course

855
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.288
and he's across the road
all morning. setting this up

856
00:42:12.322 --> 00:42:14.808
and we're in the house
and we hear. 3-2-1 ready!

857
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:19.398
So. we go across the
road and there he is.

858
00:42:19.433 --> 00:42:20.848
Picture this. he's
a massive dude.

859
00:42:20.883 --> 00:42:21.918
Huge guy.

860
00:42:21.953 --> 00:42:24.024
Strawberry blonde mullet.

861
00:42:24.058 --> 00:42:26.129
Big blonde handlebar mustache

862
00:42:26.164 --> 00:42:28.373
with a nicotine
stain in the middle

863
00:42:28.407 --> 00:42:30.409
like he's been eating an ass.

864
00:42:30.444 --> 00:42:33.136
And he just sits there. right.

865
00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:34.793
He huge in this tiny motor bike.

866
00:42:34.828 --> 00:42:35.967
He's like. here we go.

867
00:42:37.175 --> 00:42:38.383
And he took off.

868
00:42:38.417 --> 00:42:40.040
And he was like weaving
through the cones.

869
00:42:40.074 --> 00:42:41.593
Popping little monos.

870
00:42:41.628 --> 00:42:43.630
He did about 25
minutes as a warm up.

871
00:42:43.664 --> 00:42:47.219
We're like. actually this
is pretty entertaining.

872
00:42:47.254 --> 00:42:48.635
And he gets to the
end of his warm up.

873
00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:51.085
he parks the bike
about maybe 20 meters

874
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.916
from where he's gonna start
his run up to his big jump.

875
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.297
And he added a little bit
of showbiz flare here.

876
00:42:56.332 --> 00:42:57.644
I'll never forget it.

877
00:42:57.678 --> 00:42:59.715
He got off the bike and he
pretended that the motor bike

878
00:42:59.749 --> 00:43:01.717
was too heavy for him to push.

879
00:43:01.751 --> 00:43:03.408
Massive dude. tiny motor bike.

880
00:43:03.442 --> 00:43:04.202
He just goes.

881
00:43:06.445 --> 00:43:07.343
Oh. it's too heavy kids.

882
00:43:07.377 --> 00:43:08.413
I can't push it.

883
00:43:08.447 --> 00:43:10.622
We're like. yay!

884
00:43:10.657 --> 00:43:12.348
Five stars.

885
00:43:12.382 --> 00:43:14.005
You're a comedic genius.

886
00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:15.903
He's like

887
00:43:15.938 --> 00:43:17.733
and then. he just
went. oh bugger it.

888
00:43:17.767 --> 00:43:19.251
Picked the motor bike up.

889
00:43:19.286 --> 00:43:22.289
Put it under his arm and
marched back to the start line.

890
00:43:22.323 --> 00:43:24.153
like a fucking legend.

891
00:43:25.326 --> 00:43:26.638
He gets to the start line.

892
00:43:26.673 --> 00:43:30.366
He goes to put the motor
bike down but he can't.

893
00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:33.093
Because when he picked it up.

894
00:43:33.127 --> 00:43:36.683
he inadvertently put his left
hand on the exhaust pipe.

895
00:43:36.717 --> 00:43:39.133
He's got no feeling
in his left hand.

896
00:43:39.168 --> 00:43:40.790
The exhaust pipe was very hot.

897
00:43:40.825 --> 00:43:42.378
By the time he made it
back to the start line.

898
00:43:42.412 --> 00:43:45.484
his left hand had fused
to the exhaust pipe.

899
00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:48.349
melded to the motor bike.

900
00:43:48.384 --> 00:43:51.525
He's like. oh. I
can't put it down.

901
00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:55.218
We're all like. ahh. the
smell of burning flesh!

902
00:43:57.082 --> 00:43:59.360
All the adults are
pouring beer on it.

903
00:43:59.395 --> 00:44:01.052
He's like. it doesn't
hurt. it doesn't hurt.

904
00:44:01.086 --> 00:44:03.537
We're like. but it's fucked!

905
00:44:04.711 --> 00:44:07.265
That year. he let us
take him to the hospital.

906
00:44:08.404 --> 00:44:10.509
You have a motor bike
attached to your hand.

907
00:44:10.544 --> 00:44:11.752
Get in the fucking car.

908
00:44:12.995 --> 00:44:14.341
But because we were
having Christmas

909
00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:17.309
at my house in the country.
everybody was shit-faced.

910
00:44:17.344 --> 00:44:18.483
because everybody
was staying over.

911
00:44:18.517 --> 00:44:21.210
Everyone was camping so
nobody could drive him

912
00:44:21.244 --> 00:44:25.283
except for me. I'd been on my
learner's permit for one week.

913
00:44:26.387 --> 00:44:28.424
Two hour drive to the hospital.

914
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:31.047
I'm just like white
knuckling it the whole way.

915
00:44:31.082 --> 00:44:34.879
My dad shit-faced
in the passenger sit
just supervising me.

916
00:44:34.913 --> 00:44:36.604
Hey. you're doing a great job.

917
00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:40.850
My uncle. on the backseat.
motor bike on his lap.

918
00:44:42.058 --> 00:44:44.716
his left hand fused
into the exhaust pipe

919
00:44:44.751 --> 00:44:47.754
and then just sculling a long
neck with his right hand.

920
00:44:49.134 --> 00:44:50.998
And that is not what
got me into comedy

921
00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:53.587
but that is definitely
what got me into drinking.

922
00:44:54.657 --> 00:44:56.141
That guy is tough as fuck.

923
00:44:57.384 --> 00:45:02.113
Yes!

924
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.358
It's Christmas
night in emergency.

925
00:45:06.393 --> 00:45:07.359
There's chaos.

926
00:45:07.394 --> 00:45:08.913
There's people impaled
on Christmas trees

927
00:45:08.947 --> 00:45:12.364
and kids that have eaten
Christmas baubles and shit.

928
00:45:12.399 --> 00:45:15.091
And so it's crazy but he
walks through the doors

929
00:45:15.126 --> 00:45:18.405
carrying a motor bike and
the entire room went silent.

930
00:45:18.439 --> 00:45:19.544
I've never seen
anything like it.

931
00:45:19.578 --> 00:45:21.580
All these people just went.

932
00:45:25.067 --> 00:45:26.793
He marches up to the counter.

933
00:45:26.827 --> 00:45:29.588
slams the motor bike down
in front of the triage nurse

934
00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:31.763
and just goes. I've
done a mischief!

935
00:45:34.007 --> 00:45:35.387
They took him into surgery.

936
00:45:35.422 --> 00:45:37.458
He was in there for six hours.

937
00:45:37.493 --> 00:45:39.150
I had to sit in the waiting room

938
00:45:39.184 --> 00:45:40.738
and wait for him the whole time.

939
00:45:40.772 --> 00:45:42.291
And while I was there.

940
00:45:42.325 --> 00:45:44.086
there was an episode of
Seinfeld on the television.

941
00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.225
I was like. I wanna do that.

942
00:45:45.259 --> 00:45:46.157
And here I am.

943
00:45:51.093 --> 00:45:52.301
Thank you. uncle.

944
00:45:54.096 --> 00:45:55.338
Thank you. uncle.

945
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:20.432
We have to start
believing as a collective

946
00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:22.814
that we're capable of
achieving greatness

947
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:25.506
in areas that actually matter.

948
00:46:26.473 --> 00:46:27.646
And it's not gonna be easy.

949
00:46:27.681 --> 00:46:29.096
I'm not up here
saying that I've got.

950
00:46:29.131 --> 00:46:30.649
you know. I haven't
got it figured out.

951
00:46:30.684 --> 00:46:33.169
We just gonna have to try.

952
00:46:33.204 --> 00:46:34.481
If we're gonna get
our shit together.

953
00:46:34.515 --> 00:46:36.448
it's gonna involve
some sacrifice.

954
00:46:36.483 --> 00:46:38.692
You gotta give up a lot of shit.

955
00:46:38.726 --> 00:46:42.213
Stuff like casual misogyny.
listening to commercial radio

956
00:46:42.247 --> 00:46:44.077
and going to the horse races.

957
00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:46.320
Yes.

958
00:46:46.355 --> 00:46:48.184
I'm sorry. there's no
more horse races now.

959
00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.497
Here's a fun fact.

960
00:46:50.531 --> 00:46:52.982
119 race horses died last year.

961
00:46:53.017 --> 00:46:56.641
119 race horses
killed while racing.

962
00:46:56.675 --> 00:46:58.850
To put that into perspective.
that's the equivalent

963
00:46:58.885 --> 00:47:02.233
of six Australian rules
football teams worth of players

964
00:47:02.267 --> 00:47:05.270
dying on the field
during matches.

965
00:47:07.997 --> 00:47:09.654
You reckon if that happened

966
00:47:09.688 --> 00:47:12.657
they probably put a stop to
the sport. don't you think?

967
00:47:12.691 --> 00:47:14.555
It seems a little bit dangerous

968
00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.662
or at the very least
unnecessarily cruel.

969
00:47:17.696 --> 00:47:20.699
Oh. looks like he's
done his hamstring.

970
00:47:24.082 --> 00:47:28.707
Oh. that's an achilles tendon.
out for the season of life.

971
00:47:32.263 --> 00:47:33.160
I think we should do it.

972
00:47:33.195 --> 00:47:34.058
I think we should start killing

973
00:47:34.092 --> 00:47:35.369
some Aussie rules footy players.

974
00:47:35.404 --> 00:47:36.301
send a message to
the racing industry.

975
00:47:38.476 --> 00:47:39.787
Collingwood could go first.

976
00:47:39.822 --> 00:47:40.927
Who's with me?

977
00:47:42.721 --> 00:47:43.481
Yeah!

978
00:47:46.587 --> 00:47:48.969
You all just collectively
supported mass murder.

979
00:47:52.766 --> 00:47:54.285
See that?

980
00:47:54.319 --> 00:47:56.114
Create the right environment.

981
00:47:57.944 --> 00:48:00.947
Elicit the appropriate
emotional frame of mind.

982
00:48:00.981 --> 00:48:03.363
Sprinkle in a few
chemicals like dopamine

983
00:48:03.397 --> 00:48:05.606
or oxytocin or serotonin.

984
00:48:05.641 --> 00:48:06.918
Add some consequences.

985
00:48:06.953 --> 00:48:08.126
Bit of peer pressure.

986
00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:11.578
You can make a person get
behind pretty much anything.

987
00:48:11.612 --> 00:48:12.544
- Yep

988
00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:16.134
- You can manufacture faith.

989
00:48:16.169 --> 00:48:17.411
- Yes.

990
00:48:17.446 --> 00:48:21.726
Anywhere from blind
allegiance to true love

991
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.797
to the belief that
repeatedly hitting a button

992
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:27.111
at an intersection will make
the traffic lights change.

993
00:48:27.145 --> 00:48:28.077
It doesn't work.

994
00:48:28.112 --> 00:48:29.907
You only need to press it once.

995
00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:31.770
It's a time sequence.

996
00:48:31.805 --> 00:48:33.220
But there's always
someone there. isn't it?

997
00:48:33.255 --> 00:48:35.084
Just going. change!

998
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:36.465
Fucking change!

999
00:48:41.125 --> 00:48:43.782
Look. the question I'm
trying to ask is. right.

1000
00:48:43.817 --> 00:48:45.957
if as a species.

1001
00:48:45.992 --> 00:48:49.478
we're naturally predisposed
to collective belief

1002
00:48:49.512 --> 00:48:53.827
and if all faith is
fundamentally manufactured.

1003
00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:57.520
why not just create a new
religion that's wholly inclusive

1004
00:48:57.555 --> 00:49:00.075
and prioritizes
saving the planet.

1005
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:01.628
protecting every living species

1006
00:49:01.662 --> 00:49:05.873
and growing towards spiritual
evolution. in this life.

1007
00:49:05.908 --> 00:49:07.703
not the imaginary next one?

1008
00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:09.187
That's it. that's the question.

1009
00:49:15.883 --> 00:49:17.437
People watching this going.

1010
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:19.439
geez you're a self-righteous
little shit aren't you?

1011
00:49:19.473 --> 00:49:20.716
What are you doing. Randy?

1012
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:21.682
What are you doing?

1013
00:49:23.029 --> 00:49:24.340
Fucking this.

1014
00:49:26.032 --> 00:49:27.723
This is it. this is
all I know how to do.

1015
00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:30.760
This is the only thing
I've developed skills for.

1016
00:49:32.314 --> 00:49:35.489
So. if you've got a skill.
figure out how to apply it.

1017
00:49:35.524 --> 00:49:37.905
Do something. fucking
worthwhile. you cunts.

1018
00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:38.734
Okay. here we go.

1019
00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:44.912
I'm gonna end on a reading.

1020
00:49:44.947 --> 00:49:46.190
All right?

1021
00:49:46.224 --> 00:49:47.743
And then. we're gonna go
off on the night together.

1022
00:49:47.777 --> 00:49:49.538
Change the fucking world.

1023
00:49:54.163 --> 00:49:58.374
And with that. Barrel climb
aboard her space craft

1024
00:49:58.409 --> 00:49:59.272
and buggered off.

1025
00:50:00.687 --> 00:50:02.723
And the sapiens
were left to ponder

1026
00:50:02.758 --> 00:50:04.725
their limitless potential.

1027
00:50:05.692 --> 00:50:09.178
So. said one sapien to another.

1028
00:50:09.213 --> 00:50:10.731
you think she's gonna come back?

1029
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.735
Honestly. said the other sapien.

1030
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.013
I don't know if it matters.

1031
00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:17.428
We should probably get started

1032
00:50:17.462 --> 00:50:19.257
on becoming
enlightened regardless.

1033
00:50:20.707 --> 00:50:23.537
Yeah. said the other sapien.

1034
00:50:23.572 --> 00:50:25.746
I'm sure we'll get it
around to it. eventually.

1035
00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:28.680
Here ends the lesson.

1036
00:50:28.715 --> 00:50:29.440
Thank you very much.

1037
00:50:29.474 --> 00:50:30.441
Good night. thank you.

1038
00:51:24.702 --> 00:51:25.841
- Thank you very much.
