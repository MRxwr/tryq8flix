00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:31.048
Higher is... is my story from growing up on Cape Cod and.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.018
really following my passions.

00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:37.254
letting nothing get in the way of snowboarding

00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.091
and culminating on the high peaks of the Himalayas.

00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:44.662
And along the way... I realized that.

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:47.464
it's not about standing on the highest peak.

00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.800
or not about the descent.

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:55.272
it's really... it's the journey. the emotions along the way.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.345
the people you meet along the way. and it's um...

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:06.383
truly is. you know. the journey is the reward.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.875
Jeremy. like his two older brothers was very active.

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:21.178
very interested in sports.

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:24.214
We were all skiers in the family.

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.284
I recall him getting his first snowboard

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:30.521
from Shaw's General Store in Stowe. Vermont.

00:04:30.587 --> 00:04:34.425
I went to Shaw's. like. the day before Christmas

00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:37.661
and there were three of these boards in there.

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:40.230
I didn't really know what it was.

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:42.332
but I bought three of them and

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.802
Jeremy. Todd and Steve. took them out.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.372
At an early age we got really into skateboarding and

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.275
then surfing. and I was also into skiing at the time.

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.544
And I first saw snowboarding in Thrasher Mag.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.946
my first thought was. 'Finally.'

00:04:56.013 --> 00:05:00.150
I had been on the mountain a bunch on skis and I always looked at the mountain going.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:04.121
'Man. it would be so cool to be able to ride down this thing sideways.'

00:05:04.188 --> 00:05:07.691
Three of us would get up. go shred the mountain all day on our skis.

00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:10.527
and then we'd come home and turn on the floodlights

00:05:10.594 --> 00:05:13.430
and he would go until he was called in to go to bed.

00:05:13.497 --> 00:05:16.500
We were away at school and Jeremy was still at home.

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:19.136
and we came back up to Vermont one weekend and

00:05:19.203 --> 00:05:21.839
we're like. 'Where... where are our snowboards?'

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.807
And he took all the boards and

00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:25.342
went down to the General Store

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.511
and they let him trade those in for one with edges.

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:30.547
I was the youngest of three brothers and.

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:35.519
and definitely knew that I'd see some abuse for that decision.

00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.554
but I had to have that board.

00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:42.593
And if that meant taking a couple lumps. then. so be it.

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:55.072
It wasn't allowed in Stowe to snowboard on the mountain for a few years.

00:05:55.138 --> 00:06:00.878
Jeremy just was relentless in his pursuit of getting a pass.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:06.483
He was the first person to ever get a snowboard pass in Stowe. Vermont.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.220
I went to my first snowboard contest on the East Coast

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.389
when I was fourteen years old.

00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:15.092
I did thirty-five contests a year.

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:19.196
We would live early Friday so we could get to the half-pipe by Friday afternoon.

00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:24.535
We would session the half-pipe and in the process find a couch to surf.

00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:27.004
Back East at that time.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.806
it was just a gathering of the tribes at this point.

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:32.075
because a lot of us really were terrible.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:37.047
There was no itinerary other then get to the mountain to register at 7:00 AM

00:06:37.114 --> 00:06:40.317
on a coffee table in some broom closet at the ski resort.

00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:41.919
Everyone would have duct tape.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.956
You'd be inside the lodge. duct taping up your gear.

00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:48.825
It was raw. It was what snowboarding was back then.

00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:51.595
It was a full rebel sport. It was awesome.

00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.530
Next at the top. Jeremy Jones.

00:06:53.597 --> 00:06:55.899
sixteen years old out of Kingfield. Maine.

00:06:55.966 --> 00:06:58.435
Yeah. our youngest competitor hits the course...

00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:03.640
When I was sixteen. I went on the professional tour as much as I could afford.

00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:10.814
He said. 'If I don't do anything in two years. then I'll consider going to college.

00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:14.785
I knew early on there was no way I was going to college.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.821
Once I found snowboarding. it just took over my life.

00:07:17.888 --> 00:07:21.892
It seemed like Jeremy was going to do whatever it took

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.896
to make snowboarding the focal point of his life.

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:33.370
Along the way. going to my first race.

00:07:33.437 --> 00:07:36.607
I went to Jackson Hole to visit my brothers.

00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:39.610
And saw this world that I didn't know existed.

00:07:39.676 --> 00:07:45.882
I was surrounded by dishwashers and waiters. and real professional dirtbags.

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:48.785
but they were riding every day. all day. in Jackson.

00:07:48.852 --> 00:07:51.488
I had no idea something like that existed.

00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:53.890
It changed my life right then and there.

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:56.960
I was like. 'Wow. this is the snowboarding I want to do.'

00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:12.442
I'd go to Jackson every year. once or twice a year. if I had any break in my schedule.

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.912
Throughout racing. it was always this fallback plan.

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:19.683
if this gets to a point where I'm not having fun anymore.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:25.722
then it's time to go to this next phase of snowboarding. which is full time freeriding.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.925
I'm here with Bryan Iguchi and hoping to ride the Grand.

00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:05.462
It's something I've looked at for over twenty years now.

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.031
and um... I spent time here.

00:09:08.098 --> 00:09:11.935
I wanted the Tetons to be in Deeper. I wanted them to be in Further.

00:09:12.002 --> 00:09:16.707
and we put in some hard time in the Tetons. got shut down every time.

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:20.844
It's just been this. really a challenging range

00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:24.648
to try and get up and hit the major lines.

00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:27.851
This year I reached out to Z and Brendon.

00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:32.622
who are both Exum guides and have been spending a bunch of time high in the Tetons.

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:38.795
The Tetons are truly the epicenter of big mountain skiing in the lower 48.

00:09:38.862 --> 00:09:41.798
Of course that culminated with Bill Briggs in 1971.

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:46.403
having this wild imagination to go and click into skis on top of The Grand Teton.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.574
I had no doubts at all I could ski it.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.979
Climbing up there. I had my real doubts I had the strength to do it.

00:09:56.046 --> 00:10:01.985
The Otter Body as a ski line is really the dream child of Doug Coombs and Mark Newcomb.

00:10:02.052 --> 00:10:05.222
Once you finished skiing the East Face. you roll into a choke.

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:09.326
and use that to repel onto another hanging snowfield.

00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:11.762
as referred to as the Otter Body.

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.731
You then have a series of three. double rope repels

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:19.736
and they end with free hanging repel. right onto the Teepee Glacier.

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:23.907
Doug Coombs was a huge influence on my life.

00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:27.477
He was larger than life. like Superman.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:33.049
in the mountains and. you know. I always cherished my time with Doug.

00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:36.686
About a month before he died. he reached out and said.

00:10:36.753 --> 00:10:39.556
'Hey. I want to take you up the Grand.'

00:10:39.623 --> 00:10:43.193
You know. unfortunately we never got to do that.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.098
You know. the harsh reality of spending a bunch of time in these serious mountains.

00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:50.200
is they have consequences.

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.142
It was a recon mission to check out the snow.

00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:02.179
and get as close as we could to our objective.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.648
And this is as physically close as we could.

00:11:04.714 --> 00:11:06.883
getting that kind of angle of perspective.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.785
And it really was right in your face.

00:11:08.852 --> 00:11:11.388
I mean you look out and it's just right there.

00:11:11.455 --> 00:11:14.057
You can't make mistakes on something like this.

00:11:14.124 --> 00:11:17.127
And that's the biggest thing. it has to go a certain way.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.732
You see how there's that wind lip. though?

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:24.568
- On that little... - I like that

00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:27.771
It's a nice protection there. you just ride that little wave

00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:30.273
Protection from what. though?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.408
Comfort.

00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:32.909
Mental protection.

00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:34.144
At least you're not looking off onto the abyss.

00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:36.513
You see a little edge.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.549
Yeah. so you'll only have like a four hundred footer underneath you. instead of...

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.585
A thousand footer.

00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:44.921
Bout time we're on that thing. it's going to have to be pretty settled.

00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:48.525
I think we all recognize we're hanging it out there on a line like this.

00:11:48.592 --> 00:11:53.830
and we're going to employ every single trick in the book. to mitigate the hazards.

00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:58.335
Mistakes are not easily forgiven up there. for sure.

00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:02.005
It's definitely way more real. being that close.

00:12:02.072 --> 00:12:05.275
The reality of how big and steep it is.

00:12:05.342 --> 00:12:08.778
The size. just the sheer mass.

00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:11.481
You know. that block.

00:12:11.548 --> 00:12:16.119
I wouldn't say I gained confidence by getting that close to it.

00:12:24.094 --> 00:12:27.430
You know. this is turned into a major snow event.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.433
This is definitely a major snow event. for sure.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.638
But we're not worried about any deep instability in the pack.

00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:37.240
Feel really good about the overall snowpack.

00:12:37.307 --> 00:12:41.177
It's really. like. shockingly right-side up. very unique.

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:45.115
I'm totally foreign to the snowpack.

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.952
We need to really be comfortable with backing down.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.254
unless it's absolutely perfect.

00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:56.293
This thing needs to be a hundred percent or I want nothing to do with it.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:13:04.834
We can't fool ourselves into thinking that we can eliminate the risk on a line like that.

00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:07.871
So. yeah. a little bit of a waiting game.

00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:15.045
In the middle of a little storm cycle in the Tetons.

00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:20.350
Going to stretch the legs and ride some pow. with my good friend Bryan Iguchi.

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:25.455
We couldn't have come from more opposite ends of the spectrum of snowboarding.

00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:29.926
He was jibber. freestyle. and I'm in a speed suit riding hard boots.

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:33.830
Over the last ten years. we've been on a similar path.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:37.867
Just getting educated and taking it further and further.

00:14:25.915 --> 00:14:30.153
Seeing the weather window calming. it looks like it's taking shape.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.857
It's definitely a lot more snow then I was anticipating.

00:14:33.923 --> 00:14:37.961
Going into something this serious. and big.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.645
We've climbed about 2000ft

00:14:55.712 --> 00:14:59.649
We're still doing. this. to see the top of the peak.

00:14:59.716 --> 00:15:01.251
She's a big one.

00:15:11.561 --> 00:15:17.000
My immediate anxiety is making it through the night warm.

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.336
I'm in two summer bags. stacked together.

00:15:20.403 --> 00:15:24.074
A sleeping pad that seems like it got pulled off a lawn chair.

00:15:26.042 --> 00:15:29.913
And it's definite below zero action.

00:15:29.979 --> 00:15:33.583
it's a little different then California.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.485
The snow sure is better!

00:15:36.986 --> 00:15:39.155
Oh. we've got that going for us!

00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:42.792
Ah. it feels so good just to lay down for a second.

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:57.540
Prior to the mission I had a lot of anxiety for the climb.

00:15:57.607 --> 00:16:01.177
then I woke up in the morning. and just was like.

00:16:01.244 --> 00:16:03.446
I got really excited for it.

00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:07.083
I'm like. 'We're going rock climbing. I got my snowboard on my back

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.486
and I'm going to climb the Grand.'

00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:19.796
You're on belay. Z.

00:16:19.863 --> 00:16:21.965
You got Z leading.

00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:23.867
Going up there.

00:16:23.933 --> 00:16:26.069
This is the fun part.

00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:29.506
Climbing.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:35.044
Crawling.

00:16:43.987 --> 00:16:47.157
Come on keep it moving.

00:17:02.872 --> 00:17:07.143
The hardest 5.4 move I've done.

00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:20.190
We are getting close.

00:17:20.256 --> 00:17:25.361
Getting through some of the final technical climbing moves before the summit.

00:17:50.687 --> 00:17:52.021
Oh!

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:57.460
Top of the Grand. long time in the making.

00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:14.777
The real deal heavy stuff is still below us.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:19.782
we're going to evaluate snow and see if today's the day or not.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:24.320
First time I've ever had this. where I had these light shakes.

00:18:24.387 --> 00:18:29.259
It was like my brain was trying to tell my body to calm down.

00:18:29.325 --> 00:18:35.031
Just trying to keep breathing.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.372
Yeah. Jer man.

00:18:44.807 --> 00:18:46.976
Let up. enjoy this!

00:19:07.297 --> 00:19:09.065
You've got to be kidding me.

00:19:09.132 --> 00:19:11.267
Alright. dropping!

00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:30.954
That was unbelievable!

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.956
I cannot believe the pow!

00:19:34.023 --> 00:19:37.694
That gets me in the game. dude.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.861
No way!

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.363
Are you kidding me?

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.333
Oh. my God.

00:19:47.637 --> 00:19:54.010
It was kind of miraculous that it was just such a uniform. right side-up snowpack.

00:19:54.077 --> 00:19:59.482
Seeing all that and not being able to produce results on any of our tests.

00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:02.752
it still just felt like this is out there.

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:06.322
At that point. I dropped in onto this huge hanging snowfield

00:20:06.389 --> 00:20:09.192
and skied into that anchor.

00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:12.495
Jeremy. this is Z. I'm into the first anchor.

00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:15.231
you can drop whenever you're ready.

00:20:18.868 --> 00:20:22.238
The snowfield dead ends at the anchor. at this pinch.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:25.842
so your position just gets more and more precarious.

00:20:25.908 --> 00:20:27.677
rather than better and better.

00:20:27.744 --> 00:20:31.748
As you roll into that anchor. if anything does start moving above you.

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:34.550
you'd have no chance of surviving.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.360
- Watch the rock - Yeah.

00:20:44.427 --> 00:20:47.730
- I'm locked. - Alright. I'm in.

00:20:47.797 --> 00:20:50.066
Give me a little tension.

00:20:52.135 --> 00:20:53.202
Off!

00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:57.774
Jeremy's off belay. you can drop when ready.

00:21:05.715 --> 00:21:07.383
Up and lock.

00:21:08.785 --> 00:21:13.022
Okay. I need to switch to heels. hang on a bit. Z.

00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:14.857
Okay. cool.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.662
Off belay!

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:26.202
I don't like that snow

00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:28.471
We had just pulled on to the Otter Body

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:31.874
and Zahan had just pulled up to us and started to dig a pit.

00:21:31.941 --> 00:21:33.509
I was in the lowest position.

00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:36.813
trying to get an assessment of the stability on this next slope

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:40.149
but then there was this. sort of. ominous sound.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.318
Sluff! Sluff! Sluff!

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:58.835
Holy Shit!

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:02.105
That was probably one of the heaviest things I've ever experienced.

00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:04.373
being on a steep. exposed face like this

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.678
and having just a waterfall continue to come and pour over my head

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.913
and over Z below me.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.387
That portion of the line. the actual Otter Body.

00:22:18.454 --> 00:22:21.224
is really just kind a far out there experience.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.660
You're on the East Face of the Grand. on this little patch of snow.

00:22:24.727 --> 00:22:27.663
that's totally disconnected from any other snow.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.966
It's kind of not even supposed to happen.

00:22:30.032 --> 00:22:32.735
I'll drop next and go straight to the anchor.

00:22:32.802 --> 00:22:35.371
It's warming rapidly. we got to go.

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:38.107
Keep your eyes open for an anchor!

00:22:38.174 --> 00:22:39.442
Okay!

00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:42.445
K. right in here is the rocks.

00:22:46.716 --> 00:22:50.086
So. we're over a four hundred footer

00:22:50.153 --> 00:22:53.523
and we need an anchor to get out of here.

00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:58.694
I'm really happy to get on these final repels.

00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:06.602
Hey Bryan. this is Brendon.

00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:09.305
You can ski down to Jeremy and I.

00:23:09.372 --> 00:23:12.341
- Fully wait for rope - Yup.

00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:18.014
- Wasn't me. - Nope. that's spin drift.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.583
Okay. Jeremy's repelling!

00:23:22.752 --> 00:23:25.655
Okay. I'll lock you. come off repel.

00:23:28.758 --> 00:23:31.727
We're almost onto the second repel.

00:23:31.794 --> 00:23:35.965
we've got one more repel. Z's at the anchor.

00:23:36.032 --> 00:23:38.434
Fuck

00:23:42.038 --> 00:23:43.239
Off repel!

00:23:43.306 --> 00:23:45.541
Okay. Gutch. you can go ahead and repel.

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:55.318
Whoa. it feels good to get off.

00:23:55.384 --> 00:23:58.955
All four down and clear. halleluiah!

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:03.759
Copies. all four down and clear. strong work. fellas.

00:24:03.826 --> 00:24:06.028
Whoa. spin drift.

00:24:06.095 --> 00:24:07.396
Whoa.

00:24:07.463 --> 00:24:10.433
Alright. let's talk about it down there.

00:24:10.499 --> 00:24:12.969
Mountains are still talking to us.

00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:15.671
Party run!

00:25:01.183 --> 00:25:05.254
I love the fact that you've got other people. following along.

00:25:05.321 --> 00:25:09.925
They're not doing it necessarily my way. they're doing it their way.

00:25:09.992 --> 00:25:14.063
The idea is to have each person. doing his own creative thing.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.632
That's the valley here. that's Jackson.

00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:19.602
You have this expanding type of thing and what not.

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:21.837
I think it's fabulous development.

00:25:21.904 --> 00:25:25.408
If I had anything to do with it. I'm proud.

00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:40.756
I'm kind of a train wreck out of the mountains.

00:25:40.823 --> 00:25:45.428
Meaning the wheels definitely come off

00:25:45.494 --> 00:25:48.130
the further away I get from the mountains.

00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:52.201
And when I'm in the mountains. it really feels like home to me

00:25:52.268 --> 00:25:57.173
and life is simpler and it's. it's really the world I'm most comfortable with

00:25:57.239 --> 00:26:04.347
and when I get out of that. it's not as natural.

00:26:04.413 --> 00:26:07.750
My snowboard is. it's like my art form.

00:26:07.817 --> 00:26:12.154
in the sense of it. with my snowboard in the mountains.

00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:18.394
is where I can kind of go to this space. this real special place.

00:26:18.461 --> 00:26:23.032
that is so different from the day in and day out of reality.

00:26:23.099 --> 00:26:26.135
I guess at the end of the day though.

00:26:26.202 --> 00:26:31.807
that's where life feels the most pure. the most rich. the most real to me.

00:26:50.693 --> 00:26:56.866
They told us in. I think. 93'. that it was going to be in the Olympics in 98'.

00:26:56.932 --> 00:27:02.304
So. at that point. we definitely focused from 93' to 98' at the Olympic Dream.

00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:07.510
Instantly. it's like. sponsors are fired up. my parents are fired up.

00:27:07.576 --> 00:27:09.812
I mean I was excited and working hard.

00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:15.017
No matter what. if I made it to the Olympics that was going to be my last race.

00:27:15.084 --> 00:27:18.587
We had Olympic qualifiers leading up to it.

00:27:18.654 --> 00:27:21.624
On the last run of the last event.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.527
I would have needed to win the contest

00:27:24.593 --> 00:27:27.596
and I would have had a spot on the Olympic team.

00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:29.799
And I got third place at the last race

00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:34.103
and it was a really cool experience. because I was up there with my closest friend.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.638
Adam Hostetter.

00:27:35.704 --> 00:27:39.275
You could definitely see that his eye was on the prize.

00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:42.711
but it wasn't the Olympics. it was well beyond the Olympics.

00:27:42.778 --> 00:27:46.482
Where as. my eye was probably on the prize and it was just the Olympics.

00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:52.822
Didn't make the Olympic team. and never put on hard boots ever again after that.

00:27:52.888 --> 00:28:00.262
You get older and that whole. quote 'ski bum life.' becomes unattainable.

00:28:00.329 --> 00:28:01.730
You have to get a real job.

00:28:01.797 --> 00:28:04.099
If he didn't want to go to college

00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:12.341
then he knew that he had to figure out a way to make a living out of snowboarding.

00:28:12.408 --> 00:28:17.513
During the tail end of his race career. he would finish the race season

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.682
and come up to Alaska with us.

00:28:19.748 --> 00:28:22.484
Steve and I. we had been heli ski guiding.

00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:25.821
We would spend all our money and then get on commercial fishing boats

00:28:25.888 --> 00:28:29.492
and replenish the coffers for the next winter of adventures.

00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:34.163
And during one of those cycles. we decided. 'Hey. lets buy a camera.'

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.466
and that was when we started Teton Gravity Research.

00:28:37.533 --> 00:28:40.870
The first day we ever shot film. I dropped in with the camera.

00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:46.575
and went down and set it up and the first frames that I ever rolled were of Jeremy.

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:50.746
We were having a blast. and just seeing where we could take it.

00:28:50.813 --> 00:28:55.918
Jer's first trip to Alaska. he had never ridden that maritime snowpack

00:28:55.985 --> 00:29:02.024
and he made his first couple of turns and I just saw him. all of a sudden. get it.

00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:06.061
And he just came down grinning. ear to ear.

00:29:06.128 --> 00:29:10.799
'Oh. my God. I've never seen pow stick to something that steep.'

00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:17.706
He started to really show his true colors. as an exceptional big mountain rider.

00:29:17.773 --> 00:29:20.175
It was a turning point for him.

00:29:20.242 --> 00:29:23.979
I think it was. it was a point where he had discovered Alaska.

00:29:24.046 --> 00:29:26.515
he'd discovered big mountain riding.

00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:30.286
he'd discovered a new path to continue to snowboard.

00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:34.523
My names Jeremy Jones and I'm into hanging out.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:41.430
I've been doing a lot of hanging out this year. especially in Alaska.

00:29:41.497 --> 00:29:42.965
Sick.

00:29:43.032 --> 00:29:46.035
When I stopped racing and focused solely on freeriding.

00:29:46.101 --> 00:29:51.240
the level of intensity was so much greater than when I was trying to go to the Olympics.

00:29:51.307 --> 00:29:56.645
And what I learned there was you can't go out and snowboard for someone else.

00:29:56.712 --> 00:30:00.950
It's not going to work and it didn't work. I didn't go to the Olympics.

00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:03.819
Because. I was doing it for other people.

00:30:29.044 --> 00:30:32.915
If you put everything you have into it. before you know it.

00:30:32.982 --> 00:30:37.519
you're going to meet your heroes. And that's what happened to me in Alaska.

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:40.456
I mean I had full access to my heroes.

00:30:40.522 --> 00:30:43.425
like Tom Burt. Doug Coombs. Hatchett brothers.

00:30:43.492 --> 00:30:47.196
They're just sitting on a tailgate waiting for the clouds to break.

00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:51.266
The backbone of my snowboarding came from their approach in the mountains.

00:30:53.902 --> 00:30:58.140
Jeremy ends up with a mastered turn.

00:30:58.207 --> 00:31:02.311
and then he learns some freestyle. and he takes all of that

00:31:02.378 --> 00:31:05.914
and he just crushes.

00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:09.418
He's pushed the boundaries

00:31:09.485 --> 00:31:13.656
and peoples perception of what's possible on a snowboard.

00:31:13.722 --> 00:31:18.260
I can very clearly remember watching him riding spines

00:31:18.327 --> 00:31:20.662
on just straight. slick. rock walls.

00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:27.002
God. that stuff. that's really high consequence and he was just nailing it.

00:31:35.677 --> 00:31:43.052
Early 2000s. snowboarding really started shifting to almost all freestyle.

00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:46.522
You know. you had to be hitting a handrail or in the park

00:31:46.588 --> 00:31:48.290
doing some technical trick.

00:31:48.357 --> 00:31:51.260
That's what's so cool about Jeremy; He never followed.

00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:54.063
the snowboard industry. Never listened to the sponsors.

00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:56.665
who were probably harping on him. do this. or do that.

00:31:56.732 --> 00:31:59.134
I have a lot of respect for Jeremy for doing that. for just saying.

00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:02.104
'Hey. fuck you.' to those guys. I'm going to stay in the big mountains

00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:05.441
and if you want to sponsor me. sponsor me. and if you want to cut me. cut me.

00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:07.342
I don't think Jeremy even cared.

00:32:07.409 --> 00:32:11.313
I think he was like. 'I'm going to ride big mountains forever.'

00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:03.732
It's really cool to know that there's these lines

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:07.536
that you couldn't possibly dream up being that perfect.

00:33:07.603 --> 00:33:10.772
And going into unknown. insane terrain.

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:20.549
That is really a cool feeling and one that I continue to look for.

00:33:26.288 --> 00:33:34.863
Usually about three days before Jer takes off. tension gets high around the house.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.999
The kids start to sense it

00:33:37.065 --> 00:33:42.004
and they kind of understand now that Dad is going to be gone for a while.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:47.943
I think it just breaks his heart to say good-bye to them.

00:33:53.849 --> 00:33:56.185
-Are you strapped in? -Yes.

00:33:56.251 --> 00:34:00.255
Tell them that you're not going. That you don't want to go.

00:34:00.322 --> 00:34:03.625
But I like going into the mountians and snowboarding.

00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.595
But I don't want you too.

00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:13.468
It's very easy for someone to sit back and say.

00:34:13.535 --> 00:34:17.306
he's crazy. he's selfish. this guy's a jerk.

00:34:17.372 --> 00:34:21.176
to go out and do what he does with family at home.

00:34:21.243 --> 00:34:23.679
And I struggle with that.

00:34:23.745 --> 00:34:28.116
It's just hard for me to imagine living my life a different way.

00:34:28.183 --> 00:34:33.255
There's just so many different ways to die. and I think life is precious.

00:34:33.322 --> 00:34:37.125
Taking stupid risks is definitely irresponsible.

00:34:37.192 --> 00:34:44.499
But my kids need to see people living life and drinking life up as much as possible.

00:34:49.972 --> 00:34:56.511
This could be a cool time to go into an area that very few people go into.

00:34:56.578 --> 00:34:57.446
That's sick.

00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:59.681
-Isn't that sick? -Yeah.

00:34:59.748 --> 00:35:04.853
This year in particular. I feel like Jones. to throw another element of wildness to it.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.824
zero plan. Show up if you want and we'll figure it out.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:13.629
I've been to Alaska every spring for almost twenty years

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:17.766
and all my riding has been focused on these coastal ranges.

00:35:17.833 --> 00:35:23.672
Going to the Eastern Alaskan Range was just so far out of my comfort zone.

00:35:23.739 --> 00:35:29.378
It's just a totally different geography and type of snowpack.

00:35:29.444 --> 00:35:34.116
Let's go see if we find our the Holy Grail.

00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:38.287
You guys are climbers?

00:35:38.353 --> 00:35:42.157
We like to climb mountains and snowboard back down them.

00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:43.759
Oh. really? Awesome.

00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:49.564
It may be this big. blob mountain coming right out there.

00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:52.501
If I'm going to Alaska. Ryland's coming with me.

00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:55.837
He rides those mountains as good as anyone in the world

00:35:55.904 --> 00:36:00.609
and has that perfect attitude that's needed to deal with the highs and lows.

00:36:00.676 --> 00:36:04.479
that come with a long trip camped in the mountains.

00:36:04.546 --> 00:36:05.881
So. like. this guy.

00:36:05.948 --> 00:36:07.015
Which one?

00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:10.052
This face at. uh. kind of 9:30.

00:36:10.118 --> 00:36:13.455
Oh. that face there? That looks crazy to me.

00:36:13.522 --> 00:36:17.826
I think we have a good zone. but a ton of unknowns ahead of us.

00:36:17.893 --> 00:36:19.761
Definitely some anxiety.

00:36:19.828 --> 00:36:21.830
Not as many epic faces.

00:36:21.897 --> 00:36:27.235
but the faces that are epic. are so mind blowing. it's unbelievable.

00:36:27.302 --> 00:36:30.906
It's right in here. is what we call the super wall.

00:36:30.973 --> 00:36:33.408
Your looking at some big walls.

00:36:33.475 --> 00:36:36.678
There's a couple of lines that we saw.

00:36:36.745 --> 00:36:39.381
definitely be willing to think about.

00:36:39.448 --> 00:36:45.821
but a couple that Jones was seriously considering are absolutely game off to me.

00:36:45.887 --> 00:36:49.758
And at this stage of my life. I would rather.

00:36:49.825 --> 00:36:58.033
put a ton of energy into one line that's one of the best lines of my life.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.771
It happened in a flash. a deadly avalanche in Colorado Rocky Mountains.

00:37:02.838 --> 00:37:05.974
A group of snowboarders were buried alive.

00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:08.877
five of them died. only one survivor.

00:37:08.944 --> 00:37:12.481
We're getting ready to launch into the mountains

00:37:12.547 --> 00:37:16.385
and I get word that five people died in an avalanche in Loveland

00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:19.821
and one of them is a close friend of mine. Joe Timlin.

00:37:19.888 --> 00:37:24.659
I met Joe through Jones Snowboards; He was one of the first reps I hired.

00:37:24.726 --> 00:37:29.297
And I think that was just because he had that pure love of snowboarding

00:37:29.364 --> 00:37:35.270
and set his life up around snowboarding and we shared that same passion.

00:37:46.782 --> 00:37:51.253
I mean it just rocked my world; I just could not believe it

00:37:51.319 --> 00:37:57.259
and the last thing I wanted to do was go into the mountains and go snowboarding.

00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:07.135
As hard as those lessons are. it gives me perspective and regrounds me.

00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:14.876
and kind of brings me back down to ground zero and it's the ultimate humility.

00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:24.419
My first impressions were... fear. I would say.

00:38:24.486 --> 00:38:29.724
Instantly the seracs start cracking down off the side of the mountain

00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:31.259
and its just echoing with.

00:38:31.326 --> 00:38:35.997
Boom! Boom! It's like. hitting rocks. blowing up. huge rumble

00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:40.235
and all of a sudden you realize the scale of the place that you're in.

00:38:40.302 --> 00:38:47.375
I picked the zone because of this one face that we're camped underneath.

00:38:47.442 --> 00:38:50.912
There is definitely a wide array of lines on it.

00:38:50.979 --> 00:38:56.918
but there is one real cherry line right off the summit that hopefully I can ride.

00:38:59.888 --> 00:39:03.291
We have no information on this range.

00:39:03.358 --> 00:39:09.464
It's like that 'Alaska Snowpack Evaluation Handbook' is thrown out the window.

00:39:09.531 --> 00:39:13.134
So. we're out of our comfort zone for sure.

00:39:13.201 --> 00:39:16.505
That is a big face. If you do one turn

00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:19.975
and 'Oh. shit. it's three inches of pow on blue ice.'

00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:23.211
don't want to be taking a ride to the bottom.

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:27.182
At the base of our primary objective.

00:39:27.249 --> 00:39:29.918
Just going to look at some layers.

00:39:29.985 --> 00:39:35.223
maybe do a test or two. and then I think it's dinnertime.

00:39:37.058 --> 00:39:42.163
I think it's rideable. I'm just a little concerned about the ice.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.200
Like bulletproof. Like bulletproof ice.

00:39:45.267 --> 00:39:53.942
Really. I feel like the only way to find out is to just get on it. Start climbing it.

00:39:54.009 --> 00:39:57.712
We're at the base of the face.

00:39:57.779 --> 00:40:00.282
Looks upside down steep.

00:40:00.348 --> 00:40:03.585
Hoping it changes when we get on it.

00:40:03.652 --> 00:40:06.555
So. moment of truth is upon us.

00:40:14.029 --> 00:40:18.900
Well. this is the blue ice. though. I think.

00:40:18.967 --> 00:40:21.903
Better than I thought.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.408
Who knows how it'll do with a day of wind on it.

00:40:26.474 --> 00:40:29.411
but definitely got potential.

00:40:29.477 --> 00:40:32.047
Why the fuck am I up here right now?

00:40:32.113 --> 00:40:35.517
Well we still have questions about what's above us.

00:40:35.584 --> 00:40:40.455
we're going to be able to feel some real bulletproof stuff right here.

00:40:40.522 --> 00:40:45.293
So. I'm going to give it a feel and go from here.

00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:49.431
I think I'll ride the face today.

00:40:49.497 --> 00:40:53.768
I might come up and ride this lower flank again if the light is good

00:40:53.835 --> 00:40:55.170
or whatever.

00:40:55.236 --> 00:40:59.007
but I'm not feeling it.

00:41:05.113 --> 00:41:07.515
Whoa

00:41:09.284 --> 00:41:11.353
I'm afraid to look at my tent.

00:41:11.419 --> 00:41:16.825
It's not nearly as buttoned up as this one. and this one's shaking a lot.

00:41:21.596 --> 00:41:24.599
Riders on the storm.

00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:27.502
It's going to be a loud night.

00:41:27.569 --> 00:41:30.939
How well is this thing built?

00:41:33.742 --> 00:41:36.444
Right now it's batting down the hatches

00:41:36.511 --> 00:41:39.881
and just. make sure stuff hold up in this wind.

00:41:39.948 --> 00:41:43.285
But as far as the line that we're camped here for.

00:41:43.351 --> 00:41:48.623
I can say that that's probably really good ice climbing.

00:41:53.728 --> 00:41:56.898
It's like. full blizzard. Temperatures changed

00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:59.434
and we could be in this for a few days.

00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:01.970
So I don't know. it is what it is.

00:42:02.037 --> 00:42:05.573
We can't just get up and leave. kind of impossible.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.610
Man. it just really came down last night. it's insane.

00:42:08.677 --> 00:42:11.613
Like. everyone's tents were completely buried.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.784
Every four hours we have to shovel out our tents.

00:42:20.188 --> 00:42:21.589
It's still snowing.

00:42:21.656 --> 00:42:24.359
Snow most of the way up my tent.

00:42:24.426 --> 00:42:28.096
I'm pretty snowed in. right now.

00:42:34.436 --> 00:42:37.038
Unbelievable.

00:42:37.105 --> 00:42:39.808
Wow. can't believe my tent stayed up.

00:42:39.874 --> 00:42:42.177
Yeah. well not all of them did.

00:42:42.243 --> 00:42:44.045
Really?

00:42:44.112 --> 00:42:45.547
Sad day.

00:42:45.613 --> 00:42:48.049
Sad day. what happened?

00:42:48.116 --> 00:42:50.051
-Did the tent collapse? -Yup.

00:42:50.118 --> 00:42:51.519
-The big one did? -Yup.

00:42:51.586 --> 00:42:53.855
That's why I can't see it?

00:42:53.922 --> 00:42:55.657
Oouuuu...

00:42:55.724 --> 00:42:57.158
Owe.

00:42:58.193 --> 00:43:00.228
That's hard hitting.

00:43:02.831 --> 00:43:10.805
Snowed 2ft last night. no wind. stright down. collapsed the tent. broke every pole.

00:43:10.872 --> 00:43:16.144
That was one of the first moments where I've been like. this isn't worth it.

00:43:16.211 --> 00:43:20.148
I just knew that there were these massive amounts of snow up overhead

00:43:20.215 --> 00:43:23.518
and if something happened you wouldn't even hear it coming.

00:43:23.585 --> 00:43:26.054
If there was a massive. large scale avalanche.

00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:28.623
it would just. could take you out like that.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.594
It's been a wild twenty-four hours.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.564
I've heard a lot of avalanches. serac falls.

00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:39.834
We wanted a storm but not like this one.

00:43:41.469 --> 00:43:47.976
First time we haven't heard snow in at least three days.

00:43:56.518 --> 00:44:00.622
-Got spines. -Got spines.

00:44:02.657 --> 00:44:07.428
I'll never forget. coming out of my tent that morning and looking up.

00:44:07.495 --> 00:44:13.935
and seeing. like. the most incredible spine wall I've ever seen.

00:44:14.002 --> 00:44:16.204
Oh. my God.

00:44:16.271 --> 00:44:21.776
Somehow we found one of the sickest faces on the planet and we didn't even know it.

00:44:21.843 --> 00:44:27.415
For the first time of the trip. I realized. like. wow. we might be riding this thing.

00:44:27.482 --> 00:44:34.088
Time to really start evaluating this and seeing if we can figure this mountain out.

00:44:34.155 --> 00:44:37.759
We've seen a lot of. um. avalanche activity.

00:44:37.826 --> 00:44:41.029
which is good. we want to see the face shedded.

00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:45.567
It's wild. though. It's a long process. you got to enjoy it.

00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:52.106
You got to be really patient and be totally willing to walk away if it's not right.

00:45:47.362 --> 00:45:52.734
Waiting over two weeks to see what's on the other side of this thing.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.837
Oh. Gorgeous.

00:45:56.871 --> 00:45:58.673
What's it like up there?

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:05.813
It's deep and forty-five degrees on either side.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.751
I think it will be really fun walking.

00:46:09.817 --> 00:46:11.219
-Sick. -Yeah.

00:46:18.426 --> 00:46:20.328
Out of this world.

00:46:20.395 --> 00:46:23.097
Out of this world.

00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:27.402
Oh. my God.

00:46:27.468 --> 00:46:29.938
Nice work Ryland.

00:46:30.004 --> 00:46:35.209
I would at least like to make it to the top of this ridge

00:46:35.276 --> 00:46:38.379
and see what happens.

00:46:40.448 --> 00:46:44.285
These bootpack spines are too good to pass up.

00:46:44.352 --> 00:46:49.057
I mean. my God. look at this. 3000ft of vert.

00:46:49.123 --> 00:46:52.727
3. 2. 1.

00:47:16.451 --> 00:47:18.052
Woooo!

00:47:18.119 --> 00:47:22.924
Your going to like those spines Jones. they're just playful.

00:47:22.991 --> 00:47:26.327
I'm going to switch over and start heading up.

00:47:26.394 --> 00:47:27.595
Copy

00:47:27.662 --> 00:47:29.597
I'm gonna keep getting up the ridge.

00:47:29.664 --> 00:47:32.633
Enjoy that second lap.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.269
We got some decissions to make.

00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:40.708
Do we go up that cornice or do we hike up this old slide.

00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:43.077
Hard call.

00:47:44.178 --> 00:47:45.980
God that is firm.

00:47:46.047 --> 00:47:49.517
Dude. should we do the traverse?

00:47:49.584 --> 00:47:51.419
Get out of this ice?

00:47:51.486 --> 00:47:52.687
-Not a bad Idea -Yeah

00:47:52.754 --> 00:47:55.223
I think we get out of the ice.

00:47:57.125 --> 00:47:59.093
Okay.

00:48:01.729 --> 00:48:05.800
Alright... Traversing.

00:48:16.678 --> 00:48:19.781
Oh... Fuck.

00:48:24.552 --> 00:48:26.754
Not good.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.853
Oh man.

00:49:11.432 --> 00:49:16.037
That's got major problems we can't figure out today.

00:49:16.104 --> 00:49:21.542
Can I boot back up and ride a line on this main face.

00:49:24.078 --> 00:49:27.648
He really brushed it off a lot better than I would have thought.

00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:33.354
Pretty cool. I don't think a lot of people would bounce back from something like that.

00:49:33.421 --> 00:49:37.625
I reached my high point but I was not able to top out.

00:49:37.692 --> 00:49:41.195
but I'll get down and just. kind of. reevaluate.

00:49:41.262 --> 00:49:46.367
But I. in the meantime. I got a super tasty line. this way.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.054
Whoa.

00:51:10.918 --> 00:51:14.455
-What a day. dude! What a day. -Right?

00:51:14.522 --> 00:51:16.857
Hell of a backyard you have here.

00:51:16.924 --> 00:51:19.627
Yeah we found a rowdy zone.

00:51:19.694 --> 00:51:21.262
I had this way up.

00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:24.999
For a month. this is how we're going to climb the mountain.

00:51:25.066 --> 00:51:28.936
Did that. got denied about 100ft from the summit.

00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:32.673
Now we're hiking the line I want to ride.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.842
We got major white ice.

00:51:34.909 --> 00:51:36.277
Huge maybe?

00:51:36.344 --> 00:51:40.081
If I was a betting man. I"d put the odds on 50/50.

00:51:57.999 --> 00:52:04.038
You go out there with him and you're like. where's he going to take his riding next.

00:52:04.105 --> 00:52:10.244
I guess. riding 6 spines over death exposure.

00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:14.148
I was willing to get that exposed.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:39.173
It is steeper than I thought. for sure.

00:52:46.647 --> 00:52:51.719
This ridge is... oh. yeah.

00:52:56.857 --> 00:53:00.361
Into the chest. deep.

00:53:25.586 --> 00:53:27.054
All right!

00:54:13.901 --> 00:54:17.505
This is where the ice is.

00:54:26.447 --> 00:54:29.583
Oh. not bad. not bad!

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.685
Sweet!

00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:51.639
Whoa!

00:54:52.606 --> 00:54:54.809
Whoaaaa!

00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:59.146
-Yeah! -Yeah dude!

00:54:59.213 --> 00:55:03.184
Line of my life man!

00:55:11.792 --> 00:55:16.897
I can't believe. I cannot believe it man.

00:55:19.333 --> 00:55:21.268
Teary eyed.

00:55:24.405 --> 00:55:28.843
You think of everything that goes into it.

00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:33.180
Awe. It's just. oh.

00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:40.921
You know. I thought about Joe a lot on that trip.

00:55:40.988 --> 00:55:44.592
and some of the other guys who passed away in the avalanche.

00:55:44.658 --> 00:55:50.097
and it was my little piece to honor my fallen friends.

00:55:50.164 --> 00:55:54.068
I respect life. but I really feel like you got to live it.

00:55:54.134 --> 00:55:58.205
I mean nothing feels more alive than. than at that time.

00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:04.378
and just think of how siked they'd be to see us sending like that.

00:56:12.486 --> 00:56:15.289
You know. you look at my journals and stuff;

00:56:15.356 --> 00:56:18.926
I can talk about the way up over and over again

00:56:18.993 --> 00:56:23.697
and write these long pages of the way up.

00:56:23.764 --> 00:56:28.035
And the way down. is um. there's no words for the way down.

00:56:28.102 --> 00:56:33.240
It's uh. it just kind of. every journal entry ends once I strap in.

00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:40.447
That's where I really at times. go to this place. that's hard to get to.

00:56:40.514 --> 00:56:44.585
And it's just. you're mind and physical body are.

00:56:44.652 --> 00:56:50.958
just at the top. top. top. peak form in communicating together.

00:56:51.025 --> 00:56:54.862
It literally feels like your. your snowboard comes to life

00:56:54.929 --> 00:56:59.800
and it takes you for a ride and takes you to a place that.

00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:07.408
you don't have control of. but are in total control.

00:57:07.474 --> 00:57:11.011
That's what we call the white moment.

00:57:18.152 --> 00:57:22.022
Jeremy was in four. five films a year for awhile.

00:57:22.089 --> 00:57:24.458
but it was always about adventure.

00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:29.330
and it was always about looking over the next ridge and finding the next thing.

00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:33.534
As Alaska and the heli world blew up. up there.

00:57:33.601 --> 00:57:35.703
it got smaller and smaller

00:57:35.769 --> 00:57:39.506
and I think he just started to loose that energy and excitement.

00:57:39.573 --> 00:57:44.812
And he could go in and bang out multiple movie segments in a two-month chunk.

00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:47.314
Sponsors were happy. people were happy.

00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:51.085
His career was at its' pinnacle. basically. He was peaking.

00:57:51.151 --> 00:57:56.390
I knew of all this awesome terrain that was outside the snowmobile boundaries.

00:57:56.457 --> 00:57:58.292
it was outside the heli boundaries.

00:57:58.359 --> 00:58:01.895
He came to us and was like. I'm sick of the boundaries.

00:58:01.962 --> 00:58:04.164
this isn't doing it for me anymore.

00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:08.769
I want to start. going over those borders and camping and hiking these lines

00:58:08.836 --> 00:58:11.805
and getting into stuff that hasn't been done.

00:58:11.872 --> 00:58:14.241
Jeremy walking away and doing his own production.

00:58:14.308 --> 00:58:16.777
I questioned that.

00:58:16.844 --> 00:58:20.447
'You know. during that year you're still going to film with Absinthe or Standard?'

00:58:20.514 --> 00:58:22.816
And he was like.

00:58:22.883 --> 00:58:28.522
'No. For me to do the next phase. I have to do my own thing and separate it.'

00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:30.758
At the time. it definitely was a risky move.

00:58:30.824 --> 00:58:35.295
He could have done that one movie and had his whole snowboard career be gone.

00:58:35.362 --> 00:58:39.400
Jeremy said. 'The heli is limiting my access to the mountains.'

00:58:39.466 --> 00:58:41.935
That is the redefining moment

00:58:42.002 --> 00:58:45.072
that you can find in other athletes in other sports.

00:58:45.139 --> 00:58:48.042
When people refine who they are and what they do.

00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:50.911
that's when you take notice again and again.

00:58:50.978 --> 00:58:55.282
All of a sudden. I had ninety-five percent more terrain to choose from.

00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:58.786
It's not an anti-heli deal. it's not an anti-snowmobile deal.

00:58:58.852 --> 00:59:00.854
and it's not an anti-resort deal.

00:59:00.921 --> 00:59:05.392
It's about going past the existing boundaries. finding new terrain

00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:08.495
and riding those epic. dream lines.

00:59:08.562 --> 00:59:12.700
Some of the places. that he wants to access. the way that he does it.

00:59:12.766 --> 00:59:15.202
that's the utmost dedication right there.

00:59:15.269 --> 00:59:16.837
It's so beyond snowboarding.

00:59:16.904 --> 00:59:20.140
Coming from someone who came from Cape Cod. with no hills.

00:59:20.207 --> 00:59:25.379
to hiking some of the biggest hills on the planet. and snowboarding down them.

00:59:25.446 --> 00:59:31.018
It's the ultimate. like. pursuing a dream and getting there.

00:59:40.728 --> 00:59:43.397
I don't think it's possible to eliminate the worry.

00:59:43.464 --> 00:59:46.700
You know. you're still dealing with Mother Nature out there

00:59:46.767 --> 00:59:51.004
and you can't predict. a hundred percent. what Mother Nature's going to do.

00:59:51.071 --> 00:59:54.108
I know that. I've spent enough time in the backcountry.

00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:59.847
you're never one hundred percent guaranteed of anything out there.

00:59:59.913 --> 01:00:02.716
You can come right up this shoulder.

01:00:02.783 --> 01:00:06.120
and then this side of it. these are lower angle.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:11.158
We'll get dialed in on this. to a point where hopefully we can move to that.

01:00:11.225 --> 01:00:15.295
I first saw Shrangri-La when I got a text from one of my main cameraman.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.497
Chris Figenshau.

01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:18.699
I was in the Jackson Hole Library

01:00:18.766 --> 01:00:21.101
and paging through a book on Nepal

01:00:21.168 --> 01:00:24.505
and came across a photo that was really striking.

01:00:24.571 --> 01:00:26.140
and really aesthetic mountain.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.843
I talked to climbers. who talked to meteorologist.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.579
trying to just get some snow beta.

01:00:32.646 --> 01:00:37.284
if we were crazy to think about riding something like that in the Himalayas.

01:00:37.351 --> 01:00:42.823
It was for sure the greatest gamble I'd ever taken.

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:46.693
But to me. at this point in my snowboarding.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:53.167
I was willing to accept that there was a good chance I might not be able to ride it.

01:01:18.392 --> 01:01:23.197
Sensory overload. everywhere you look. Oh. my God.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:26.767
The streets are just bustling with people.

01:01:26.834 --> 01:01:30.671
so much humanity packed into one little street.

01:01:30.737 --> 01:01:34.741
Just a real interactive city.

01:01:34.808 --> 01:01:38.545
no one on their phones. no one. like. headphones on

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.982
just really. happy people.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.461
Really. Luca was a no-brainer.

01:01:54.528 --> 01:01:58.799
very comfortable in the mountains. both climbing and riding.

01:01:58.866 --> 01:02:02.069
comfortable with hard snow. has been to altitude.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:06.506
Really. just found the best. true. big mountain snowboarder I could

01:02:06.573 --> 01:02:09.676
and that's Luca Pandolfi.

01:02:09.743 --> 01:02:12.779
I met Jeremy for the first time in Switzerland.

01:02:12.846 --> 01:02:14.948
He is a rider that I respect a lot

01:02:15.015 --> 01:02:18.485
because he influenced my way of riding from the beginning.

01:02:18.552 --> 01:02:20.854
from where I started as a boy.

01:02:20.921 --> 01:02:23.457
About to hit my city max.

01:02:23.523 --> 01:02:26.593
which is about. seventy-two hours.

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:33.066
The plan is to fly to Lukla.

01:02:33.133 --> 01:02:36.570
at which point we will start a two week trek to basecamp.

01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:38.272
and from there.

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:43.744
we'll be a day or two away from the first view of the face.

01:03:06.733 --> 01:03:08.302
On the trail coming in.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:11.371
it winds up and down these really steep mountains

01:03:11.438 --> 01:03:13.707
and it's their main highway

01:03:13.774 --> 01:03:19.813
and the way they access and supply these towns is through these trails.

01:03:43.637 --> 01:03:48.775
We just got our first glimpse of the alpine and it is shocking.

01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:55.048
We definitely got a lot of walking to do. It is a big. big. big world.

01:04:14.167 --> 01:04:20.674
You move up this valley. just getting. just ramping up.

01:04:23.643 --> 01:04:27.881
Come around the corner and it was right in front of us.

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:31.284
. Ama DaBlam. Lhotse. Mount Everest.

01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:34.788
You feel the energy of the mountains.

01:04:34.855 --> 01:04:37.391
it's a peaceful place.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:40.560
It's kind of being too much spiritual or worry?

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:44.097
Can just make your own experience. You can feel it.

01:04:44.164 --> 01:04:48.602
I've been hit. by a bad thing. you know.

01:04:48.668 --> 01:04:51.538
I discover my mom was a terminal.

01:04:51.605 --> 01:04:53.607
she was year. she had bad cancer.

01:04:53.673 --> 01:04:57.044
Then. she was doing well again. so I got motivated.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.479
I went into climbing again.

01:04:59.546 --> 01:05:03.350
But then suddenly. four days before leaving here. she passed away.

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:06.453
That has been a pretty tough moment for me.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.356
I just fell down. I was emotionally destroyed.

01:05:09.423 --> 01:05:14.828
but I knew that Nepal was a good place to refresh my mind

01:05:14.895 --> 01:05:17.030
and to get in touch with nature.

01:05:17.097 --> 01:05:21.001
Nature is the best way to get into the flow again.

01:05:27.474 --> 01:05:29.910
Traffic Jam.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:40.020
We hope to start snowboarding in here on small stuff.

01:05:40.087 --> 01:05:43.423
but we'd like to snowboard this.

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:46.426
Are you direct to come down? Or just...

01:05:46.493 --> 01:05:52.999
We. you know... No. we turn... you know.

01:05:53.066 --> 01:05:56.336
Nima Tasi has been on Everest. 10 times.

01:05:56.403 --> 01:05:58.004
Ama DaBlam 12 times.

01:05:58.071 --> 01:06:00.707
All the big peaks he's been on them multiple times.

01:06:00.774 --> 01:06:05.378
Whenever you see someone his age that's been on this serious of mountains.

01:06:05.445 --> 01:06:08.448
I have the utmost respect for a person like him.

01:06:08.515 --> 01:06:14.221
I wonder if they will be successful or not.

01:06:14.287 --> 01:06:20.494
If they make it to the top. how will they ride down?

01:06:30.437 --> 01:06:33.140
Yes. off and away.

01:06:41.047 --> 01:06:43.583
Definitely giving it ample time.

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:44.885
to get acclimatized.

01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:47.220
We're not trying to march on up.

01:06:47.287 --> 01:06:50.290
spend a little time at 20.000ft and get out of here.

01:06:50.357 --> 01:06:55.162
20.000ft for us needs to feel like our home town.

01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:57.364
I feel like I'm doing good.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.767
then a little hill comes and I'm instantly out of breath.

01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:04.704
It keeps going through my head. how am I going to snowboard?

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.007
When it's this hard to walk.

01:07:08.542 --> 01:07:12.546
Nice. to be home for awhile.

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:18.985
I woke to a clear morning.

01:07:19.052 --> 01:07:20.954
have some breakfast and then head up

01:07:21.021 --> 01:07:24.858
and hopefully get a view of the peak we're hoping to ride.

01:07:24.925 --> 01:07:26.359
Nervous for sure.

01:07:26.426 --> 01:07:28.595
to see if it's at all in the cards?

01:07:28.662 --> 01:07:31.698
If it's a maybe. if it's who knows.

01:07:31.765 --> 01:07:35.302
The first time I saw the picture. I shit in my pants.

01:07:35.368 --> 01:07:40.207
I love that balance between fear and excitement.

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:44.010
I want to see it; I can't wait to see it.

01:07:44.077 --> 01:07:46.313
It was really exciting.

01:07:46.379 --> 01:07:50.784
because here's this face that I'd played over in my head a million times

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.719
and looked at photos.

01:07:52.786 --> 01:07:57.891
and it was pretty surreal to finally be that close to it.

01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:02.429
We're here exactly when we want to be.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:06.766
It's the right aspect; It's the right elevation. but...

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.502
still one big maybe.

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:12.072
We got a lot going for us.

01:08:12.138 --> 01:08:15.575
but it's still a 65 degree spine wall in Nepal.

01:08:15.642 --> 01:08:18.712
Maybe it's not. I hope it's not 65 degrees.

01:08:18.778 --> 01:08:20.947
but it looks like it from here.

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.216
It looks as steep as it gets.

01:08:23.283 --> 01:08:29.322
That's what has me freaked out a little bit. Just massive.

01:08:29.389 --> 01:08:31.291
That one.

01:08:32.592 --> 01:08:36.129
Yeah. You understand?

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:40.333
Mingbo La may be practice. but the main objective?

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.668
Over there.

01:08:41.735 --> 01:08:45.472
We are going to spend a lot of time at high camp.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:49.542
The acclimatization process is to go. get up high.

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:52.679
spend a bunch of time up there. sleep down low.

01:08:52.746 --> 01:08:54.214
And ideally you recover

01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:57.183
and each time you go back up to higher elevations.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.686
you are that much stronger.

01:08:59.753 --> 01:09:02.622
Higher... and feeling it.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:07.627
I feel like I'm three hundred pounds... crawling.

01:09:10.764 --> 01:09:14.567
So we've been here. I think approaching. three weeks

01:09:14.634 --> 01:09:17.304
and I've yet to strap my snowboard on.

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:20.407
but we'll get there. Patience.

01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:28.515
We're hoping to top out on Mingbo La

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.817
and ride our first line of the trip.

01:09:30.884 --> 01:09:34.688
If we can just get up in the 19.000 foot range.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:42.228
it'd set us up for snowboarding 19 to 20.000 feet in a couple of days.

01:09:42.295 --> 01:09:44.764
Hey. you can lower me Luca.

01:09:44.831 --> 01:09:46.666
It's just this little curb.

01:09:46.733 --> 01:09:51.004
going zero vision. Wish me luck.

01:09:58.545 --> 01:10:00.013
Yeah dude.

01:10:01.748 --> 01:10:03.583
Tiring. huh?

01:10:06.753 --> 01:10:08.321
Snow's good.

01:10:08.388 --> 01:10:11.691
-Snow's perfect. I think. for steeps. -I need to see.

01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:13.360
Me too. yeah.

01:10:17.263 --> 01:10:19.299
Coming this way? Or...

01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:22.936
We don't know. the first day we go up here.

01:10:23.003 --> 01:10:26.239
We look at the ridge.

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.975
We don't need any fix signs.

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:31.077
we just climb.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.246
So. before we go up today

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:36.850
we can have good look at glacier one more time.

01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:38.118
with the sun.

01:10:38.184 --> 01:10:41.521
Okay? You like the plan?

01:10:41.588 --> 01:10:43.556
Oh. sure. sure.

01:10:44.424 --> 01:10:47.160
We are going up to high camp.

01:10:47.227 --> 01:10:50.497
I think it's probably our fourth lap up there.

01:10:50.563 --> 01:10:53.533
Kind of our first real high pressure of the trip.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.670
and we're hoping to go up there. stay up there for a while.

01:10:57.737 --> 01:10:59.472
Still so many unknowns.

01:10:59.539 --> 01:11:03.309
but we'll start figuring out exactly what the challenges are.

01:11:03.376 --> 01:11:06.212
and just one step at a time

01:11:06.279 --> 01:11:09.682
and hopefully get a chance to ride this face.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.464
It's about to get real these next couple days.

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:29.102
because now we're focusing on Shangri-La spines.

01:11:29.169 --> 01:11:33.640
This afternoon. hopefully we can punch a line through this glacier.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:36.843
That's the first order of business.

01:11:40.413 --> 01:11:42.582
I really need to think about it.

01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:45.285
because it is not my type of terrain.

01:11:45.351 --> 01:11:47.587
I am more used to. to ski couloirs.

01:11:47.654 --> 01:11:50.690
I'm open to suggestions. you are the Spine Master.

01:11:50.757 --> 01:11:53.026
I would come over that last spine

01:11:53.093 --> 01:11:55.261
and exit right next to the pepper.

01:11:55.328 --> 01:11:58.064
Because that would. that will stay clean.

01:11:58.131 --> 01:12:00.900
That over there? Whoa.

01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:04.270
Tomorrow we are going this way?

01:12:04.337 --> 01:12:06.706
Tomorrow we go up. yes.

01:12:06.773 --> 01:12:07.674
Not Mingbo La?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.275
No more Mingbo La.

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:14.414
Tomorrow. we go up this and ride this side of all the rocks.

01:12:14.481 --> 01:12:17.684
The next day. we go to the summit

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.987
and ride this side of all the rocks.

01:12:21.054 --> 01:12:22.655
No.

01:12:25.692 --> 01:12:29.295
It's been amazing seeing the porters and Sherpas.

01:12:29.362 --> 01:12:31.364
operate in the mountains.

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:33.800
They spend their whole life in the mountains.

01:12:33.867 --> 01:12:36.402
half the year they're on an expedition

01:12:36.469 --> 01:12:39.138
and just seeing how they move through the mountains

01:12:39.205 --> 01:12:44.077
and the speed at which they do it has been mind boggling.

01:12:44.143 --> 01:12:49.082
You know. they weren't really used to seeing people climb.

01:12:49.148 --> 01:12:51.317
not on fixed lines.

01:12:51.384 --> 01:12:55.822
Their whole deal is always fixed lines on anything.

01:12:55.889 --> 01:12:57.590
you know. over 40 degrees.

01:12:57.657 --> 01:12:59.859
so we said. 'thanks.'

01:12:59.926 --> 01:13:03.263
and they sat back and watched us do our thing.

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:26.319
Lining.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.495
Relentless.

01:13:35.562 --> 01:13:39.232
We were gaining six inches at a time.

01:13:39.299 --> 01:13:42.669
clawing our way up and to gain that ridge.

01:13:42.735 --> 01:13:46.873
I think it probably took us two hours of full battle.

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:50.543
to go the final two hundred feet.

01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:07.427
Yeah!

01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:10.463
Finally getting up there

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:13.666
and just revealing the most science-fiction.

01:14:13.733 --> 01:14:16.603
foreign. mountain vista I had ever seen.

01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:19.772
was an incredible feeling.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.675
Nice dude.

01:14:23.977 --> 01:14:25.411
Yeah dude.

01:14:26.079 --> 01:14:26.145
Good job.

01:14:28.314 --> 01:14:32.952
I defintely want to make it a couple hundered yards up the ridge.

01:15:02.982 --> 01:15:04.584
On belay.

01:15:09.455 --> 01:15:12.458
Left or right or center?

01:15:15.294 --> 01:15:16.996
This way.

01:15:17.063 --> 01:15:19.098
Looks good.

01:15:19.165 --> 01:15:20.867
Going off.

01:15:32.845 --> 01:15:35.915
Hey guys. I'm thinking of starting from here.

01:15:35.982 --> 01:15:39.018
does that look kosher to you guys?

01:15:39.085 --> 01:15:42.555
You're gonna wanna fade rider's right.

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.190
If you go rider's left.

01:15:44.257 --> 01:15:45.591
that big spine below you.

01:15:45.658 --> 01:15:48.261
has got a huge cliff right in the middle of it.

01:15:48.327 --> 01:15:50.029
Sounds good. brother.

01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:32.999
All good!

01:17:42.508 --> 01:17:46.279
Pretty much a first experience for me on big spines like that.

01:17:46.345 --> 01:17:48.281
with a lot of sluff management.

01:17:48.347 --> 01:17:51.651
and you imagine the feeling to be at the top of these spines

01:17:51.717 --> 01:17:55.455
and you're not sure what you are doing. it is your first experience.

01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:57.824
and you see Spines Master get sluffed out.

01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:00.126
I was like. 'what the fuck I do now?'

01:18:00.193 --> 01:18:03.229
and then I just like to unplug the brain

01:18:03.296 --> 01:18:04.730
and be in that zone.

01:18:04.797 --> 01:18:08.167
When you just react to what is coming your way.

01:18:41.834 --> 01:18:45.471
It's what was not the imagined line.

01:18:45.538 --> 01:18:49.675
but I'm pretty happy for my. my first experience in this kind of terrain.

01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:53.279
You guys show me another world.

01:18:53.346 --> 01:18:55.815
Tomorrow is another day.

01:18:59.552 --> 01:19:03.489
Definitely. freaked me out getting sluffed off that thing

01:19:03.556 --> 01:19:06.726
and I don't know. I had gotten away with a lot of.

01:19:06.792 --> 01:19:09.862
playing with a lot of sluffs on a lot of steep faces

01:19:09.929 --> 01:19:12.765
and it was kind of like my chips were finally up

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:15.568
and I think it was the first time in 6 or 7 years.

01:19:15.635 --> 01:19:17.970
that I've gotten sluffed off a face.

01:19:23.476 --> 01:19:25.845
How's it going. Jer?

01:19:25.912 --> 01:19:27.046
Oh...

01:19:28.214 --> 01:19:30.483
That's how I feel.

01:19:30.549 --> 01:19:33.686
Basically going as slow...

01:19:33.753 --> 01:19:37.523
as possible without stopping is the pace.

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:40.626
I'd say. First skier.

01:19:42.395 --> 01:19:43.362
Nice!

01:19:43.429 --> 01:19:44.463
Yeah.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.632
Into the sunshine.

01:20:16.329 --> 01:20:18.097
Close to the top!

01:20:18.164 --> 01:20:19.532
Clouds came in.

01:20:19.598 --> 01:20:21.100
got a little window.

01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:23.202
hopefully we get some clearing.

01:20:23.269 --> 01:20:26.405
but we're on the roof of the world man.

01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:46.359
Really... High.

01:20:48.194 --> 01:20:50.229
Yeah... Jones.

01:20:51.297 --> 01:20:54.333
Yeah. edge of the world.

01:21:00.139 --> 01:21:03.075
So some where about 20.000ft.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:11.283
But there's one problem.

01:21:15.988 --> 01:21:18.424
Clouds just snuffed us out.

01:21:18.491 --> 01:21:21.761
But I have hope.

01:21:21.827 --> 01:21:23.763
So we'll see.

01:21:30.236 --> 01:21:33.039
We still got 3 more hours of daylight

01:21:33.105 --> 01:21:35.875
and I've crafted a little bed here.

01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:37.843
I'm in it for the long hull.

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:40.079
I'll take a nap. what have you.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:43.149
I feel pretty good as long as I don't move up here.

01:21:43.215 --> 01:21:45.651
Wake me up when it's sunny!

01:21:45.718 --> 01:21:47.920
Top of the line. waiting.

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:51.657
It is already one house and a half I am here.

01:21:51.724 --> 01:21:54.493
I'm freezing.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.330
The whole time I've been sitting here for three and a half hours.

01:21:58.397 --> 01:22:00.833
I thought for sure we would get a window.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.171
I was staring down my line in the sun.

01:22:05.237 --> 01:22:07.540
I was off by about ten minutes.

01:22:07.606 --> 01:22:11.210
It's going to be serious getting off this thing on foot.

01:22:11.277 --> 01:22:15.548
I will be crawling to camp tonight. in the dark.

01:22:15.614 --> 01:22:18.484
Down climbing.

01:22:18.551 --> 01:22:20.786
Freezing!

01:22:37.503 --> 01:22:38.971
Fuck!

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:44.143
It's getting dark. we got to move.

01:23:00.459 --> 01:23:04.163
I was at the top of my line. it was in the shadows.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:08.000
so I was in the half in the fucking cold.

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:12.238
Up above. you know. 20.000 feet for probably.

01:23:12.304 --> 01:23:15.941
um. I don't know. close to five hours today.

01:23:16.008 --> 01:23:19.345
And I'm definitely cooked.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:22.882
It was heartbreaking to walk off that peak.

01:23:22.948 --> 01:23:25.084
I had worked so hard to get there.

01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:28.020
the snow was killer. the terrain looked awesome.

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.022
I felt really comfortable.

01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:35.327
But I realized on my way down. how tired I was.

01:23:35.394 --> 01:23:38.931
I couldn't make more than two turns without having to stop.

01:23:38.998 --> 01:23:41.934
So. it was probably a good thing that.

01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:44.970
I didn't get to ride the face that day.

01:23:47.873 --> 01:23:51.010
You know what it takes to get up there.

01:23:52.144 --> 01:23:54.580
My throat is on fire.

01:23:54.647 --> 01:23:57.983
If you're not a 100%. you obviously can't.

01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:00.553
You need to be a hundred percent.

01:24:02.054 --> 01:24:04.256
Sorry to hear that. dude.

01:24:04.323 --> 01:24:05.157
Yeah.

01:24:05.224 --> 01:24:08.093
It's just... the fucking shit.

01:24:09.662 --> 01:24:11.230
I wish you good luck.

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:12.565
Thank you.

01:24:14.033 --> 01:24:17.136
I totally respected his decision

01:24:17.203 --> 01:24:20.906
and you've got to listen to you're gut on these serious lines

01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:26.178
and I think his gut was telling him not to go up that day.

01:24:26.245 --> 01:24:30.015
It's been pretty much a successful trip for me.

01:24:30.082 --> 01:24:32.284
I learn a lot. have a lot of fun.

01:24:32.351 --> 01:24:36.388
But... there's a moment where you need to pull the plug.

01:24:48.634 --> 01:24:52.438
If I passed away and could say one thing to my wife.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.006
I'd say 'I'm sorry'

01:24:55.908 --> 01:24:57.676
It's just.

01:24:58.711 --> 01:25:00.679
the kids change everything.

01:25:00.746 --> 01:25:05.884
my world made a lot more sense before I had kids.

01:25:05.951 --> 01:25:11.490
Leaving kids behind without a father would be devestating.

01:25:11.557 --> 01:25:15.327
I think it would erase all of my successes.

01:25:15.394 --> 01:25:18.764
in the mountains or what have you.

01:25:18.831 --> 01:25:21.533
It would be irrelevant.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:41.814
It's taken so much energy just to get to this fourth run.

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.384
it's just amazing how hard it's been.

01:26:47.353 --> 01:26:49.855
We're gonna build an anchor.

01:26:49.922 --> 01:26:54.827
I'm going to go over this top roll on a belay

01:26:54.893 --> 01:26:58.330
and then. go from there.

01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:05.537
1...2...3!

01:27:08.073 --> 01:27:10.576
Okay. that feels good.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.368
How much more rope?

01:27:36.435 --> 01:27:38.937
Yeah that's probably your last turn.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.806
Okay!

01:27:43.575 --> 01:27:44.843
Off!

01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:48.580
Alright. Jeremy! Be careful!

01:28:16.141 --> 01:28:18.277
It's pretty much an exposed line.

01:28:18.343 --> 01:28:20.512
there's bergschrund at the bottom.

01:28:20.579 --> 01:28:23.949
but then there's a short glacier and then there are seracs.

01:28:24.016 --> 01:28:25.317
So. conservative.

01:28:25.384 --> 01:28:29.188
and say. 'it's more like surviving.'

01:28:32.191 --> 01:28:34.059
You guys got a copy?

01:28:34.126 --> 01:28:36.295
-Yeah. barbi copy. -Go ahead Jer.

01:28:36.361 --> 01:28:38.330
It firmed up.

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:44.803
and obviously can't really hold an edge on this.

01:28:56.381 --> 01:29:00.786
For sure. don't seek out these hard packs.

01:29:00.853 --> 01:29:04.156
steep lines that I have to pick my way down.

01:29:04.223 --> 01:29:07.392
But I knew I could get down the line safely.

01:29:07.459 --> 01:29:10.028
and I just really slowed everything down

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.097
and focused on inch-by-inch

01:29:12.164 --> 01:29:13.799
and picked my way down.

01:29:13.866 --> 01:29:17.369
Made sure I wasn't coming off that face.

01:29:26.979 --> 01:29:28.714
Oh

01:29:30.148 --> 01:29:33.252
That was the hardest run of my life.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.423
Forty-five minutes.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:55.507
This trip to the Himalayas wasn't a stepping stone.

01:29:55.574 --> 01:29:57.509
to like. 'I want more.'

01:29:57.576 --> 01:30:00.679
The entry fee into the Himalayas is hard.

01:30:00.746 --> 01:30:05.551
If I had seen what I saw on this trip fifteen years ago.

01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:09.621
yeah. I could have set my life up around that.

01:30:09.688 --> 01:30:13.191
I do think there is a ton left to be done there.

01:30:13.258 --> 01:30:15.027
I won't be the one doing it.

01:30:15.093 --> 01:30:19.264
but hopefully the future generations take it from here.

01:30:21.066 --> 01:30:24.603
With these films I hope.

01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:28.206
I really hope I inspire people to get out there.

01:30:28.273 --> 01:30:29.808
to challenge themselves.

01:30:29.875 --> 01:30:33.979
not in the challenge. go hit the biggest cliff of your life.

01:30:34.046 --> 01:30:39.618
I mean challenge. in like. go on that great adventure.

01:30:39.685 --> 01:30:42.387
Just really follow your passion.

01:30:42.454 --> 01:30:45.424
That's a scary thing and a challenging thing.

01:30:45.490 --> 01:30:49.828
That means making some tough choices along the way.

01:30:49.895 --> 01:30:50.729
K

01:30:52.130 --> 01:30:55.000
That's just such an exciting part of life.

01:30:55.067 --> 01:31:00.739
I know this a far out there dream. but I'm all in on it.

01:31:00.806 --> 01:31:04.343
It's the only way I know how to live my life.

01:31:50.322 --> 01:31:53.759
Snowboarding is just a part of Jeremy.

01:31:53.825 --> 01:31:56.261
I would never want to change that.

01:31:56.328 --> 01:32:00.799
I would never want him to do anything but what he's pasisonate about.

01:32:00.866 --> 01:32:04.903
When he's 80 years old. he's going to be out in the mountains.

01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:06.004
As much as possible.

01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:08.040
It's his heart and soul.

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:11.810
and that's what we love about him so much.

01:34:29.881 --> 01:34:32.384
What's your cooking resume?

01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:34.186
My cooking resume.

01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:38.557
Um. there we're a lot of questions involved.

01:34:38.623 --> 01:34:42.527
Well. I'll tell you how you get to be a cook on a trip like this.

01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:45.897
You actually need a super stacked resume.

01:34:45.964 --> 01:34:48.733
that has nothing to do with food.

01:35:19.097 --> 01:35:21.032
Have a good run man.

01:35:22.033 --> 01:35:23.134
Woo!

01:35:29.274 --> 01:35:31.810
That was probably pretty good.

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:18.356
Ama Dablam. Cho-oyu. Nuptse. Everest. Lhotse.

01:36:18.423 --> 01:36:23.228
a lot of the worlds highest mountains right here.

01:40:01.012 --> 01:40:03.748
To go up and narrow the safety margin.

01:40:03.815 --> 01:40:05.617
I don't care how you do it!

01:40:05.683 --> 01:40:09.754
Man. I think that's great adventure and I think that's super.

01:40:09.821 --> 01:40:13.825
and Im glad to see anybody doing anything that way.

01:40:13.892 --> 01:40:16.928
But you have to move off the stage

01:40:16.995 --> 01:40:20.198
and let somebody else do the performing.
