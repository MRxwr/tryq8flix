ALL CHARACTERS. LOCATIONS.
ORGANIZATIONS. RELIGIONS.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.877
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:22.487
WE MADE SURE THE CHILD ACTORS
WHO APPEAR IN THIS EPISODE...

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.257
WERE SAFE AND WELL TAKEN
CARE OF THROUGHOUT THE SHOOT.

00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:29.757
He would've used all of his
energy even if it killed him.

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:32.568
So he probably doesn't
remember who he is by now.

00:00:33.227 --> 00:00:34.738
Zi O. you punk.

00:00:34.797 --> 00:00:36.037
He's back.

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:37.837
We're doing our best to bring him in.

00:00:37.907 --> 00:00:39.467
Run away.

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:40.907
Don't do it!

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.738
This may be a great opportunity.

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.507
You know this is your last chance. don't you?

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:47.348
Whichever of the two is
alive is the murder suspect.

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:51.147
PREVIOUSLY ON "L.U.C.A.: THE BEGINNING"

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:54.958
We've met. haven't we?

00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:57.058
I remember exactly who you are.

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:58.488
So you'd better remember...

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.727
what happened to my parents.

00:01:00.787 --> 00:01:02.098
But he won't die. right?

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:03.998
He can still die if he's
in critical condition.

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:06.897
If he died. bring me his body.
In the freshest state possible.

00:01:09.697 --> 00:01:11.108
He ran away.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:13.108
He was dying. but he got up...

00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:17.378
The weak cells probably died. and
only the strong cells survived.

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:20.078
I've been waiting for
you. What did I do to you?

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.378
I'm the one with questions.

00:01:57.178 --> 00:01:58.518
We'll be back. Gu Reum.

00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:00.018
Stay home alone for just a little while.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:01.488
Where are you going?

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.727
We won't take long. It'll
take less than an hour.

00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:07.587
Let's go eat tonkatsu for lunch.

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:11.198
Mom.

00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:17.837
My baby. let's go eat something
more delicious than tonkatsu.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:19.668
Like what?

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:21.877
Whatever you want. Your
dad will buy it for you.

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:31.988
We'll see you later.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:28.208
EPISODE 3

00:03:33.608 --> 00:03:34.678
Search carefully.

00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:03.508
Darn it.

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:08.747
Guys.

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:11.687
Gu Reum is in trouble.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:14.888
She either got kidnapped or went missing.

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.717
Restrict all the entrances of
the adjoining subway stations...

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:18.187
so that no one can get out.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.557
- Yes. sir.
- Yes. sir.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.298
POLICE

00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:36.478
POLICE

00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:41.267
- My goodness!
- Oh. my gosh!

00:05:46.648 --> 00:05:48.548
RELIEF GOODS STORAGE

00:05:53.348 --> 00:05:55.057
Move!

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.317
- Move!
- Grab one!

00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:02.798
- My gosh!
- Hurry!

00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:15.437
- Let's go!
- Move!

00:06:16.307 --> 00:06:18.247
Hurry up!

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:22.778
Is this really possible?

00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:25.887
No. it's impossible.

00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:27.488
This is totally insane.

00:06:27.548 --> 00:06:28.988
This is a mixture of everything.

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.557
He has the DNA of humans. immortal jellyfish.

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:33.858
electric eels. and even flies.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:36.197
Do you think this is genome editing?

00:06:36.557 --> 00:06:38.997
It's impossible to edit all
these genes together at once.

00:06:39.997 --> 00:06:42.398
Unless they put all these
animals into a blender...

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.997
and combined them all together.

00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:46.367
That means they manipulated the germ cells.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:49.908
Regardless of whether this is
possible or not. it's illegal.

00:06:51.877 --> 00:06:54.918
What kind of lunatic would
do that kind of experiment?

00:06:54.978 --> 00:06:57.817
No one I know of. Except for one person.

00:06:58.848 --> 00:06:59.887
Who?

00:07:00.418 --> 00:07:01.788
Professor Ryu Jeung Kwon.

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:03.788
"Ryu Jeung Kwon"?

00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:06.858
You mean the guy who lost his one arm?

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:10.158
- You know him?
- Of course.

00:07:10.858 --> 00:07:12.228
He got kicked out of school and arrested...

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.627
because of the genetic
modification experiment he did.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.367
Gosh. he's known to be a
real psycho in this field.

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.707
He's a complete lunatic.

00:07:20.108 --> 00:07:21.408
We went to college together.

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:23.978
He used to be my best friend.

00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:25.747
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

00:07:26.648 --> 00:07:29.178
Oh. I see. I'm sorry.

00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:30.877
You don't need to apologize.

00:07:32.117 --> 00:07:33.947
I was the one who told
people that he was crazy...

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:36.418
and suggested that he should
get kicked out of school.

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:32.678
"WHEN WILL THE SKIES COLLECT
THOSE WHO ARE BROKEN INSIDE?"

00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:48.798
Come on! Hurry!

00:08:55.837 --> 00:08:57.737
Let's get out of here!

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:01.778
Aren't you hungry?

00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:06.607
What? We're all doing this to make a living.

00:09:07.107 --> 00:09:08.378
Cut it out. This is serious.

00:09:08.717 --> 00:09:10.477
What's more serious than having
to eat when you're hungry?

00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:11.587
Hey.

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:13.587
Let's go.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.768
Everyone makes at least
one big mistake in life.

00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:30.668
For instance. they commit murder.
steal. do drugs. or get married.

00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:34.437
But you've already made a big mistake.

00:09:35.077 --> 00:09:36.837
You were bound to rot in
jail. but I got you out.

00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:38.748
Then you should've made sure
not to make another mistake.

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.178
I apologize.

00:09:40.248 --> 00:09:42.577
An apology isn't going to cut it.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:43.648
I can find him.

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.587
Where? How?

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.947
And don't say you're going to
wait until he shows up again.

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.118
He disappeared with...

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:52.587
the female cop that
followed us at the hospital.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.628
The cops are probably looking for her.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:09:56.528
If we're able to keep track of
their investigation records.

00:09:57.128 --> 00:09:58.727
we'll be able to find them before they do.

00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:02.937
What if he just left that
cop and ran away by himself?

00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:06.067
If he left her there. she
would've gotten hit by the subway.

00:10:07.038 --> 00:10:08.577
But he came and saved her.

00:10:10.038 --> 00:10:11.807
He would've run.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.107
I've never seen him save someone before.

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:17.847
I'll get you the investigation
records. so find him.

00:10:20.618 --> 00:10:23.557
If you do this right. I'll let you retire.

00:10:24.987 --> 00:10:26.687
You can't live here forever.

00:10:26.957 --> 00:10:29.557
You should live in a house
that has windows and a garden.

00:10:30.557 --> 00:10:32.498
You can also get yourself a dog.

00:10:33.628 --> 00:10:35.067
But don't get married.

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:37.398
It only causes trouble.

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:42.837
I need to get shots every two weeks anyway.

00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:45.977
I can't leave this place even if I want to.

00:10:47.077 --> 00:10:48.477
I'm sure we can find a way.

00:10:50.018 --> 00:10:53.087
If you find Zi O. I'll
give you one of his arms.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:56.487
You know we can transplant
his body onto yours.

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.687
Will you really do that for me?

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.057
What would be so difficult
about giving you an arm?

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:07.967
Solving a single problem could lead
everything else to fall into place.

00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:11.067
Once we take care of this.
everything else will be minuscule.

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:13.967
You'd better catch him this time.

00:11:14.937 --> 00:11:16.237
If you fail to catch him again.

00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.878
it'll make me start
questioning your competence.

00:11:35.727 --> 00:11:37.898
EXERCISING LIEN ON PROPERTY

00:12:10.498 --> 00:12:12.567
"WHEN WILL THE SKIES COLLECT
THOSE WHO ARE BROKEN INSIDE?"

00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:29.278
I tried to stop your bleeding.
but I'm not sure if it's healed.

00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:34.487
You hurt your head. Take it easy.

00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:36.758
That's the last thing I'll do with you.

00:12:48.227 --> 00:12:49.768
HANDLE WITH CARE

00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:51.567
That's enough.

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:55.307
Just tell me what you know about me.

00:12:56.837 --> 00:12:57.837
You said you know me.

00:12:59.148 --> 00:13:00.947
If you want to know. you tell me first.

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.178
Tell me what you remember.

00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:11.658
Someone collapsed.

00:13:11.987 --> 00:13:13.827
I remember saving her.

00:13:21.097 --> 00:13:23.638
I think it was you. but I'm not sure.

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:28.067
Thank you for saving my life.

00:13:28.067 --> 00:13:29.077
There. You happy?

00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:30.908
What else do you remember?

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:32.378
I don't remember anything else.

00:13:32.447 --> 00:13:34.178
I woke up at the hospital
and ran until I got here.

00:13:34.178 --> 00:13:35.217
That's all I remember.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.178
Who were those guys who chased
after you at the subway station?

00:13:37.878 --> 00:13:38.888
- I don't know.
- Do you remember...

00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:39.888
falling from the rooftop?

00:13:41.018 --> 00:13:42.288
What about Mr. Kim's death?

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:43.788
Who's Mr. Kim?

00:13:47.457 --> 00:13:48.628
Did you hurt your head?

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:53.298
Tell me what you know.

00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:54.827
Move.

00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:23.727
Don't you feel safe enough to tell me now?

00:14:51.717 --> 00:14:54.788
JUAN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:14:55.057 --> 00:14:56.498
I wonder who he was...

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:58.197
considering they came all the
way to the hospital to kill him.

00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:01.768
They probably wanted to get rid of
the witness of a murder incident.

00:15:04.668 --> 00:15:05.707
But he broke his back.

00:15:05.768 --> 00:15:07.668
How did he suddenly get up and run away?

00:15:08.437 --> 00:15:09.807
Maybe it was someone else's X-ray.

00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:11.337
Maybe he was fine to begin with.

00:15:11.408 --> 00:15:13.977
Sir. aren't you suspicious as well?

00:15:14.408 --> 00:15:17.577
I'm more shocked that people
kill their own parents for money.

00:15:17.878 --> 00:15:20.087
And how could they be cruel enough
to kidnap and bury those kids?

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:21.087
That's what I don't get.

00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:23.888
My gosh. why are you
suddenly acting so humane?

00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:26.327
Listen. you punk.

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:29.498
The moment you think it's
okay to kill parents and kids.

00:15:30.197 --> 00:15:31.827
you lose your right to be human.

00:15:32.967 --> 00:15:34.398
I know that.

00:15:34.798 --> 00:15:37.197
But it's weird that you're
being like this all of a sudden.

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:39.138
Are you planning to run for an election?

00:15:39.807 --> 00:15:41.268
I might see you eating
tteokbokki and sundae...

00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:42.707
at a market place tomorrow.

00:15:43.307 --> 00:15:44.378
You know what I mean. right?

00:15:44.437 --> 00:15:45.807
You'll start talking about
your hardships. you know.

00:15:52.717 --> 00:15:54.148
What's taking him so long?

00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:55.587
Gosh. you scared me.

00:15:56.418 --> 00:15:57.987
Hey. you got it? You found something. right?

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.357
- Yes. I did.
- See? What did I tell you?

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:01.827
Shortly after the fire incident was reported.

00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:04.057
a vehicle in the vicinity
was reported stolen.

00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:07.168
"22G 7801". A silver sedan.

00:16:07.697 --> 00:16:08.937
I've put out an APB.

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:10.798
Okay. thanks.

00:16:11.967 --> 00:16:15.067
See? It's not like he could've
carried Gu Reum on his back.

00:16:15.138 --> 00:16:18.008
He stole a vehicle and managed to escape.

00:16:19.107 --> 00:16:22.748
Only seasoned veterans like
me can figure out this much.

00:16:23.077 --> 00:16:25.618
Well done. Great job.

00:16:25.847 --> 00:16:28.618
Now. comb through the CCTV
footage and locate that vehicle.

00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:31.587
Wait. you want me to do that?

00:16:32.557 --> 00:16:33.557
Captain.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.298
Goodness. Can't he get the juniors to do it?

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:40.298
The police are trying to
locate the stolen vehicle now.

00:16:40.368 --> 00:16:41.868
Wait in the car.

00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:46.837
How can you...

00:16:49.178 --> 00:16:50.937
not remember anything?

00:16:51.807 --> 00:16:53.847
I do remember some things. but
I don't know what they are.

00:16:53.908 --> 00:16:55.548
I don't even know if they're my memories.

00:16:55.618 --> 00:16:56.678
Then...

00:16:58.577 --> 00:16:59.847
how do you remember me?

00:17:02.118 --> 00:17:04.357
I was curious about that
too. That's why I saved you.

00:17:09.358 --> 00:17:11.128
Have we met before?

00:17:12.428 --> 00:17:14.767
If there's no one else like you.

00:17:16.467 --> 00:17:18.338
then I'm sure it was you.

00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:29.977
Hey. turn up the siren...

00:17:30.047 --> 00:17:31.878
if you want to tell the whole
world where we're headed.

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.908
When I was 10.

00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:56.838
you came to my house.

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.608
Are you sure it was me?

00:18:01.777 --> 00:18:04.777
Some kind of blue light
beamed out of your eyes.

00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:08.217
What's wrong?

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:09.858
Don't do that.

00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:12.257
Don't! You're scaring me!

00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:16.858
Dad! Dad!

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:21.767
And it attacked me.

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.408
Why did I go to your house?

00:18:34.308 --> 00:18:35.777
That's the question I want to ask.

00:18:36.547 --> 00:18:39.418
Why you came to my house and
where you went after that.

00:18:40.388 --> 00:18:42.158
How could you make me suffer like this...

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:45.558
my whole life when you only stayed for a day?

00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:01.108
That was the last time I saw you.

00:19:04.037 --> 00:19:05.078
And after that.

00:19:07.207 --> 00:19:08.977
my parents disappeared.

00:19:13.388 --> 00:19:14.717
I have no recollection of that.

00:19:17.588 --> 00:19:19.987
Not remembering anything
doesn't make your past go away.

00:19:20.227 --> 00:19:22.058
Do you think I killed them?

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:25.328
You're certainly capable of doing that.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:26.997
That night.

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:30.898
I saw an evil monster.

00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:36.678
You see. I'm scared of people.

00:19:37.937 --> 00:19:40.947
Whenever someone walks up to me.
it makes my hair stand on end.

00:19:42.007 --> 00:19:44.818
If I were an evil monster. why
would I be terrified of people?

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:50.358
Whether you're evil or not
is not up to you to decide.

00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:54.527
Hey. let's hurry up.

00:19:54.588 --> 00:19:55.898
Yes. sir.

00:20:03.497 --> 00:20:05.737
I'm going to dig through
your brain if I have to.

00:20:06.737 --> 00:20:08.737
I will do whatever it takes to
find out what really happened.

00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:29.582
Someone's here.

00:20:31.122 --> 00:20:32.491
Run. It's him.

00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:53.564
Hey. who are you?

00:20:54.593 --> 00:20:56.804
A hitman? A private detective?

00:21:19.823 --> 00:21:20.823
Where is he?

00:21:21.754 --> 00:21:24.064
Even if you guys catch him. he'll
end up in my hands eventually.

00:21:24.294 --> 00:21:26.064
You cops had better stay out of this.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.764
You little... Who do you think you are?

00:21:46.314 --> 00:21:48.683
- Be careful who you shoot.
- Yes. sir.

00:21:48.754 --> 00:21:50.254
- You three. go that way.
- Yes. sir.

00:21:50.323 --> 00:21:51.484
We'll go to the second floor.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:52.923
Go!

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:13.734
You'd better stay away from him. He's mine!

00:23:26.784 --> 00:23:27.853
Over here!

00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:35.024
Gu Reum!

00:23:38.794 --> 00:23:39.863
Gu Reum!

00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:42.564
You scumbag!

00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:44.464
Get him!

00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:51.603
Hey! You piece of...

00:23:52.143 --> 00:23:53.544
Go! Get him!

00:23:54.073 --> 00:23:55.683
- Hey. go!
- Go!

00:23:57.413 --> 00:24:00.054
Hey. are you all right?

00:24:01.183 --> 00:24:02.353
You're okay. right?

00:24:02.423 --> 00:24:03.754
Stay right here.

00:24:25.044 --> 00:24:27.774
7pm. here.

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:49.564
He's fast.

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:50.903
- He's not there?
- No.

00:24:53.603 --> 00:24:54.933
Keep looking.

00:24:55.304 --> 00:24:56.343
Yes. sir.

00:24:57.304 --> 00:24:59.073
You go that way.

00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:01.373
Hey.

00:25:02.814 --> 00:25:04.014
Are you really okay?

00:25:04.714 --> 00:25:05.714
Yes.

00:25:06.413 --> 00:25:08.314
How did you find me?

00:25:12.623 --> 00:25:13.724
Were you abducted?

00:25:14.254 --> 00:25:16.024
I passed out while fighting
on the subway track.

00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:17.623
and this was where I was when I woke up.

00:25:17.694 --> 00:25:18.794
Let's see your arm.

00:25:20.133 --> 00:25:21.893
- What?
- Show me your arm.

00:25:29.304 --> 00:25:31.544
- There's no restraint mark.
- No.

00:25:31.603 --> 00:25:33.113
How many abducting and kidnapping cases...

00:25:33.173 --> 00:25:35.073
do you think I've worked on over the years?

00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:36.244
Is this a quiz?

00:25:36.314 --> 00:25:39.583
Be it abduction or kidnapping. the
victim always says. "Thank you."

00:25:40.653 --> 00:25:42.113
But do you know what the perp says?

00:25:43.724 --> 00:25:46.254
- What?
- "How did you find us?"

00:25:47.923 --> 00:25:49.024
And that's what you said.

00:25:52.294 --> 00:25:53.433
Why won't you answer me?

00:25:53.494 --> 00:25:55.133
You majored in talking back.

00:25:56.034 --> 00:25:58.064
- Do you suspect me?
- Yes.

00:25:58.133 --> 00:25:59.903
Oh my...

00:26:00.534 --> 00:26:03.004
Are you saying I abducted myself?

00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:11.714
I'm not hiding anything.

00:26:12.784 --> 00:26:14.554
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:26:14.853 --> 00:26:15.883
Really?

00:26:15.954 --> 00:26:18.623
What about you? Are you hiding something?

00:26:18.853 --> 00:26:20.423
- What would I hide?
- Well.

00:26:20.754 --> 00:26:22.764
you won't say how you found me.

00:26:24.494 --> 00:26:26.464
Is it a trade secret?

00:26:34.603 --> 00:26:35.843
Something happened. didn't it?

00:26:35.903 --> 00:26:37.474
I don't know. I was unconscious.

00:26:38.843 --> 00:26:40.113
Something happened to you. didn't it?

00:26:41.714 --> 00:26:43.083
That's why you keep hiding it.

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:47.883
I'll get you a female officer
to handle it. so tell the truth.

00:26:48.954 --> 00:26:50.153
We'll keep it confidential.

00:26:52.623 --> 00:26:55.964
Seriously. you have one wild imagination.

00:26:56.623 --> 00:26:58.923
- No?
- No.

00:26:58.994 --> 00:27:01.494
- I don't think so.
- I said no.

00:27:05.464 --> 00:27:06.734
That's a relief then.

00:27:10.903 --> 00:27:12.073
Are you hanging out?

00:27:13.474 --> 00:27:14.514
Are you?

00:27:16.113 --> 00:27:17.544
Did you check every corner?

00:27:17.643 --> 00:27:19.254
We looked everywhere. There's nobody here.

00:27:20.314 --> 00:27:22.314
- No one at all.
- Those rats.

00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:27.794
Put out an APB. and let's wrap up.

00:27:28.294 --> 00:27:29.694
- Yes. sir.
- Let's go.

00:27:30.163 --> 00:27:31.264
Let's go.

00:27:44.444 --> 00:27:45.744
Are you sure he didn't leave?

00:27:47.673 --> 00:27:48.944
I didn't see him leave.

00:27:55.284 --> 00:27:58.554
Zi O treated that girl?

00:27:58.623 --> 00:27:59.853
It's more than that.

00:28:00.994 --> 00:28:02.994
I felt like he was protecting her.

00:28:03.923 --> 00:28:05.724
If they protect each other.

00:28:05.823 --> 00:28:07.433
they'll definitely meet again.

00:28:10.734 --> 00:28:13.133
Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum. Police Academy grad.

00:28:13.534 --> 00:28:15.504
She was with Major Crimes. but was demoted...

00:28:15.573 --> 00:28:17.403
to Criminal for insubordination.

00:28:17.474 --> 00:28:18.744
PARENTS WENT MISSING

00:28:18.804 --> 00:28:21.044
There's nothing unusual except
for her parents going missing.

00:28:21.113 --> 00:28:23.583
That's what's unusual. Her
father is Ha Young Jae.

00:28:24.544 --> 00:28:25.583
Ha Young Jae?

00:28:25.643 --> 00:28:28.183
The co-founder of this lab and researcher.

00:28:28.514 --> 00:28:30.423
The person who created Z-0.

00:28:37.464 --> 00:28:40.264
If he hadn't taken off
with the lab notes and Z-0.

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:42.234
we wouldn't be in this mess.

00:28:42.534 --> 00:28:43.933
You couldn't catch him back then?

00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:45.663
Is he really missing?

00:28:59.984 --> 00:29:01.583
We have your wife.

00:29:02.583 --> 00:29:04.153
Talk. or she dies.

00:29:06.123 --> 00:29:07.423
Do you want to make your
daughter a children's home?

00:29:08.294 --> 00:29:09.464
I wouldn't know.

00:29:10.823 --> 00:29:12.663
He and his wife disappeared.

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.093
Was it Z-0?

00:29:18.163 --> 00:29:20.073
It's highly probable.

00:29:22.873 --> 00:29:25.204
I'll take care of the cops.

00:29:26.714 --> 00:29:28.143
so mark the female detective.

00:29:28.613 --> 00:29:29.613
Yes. sir.

00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:46.593
FIRE AT SUBWAY STATION

00:30:08.083 --> 00:30:09.454
Can we meet right now?

00:30:17.064 --> 00:30:18.923
Why? Do I look pretty?

00:30:19.264 --> 00:30:20.633
Why do you look so terrible?

00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:22.363
I'm a detective.

00:30:23.204 --> 00:30:24.734
So you should've been more obedient.

00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:26.173
Why are you suffering there?

00:30:26.504 --> 00:30:28.474
It would've been much
easier digging into people.

00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:30.843
I wasn't kicked out for being disobedient.

00:30:30.903 --> 00:30:31.944
Then?

00:30:32.304 --> 00:30:34.343
I dug into my direct supervisor.

00:30:35.343 --> 00:30:37.183
He was so dirty.

00:30:37.244 --> 00:30:38.984
You kept at it even after you
were told to stop. didn't you?

00:30:39.413 --> 00:30:41.613
- Yes.
- That's insubordination.

00:30:41.954 --> 00:30:43.623
Did you call me here to scold me?

00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:46.224
That too. And to ask for a favor.

00:30:46.923 --> 00:30:48.893
A personal favor is fine.
but not special treatment.

00:30:51.423 --> 00:30:53.034
Find a person for me.

00:30:54.093 --> 00:30:55.264
That sounds like special treatment.

00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:56.564
Remember that guy...

00:30:57.103 --> 00:30:59.333
who was fighting for his life
in the hospital. then fled?

00:31:00.673 --> 00:31:02.873
His name was Zi O. I believe?

00:31:04.274 --> 00:31:07.643
I analyzed his DNA. and it was strange.

00:31:09.444 --> 00:31:10.613
In what way?

00:31:10.683 --> 00:31:12.514
I don't know if you'll believe me...

00:31:12.583 --> 00:31:14.083
- I'll believe you.
- What?

00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:16.183
Anything.

00:31:18.024 --> 00:31:19.823
It's not very believable.

00:31:20.653 --> 00:31:23.923
but it seems he's human but not human.

00:31:24.294 --> 00:31:25.323
What?

00:31:25.863 --> 00:31:26.994
How do I put it?

00:31:28.234 --> 00:31:30.363
I can't say he's human.

00:31:32.204 --> 00:31:34.774
- A mutant?
- No. nothing like that.

00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:36.143
Does he have supernatural powers?

00:31:36.204 --> 00:31:39.643
If certain abilities excel.
that could be supernatural.

00:31:40.143 --> 00:31:41.673
But we can't tell just from the DNA.

00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:45.913
Then what's weird?

00:31:46.314 --> 00:31:48.153
We need to run tests to figure that out.

00:31:49.524 --> 00:31:51.054
You want me to find Zi O?

00:31:51.484 --> 00:31:54.024
That's your case. so you can handle that.

00:31:54.823 --> 00:31:58.064
Ryu Jeung Kwon. My college friend.

00:31:58.694 --> 00:32:00.933
It should be easy for you to find him.

00:32:00.994 --> 00:32:02.663
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

00:32:03.264 --> 00:32:05.504
- That's why I'm asking you.
- Did he go missing?

00:32:05.564 --> 00:32:07.103
No one reported him missing.

00:32:07.173 --> 00:32:08.573
He can't be located. is more accurate.

00:32:08.633 --> 00:32:10.304
His family didn't report him missing?

00:32:10.744 --> 00:32:13.474
They had cut ties with him.

00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:15.744
so it's understandable.

00:32:15.843 --> 00:32:17.143
What happened?

00:32:17.413 --> 00:32:18.784
During the last association meeting.

00:32:20.183 --> 00:32:22.014
he gave a presentation.

00:32:22.784 --> 00:32:24.254
That caused a bit of a problem.

00:32:24.823 --> 00:32:28.123
Humans realized how unstable they were.

00:32:28.194 --> 00:32:32.294
However. they made the wrong
choice in order to overcome that.

00:32:32.694 --> 00:32:35.694
Rather than becoming
stronger. they built machines.

00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:38.964
Rather than developing their
brains. they built computers.

00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:42.433
Soon. there will come a time when
we leave the world to machines.

00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:45.843
and thinking to AI.

00:32:49.883 --> 00:32:52.984
Humans chose technology over evolution.

00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:55.583
The result? Technology is developing.

00:32:56.054 --> 00:32:59.323
but humans are regressing.

00:33:00.994 --> 00:33:04.564
It wasn't the passion of a
young scientist. but lunacy.

00:33:04.724 --> 00:33:06.564
He's right though.

00:33:06.633 --> 00:33:08.194
He may be.

00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:10.603
Since some supported him fanatically.

00:33:10.904 --> 00:33:15.574
Humans became the only species
to choose to stop evolution.

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:18.544
Evolution is change. and change is life.

00:33:18.603 --> 00:33:20.674
A species that stops
evolution becomes extinct.

00:33:21.314 --> 00:33:23.683
In order to prevent the
extinction of mankind.

00:33:23.743 --> 00:33:25.643
we must enhance evolution...

00:33:25.714 --> 00:33:27.614
and keep our species alive.

00:33:28.853 --> 00:33:31.824
- He's a psycho.
- He has lost his mind.

00:33:32.723 --> 00:33:33.893
He's weird.

00:33:35.853 --> 00:33:37.223
The ethics of research!

00:33:38.364 --> 00:33:42.194
We must realize that we're
watching humans regress!

00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:46.734
The value of science is not ethics or morals.

00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:49.973
It's taking on new challenges!

00:33:51.643 --> 00:33:53.214
That's nonsense.

00:33:58.683 --> 00:34:00.714
Immediately thereafter.

00:34:00.783 --> 00:34:02.553
the academy asked for my opinion.

00:34:02.614 --> 00:34:06.083
I used everything I had to criticize him.

00:34:06.154 --> 00:34:08.294
My report was chosen.

00:34:08.353 --> 00:34:11.263
and he was expelled for
violating the ethics of research.

00:34:11.324 --> 00:34:12.663
They cut his funding.

00:34:13.933 --> 00:34:17.134
He was arrested a few months later.
and then his family left him.

00:34:17.504 --> 00:34:18.864
Why was he arrested?

00:34:18.933 --> 00:34:21.433
Embezzling research funds.
Trafficking of human eggs...

00:34:21.504 --> 00:34:22.703
and endangered animals.

00:34:23.444 --> 00:34:25.504
He insisted he was innocent.

00:34:25.574 --> 00:34:28.214
but it looked like people
wanted him executed.

00:34:28.544 --> 00:34:31.283
Was it that serious?

00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:36.183
For example. what if you
merged a human with a dog...

00:34:36.723 --> 00:34:39.183
to create a human with a keen sense of smell?

00:34:39.924 --> 00:34:43.163
What if you mix a human and a bird
to create a human that can fly?

00:34:43.393 --> 00:34:44.763
What if you add the fish DNA to a human...

00:34:44.763 --> 00:34:46.493
and a baby with gills is born?

00:34:46.933 --> 00:34:49.333
A man who can produce a powerful
current like an electric eel...

00:34:49.393 --> 00:34:51.634
or shoots out potent venom
like a jellyfish does.

00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:53.433
Can you call that man human?

00:34:54.074 --> 00:34:55.803
What are the boundaries of mankind?

00:34:56.444 --> 00:34:58.243
He didn't stop at just
believing in such a possibility.

00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:02.044
Jeung Kwon was actually working on it.

00:35:03.114 --> 00:35:05.984
We kept it from the media
because it was so shocking.

00:35:06.183 --> 00:35:09.013
but they seized a chimera when
they were searching his lab.

00:35:10.424 --> 00:35:11.754
What is a chimera?

00:35:13.953 --> 00:35:15.754
An organism made up of cells
from different animals.

00:35:16.094 --> 00:35:17.794
Human cells could be
combined with animal cells.

00:35:31.444 --> 00:35:32.574
That's insane.

00:35:32.574 --> 00:35:33.614
Insane. indeed.

00:35:34.844 --> 00:35:36.714
But he disappeared after he got out of jail.

00:35:37.183 --> 00:35:38.884
Some say he moved abroad.
Others say he killed himself.

00:35:38.944 --> 00:35:40.083
There are all these rumors.

00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:41.853
but no one has seen or
met him since his release.

00:35:42.783 --> 00:35:46.754
Are you saying Ryu Jeung Kwon created Zi O?

00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:49.694
- It's just my speculation.
- But how likely is it?

00:35:49.763 --> 00:35:50.763
Well...

00:35:51.194 --> 00:35:54.364
The recent gene-editing experiment
done by China and the US...

00:35:54.433 --> 00:35:56.404
did succeed in producing
children who are immune to HIV.

00:35:56.464 --> 00:35:59.303
I'd say it's possible to
create any kind of "human".

00:35:59.364 --> 00:36:01.833
You can even inject human
germ cells into a pig...

00:36:01.904 --> 00:36:04.074
to grow human organs inside it.

00:36:06.103 --> 00:36:08.413
So it's a pig on the outside
but a human on the inside?

00:36:08.413 --> 00:36:09.444
Creepy. right?

00:36:10.183 --> 00:36:12.013
They say science has limits. but not its own.

00:36:12.484 --> 00:36:13.513
Then whose limits are they?

00:36:13.583 --> 00:36:14.853
They're imposed by morality.

00:36:14.913 --> 00:36:17.683
Scientists aren't allowed to
take their experiments further.

00:36:18.254 --> 00:36:19.453
So if they break out of that.

00:36:19.484 --> 00:36:21.594
they can take it further?
Is that what you're saying?

00:36:21.654 --> 00:36:25.564
Many scientists want to
create new living organisms.

00:36:25.893 --> 00:36:28.564
Let's be honest. Who wouldn't
want to be like the Almighty?

00:36:28.964 --> 00:36:30.103
Let's say...

00:36:30.763 --> 00:36:32.634
such a creature was born.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:37.643
Then can it have the human mind?

00:36:38.074 --> 00:36:39.103
That I don't know.

00:36:39.774 --> 00:36:43.384
But its instincts may supersede
its feelings or thoughts...

00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:45.944
because it's partially
made up of animal cells.

00:36:48.714 --> 00:36:50.654
Then if such creatures grow in number.

00:36:51.154 --> 00:36:53.594
they'll rule all of us ordinary folks. right?

00:36:53.654 --> 00:36:56.154
This world will not be
ruled by the strongest.

00:36:56.223 --> 00:36:58.824
but by those who can quickly adapt to change.

00:36:59.123 --> 00:37:01.094
That is why mankind is
the ruler of this planet.

00:37:01.294 --> 00:37:04.033
Look at what people are
doing. I'm so sick of them.

00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:06.263
You find them in every corner of
the earth. no matter how remote.

00:37:07.803 --> 00:37:09.803
You can find Jeung Kwon. right?

00:37:12.674 --> 00:37:13.674
I'll do my best.

00:37:21.913 --> 00:37:23.654
JUAN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:37:23.723 --> 00:37:27.154
Kim. who was hit by the cargo
train and died on the spot.

00:37:27.223 --> 00:37:29.553
was formerly employed by the military.

00:37:30.123 --> 00:37:32.723
Kim fled while being investigated...

00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.763
for military corruption back in 2019.

00:37:35.464 --> 00:37:38.504
Based on his text message which
appears to be a suicide note.

00:37:38.703 --> 00:37:40.504
the police are investigating the case.

00:37:40.574 --> 00:37:42.674
weighing the possibility of suicide.

00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:45.703
In the text message. he apologized to...

00:37:45.774 --> 00:37:49.274
Hey. we're the police. Who
said this is a suicide case?

00:37:49.913 --> 00:37:51.844
- Since finding this message.
- Not me.

00:37:51.913 --> 00:37:53.853
the police have been having a hard time...

00:37:53.913 --> 00:37:55.583
- I didn't say it either.
- due to the location...

00:37:55.654 --> 00:37:57.553
Not a single reporter
showed up in our office.

00:37:57.623 --> 00:37:59.384
The platform is sealed off at the moment.

00:38:00.393 --> 00:38:03.053
Do they run stories on the news
without actually covering them?

00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:07.294
Hold on. We couldn't access
Kim's information in the system.

00:38:07.763 --> 00:38:09.694
Who obtained all that info?

00:38:10.134 --> 00:38:12.663
After that. Kim...

00:38:13.134 --> 00:38:15.973
Captain. about the subway station case...

00:38:16.473 --> 00:38:18.143
The reporters somehow know
what we didn't even know.

00:38:19.243 --> 00:38:21.214
We can't access the victim's
info. We sent in a request.

00:38:21.274 --> 00:38:22.574
but they're ignoring our request.

00:38:22.643 --> 00:38:24.683
Just let it go. The case
is being transferred.

00:38:25.143 --> 00:38:26.143
What do you mean?

00:38:26.214 --> 00:38:28.583
Zi O's case too. They've been
transferred to a different precinct.

00:38:29.154 --> 00:38:30.183
Take your hands off it now.

00:38:31.053 --> 00:38:32.953
What? Murder and kidnapping...

00:38:33.024 --> 00:38:35.123
It's a high-profile case. We
can't let them take it from us!

00:38:35.424 --> 00:38:37.094
Who got the case? The
Regional Investigation Unit?

00:38:37.424 --> 00:38:38.424
No idea.

00:38:39.123 --> 00:38:41.464
I just met with the chief
and was told to hand it over.

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:42.993
Hand over all the reports.

00:38:43.703 --> 00:38:44.933
There's none.

00:38:46.734 --> 00:38:48.234
What report?

00:38:48.734 --> 00:38:50.774
We've just been running around. The
investigation hasn't even begun.

00:38:51.674 --> 00:38:52.873
Come in.

00:38:56.444 --> 00:38:57.544
Yes. we're here.

00:38:58.743 --> 00:38:59.743
Where's Gu Reum?

00:39:01.314 --> 00:39:03.324
- Is she at the hospital?
- I don't know.

00:39:05.283 --> 00:39:07.723
She's being treated. She
said she'll be here tomorrow.

00:40:12.984 --> 00:40:13.993
Eat it.

00:40:14.794 --> 00:40:15.794
I got it for you.

00:40:31.074 --> 00:40:33.373
You said there are some
memories engraved in your mind.

00:40:40.484 --> 00:40:41.553
A white room.

00:40:42.114 --> 00:40:43.154
A narrow hallway.

00:40:44.583 --> 00:40:46.024
A kid who looks terrified.

00:40:46.353 --> 00:40:48.553
Curtains on fire. Academy Loan.

00:40:48.824 --> 00:40:49.853
The blue land...

00:40:50.794 --> 00:40:51.824
The wind.

00:40:51.964 --> 00:40:53.493
Lastly. your face and my name.

00:40:55.663 --> 00:40:57.134
Any memories of killing someone?

00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:09.174
I don't know.

00:41:11.283 --> 00:41:13.783
Hey. try to bring back your memories.

00:41:13.853 --> 00:41:15.214
Don't just say that you don't know.

00:41:17.984 --> 00:41:20.024
I do remember waking up after
being unconscious for a while.

00:41:20.094 --> 00:41:23.294
Although I don't know whether
it's only happened once or more.

00:41:23.993 --> 00:41:26.763
When I wake up. everything's
always wiped clean.

00:41:28.393 --> 00:41:30.364
So when you regain your consciousness.

00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:31.734
you don't remember anything?

00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:33.703
That's right. except for a few things.

00:41:35.703 --> 00:41:36.803
How convenient.

00:41:37.274 --> 00:41:38.774
I wish I could do that too.

00:41:38.844 --> 00:41:41.074
Turn my memory on and off.

00:41:41.413 --> 00:41:43.413
Do you know what it's like to start
over after everything's wiped out?

00:41:44.314 --> 00:41:45.614
I feel as though...

00:41:47.214 --> 00:41:49.913
I was abandoned without knowing
what I used to do and who I am.

00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:53.723
Not knowing what to do because...

00:41:53.794 --> 00:41:56.223
you know nothing about yourself.
Do you know what it's like?

00:41:58.294 --> 00:42:00.064
You know what it's like to
live in pain all your life?

00:42:01.294 --> 00:42:03.533
My parents. who said we should
have tonkatsu for lunch.

00:42:03.603 --> 00:42:05.263
never came back after they
left the house with you.

00:42:05.933 --> 00:42:08.033
Are they dead? Are they alive?

00:42:08.674 --> 00:42:09.703
Or...

00:42:12.004 --> 00:42:13.444
did they abandon me?

00:42:13.774 --> 00:42:15.774
Even while praying that
they're still alive somewhere.

00:42:15.844 --> 00:42:17.444
I caught myself thinking.
"What if they're alive?"

00:42:18.544 --> 00:42:21.413
"If they're alive and
well after abandoning me."

00:42:22.683 --> 00:42:23.723
"then what about me?"

00:42:25.824 --> 00:42:28.623
Do you know what it's like to be
trapped in that scary thought...

00:42:29.123 --> 00:42:30.123
all your life?

00:42:30.294 --> 00:42:32.924
At least you remember being
abandoned. I don't even have that.

00:42:34.464 --> 00:42:36.663
I can't empathize with you
because I don't have parents.

00:42:38.263 --> 00:42:40.103
I remember nothing. so I
have nothing to tell you.

00:42:42.504 --> 00:42:43.544
I'll get going.

00:42:44.473 --> 00:42:45.873
You grew up in a children's home.

00:42:47.913 --> 00:42:49.013
I'll take you there tomorrow.

00:42:53.013 --> 00:42:54.484
Then we'll find out...

00:42:55.814 --> 00:42:57.283
who abandoned you...

00:42:58.453 --> 00:43:01.324
and whether or not that precedes
the day you came to my house.

00:43:01.953 --> 00:43:03.564
I grew up in a children's home?

00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:09.464
Come out when I call you tomorrow.

00:43:10.933 --> 00:43:11.964
Hey.

00:43:15.803 --> 00:43:16.944
Where's the children's home?

00:43:17.643 --> 00:43:18.703
You're curious?

00:43:19.203 --> 00:43:20.243
I told you.

00:43:21.574 --> 00:43:23.683
I'll dig through your brain
to find out what happened.

00:43:29.614 --> 00:43:30.853
What if I refuse to go?

00:43:31.083 --> 00:43:32.453
Then keep living like that.

00:43:33.824 --> 00:43:35.324
Without even knowing who you really are.

00:44:02.283 --> 00:44:03.583
You haven't eaten yet?

00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:08.993
Did you see the news?

00:44:10.464 --> 00:44:12.623
A former soldier accused of
corruption died by suicide.

00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:14.663
What a joke.

00:44:16.064 --> 00:44:18.504
You see. even the deceased
have a thing called honor.

00:44:20.033 --> 00:44:21.933
To a dead person. that
is too much of a luxury.

00:44:22.774 --> 00:44:24.544
What will they say when I die?

00:44:25.404 --> 00:44:27.643
"A former female soldier who
made a move on her superior..."

00:44:27.714 --> 00:44:29.074
"to get a promotion dies by suicide."

00:44:29.574 --> 00:44:30.643
Something like that?

00:44:31.344 --> 00:44:32.413
Just don't die.

00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:35.714
You said we were doing this for our country.

00:44:36.484 --> 00:44:39.123
You roped me into this so I could
prove my loyalty to the country.

00:44:39.553 --> 00:44:40.824
Are you sure this is how it's done?

00:44:41.623 --> 00:44:44.223
You see. we're just small fry.

00:44:44.794 --> 00:44:46.723
It's normal that we don't know everything.

00:44:48.134 --> 00:44:50.163
Just as ants don't know about space?

00:44:51.103 --> 00:44:52.833
If you don't like it. leave.

00:44:53.103 --> 00:44:54.734
What about this leg?

00:44:55.473 --> 00:44:57.973
It'll rot and fall off without the shots.

00:44:59.243 --> 00:45:01.973
Isn't that why you're
obeying with your mouth shut?

00:45:02.344 --> 00:45:03.683
Stop whining.

00:45:04.814 --> 00:45:06.743
Sure. I'm just whining.

00:45:06.884 --> 00:45:09.214
What's the big deal about an arm and a leg?

00:45:09.453 --> 00:45:12.824
But we're doing who-knows-what
just to keep them.

00:45:17.223 --> 00:45:19.663
That female cop will get
a new cell phone tomorrow.

00:45:19.723 --> 00:45:22.694
They planted a tracker. so
keep a close eye on her.

00:45:36.413 --> 00:45:38.783
A half day? Why?

00:45:41.353 --> 00:45:42.953
I got 15 stitches.

00:45:43.013 --> 00:45:46.953
Back in my day. we stapled
it and continued working.

00:45:47.553 --> 00:45:49.053
You've got it good.

00:45:49.123 --> 00:45:50.154
That's why people call you...

00:45:50.154 --> 00:45:51.194
a "kkondae". condescending older person.

00:45:51.263 --> 00:45:52.364
It's an honor.

00:45:52.424 --> 00:45:54.993
"Kkondae" was added to
the British dictionary.

00:45:55.064 --> 00:45:57.134
You mean English dictionary.

00:45:57.564 --> 00:45:58.703
I'm injured.

00:46:00.234 --> 00:46:01.634
What will you do if you leave early?

00:46:02.203 --> 00:46:03.973
- Rest.
- Rest and do what?

00:46:04.044 --> 00:46:05.873
You used to nag that I didn't rest enough.

00:46:05.944 --> 00:46:07.444
Now. you nag because I want to rest.

00:46:07.513 --> 00:46:08.814
You wouldn't rest even when I told you to.

00:46:08.873 --> 00:46:10.814
So it's suspicious that you suddenly want to.

00:46:11.384 --> 00:46:13.913
Look. I'm injured.

00:46:15.413 --> 00:46:16.413
Ouch.

00:46:19.824 --> 00:46:20.924
Who is that?

00:46:21.953 --> 00:46:24.493
- Wait.
- Kim Hwang Shik. You recognize him?

00:46:24.564 --> 00:46:26.623
He was in the subway station.

00:46:27.433 --> 00:46:29.163
He committed suicide by
jumping in front of a subway.

00:46:29.393 --> 00:46:30.504
No way.

00:46:31.234 --> 00:46:32.663
That was an accident.

00:46:32.734 --> 00:46:34.574
If we say it was an accident.
we need to explain it.

00:46:34.973 --> 00:46:36.833
Why was he there at that hour?

00:46:36.904 --> 00:46:38.973
Who sent him there? Why?

00:46:39.643 --> 00:46:41.614
But there's no need if
we say it was suicide...

00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:42.844
since it's personal.

00:46:43.473 --> 00:46:44.544
Why was it suicide?

00:46:44.614 --> 00:46:45.913
That's what the police announced.

00:46:45.984 --> 00:46:47.413
Which police? This is our case.

00:46:47.484 --> 00:46:49.553
- They did.
- "They" who?

00:46:49.614 --> 00:46:51.953
I don't know. We were told to
hand it over. and to drop it.

00:46:52.024 --> 00:46:53.754
They didn't say who from
which unit was investigating.

00:46:53.824 --> 00:46:55.524
If they took the case.
they should tell you...

00:46:55.594 --> 00:46:57.594
who's taking it. where
to send what you have...

00:47:04.364 --> 00:47:07.904
This is above lowly cop's
paygrade. is that it?

00:47:07.973 --> 00:47:10.033
This punk. Lowly cop?

00:47:10.473 --> 00:47:12.074
We have the right to investigate.

00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:13.674
Then where did this case go?

00:47:13.743 --> 00:47:15.973
I don't know. They said
to drop it. so we did.

00:47:16.044 --> 00:47:17.814
- You should as well.
- Captain.

00:47:17.884 --> 00:47:19.283
I'm telling you in case you stir up trouble.

00:47:19.314 --> 00:47:22.484
Why are you just taking
it without any complaints?

00:47:22.553 --> 00:47:25.154
I did complain. I complained like crazy.

00:47:25.223 --> 00:47:26.254
I mean...

00:47:26.324 --> 00:47:28.853
You were kicked out for
insubordination. right?

00:47:29.223 --> 00:47:30.623
For investigating a supervisor.

00:47:31.594 --> 00:47:33.864
You were sent here because
you were with Major Crimes.

00:47:34.234 --> 00:47:37.634
Violent Crimes guys like us
would've lost our badges.

00:47:38.263 --> 00:47:40.603
So don't stick your nose around
after leaving work early.

00:47:40.674 --> 00:47:42.734
Just sit down and rest.

00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:48.743
You have a new phone.

00:47:49.114 --> 00:47:51.413
Submit your old one and go home.

00:47:59.623 --> 00:48:02.123
You found her? Where is she?

00:48:03.024 --> 00:48:04.723
I'll join you guys. so keep me updated.

00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.254
Seriously. You rude brat.

00:48:27.853 --> 00:48:30.183
Sit in the front. Do you
think you're a chairman?

00:48:45.703 --> 00:48:47.973
Hey. Sit in the back.

00:48:49.074 --> 00:48:51.044
It feels weird sitting side by side.

00:48:58.013 --> 00:48:59.143
Go back.

00:49:00.614 --> 00:49:02.114
Which a children's home?

00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:05.424
You don't remember being
in a children's home?

00:49:07.723 --> 00:49:09.254
I've never been to one.

00:49:12.123 --> 00:49:15.594
People may lie. but documents never do.

00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:17.703
Sit in the back.

00:49:19.404 --> 00:49:21.274
What does it matter where I sit?

00:49:22.933 --> 00:49:25.174
It's me you hate. not where I sit.

00:49:26.603 --> 00:49:27.814
Want to ride in the trunk?

00:49:30.274 --> 00:49:31.344
Let's go.

00:50:16.418 --> 00:50:17.858
How may I help you?

00:50:17.918 --> 00:50:19.458
Well... Just a minute.

00:50:23.728 --> 00:50:25.097
I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum.

00:50:25.728 --> 00:50:27.467
I'm here to see Sister Stella.

00:50:27.528 --> 00:50:29.367
Are you the detective who called?

00:50:29.597 --> 00:50:31.438
She's waiting for you. Please come in.

00:50:34.608 --> 00:50:37.537
I'll ask the questions. You stay quiet.

00:50:59.057 --> 00:51:00.258
Sister Stella.

00:51:07.807 --> 00:51:11.338
Hello. I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu
Reum. I called earlier.

00:51:14.347 --> 00:51:16.708
I sense very good energy from you.

00:51:18.318 --> 00:51:21.387
Too good for a detective.

00:51:21.818 --> 00:51:24.787
I don't know what brings you here.

00:51:26.387 --> 00:51:30.858
but since you're here anyway. I'll bless you.

00:51:35.398 --> 00:51:38.367
You seem to be with someone else.

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.907
Yes. we came together.

00:51:42.267 --> 00:51:44.608
Bless you.

00:51:47.947 --> 00:51:49.108
Say something.

00:51:50.148 --> 00:51:51.278
Thank you.

00:51:58.287 --> 00:52:00.258
She's still at a church.

00:52:00.557 --> 00:52:01.688
Is she praying?

00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:07.467
Can I get some sort of a reaction?

00:52:08.967 --> 00:52:10.197
Haven't you read her profile?

00:52:10.967 --> 00:52:12.398
She isn't religious.

00:52:16.708 --> 00:52:18.537
I'm looking for someone.

00:52:19.307 --> 00:52:23.548
It has been a while since we
closed the children's home...

00:52:23.608 --> 00:52:26.048
for this and that reason.

00:52:26.117 --> 00:52:27.987
So I'm not sure I'll remember.

00:52:28.548 --> 00:52:30.688
For whom are you searching?

00:52:32.717 --> 00:52:34.927
It has been over 20 years.

00:52:34.987 --> 00:52:38.128
but did you know Jang Jae
Woo and Hwang Eun Gyeong?

00:52:40.927 --> 00:52:42.467
I don't know.

00:52:44.367 --> 00:52:45.597
HWANG EUN GYEONG. MISSING

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:50.137
According to their family. they
were a member of his church.

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:53.708
They left to go to mass
that day and went missing.

00:52:53.778 --> 00:52:56.677
I've spent my entire life here.

00:52:57.048 --> 00:52:59.217
If that had happened.

00:52:59.278 --> 00:53:02.148
the police would've come.

00:53:03.088 --> 00:53:06.958
I've never heard of any member
of our church going missing.

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:10.028
It was a missing person case.
but the police never came?

00:53:10.088 --> 00:53:12.197
Not for that. no.

00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:14.927
Then what for?

00:53:17.697 --> 00:53:18.967
There was...

00:53:20.398 --> 00:53:22.537
a fire in the church.

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:25.907
They came for the first time then.

00:53:26.478 --> 00:53:27.478
I see.

00:53:30.148 --> 00:53:34.188
Then do you remember the name Zi O?

00:53:38.617 --> 00:53:39.787
Do you?

00:53:41.028 --> 00:53:42.287
Zi O?

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:45.128
I remember him.

00:53:46.898 --> 00:53:49.568
How could I forget that name?

00:53:50.668 --> 00:53:51.798
Do you know...

00:53:52.898 --> 00:53:55.568
who dropped him off here?

00:53:55.967 --> 00:53:56.967
No.

00:53:57.508 --> 00:53:59.478
He came on his own.

00:54:00.137 --> 00:54:02.148
I went out one morning.

00:54:02.208 --> 00:54:04.347
and he was standing by
the statue of Virgin Mary.

00:54:05.347 --> 00:54:06.778
"Did you come here on your own?"

00:54:08.318 --> 00:54:10.048
"Did someone bring you here?"

00:54:11.588 --> 00:54:14.117
I kept asking. but he said the same thing.

00:54:14.628 --> 00:54:16.387
Zi O. Zi O.

00:54:17.697 --> 00:54:19.528
That became his name.

00:54:20.128 --> 00:54:23.327
Do you remember exactly what date.
or what month and year it was?

00:54:23.728 --> 00:54:26.097
I don't remember.

00:54:26.467 --> 00:54:28.668
It was so long ago.

00:54:29.108 --> 00:54:33.708
It has been over 20 years.

00:54:35.778 --> 00:54:37.648
Did anyone come to see him...

00:54:37.717 --> 00:54:39.418
or sponsor him at some point?

00:54:39.778 --> 00:54:41.487
Why do you ask?

00:54:42.017 --> 00:54:44.088
What do you want to know?

00:54:44.557 --> 00:54:48.188
I was wondering if there was
anyone related to him in some way.

00:54:49.927 --> 00:54:54.298
Did he do something wrong?

00:54:54.927 --> 00:54:55.927
No.

00:54:57.068 --> 00:54:59.767
Did someone adopt him?

00:55:01.338 --> 00:55:02.708
Yes. there were several.

00:55:03.737 --> 00:55:07.778
Was there a man named
Ha Young Jae among them?

00:55:08.978 --> 00:55:10.548
Ha Young Jae.

00:55:11.117 --> 00:55:13.677
Ha Young Jae.

00:55:15.017 --> 00:55:16.088
No.

00:55:17.487 --> 00:55:19.588
I've never heard that name before.

00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:22.358
Your memory may be imperfect.

00:55:22.427 --> 00:55:25.258
so may I see your documents?

00:55:26.798 --> 00:55:27.898
No.

00:55:30.267 --> 00:55:32.967
It's impossible for me not to remember.

00:55:34.568 --> 00:55:37.778
I can't forget a single detail...

00:55:37.838 --> 00:55:40.208
related to that child.

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:48.248
Whenever someone took him to adopt him.

00:55:48.517 --> 00:55:52.787
they brought him back the day after.

00:55:53.157 --> 00:55:55.028
They said they couldn't keep him.

00:55:56.887 --> 00:56:01.128
They all said that they couldn't
raise him for a single day.

00:56:01.927 --> 00:56:04.697
They looked terrified when they brought him.

00:56:05.267 --> 00:56:07.668
and left as if they were running away.

00:56:09.568 --> 00:56:11.307
So... Sister.

00:56:11.378 --> 00:56:12.938
That's how he was.

00:56:14.608 --> 00:56:16.608
He was too difficult for everyone.

00:56:18.947 --> 00:56:20.117
I see.

00:56:20.378 --> 00:56:22.947
- That child...
- You don't need to continue.

00:56:23.017 --> 00:56:24.048
No.

00:56:24.787 --> 00:56:28.958
If you're involved with
him. you need to know this.

00:56:29.657 --> 00:56:32.157
He set this church on fire.

00:56:33.697 --> 00:56:35.827
That's when I hurt my eyes.

00:56:38.197 --> 00:56:40.798
Stay away from him.

00:56:45.438 --> 00:56:48.947
He doesn't remember being here.

00:56:53.617 --> 00:56:55.717
He was always like that.

00:56:56.847 --> 00:56:59.117
Even after starting the fire.

00:56:59.188 --> 00:57:02.487
he said he didn't remember.
and that it wasn't him.

00:57:02.887 --> 00:57:04.287
Do you know why?

00:57:06.057 --> 00:57:08.767
- Why?
- Inside of him...

00:57:10.697 --> 00:57:12.298
lies a demon.

00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:15.037
The demon started the fire.

00:57:15.108 --> 00:57:17.677
and the child didn't remember.

00:57:18.508 --> 00:57:19.577
No.

00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:24.617
That child...

00:57:26.117 --> 00:57:27.717
was a demon.

00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:06.088
No.
