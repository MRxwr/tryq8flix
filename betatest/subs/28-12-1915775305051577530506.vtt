00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.078
You don't wanna play with us?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.081
I know a game.
but we need another player.

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.782
It's called pound the hillbilly.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.543

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.121
- What about your daddy?
- Doesn't have one.

00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:04.123
I do have a father.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.860
Fight. Frank.

00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:09.361

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:47.766
Good boy.

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.936
Who did you piss off this time?

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:54.740
I get my face smashed in
and it's my fault?

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:56.208
I called for you.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.177
I had the radio on.

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.779
- Corky heard me.
- Dogs have better hearing.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.715
Frank.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.187
Life is tough.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.923
Sometimes there's nobody there
to help you.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:24.336
Corky.

00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:26.505
Dad?

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.407

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.847

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.416
What happened?

00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:39.284
Trouble at school.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.553
Hey. you should see
the other kids.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.989
Yeah. well.
does you mother know?

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.892
Where is her ladyship?

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.828
Think she'll be happy to see me?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.630
Yeah.

00:03:56.437 --> 00:03:58.770
What are you doing here?

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.340
Well. I just came to see
your beautiful smile.

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:04.743
- What do you want?
- I want to see my son.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.279
Well. you just saw him.
now leave.

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.580
Come on. Frank. let's go inside.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.582
- Let's go inside!
- No!

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.351
Frank is gonna stay right here.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.523
Give us a chance
to catch up. okay. son?

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:19.758
Sure. Pop.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.500
How the hell did you find us?

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:31.503
Well you're not exactly
Miss Inconspicuous.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.672
I told you to leave.

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:36.842
And I'm telling you the judge
ordered you to stay in Chicago

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:38.744
and to notify the court
and or me

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.279
if you intended to leave.

00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:42.281
Well the judge only knows
the law.

00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:43.749
but I know what's best
for my son.

00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:45.484
To raise him without his father?

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.519
I only married you out of pity.

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.955
A promise I made to my mother
on her death bed.

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:52.491
God knows what she ever saw
in you.

00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:55.494
I know you never wanted me.

00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:57.763
But I also know
that you never wanted him.

00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:59.431
You just don't want me
to have him.

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.433
Get the hell out!

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.638
I love that boy.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.374
Something that you'll
never understand.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.476
So you can runaway. hide.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.512
and whatever your deranged
mind can think up.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.048
but I promise you this.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.317
that if I can't see my son.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.419
the judge hears
you skipped town.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:22.721
and I get full custody.

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.896
Fine!

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.368
Fine.

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:43.575
Now you know I have to be
in the city for work.

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:46.578
Can't stay here.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.747
But what if you came to visit me

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.749
every other weekend in Chicago?

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:52.751
Really?

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:54.920
Yeah.
Pick you up on Saturday.

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.922
I want you to go now.

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:59.925
- Can Pop stay for dinner?
- No. he can't.

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:02.861
- But it's gonna get dark soon.
- Well then he better get going.

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:04.463
It's okay. all right?

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:06.965
We're gonna see each other
on Saturday.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.667
Promise?

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.769
Well. there's only one way
to make a promise.

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:15.540
Get up. stand on that side
of the fence.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.609
Cowboys binding contract.

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:19.845
I stand on this side.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.847
Now we shake hands.

00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:27.986
I give you my word.

00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:34.526
I wish you could stay.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.529
Well. you got a hug
for your old man?

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.900
Oh. man.
how'd you get so strong?

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.468
Chocolate.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.971
Chocolate. huh?

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:51.143
Well. maybe this will tide you
over till Saturday.

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:54.713
Just don't let your mom see it.

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.693
Now I'll always be with you.

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:15.901
Thanks. Pop.

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:21.173
So long. cowboy.

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.498

Now. I want you to pick out a
song for me and her to dance to.

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.044
I think you'll know
what she likes.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.450
I think she would like
any kind of music.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.452
Any kind of song.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:57.221
She's not picky.

00:15:57.223 --> 00:15:59.691
You can tell all that
just by looking at her?

00:15:59.693 --> 00:16:02.060
I can tell all that
by looking at you.

00:17:22.642 --> 00:17:24.776
What the hell happened
up at Bullhead?

00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:26.544
Tom Wells happened.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.179
Yeah. well.
Mason's talking to Tom.

00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:30.415
I wanted to hear
your side of it.

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:33.117
I had it all under control then
shit for brains used my Kel-Lite

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:34.619
to knock the guy's head off.

00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:37.355
Well. we haven't heard
the end of this.

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:39.357
I'll keep you in the loop.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.159
Shouldn't you be in school. son?

00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:42.627
Uh. this is Mitch Myers.

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:45.163
- He's rookie.
- No shit.

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:47.331
- Been training down in Phoenix.
- Good for him.

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.801
It's a real pleasure
to meet you. Officer Shankwitz.

00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:52.203
- The newest member of our team.
- Lucky us.

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:55.740
No. Frank. lucky you.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.408
No.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.245
I'd rather take Tom Wells.

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.618
Then we had four months
additional academy training.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.620
And that included self-dense.

00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:13.224
uh. firearms operations.
first aid.

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:17.728
uh. hostage negotiation.
uh. high speed driving.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.165
traffic control.
crowd management.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:23.167
and that was all
basic cadet training.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.435
Sorry.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.405
Listen. Junior.
it's tough out there.

00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:30.408
Risky. dangerous.
and unpredictable.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.410
But that's enough about me.

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:35.413
You wanna die tonight.
just keep talking.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.782
Yes. sir.

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.784
Not another word.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.420
Except that one.

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:44.388
Internal Affairs are gonna
be all over this. Tom.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.557
- It doesn't look good.
- Have you finalized your report yet?

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.560
No. Not till I know
what you wanna do.

00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:51.662
Well I had kind of a fun idea.

00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:53.664
Sounds like you.
Let's hear it.

00:18:55.535 --> 00:18:59.804
That male suspect
doesn't know shit

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.906
- about what happened.
- What?

00:19:01.908 --> 00:19:04.909
Hey. what are you talking about?

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.312
Come here.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.818
All right. go.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.820
He and Frank went toe to toe.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.522
- Uh-huh.
- Took a pretty good beatin'.

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.524
Got knocked on the head.

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:21.192
As far as he knows.

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:23.461
old Tom here had
nothing to do with it.

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:24.929
Okay.

00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:27.932
Why should I cover your ass?

00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:29.367
You're not exactly
Mr. Ethical.

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:31.469
I know. but I'm still
your sergeant.

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.805
So. give me one good reason why I should
put my ass on the line for you again?

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.807
I'll give you
three good reasons.

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:39.177
A. I'm your best guy.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:42.613
Number two. if I go down.

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:45.616
could be a domino effect.

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:48.486
That's only two reasons.

00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:50.488
Yeah. that's all I got.
but I think I made my point.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.356
I get it. okay.

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:54.525
All right. but this little story
of yours better work

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.527
or you're shit out of luck.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.230
Now. the broad. she saw it all.

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:01.265
What about her?

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:03.301
That's the fun part.

00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:11.609
♪ On the other side ♪

00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:40.738
Frank?
Stay in the car.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.607
Keep your hands where I could...
Son of a bitch!

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:44.809
Hey. stop!

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.747
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.749
- Okay.
- Hang in there. Frank!

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.317
Frank? Frank.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:55.286
Okay. I'm gonna
remove your helmet.

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:57.822
Do not move. I'm taking off
your helmet right now.

00:20:59.692 --> 00:21:01.726
All right. Okay.

00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:04.895
Get down on the ground.

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:06.664
Uh... okay.

00:21:11.337 --> 00:21:13.871
Come on.

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:16.007
- Is he all right?
- He's not breathing.

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:17.875
Come on. Frank!

00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:20.878
This is motor 13-33.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.513
I have an officer down.

00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.583
Motor 10-91 is a 962A.
I need medical assistance

00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:27.551
between Parker
and Cienega Springs.

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:29.587
Do you copy?

00:21:29.589 --> 00:21:31.589
- Fight.
- Do you copy?

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.824
- 10-4. motor 13-33.
- Fight. Frank!

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:35.826
A rescue unit is en route.

00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:38.462
Okay. Frank.
this is Mitch Myers.

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:40.698
I need you to hang in there.
help is on its way.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.733
- Do you have anything?
- No.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:44.735
He's not breathing.

00:21:44.737 --> 00:21:47.038
I'm sorry.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.907
I'm so sorry.

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:55.913
963A... motor 10-91 is a 963A.

00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:00.618
Frank's gone.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.868
What are you doing?

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.738
Get your things
or they'll be left behind.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.939
Where are we going?

00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:24.642
- Arizona.
- Why?

00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:26.644
It's where I belong.

00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:29.814
I wanna stay here.

00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:32.817
So you can get
your face smashed in?

00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:34.819
Yeah. you really love it here.

00:22:34.821 --> 00:22:36.687
I wanna see Dad.

00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:38.689
He's coming to pick me up
on Saturday.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.392
- Not anymore.
- Why not?

00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:44.895
Your dad wants you back
in Chicago for good.

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:48.065
If we stay here. he'll take you
away from me for good.

00:22:48.067 --> 00:22:49.700
I ain't gonna let that happen.

00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:51.502
I'm not going.
Dad will come for me.

00:22:51.504 --> 00:22:53.504
- Go on. get in the car.
- No.

00:22:53.506 --> 00:22:55.473
- Frank. get in the car. Frank.
- No.

No. no!
I'm not going.

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:06.016
Stop it!
Get in the car!

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:08.052
- I'm not...
- Stay in the car!

00:23:09.956 --> 00:23:11.956
Stay in the car!

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:24.535
- Wait. you forgot Corky.
- He's not coming.

00:23:24.537 --> 00:23:26.704
Can't take him
on the road with us.

00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:31.709
Corky. no!

00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:32.977
Corky!

00:23:32.979 --> 00:23:34.979
Mom. stop. please!

00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:37.515
Mom! Mom. stop. I'm sorry!

00:23:37.517 --> 00:23:39.116
Whatever I did...
Whatever I did. I'm sorry.

00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:41.619
Shut up. Frank!
Stop it!

00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:46.657
Corky!

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:52.196
He's... He's breathing!

00:23:52.198 --> 00:23:54.532
- What?
- He's breathing! He's alive!

00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:57.067
Am I in heaven?

00:23:57.069 --> 00:23:59.570
No. Frank.
you're in Parker. Arizona.

00:23:59.572 --> 00:24:02.840
Why is this angel kissing me?

00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:05.009
Don't move. don't move.
Keep your eyes on me.

00:24:05.011 --> 00:24:06.510
If you insist.

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:08.212
Do you remember what happened?

00:24:08.214 --> 00:24:10.581
Uh... yeah.

00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:12.149
I'm still paired
with a damn rookie.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.924
Hey. what are you doing
later tonight?

00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:21.792
He's alive!

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:25.496
Motor 10-91 is a 962A!

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:28.899
You had us worried
for a minute there. Frank.

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:30.868
What's your name?

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.937
Sally.

00:24:32.939 --> 00:24:34.939
Thank you. Sally.

00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.641
I'm glad it was you.

00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:40.744
If he had kissed me.
I don't think I'd come back from that.

00:24:40.746 --> 00:24:42.480
Did you get the son of a bitch?

00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:44.615
Yeah. he's cuffed to the bike.

00:24:44.617 --> 00:24:47.084
Evening. sir.

00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:49.053
License and registration.

Dr. Cohen to pathology.

00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:02.900
You've gotta stay awake. Frank.

00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:05.936
Can't have you go into shock.

00:25:10.943 --> 00:25:12.510
Excuse me. nurse.

00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:14.745
Could you get his doctor for me?

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:16.747
Mm-hmm.

00:25:16.749 --> 00:25:20.184
So. uh. how are you holding
up. Frank?

00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:22.253
Well. I feel about as good
as I look.

00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:23.988
What is it with you?

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.823
Always getting beat up.

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:28.626
I guess I like trouble.

00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:32.096
Who's the groupie?

00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:34.231
Oh. this is Kitty Carlisle.
New secretary.

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:36.033
Just joined us today.

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.968
Uh. Frank Shankwitz.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.571
Sometimes prettier.

00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:43.107
but always just as charming.

00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:45.543
Pleasure's all mine. Frank.

00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:48.212
Well. it's quite a grip
you got there. Kitty.

00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:50.314
You're gonna fit right in.

00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:52.616
Charming and a sense of humor.

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:53.984
Wow. it's like you know me
already.

00:25:56.022 --> 00:25:58.556
Well. Doctor.

00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:00.324
Good evening. Frank.
I'm Dr. McKinley.

00:26:00.326 --> 00:26:03.193
You are lucky to be alive.

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:04.695
You have a skull fracture

00:26:04.697 --> 00:26:06.897
and severe bruising
of the brain.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.832
It's gonna be a long road
back for you.

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:10.234
but you'll get there
with plenty of rest.

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:13.637
What are you thinking.
like a few weeks?

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:15.906
More like a few months.

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:18.309
I'm gonna ask you to have someone
come stay with you for a week or two.

00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:19.710
Help look after you.

00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:20.945
No. I'm fine.

00:26:20.947 --> 00:26:22.947
Don't need nobody fussing
over me.

00:26:22.949 --> 00:26:25.115
Well. the risk of you going
into shock is very. very high

00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:26.216
for the next few days.

00:26:26.218 --> 00:26:27.952
Especially at night.

00:26:27.954 --> 00:26:29.620
So I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to insist on it.

00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:33.023
Kitty. you got
your first assignment.

00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:34.592
She's not staying at my house.

00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:35.859
I'm not staying at his house.

00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:38.062
Not without dinner
and a movie first.

00:26:38.064 --> 00:26:40.631
- It's kind of a rule.
- I'm not staying at his house period.

00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:44.301
- He's crazy.
- Frank. the sooner you get better.

00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:45.769
the sooner you get back to work.

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.304
and you heard
what the doctor said.

00:26:47.306 --> 00:26:49.039
You need looking after.

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:54.178
And. Kitty. I wanna know
who's doing the looking after.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.180
Ortho tech to pediatrics.

00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:11.028
All right. let's see.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.197
Uh. yeah.
Watch this step.

00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:14.999
You sure you don't want
these crutches?

00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:16.266
I don't need any help.

00:27:16.268 --> 00:27:19.269
All right. let's get you set up.

00:27:19.271 --> 00:27:22.272
I just want you to rest up
and get better.

00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:24.942
Get you back on that horse.

00:27:24.944 --> 00:27:26.944
Yeah.

00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:30.714
Welcome to Arizona's finest.

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:34.718
Wow. Frank. you didn't have
to tidy up on account of us.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.787
I guess if it doesn't work
as a cop

00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:38.956
you can always go
into interior design.

00:27:38.958 --> 00:27:40.958
That's funny.
Quick tour.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.826
Liquor cabinet's over there.

00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:44.161
Kitchen's through there.

00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:45.829
I don't get in there much.

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:48.165
Probably see more action
now Kitty's here.

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:50.100
Can I leave?
This is gonna end badly.

00:27:50.102 --> 00:27:52.269
No. no. no. you'll be just fine.

00:27:52.271 --> 00:27:54.338
- It's not me I'm worried about.
- Okay. bedroom's through this way.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.341
Probably see a lot less action
now Kitty's here.

00:27:59.045 --> 00:28:01.078
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- No. no. no. no.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.347
You're gonna stay right here.
Come on.

00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:08.385
Well. let me get you
set up here. Frank.

00:28:08.387 --> 00:28:10.054
I want you to rest up.

00:28:10.056 --> 00:28:12.056
Okay.

00:28:12.058 --> 00:28:15.059
You lie back there.

00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:18.328
Now. is there anything
I can get you before I leave?

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.030
Yeah.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:22.900
A bottle of Scotch

00:28:22.902 --> 00:28:25.035
and a good cigar
would be great about now.

00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:27.137
Well. I'm sorry. Frank.
not gonna happen.

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:30.140
I guess I'll just lay here.

00:28:30.142 --> 00:28:31.442
With Kitty.

00:28:31.444 --> 00:28:33.310
Yeah. sorry. Frank.
not gonna happen.

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:35.345
Look. Frank. I'll get you
that drink.

00:28:35.347 --> 00:28:38.882
As soon as you pay me back
for that bike you wrecked.

00:28:38.884 --> 00:28:42.886
Now you two play nice.

00:28:52.298 --> 00:28:55.299
Look. if you wanna go.
I'm not gonna stop ya.

00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:58.435
I have no intention
of being fired

00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:00.104
on my very first assignment.

00:29:00.106 --> 00:29:01.405
Thank you.

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:06.777
At the hospital why didn't you
tell Eddie we had already met?

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:10.114
I didn't wanna
have to explain it.

00:29:10.116 --> 00:29:11.381
Why didn't you say anything?

00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:13.383
When I first saw you there.

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:16.286
my first thought was
why is this man following me?

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.222
Well. you know
what I'm thinking?

00:29:18.224 --> 00:29:21.859
I'm thinking this pain medicine
is wearing off way too fast.

00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:23.494
Can I ask you something?

00:29:23.496 --> 00:29:25.429
I know what you're gonna ask me
and the answer is no.

00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:27.331
I'm not allowed to date you.

00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:30.334
It's against department policy.
and they're very strict.

00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:32.936
Well. thank you for helping me
dodge that bullet.

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.239
Mm-hmm.

00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:38.275
Do you mind if I ask you a
question about your accident?

00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:40.511
No.

00:29:41.547 --> 00:29:43.981
No. you don't mind

00:29:43.983 --> 00:29:45.983
or no. you don't want me to ask?

00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:53.924
Eddie said you stopped breathing
for a few minutes.

00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:55.259
Is that true?

00:29:58.264 --> 00:30:00.264
You know what?

00:30:00.266 --> 00:30:02.800
If we're gonna talk. let's...
Let's just talk about you.

00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:04.368
Okay?

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.569
Are you married?

00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:08.038
You're very direct.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.073
Are you a Scorpio?

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:11.475
- What?
- A Scorpio?

00:30:11.477 --> 00:30:13.210
- Are you a Scorpio?
- No.

00:30:13.212 --> 00:30:14.444
- Leo.
- No.

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:16.180
- Gemini? Taurus.
- No.

00:30:16.182 --> 00:30:17.848
- Pisces.
- I knew it.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.082
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:21.518
This pain medicine's worn off.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.154
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:26.156
- Here.
- No. don't. I don't need your help.

00:30:38.838 --> 00:30:41.839
Ow!

00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:43.540
Damn it.

00:32:16.302 --> 00:32:18.302
Frank!

00:32:29.949 --> 00:32:31.949
Frank!

00:32:31.951 --> 00:32:34.651
Come on. let's go!

00:32:35.688 --> 00:32:37.688
Lorraine. you in here?

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:41.425
Frank!

00:32:41.427 --> 00:32:43.460
Come on. let's go. Frank!

00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:48.265
Corky! Corky!

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:50.133
Atta boy.

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:51.468
Hey. where's Frank?

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.470
Where's Frank. buddy?

00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:57.474
Frank!

00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:00.978
Come on. Corky. come on.

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:10.120
Damn that woman.

00:33:10.122 --> 00:33:12.122
Goddamn that woman!

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.219
- Sheriff's office.
- My son's been kidnapped.

00:33:42.221 --> 00:33:45.255
Uh. uh. what's your name. sir?

00:33:45.257 --> 00:33:46.623
Frank Shankwitz.

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:48.525
Uh. how do you spell that?

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:51.194
S-H-A-N-K-W-I-T-Z.

00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:54.097
And your son's name?

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:57.034
Uh. same. Frank.
Frank Shankwitz. Jr.

00:33:57.036 --> 00:33:58.802
Do you know who took your son?

00:33:58.804 --> 00:34:00.203
My wife.

00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:01.671
My ex-wife Lorraine.

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:04.574
So. the boy's with his mother.

00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:06.276
Yes.

00:34:06.278 --> 00:34:08.278
Is that a problem?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.781
We have joint custody.

00:34:10.783 --> 00:34:13.150
She ignored a court order
to stay in Chicago.

00:34:13.152 --> 00:34:14.551
She took him. and now
she's on the run again.

00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.453
So. yes. it's a problem.

00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:19.256
Well. if the boy's
with his mother

00:34:19.258 --> 00:34:21.825
then it's something
for the court

00:34:21.827 --> 00:34:23.827
and the Chicago police
to handle.

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:27.597
If you wanna register
your son as missing.

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:30.634
then we can start a search
in 72 hours.

00:34:30.636 --> 00:34:32.602
They could be halfway
around the world by then!

00:34:32.604 --> 00:34:34.371
Calm down. Mr. Shankwitz.

00:34:34.373 --> 00:34:36.373
- Calm down?
- I'm sorry. but that's all...

00:34:36.375 --> 00:34:38.375
Just find my son!

00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:49.686
Frank!

00:34:51.223 --> 00:34:54.591
Frank.

00:34:54.593 --> 00:34:57.094
- You're okay.
- Leave it.

00:34:57.096 --> 00:35:00.097
- I got it.
- I said leave it!

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:03.567
Nice going.
Florence Nightingale.

00:35:21.153 --> 00:35:24.154
Son of a bitch!

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:40.137
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:41.571
That's her shitty ass car.

00:35:41.573 --> 00:35:44.508
so that must be
her shitty ass house.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.210
Sit tight.

00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:49.212
Be right back.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.925
Crazy bitch.

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:51.741
Yeah?

00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:53.877
- She's a firecracker. all right.
- Is she gonna be a problem?

00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:56.646
No problem. Officer Shankwitz.

00:36:56.648 --> 00:36:57.881
No problem at all.

00:36:57.883 --> 00:37:00.317
That's what I like to hear.

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:03.286
Let's go.

00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:55.839
Damn it!

00:38:25.003 --> 00:38:27.003
Frank!

00:38:33.045 --> 00:38:35.045
Frank!

00:38:49.528 --> 00:38:51.528
Frank!

00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:03.673
Frank. what the hell
are you doing?

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:05.442
I'm playing tennis.

00:39:05.444 --> 00:39:06.910
What's it look like?

00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:09.446
It looks like you need
to get dressed and shave.

00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:12.048
- You look like a bum.
- A bum.

00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:15.552
Yeah. well you look
like a hooker.

00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:19.389
You don't like the way I look?

00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:20.757
No. no. it's perfect.

00:39:20.759 --> 00:39:22.826
You know. if you wanna earn
a few bucks on the way home.

00:39:22.828 --> 00:39:24.828
Get out of here.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.130
You get out of here.

00:39:27.132 --> 00:39:29.599
I live here. you're trespassing.

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:32.836
- Get out!
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:39:34.573 --> 00:39:36.139
Shoot the bottle.

00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:38.975
No way. I'm done.

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:41.911
I wasn't asking.

00:39:57.662 --> 00:39:58.862
Told ya.

00:39:58.864 --> 00:40:00.864
Waste of damn time.

00:40:00.866 --> 00:40:02.832
- Again.
- I said I'm done.

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.734
I said again.

00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:26.923
Take the shot.

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:39.469
So. who's your date?

00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:41.604
What makes you think
I have a date?

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:43.039
You dressed up for me. huh?

00:40:43.041 --> 00:40:46.042
Why do you care?

00:40:46.044 --> 00:40:47.811
I just wanna know
who's stealing my nurse

00:40:47.813 --> 00:40:49.813
so I can arrest them.

00:40:49.815 --> 00:40:52.182
I was only assigned
to you for a week.

00:40:52.184 --> 00:40:54.851
Why do you keep coming back?

00:41:00.125 --> 00:41:01.758
I don't know.

00:41:04.095 --> 00:41:06.529
I am gonna be late for my date.

00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:07.690
Honey. rise and shine.

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:09.158
Come on. up and at 'em.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.693
I retired.

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.161
I don't have
to get up and at 'em.

00:42:12.163 --> 00:42:14.297
Well. it's 9:30. you know.

00:42:14.299 --> 00:42:15.932
9:30?

00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:18.101
Half the day's gone.
Why didn't you wake me?

00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:20.203
Just thought I'd let you get
a little beauty sleep.

00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.105
Beauty?
Look at this face.

00:42:22.107 --> 00:42:23.973
I'm already beautiful enough.

00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:26.309
I get any more beauty sleep.
I'll be gorgeous.

00:42:26.311 --> 00:42:29.112
I'd hurry up and get
downstairs if I were you.

00:42:29.114 --> 00:42:31.214
- Why?
- 'Cause if your head got any bigger.

00:42:31.216 --> 00:42:33.650
- it wouldn't get through the door.
- Oh.

00:42:33.652 --> 00:42:35.652
But it's a cute face.

00:42:35.654 --> 00:42:36.920
- Mmm.
- Mm-mm.

00:42:36.922 --> 00:42:38.121
- Love you.
- Mm.

00:43:20.899 --> 00:43:22.899
I know why you're here. Doc.

00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:24.767
There's nothing to talk about.

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:27.804
Well. good afternoon
to you. too. Frank.

00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:29.806
Wife and kids are doing fine.

00:43:29.808 --> 00:43:31.240
Thanks for asking.

00:43:31.242 --> 00:43:33.776
Sorry. Doc.
I just wanna get better

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:35.178
and get back on the horse.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.846
Eddie won't let you
get a haircut

00:43:36.848 --> 00:43:39.716
until he knows you
and I have a little talk.

00:43:39.718 --> 00:43:41.718
So how 'bout it?

00:43:43.655 --> 00:43:45.822
I usually like to pop a few
pain killers right about now.

00:43:45.824 --> 00:43:48.625
- You want anything?
- No thanks.

00:43:48.627 --> 00:43:49.892
But I'd like
to ask you something.

00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:52.862
What's it like
being dead man walking?

00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:54.764
I don't ' need to get
into all the deep stuff.

00:43:54.766 --> 00:43:57.200
I was in wreck. I survived.
I'm getting better.

00:43:57.202 --> 00:43:58.135
It's all you need to know.

00:43:58.147 --> 00:43:59.802
Well. there's something
else I need to know.

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.704
Why didn't you just stay dead?

00:44:01.706 --> 00:44:03.706
What are you talking about?

00:44:03.708 --> 00:44:06.376
Your line of work
you see a lot of death.

00:44:06.378 --> 00:44:08.244
There's nothing more final.

00:44:08.246 --> 00:44:11.347
and yet here you are.

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:13.916
- I don't know. I got lucky I guess.
- Lucky?

00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:16.786
Lucky is finding
a four-leaf clover.

00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:19.322
You were pronounced dead after
three minutes without a pulse.

00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:22.325
You have to do a lot better
than lucky here. Frank.

00:44:22.327 --> 00:44:23.760
I don't know why
I didn't stay dead.

00:44:23.762 --> 00:44:25.294
You're the doctor. you tell me.

00:44:25.296 --> 00:44:28.097
I can't give you the answers
until I know the questions.

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:29.699
I got a question.

00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:31.334
Yeah. I got a couple
of damn good questions.

00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:33.236
Where's the epiphany?
What's the meaning of life?

00:44:33.238 --> 00:44:35.171
'Cause I tell ya. Doc.
all I got out of that night

00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:37.440
was a wrecked motorcycle.
the mother of all migraines.

00:44:37.442 --> 00:44:38.941
and a nurse
who can't cook for shit.

00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:40.810
You don't need an epiphany

00:44:40.812 --> 00:44:42.111
or to know the meaning of life.

00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:44.113
Maybe you survived the accident

00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:45.915
to find the meaning
of your life.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.821
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time over there.

00:44:51.823 --> 00:44:54.991
Just. you know. checking in
every now and then.

00:44:54.993 --> 00:44:56.993
A few grocery runs. that's all.

00:44:56.995 --> 00:44:58.995
You be careful. Kitty.

00:44:58.997 --> 00:45:02.799
The world of a cop is a...
crazy place.

00:45:02.801 --> 00:45:04.801
So I like to keep things

00:45:04.803 --> 00:45:08.137
nice and simple around here.

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:10.373
Distractions are not welcome.

00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:13.276
and they won't be tolerated.
Clear?

00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:16.312
I can assure you. Sergeant.

00:45:16.314 --> 00:45:17.780
there is nothing to worry about.

00:45:17.782 --> 00:45:19.315
Arrogant.

00:45:19.317 --> 00:45:24.020
stubborn. ego-driven bachelors
are not my thing.

00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:26.389
Well. good.

00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:27.890
We're good then.

00:45:27.892 --> 00:45:29.892
Hey.

00:45:32.197 --> 00:45:34.997
John. yes.

00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:36.466
It's good to see you. my friend.

00:45:36.468 --> 00:45:38.468
Hey. good to see you.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.471
John Foster.
U.S. customs.

00:45:41.473 --> 00:45:44.006
Kitty Carlisle. new secretary.

00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:46.442
- Nice to meet you. John.
- Nice to meet you.

00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:48.911
Now. should I file these now.
or would you like me to come back later?

00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:50.146
Oh. no. no. no.

00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:52.014
There are no secrets
between John and I.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:54.150
- We're old buddies.
- Okay.

00:45:54.152 --> 00:45:56.185
- Sit down. John.
- Thank you. thank you.

00:45:57.822 --> 00:46:01.090
Well. John. been a long time.
What's new?

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:04.861
Well. I have a little request
a little out of the ordinary.

00:46:04.863 --> 00:46:06.896
but it is what it is.

00:46:06.898 --> 00:46:09.332
Well. got my attention.

00:46:09.334 --> 00:46:11.200
Thank you.

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:14.504
So my wife has this friend.
and she has a son named Michael.

00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:18.341
He has this obsession with
the television series "CHiPS."

00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:22.979
We are well aware
of that around here.

00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:25.515
Our motorcycle guys think
they deserve a raise

00:46:25.517 --> 00:46:27.550
because of that damn show.

00:46:27.552 --> 00:46:29.952
I bet. I bet.

00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:31.821
So I was hoping maybe.
you know. he could come over

00:46:31.823 --> 00:46:34.090
and see the department.
meet some of the guys.

00:46:34.092 --> 00:46:35.992
and see the motorcycles.

00:46:35.994 --> 00:46:37.193
Sure. sure.

00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:39.195
I think we can handle that.

00:46:39.197 --> 00:46:41.164
Why don't you give Kitty
a call next week

00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:42.365
and we'll set it up.

00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:44.100
Well. that's the problem.

00:46:44.102 --> 00:46:46.169
See. Michael. he has leukemia.

00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:48.437
and he's not expected
to live more than a week.

00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:51.240
Oh. my God.

00:46:51.242 --> 00:46:53.276
- Poor kid.
- Yeah.

00:46:53.278 --> 00:46:56.479
So. if you could maybe
assign a motor officer

00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:59.348
to show him around and help
with the "CHiPS" thing.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.950
Frank should do it.

00:47:00.952 --> 00:47:02.985
Uh. sorry to interrupt.

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:04.587
but I think Frank should do it.

00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:06.155
Who's Frank?

00:47:06.157 --> 00:47:07.990
Yeah. he's one
of our motor officers.

00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:09.926
He was in a big wreck
a couple of months ago.

00:47:09.928 --> 00:47:11.928
He's not in the best of health

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.496
to be dealing
with someone like that.

00:47:13.498 --> 00:47:16.232
- Frank can handle it.
- I was talking about the kid.

00:47:16.234 --> 00:47:18.401
They've both hit hard times.

00:47:18.403 --> 00:47:21.337
Maybe they can find
some common ground there.

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:24.006
Is this about Frank
or is this about Michael?

00:47:25.877 --> 00:47:27.577
Maybe both.

00:47:27.579 --> 00:47:29.378
You think he'd even wanna do it?

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.130
No way. not a chance.

00:47:31.131 --> 00:47:32.881
What the hell am I supposed
to say to a a sick kid?

00:47:32.884 --> 00:47:34.283
Whatever you would say
to a healthy one.

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:36.285
Is this Eddie's idea
of getting me back to work?

00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:38.387
- I told him you would do it.
- You volunteered me.

00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:40.623
Why the hell would you do that?

00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:42.158
What's the big deal?

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.926
You hang out with the kid
for a few hours.

00:47:43.928 --> 00:47:45.228
show him your motorcycle.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:47.864
maybe make a few
age-appropriate jokes.

00:47:47.866 --> 00:47:49.432
What are you so afraid of?

00:47:49.434 --> 00:47:50.633
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:47:50.635 --> 00:47:52.168
Then what is it. tough guy?

00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:56.505
Forget it.
I'm not doing it.

00:47:56.507 --> 00:47:59.542
You know. that's a shame.

00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:01.444
'cause I was really
hoping that Michael

00:48:01.446 --> 00:48:03.145
could have
a father figure around

00:48:03.147 --> 00:48:04.981
the last week
of his life. but...

00:48:04.983 --> 00:48:06.515
I guess not.

00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:09.518
I'll find someone else.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.020
Someone strong.

00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:14.957
Someone like... Tom Wells.

00:48:20.899 --> 00:48:22.465
Wait.

00:48:25.503 --> 00:48:27.503
Kitty.

00:48:32.677 --> 00:48:34.677
Kitty.

00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:44.086
What'd you mean
by father figure?

00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:46.355
Well. Michael's
parents split up.

00:48:46.357 --> 00:48:47.924
His mom and him moved here.

00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:49.926
and his dad is
still in Illinois.

00:48:49.928 --> 00:48:51.527
But you're probably right.

00:48:51.529 --> 00:48:53.996
I mean. what do you know
about his life?

00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:03.072
I'll do it.

00:49:36.441 --> 00:49:39.241
Can he walk?
Do we need to help him out of the car?

00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:41.177
Maybe we should get a wheelchair.
Do you need anything?

00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:42.478
Maybe some Valium for you.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.146
Relax for God's sake.

00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:46.082
You're giving me a headache
on top of this migraine.

00:49:46.084 --> 00:49:47.450
Which I didn't know
was possible until now.

00:49:47.452 --> 00:49:50.553
So just shut up.

00:49:50.555 --> 00:49:52.555
Well. that's a negative
on the wheelchair.

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:55.691
Hi. I'm Michael.

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:57.727
- You want some gum?
- Sure.

00:49:57.729 --> 00:49:59.295
Thanks. Michael.
I'm Officer Frank.

00:49:59.297 --> 00:50:00.629
How would you like to...

00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:02.665
- Whoa!
- Sit on the motorcycle?

00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:05.067
Hi. I'm Marcy.
Michael's mom.

00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:06.335
Officer Frank Shankwitz.

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.537
Thank you so much
for doing this.

00:50:08.539 --> 00:50:11.374
I haven't seen him this happy
and excited in a very long time.

00:50:11.376 --> 00:50:13.709
Well. I haven't seen anyone this
happy to be surrounded by cops.

00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:15.211
All his friends
are into superheroes.

00:50:15.213 --> 00:50:17.680
but Michael worships you guys.

00:50:17.682 --> 00:50:20.182
Yeah. well.
we're just regular heroes.

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:21.684
Whoa!

00:50:21.686 --> 00:50:23.586
Those are rad.

00:50:23.588 --> 00:50:25.621
Yes. yes. they are.

00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:27.456
You can touch it if you like.

00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:32.028
Wanna check out the station?

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.629
We have something for you.

00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:38.401
- Sharp.
- Hey. hey.

00:50:38.403 --> 00:50:40.269
Real trooper now.

00:50:40.271 --> 00:50:42.271
Whoa.

00:51:00.625 --> 00:51:01.472
Ooh.

00:51:01.484 --> 00:51:04.060
Ladies and gentlemen.
can I have you attention?

00:51:04.062 --> 00:51:05.628
I have a special announcement.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.398
It's important that I find
Officer Michael Allen.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.400
That's me!

00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:14.336
He's about. oh. this high.
blond hair.

00:51:14.338 --> 00:51:16.739
Loves to chew bubble gum.

00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:17.730
I'm here.

00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:20.743
I have these special
awards to present to him.

00:51:20.745 --> 00:51:23.245
It doesn't seem like he's here.

00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:25.614
Uh. he must be on duty.

00:51:25.616 --> 00:51:27.316
Frank. have you seen him?

00:51:27.318 --> 00:51:29.118
No. haven't seen him. Eddie.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.721
- I'm over here!
- Did I hear something?

00:51:32.723 --> 00:51:37.226
Officer Michael Allen reporting for duty.

00:51:37.228 --> 00:51:39.662
Well. why didn't you say so?

00:51:39.664 --> 00:51:42.198
I have these for you.

00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:48.504
And every police officer
has their own badge.

00:51:48.506 --> 00:51:51.540
So I'm real police officer now?

00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:55.444
Well. that is exactly
what you are.

00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:56.745
Look. Mom. check it out.

00:51:58.516 --> 00:52:00.449
Can I have a word with you.
Frank. real quick?

00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:03.185
Yeah.

00:52:05.356 --> 00:52:08.557
When you're done here.
you need to head over to Internal Affairs.

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:11.260
- They need to talk to you.
- What do they wanna talk about?

00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:15.297
Whole bunch of stuff.

00:52:19.237 --> 00:52:21.337
- Bullhead.
- What about it?

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:23.439
Just need to ask you a few
questions about that night.

00:52:23.441 --> 00:52:25.774
Well. everything is in my
report. nothing's changed.

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:27.910
We've been contacted
by the suspect's lawyer.

00:52:27.912 --> 00:52:29.812
Just wanna make sure
we have all the facts.

00:52:29.814 --> 00:52:31.747
We just wanna know what happened.
Nothing to worry about.

00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:34.216
I'm not worried.
Fire away.

00:52:34.218 --> 00:52:36.252
Well. according to your report.

00:52:36.254 --> 00:52:38.254
Officer Wells picked up
your Kel-Lite

00:52:38.256 --> 00:52:39.522
when he arrived at the scene.

00:52:39.524 --> 00:52:41.390
Mm. What about it?

00:52:41.392 --> 00:52:43.893
Well. did you hand him the light
or assist in the attack

00:52:43.895 --> 00:52:45.394
on the male suspect in any way?

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:47.396
Did I hand him the light?

00:52:47.398 --> 00:52:49.265
You guys met Tom Wells?

00:52:49.267 --> 00:52:50.666
Could you please just
answer the question?

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:53.936
No. I did not hand my Kel-Lite
to Tom Wells.

00:52:56.174 --> 00:52:58.908
Is there a problem?

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:00.709
According to the suspects.

00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:02.478
when he regained consciousness.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.481
you were standing over him
holding a Kel-Lite.

00:53:05.483 --> 00:53:08.250
That light was covered in blood
and issued to you.

00:53:08.252 --> 00:53:10.419
Could you explain that?

00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:11.754
Doesn't look good. Frank.

00:53:11.756 --> 00:53:14.456
You know what looks worse?

00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:17.927
Is a crazy son of a bitch smashing
in the skull of a handcuffed drunk.

00:53:17.929 --> 00:53:19.862
Calm down. Frank.
we're just asking questions

00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:22.231
based on the reports and statements
that were filed for this incident.

00:53:22.233 --> 00:53:24.233
Here's a statement for ya.

00:53:24.235 --> 00:53:25.801
I restrained Tom Wells.

00:53:25.803 --> 00:53:27.670
Relieved him of my Kel-Lite.

00:53:27.672 --> 00:53:30.339
Which is the only reason
this is a brutality charge

00:53:30.341 --> 00:53:31.807
and not a damn murder case!

00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:58.801
Hey.

00:53:58.803 --> 00:54:00.803
There are three rules at work.

00:54:00.805 --> 00:54:03.973
Keep your head down. keep your mouth
shut. and keep smiling.

00:54:03.975 --> 00:54:05.975
- You got that?
- Okay. Mom.

00:54:33.471 --> 00:54:36.505
Goddamn it. Mr. Baxter.

00:54:36.507 --> 00:54:37.973
Creeping up on me like that.

00:54:37.975 --> 00:54:39.508
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.511
I was just admiring
your presentation.

00:54:42.513 --> 00:54:45.281
The bed.
Pristine.

00:54:45.283 --> 00:54:47.283
Yeah. of course it is.
I did it.

00:54:47.285 --> 00:54:50.286
Tell me. Lorraine.
you like working here?

00:54:50.288 --> 00:54:51.620
Sure.

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:53.789
I mean. it ain't exactly
The Ritz but...

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:57.760
And you appreciate the opportunity
I've given to you and your boy?

00:54:57.762 --> 00:55:00.763
We appreciate it.
Why?

00:55:02.767 --> 00:55:05.934
Why don't you show me how much?

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.607
No. Mr. Baxter!

00:55:17.748 --> 00:55:19.748
Get back here!

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.351
You're done in this town!

00:55:22.353 --> 00:55:24.353
You hear me. you whore?

00:55:24.355 --> 00:55:26.355
Oh. You okay. ma'am?

00:55:28.392 --> 00:55:30.392
Who did this to you?

00:55:34.699 --> 00:55:36.699
Mr. Baxter.

00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:43.739
Go on home. ma'am.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.488
Okay. okay. I need two more meatloafs.

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.890
And where's my sausage and eggs?

00:56:01.892 --> 00:56:05.394
I think somebody's gonna get
fired today. huh?

00:56:05.396 --> 00:56:07.129
How about you. gringito. huh?

00:56:07.131 --> 00:56:09.098
- You wanna get fired today?
- No. sir.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.934
What is this? Huh?

00:56:11.936 --> 00:56:13.869
You can't even
clean the pot. huh?

00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:15.137
Maybe your cook should learn
to cook.

00:56:15.139 --> 00:56:17.840
- Hey. what did you say?
- What did you say?

00:56:17.842 --> 00:56:20.476
Everything's clean.
Go on. check.

00:56:20.478 --> 00:56:22.544
The meatloaf was overcooked.
so it stuck to the pan.

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:24.947
The problem is the cooking.
not the cleaning.

00:56:24.949 --> 00:56:28.517
Jose. our diner said
the meatloaf's burnt

00:56:28.519 --> 00:56:30.819
and he's not paying for it.

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:34.590
- You're burning my food?
- Jose.

00:56:34.592 --> 00:56:36.592
- Yeah. you're burning my food.
- No. Jose.

00:56:36.594 --> 00:56:38.827
You're costing me money. You're
throwing my money away. cabrón.

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:41.530
You know what? Both of you get out.
You're fired.

00:56:41.532 --> 00:56:42.865
Both of you.
Vamonos vamonos.

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.660
You okay?

00:57:17.701 --> 00:57:19.701
Have a seat.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.573
What's your name?

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:30.512
Frank.

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:32.514
I'm Juan.

00:57:32.516 --> 00:57:35.517
People around here
call me... Juan.

00:57:37.988 --> 00:57:40.022
What happened to you?

00:57:40.024 --> 00:57:43.025
Doesn't matter.

00:57:43.027 --> 00:57:45.060
My mom's gonna kill me.

00:57:45.062 --> 00:57:47.529
What are you doing out so late?

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:50.232
I just finished work.

00:57:50.234 --> 00:57:52.501
Where do you work?

00:57:53.537 --> 00:57:56.538
I'm a dishwasher.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.674
I was a dishwasher at El Torro.

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:02.711
No. No. no. no. no.

00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:04.713
That is not a diner.

00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:07.716
This is a diner.

00:58:07.718 --> 00:58:09.818
It's the Snow Cap.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.954
I built it
with my own two hands.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.990
That's good for you.

00:58:14.992 --> 00:58:17.993
Well. maybe good for you. too.

00:58:19.763 --> 00:58:20.963
How?

00:58:20.965 --> 00:58:23.966
Summer's around the corner.

00:58:23.968 --> 00:58:27.035
I can use an extra pair
of hands.

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:29.071
Really?

00:58:29.073 --> 00:58:31.673
There's one condition. though.

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:33.242
What?

00:58:33.244 --> 00:58:35.878
You have to be able
to tell a joke.

00:58:43.754 --> 00:58:45.787
A priest and a rabbi walk
into a bar.

00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:48.790
All right. okay.

00:58:48.792 --> 00:58:50.092
You start tomorrow. pancho.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:02.204
Wow!

00:59:02.206 --> 00:59:04.873
Look. Mom. it's "CHiPS."

00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:18.086
Thank you. Charlie.

00:59:22.126 --> 00:59:24.192
Wow! Is that for me?

00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:26.795
Well. you are Trooper
Michael Allen. aren't you?

00:59:26.797 --> 00:59:28.797
Oh. not... not out here. honey.

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:32.067
Take it inside.

00:59:33.671 --> 00:59:35.270
Wow. he's a bundle of energy.

00:59:35.272 --> 00:59:37.272
Yeah. reminds me of my
first day at the academy.

00:59:37.274 --> 00:59:39.007
More like last week.

00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:40.809
- Oh. yeah. you're new?
- Mm.

00:59:40.811 --> 00:59:42.044
Hasn't been easy.
Frank's been busting my chops.

00:59:42.046 --> 00:59:43.946
We do that for all the rookies.

00:59:43.948 --> 00:59:45.948
Don't worry.
I'll be easier on Michael.

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.349
Oh. you don't need to do that.

00:59:47.351 --> 00:59:48.750
He can handle it.

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:52.888
He's the real deal.

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:54.289
Look at that.

00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:56.091
Yeah. when Michael is
feeling well enough.

00:59:56.093 --> 00:59:57.292
he takes his motorcycle
down the street

00:59:57.294 --> 00:59:59.127
and puts tickets on all the cars

00:59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.696
that are parked on the curb.

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.364
Maybe we should've parked
in the driveway.

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:03.899
He's a cop through and through.
isn't he?

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.771
Can I sit on the motorcycle?

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.374
10-4. Officer.
Come on.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:13.875
Pick you up.
All right.

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.877
One. two. three.
Oh. you're heavy.

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:17.879
Oh. yeah.

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:22.384
Hello. Arizona.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:26.388
This is Officer Michael Allen
reporting for duty.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.256
Good morning.
Officer Michael.

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:30.258
I am marking you 10-8.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:35.897
Do all police officers
get wings?

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:38.367
No. These are special.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:40.235
Custom made just
for motorcycle cops.

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:43.138
I've got a highway
patrol motorcycle.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.373
and I'm a real cop.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.041
Well. let me see what I can do.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:48.176
- Really?
- I'm not making any promises.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.412
but I promise.

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:51.947
Promise promise?

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.051
Come with me.

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:58.053
There's only one way
to make a promise official.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:00.055
That's a cowboy's
binding contract.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.790
What's that?

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.392
You stand on that
side of the fence.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:05.394
I stand on this side.

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:08.397
and now we shake hands.

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:11.266
I promise you.
I'll get you your wings.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.268
Thank you. Officer Frank.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.738
Do you wanna be a police officer

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.776
More than anything in the world?

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.083
I wish I didn't have to die.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.389
That already happened
to me once.

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:36.058
Really?

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.163
What was it like?

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:44.332
It was peaceful.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:47.335
Nothing to feel scared
or sad about.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:51.940
But why did you come back?

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:55.977
'Cause I had something
important to do.

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:57.979
What?

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.015
Help you.

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:02.451
You don't have to do that.
Officer Frank.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:04.453
Why not?

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:08.156
People always feel sorry for me

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:11.026
and they wanna help me.

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:14.162
But you don't have to help me.
Officer Frank.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.201
Maybe you're helping me.

01:02:22.773 --> 01:02:25.841
These are the reports and statements
from the Bullhead incident.

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:29.511
Officer Tom Wells. Sergeant
Mason. the two suspects.

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.179
This one's yours.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:33.949
It's the only one
that's pure fabrication.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.951
What the hell you talking about?

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:38.286
- Let me see these.
- By all means.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:39.921
All four are consistent.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.157
The same chain of events.
the same story.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.458
All except yours.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.026
Are you crazy?

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:47.028
Well. this... this is bullshit!

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.296
Every goddamn word!

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.532
I'm gonna advise you
to be really careful

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.167
with your choice of words.

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.369
It's pretty conclusive. Frank.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:57.205
They're trying to set me up.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:58.473
You can't see that?

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.175
Our investigation is complete.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.377
We're gonna submit our findings
to the commander.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.082
That concludes our meeting.

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:11.086
Goddamn it!

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.088
You know. you should
probably leave now.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.090
Before we have to
have you removed.

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:20.362
Uh. I'm gonna have
to let you go.

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:21.997
There's somebody here to see me

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.999
and apparently it can't wait.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.234
Yeah. bye.
I'll get back.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:29.237
Well. you wanna talk
or you wanna take a leak?

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.039
You spoken to Mason
or Tom Wells?

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.308
Not today.
What's going on?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.043
Bullhead.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:36.812
They're screwing me. Eddie.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:39.314
Internal Affairs
wants my badge and gun.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:40.982
You shitting me?

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.551
All right. all right.
now calm down.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:44.352
Calm down!

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.988
Sit.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.324
All right. let's have it.

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:58.366
We've got a...
You wanted to see me. Sarge?

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:01.069
Yes. Kitty. please. sit down.

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.604
Sit tight. Frank.

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.105
This involves you. too.

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:05.473
What does?

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:08.910
Look. I don't know
what's going on

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:11.613
between you two.
but what I do know is

01:04:11.615 --> 01:04:13.915
I'm about to make it
a lot easier.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.451
Wait. what is this?

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:19.554
Kitty. a position just opened up
down in Tucson.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:21.590
and I'm recommending you
for transfer.

01:04:21.592 --> 01:04:23.291
It's better money.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.026
and it's a great opportunity.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.095
Look. Eddie. there's nothing
going on between us.

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:30.131
Kitty. you leave next month.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.300
Frank. I'll talk to Mason.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:34.269
Go.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.904
Yes?

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.639
No. I can wait.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.482
So you gonna take the transfer?

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.351
Eddie wasn't asking.

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:50.919
It's a good thing.

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.921
I mean. I could use the money.

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:54.256
It works out for you. too.

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:56.958
I mean. I know I annoy you.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.962
So now. you don't have
to see my face every day.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.163
Frank.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:40.135
Look. that was Michael's doctor.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.937
He's in a coma.

01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:44.172
Here.

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:49.377
Go!

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:15.430
Michael?

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:24.606
Am I real motorcycle cop now?

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:34.115
Yes. you are.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:39.754
And I'm your partner.

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:47.295
Oh. Michael.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.098
Come on.

01:07:56.773 --> 01:07:58.773
Thank you.

01:08:57.868 --> 01:08:59.634
Mason. it's Frank.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:00.902
We need to talk.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.904
Hello?

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:15.383
- Precinct.
- Yeah. Kathy. it's Frank.

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:17.218
- Get me Tom Wells.
- He just walked by.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.220
- One second.
- Yeah. I'll hold.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.224
- Sorry. Frank. he's not here.
- What?

01:09:23.226 --> 01:09:26.227
You just said he was there.

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:35.503
- Frank Shankwitz?
- Who wants to know?

01:09:36.873 --> 01:09:38.773
I got something for you.
You've been served.

01:09:38.775 --> 01:09:40.241
What?

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:41.843
By who?

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.845
You want the shirt off my back?

01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:46.848
Get off my property before I
arrest you for trespassing!

01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:58.960
Where is he?
Mason!

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:03.665
Oh. Frank. Frank!

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.533
Frank! Frank. no.
What are you doing?

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.535
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.937
Looks like a subpoena.

01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:10.438
Now get your filthy
hands off me.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440
- Get 'em off of me now!
- Frank.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.309
- Now!
- Get your hands off him.

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:15.777
- Come here.
- I've been framed

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:17.645
for what happened in Bullhead

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.747
and now I'm being sued
for a million bucks

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:22.483
and this piece of shit
is doing nothing about it.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.652
He's throwing me to the dogs.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.454
You better start talking. Mason.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:28.456
Sure. Eddie. I'll talk.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.959
Frank. you're
under investigation

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:33.328
for using excessive force
on a suspect.

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:36.431
That same suspect is suing you

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:38.900
for a violation
of his civil rights.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:43.271
And this department cannot
and will not help you.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:47.275
Now. both of you assholes
get out of my office.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:49.944
Get out of my office now.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:59.854
Hey. Frank.
How are ya?

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:01.723
Can you talk for a sec?
Come here.

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:04.726
- Tom.
- Wanna talk to you for a second. cowboy.

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:07.729
Haven't seen you around
much lately.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.297
You're not taking my calls.

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:11.499
- Yeah.
- But now you wanna talk.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.935
Sure. Let's talk.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.937
This is nice and public.
Plenty of witnesses.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.438
You're sure you wanna help
this asshole?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.440
- Help me?
- Hey! Frank. Frank. Frank.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.542
- Stop it. come on.
- What the hell is he talking about?

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:23.544
Look.
Hey. look at me.

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:26.481
Do what I say

01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:28.549
and avoid this
termination. okay?

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:31.019
- Go to hell. Mason.
- Frank. just hear me out.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.654
Your record is impeccable.

01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:35.023
You're completely clean
with a shitload of awards.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:38.326
So making a deal with these guys right
now. it's a walk in the park.

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:40.728
- Come on.
- I get it.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.765
I take one for the team
and this prick walks.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:46.467
How the fuck is
that a good deal for me?

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.303
Stop. Frank.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.738
I'm gonna recommend suspension
without pay. I know.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.041
But it's the only way
these guys will play ball.

01:11:53.043 --> 01:11:54.542
Come on.

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:55.843
I know it's a blemish
on your record.

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:57.912
This way the termination
will go away.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:00.948
you maintain your job.
and you're back to it before you know it.

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:03.651
- Come on. man.
- It's either this or termination. Frank.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.653
It's your call.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.522
I say I keep my job

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:10.024
and you two go screw
yourselves and each other.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:12.560
Whatever you want. It's your funeral. pal.
We're just trying to help ya.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.762
Frank. now listen to me.
I want you to hear me out one more time.

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.364
You're finished.
You're an idiot

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:18.099
and you're finished.
Get out of my sight.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.500
Get out of my sight.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:23.571
What's your next play?

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:28.576
Get a lawyer or get a new job.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:30.378
Do you know any lawyers?

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.380
None I can afford.

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:35.116
Used up all my sick days
after the accident.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:36.551
I'm cleaned out.

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:37.885
I might be able to help you out.

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:39.520
I don't want your money.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:40.855
No. that's not what I...

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.590
Oh. but if you need
a little I can...

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:44.425
I said I don't want
your damn money.

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:45.660
Well. I might know a lawyer.

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:46.894
Might know is
not much good to me.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.996
He's a buddy of mine.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:49.670
Oh.

01:12:49.682 --> 01:12:51.733
I've known him my whole life.
He's the smartest guy I know.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:53.501
He's a buddy of yours.
he can't be that smart.

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:55.503
What is his name?

01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:56.904
- James Fisher.
- Mm.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:59.006
He's a junior
at a law firm in Phoenix.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:00.908
Money won't be a problem.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.877
In fact. he'd probably pay you
just to get his first case.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.879
His first case?

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:10.017
You have a better idea?

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.054
Get him on the phone.

01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:22.663
Okay. listen up. everybody.

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:27.602
In two days Michael Allen
is being buried in Illinois.

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:30.505
And I'm sending Frank and Mitch
as our representatives

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:33.908
to honor Michael
as an Arizona trooper.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.910
Not a good idea. Eddie.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.478
You got something to say. Mason?

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.130
Frank's suspended.

01:13:39.131 --> 01:13:40.781
It doesn't look good if he's
the best we got. you know.

01:13:40.784 --> 01:13:41.983
Well. guess what?

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:43.918
I don't give a shit
what it looks like.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.187
He's still a cop
and he's still going.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.990
Who are you kidding. Eddie?
He's on borrowed time.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:51.125
Look. if you want. we can step
into my office

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.127
and discuss it after this.

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:54.595
But for now

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.832
I'd like you guys
to pass the hat around

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.200
and anything you can donate

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:02.737
we would really appreciate it.

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:07.074
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:09.076
And thank you.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.913
Of course. we don't expect
you to give anything

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:15.483
because we all know
you got deep pockets.

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:17.518
but you got short arms.

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:23.191
Thanks. folks.
I'll be here all week.

01:14:46.883 --> 01:14:48.249
Morning. gentlemen.

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:50.117
Frank Shankwitz.
Arizona Highway Patrol.

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:51.719
Randy Jackson.
Illinois State Police.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:53.921
- Mitch Myers.
- Joe Garcia. Chicago Police.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:56.190
Thanks for coming today.
gentlemen.

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.493
Listen. we read about this
in the newspaper

01:14:58.495 --> 01:15:00.761
and we felt obligated.
We need to be here with you.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:02.663
It means a lot that you did.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.665
I could tell ya it'd mean
the world to this young man.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.067
We're just proud
to be a part of it.

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:07.902
So are we.

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.271
And if Michael were here.
he'd shake both your hands.

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.039
offer you a piece of gum.
and ask for a ride

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.401
- in your patrol car.
- I think we'd probably give it to him.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.278
Thanks.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:27.088
Frank.

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:29.590
I'm so glad you could make it.

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:36.163
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:38.900
Thank you so much
for everything.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:45.039
Ready?

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:16.671
So long. partner.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.893
Thank you.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.634
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:44.058
Frankie.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.327
What are you doing?

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:49.296
I'm hungry. Juan.

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:50.765
I'm so hungry.

01:17:50.767 --> 01:17:54.001
Well. I'll go make you
something.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.837
Listen to me. you work here now.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.707
that means you eat here now.

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:02.376
And real food. not garbage.
you understand?

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:05.980
I wanna help you.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:08.015
And it's okay for you
to accept my help.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:11.852
'cause when people need help
you give it to them.

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:16.824
But how?
I'm just a kid.

01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:20.027
You're not just anything.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:23.197
You're Frank Shankwitz.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.933
And you could help people.

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:33.274
Remember. if someone needs help

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:36.077
you give it to them.

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:38.079
Hmm?

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:39.847
Yeah.

01:19:57.326 --> 01:19:59.794
Frank!

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:01.562
Honey! What happened?

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.264
What broke?

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:05.266
Frank. have you lost
your marbles again?

01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:08.202
I'm looking for that
magnifying glass.

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:09.937
We have a magnifying glass?

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.317
I think I found my son.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.025
Department of Public Safety.

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:33.160
Good morning.
this is Frank Shankwitz.

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:34.595
Frank. it's Kitty.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:36.497
Why are you introducing
yourself? It's weird.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.299
Well. just being polite.

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:40.301
Well. that's a first.

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:42.603
I think we have our
wires crossed here.

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:45.072
Uh. my name is Frank Shankwitz.

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:50.144
and I believe that my son Frank
Shankwitz. Jr is a police officer there.

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:52.213
Why. yes. of course.
I'm so sorry.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.582
Frank is one of our highway
patrol officers.

01:20:54.584 --> 01:20:56.417
Um. he's actually not here
right now.

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:57.618
He's in Illinois.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.053
Well. that's why I'm calling.

01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:00.254
See. I live in Chicago

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:01.622
and I read in the paper

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:03.858
about this little boy
and it said

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.126
that Frank was gonna be
at his funeral today.

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.128
In Kewanee.

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.931
Yeah. he's... he's actually
there right now.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:12.366
You know what?

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.635
Why don't I take down
your address

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:17.371
and phone number and I will
pass them along to him.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.293
He should be checking in
with us some time today.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.409
Thank you. Kitty.

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:24.111
Thank you.

01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:25.579
Can I ask you something?

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:27.114
Anything.

01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:30.618
What's he like?

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:57.945
Good afternoon.

01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:59.647
Is it?

01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:03.550
Uh. James Fisher.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:05.019
We spoke on the phone.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.221
You must be Clover.

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:09.223
Last time I checked.

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:15.162
Are you coming in or what?

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:21.068
Will I need my attorney here
or...

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.404
No. that won't be necessary.

01:22:23.406 --> 01:22:25.072
All I need is your account

01:22:25.074 --> 01:22:27.408
of the night you were arrested
up at Bullhead.

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:29.944
I went over all this
with the cops.

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:33.280
This won't take long.
I... I promise.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:37.318
I was out drinking
with my boyfriend.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.353
We smoked a little pot.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:42.056
He passed out
on the way home and...

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:44.058
I had some fun with the cops.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:47.161
And what happened
when you were pulled over?

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:50.297
I got into a fight with
a cop and got arrested.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.498
So what?

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.501
So what... what did he look like?

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:59.039
Big guy. dressed like a cop.

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:03.310
Can you be more specific?

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.312
Height. weight.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.649
Yeah. yeah. uh. maybe 6'2. 6'3.

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.517
weighed about 220.

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:14.722
And what happened
to your boyfriend?

01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:18.425
Apparently he was beaten
so badly. he almost died.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:22.563
Another pig turned up and beat
Ziggy with a flashlight.

01:23:22.565 --> 01:23:24.999
Can you describe that officer?

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:27.501
Shorter.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:31.438
About 5'8. 150. 160 pounds.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.676
Black hair.
little psycho weasel.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.678
You know his name by any chance?

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.681
The name was Fred or something.

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:43.684
Frank?

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.686
Yeah. Frank.

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:47.287
And a funny last name.

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:51.291
I wanna say...
Sandwich?

01:23:52.294 --> 01:23:54.328
Maybe I'm just hungry.

01:23:54.330 --> 01:23:56.163
Shankwitz?

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:58.165
Yes.

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:01.101
Frank Shankwitz.
Do you know him?

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:03.437
Uh. I've heard of him.

01:24:03.439 --> 01:24:05.039
How do you know
that was his name?

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:06.640
Another cop told me.

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:09.476
Police sergeant came here
to the house a few weeks ago.

01:24:09.478 --> 01:24:12.212
He was there. too.
that night up at Bullhead.

01:24:14.517 --> 01:24:15.783
What's so funny?

01:24:16.819 --> 01:24:18.819
Oh. nothing.

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:21.488
Uh. the... the police officer

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.458
that arrested you.
what color hair did he have?

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.561
Brown hair. brown moustache.

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:29.129
Do you know his name?

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:32.433
I don't know.

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:34.468
Who cares? You know.
it's the little shit

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.703
you need to lock up.

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:39.440
So. to clarify.

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:43.410
the police officer who beat
and nearly killed your boyfriend

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:47.281
was about 5'8. black hair.
no moustache

01:24:47.283 --> 01:24:50.551
and his name was
Frank Shankwitz.

01:24:50.553 --> 01:24:53.087
Is there an echo in here?

01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:55.089
Yes! Yes!

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:01.395
That's the cop who arrested us.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.166
That's him.

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:08.669
He beat Ziggy's ass.

01:25:11.874 --> 01:25:14.308
Would you be willing to sign
this as testimony against him?

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:16.276
Hell. yeah!

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:18.278
Got a pen?

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.481
Yeah.

01:25:20.483 --> 01:25:22.483
Okay.

01:25:28.591 --> 01:25:30.824
So what's going on
with you and Kitty?

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.193
Nothing.

01:25:33.195 --> 01:25:34.595
She's moving to Tucson.

01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:38.765
Is it true Eddie let her go
because you two were...

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:40.200
you know?

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:41.635
Who told you that?

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:43.637
Everyone in the department.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:45.606
Yeah. well everyone
in the department is wrong.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:47.608
She got a promotion.
end of story.

01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:52.613
So why'd you drag me
out here then?

01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:54.615
What is this place?

01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:57.818
It's nothing.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.554
It's nothing good.

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:03.190
Well. why don't we go
back to the hotel?

01:26:03.192 --> 01:26:05.526
We should check back in
with the department.

01:26:05.528 --> 01:26:07.194
Confirm our flights
for tomorrow.

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:09.196
We know what time
we're flying out.

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:11.365
A few beers
and a bottle of scotch.

01:26:11.367 --> 01:26:12.599
That's what I'm doing tonight.

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:15.202
I would actually like
to see Chicago.

01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:16.803
It's my first time up here.

01:26:16.805 --> 01:26:19.640
- How about you?
- I was born in Chicago.

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.375
No way.

01:26:21.377 --> 01:26:23.877
Then you can show me
around. huh?

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:27.347
I really don't feel like doing the
whole tourist thing tonight. Mitch.

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:29.516
If it's not a bar.
I don't wanna know about it.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:32.819
Wait. how did you end up
in Arizona?

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:35.822
My mother had a thing
for cowboys.

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:39.293
Where do you call home?

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:41.328
My home's in Arizona.

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:44.331
And my heart's still here.

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:01.748
I failed you. Frank.

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.218
You're 11 years old

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.221
and you make more money than me.

01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:08.989
I just keep letting you down.

01:27:08.991 --> 01:27:10.958
Why don't we go back to Chicago?

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.359
Dad can help.

01:27:12.361 --> 01:27:15.362
He'll look after us.

01:27:17.533 --> 01:27:19.533
No. he can't.

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:22.636
Do you remember
your father's sister?

01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:24.638
Auntie Linda.

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:30.544
I got this letter from her
a few weeks ago.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:34.248
Your father found us.

01:27:36.352 --> 01:27:37.851
Dad found us?

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:39.386
He's coming here?

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:47.861
He was driving down here

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:51.865
and it was raining hard

01:27:51.867 --> 01:27:55.869
and he got into an accident.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:58.872
He didn't make it.

01:28:00.909 --> 01:28:03.910
I'm so sorry.

01:28:07.816 --> 01:28:11.818
Look. I want you
to live with Juan now.

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.987
You'll have a much better life

01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:15.856
without me around
to mess things up.

01:28:15.858 --> 01:28:18.625
I promise you.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.627
I promise.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:26.633
You're gonna be fine.

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:46.853
You okay?

01:28:48.724 --> 01:28:50.724
Just drive.
Just drive.

01:28:50.726 --> 01:28:52.726
Just drive.

01:29:46.682 --> 01:29:48.682
It's okay.

01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:50.684
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.774
- Frank?
- Mitch.

01:30:13.776 --> 01:30:15.642
Kitty. Where's Frank?

01:30:15.644 --> 01:30:17.677
- At the bar.
- Go get him.

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.679
- No way
- Why not?

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:21.882
- He's drinking.
- So?

01:30:23.652 --> 01:30:26.686
Imagine trying to take a ham
sandwich from a hobo.

01:30:26.688 --> 01:30:28.922
Tell him it's urgent
police business.

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:31.158
It's urgent police business.

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.859
My suspension hearing
is pending.

01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:35.762
Not my problem.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.664
Suspension hearing pending.
not his problem.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.099
Stubborn son of a bitch.

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:40.801
I'm just telling you
what he said!

01:30:40.803 --> 01:30:42.202
Not you. him.

01:30:42.204 --> 01:30:43.970
Oh.

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:45.939
Look. can't this wait?
Like. what is so important?

01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:50.510
Mitch. I need you to get a pen
and write down this address.

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:52.045
- And I need you to make sure...
- Hey.

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:54.181
That Frank gets there tonight.

01:30:54.183 --> 01:30:55.715
Wait. what's at this address?

01:30:55.717 --> 01:30:57.451
You will see when you get there.

01:30:57.453 --> 01:30:59.453
Hey. why the big secret?
He's not gonna go anywhere

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:00.821
unless I tell him
where we're going.

01:31:00.823 --> 01:31:04.825
Tell him he has to go.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:06.593
His life depends on it.

01:31:06.595 --> 01:31:08.595
You ready to go?

01:31:08.597 --> 01:31:09.963
Go where?

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.965
The best goddamn bar in Chicago.

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:14.968
Got the address right here.

01:31:19.208 --> 01:31:21.107
It's a house.

01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:24.110
Well. this is the right address.

01:31:24.112 --> 01:31:27.113
Maybe bars are different
in Chicago.

01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:29.115
Where'd you get that?

01:31:30.919 --> 01:31:32.519
Kitty.

01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:33.854
Kitty?

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:35.722
How does she know
the best bar in Chicago?

01:31:35.724 --> 01:31:38.725
She just told us
we had to come here.

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:44.030
Waste of time dragging me
all the way out here.

01:31:44.032 --> 01:31:45.499
I'm heading back.

01:31:45.501 --> 01:31:47.734
Your life depends on it.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:56.710
What'd you just say?

01:31:56.712 --> 01:31:59.846
Kitty told me to say that.

01:32:03.886 --> 01:32:06.887
Whatever this place is.
they better have good scotch.

01:32:09.658 --> 01:32:11.525
Why'd you listen to her anyway?

01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:12.859
She'll be in Tucson
this time next week.

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:15.595
You know that?
Damn filly is leaving us.

01:32:16.632 --> 01:32:18.899
Come on. open up!

01:32:19.935 --> 01:32:22.769
We want scotch!

01:32:47.563 --> 01:32:49.563
Frankie?

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:28.668
Why didn't you ever come
find me?

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:32.639
I gotta show you something.

01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:42.882
Here you are.
Look.

01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:45.885
For years I tried everything.

01:33:45.887 --> 01:33:48.888
Every...
Everything at my disposal.

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:52.792
The police and the private
investigators. newspapers.

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:56.796
It's just like you and your mother
fell off the face of the earth.

01:33:56.798 --> 01:33:59.165
And I couldn't find you.

01:33:59.167 --> 01:34:03.303
Arizona?

01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:06.172
I am so sorry.

01:34:08.043 --> 01:34:13.880
I stayed in Chicago in case
you would try and find me.

01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:19.786
Mom told me you died
in a car crash.

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:23.056
What?

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.266
Damn that woman.

01:34:37.673 --> 01:34:40.807
She took you away from me.

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:45.845
Now a little boy named Michael

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:49.349
brought me back to you.

01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:51.351
Yeah.

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:54.754
How'd you get so big?

01:34:54.756 --> 01:34:56.423
Chocolate.

01:34:56.425 --> 01:34:59.426
Chocolate.

01:34:59.428 --> 01:35:02.328
Chocolate.

01:35:05.367 --> 01:35:07.267
I have something for you.

01:35:14.242 --> 01:35:17.844
You know from... from now on

01:35:17.846 --> 01:35:20.246
I'll always be with you. son.

01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:31.891
You always were. Pop.

01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:36.029
Hmm?

01:35:51.046 --> 01:35:53.046
The prodigal son has returned.

01:35:53.048 --> 01:35:54.514
Good to see ya. Mitchy.

01:35:54.516 --> 01:35:56.382
Good to see you.

01:35:56.384 --> 01:35:58.384
- Come on through. buddy.
- Thanks.

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.523
Frank?

01:36:03.525 --> 01:36:05.058
James Fisher. this is Frank...

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.392
No need for the formalities.

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:08.394
James. it's a pleasure.
Take a seat.

01:36:08.396 --> 01:36:10.396
Can I get you anything to drink?

01:36:10.398 --> 01:36:11.831
Cigar?

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:14.467
Uh. maybe later.

01:36:14.469 --> 01:36:18.104
So. what'd she say?

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:21.107
Well. Frank. it's like this.

01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:23.109
That night up at Bullhead

01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:26.146
unless you were 5'8 with
black hair and no moustache.

01:36:26.148 --> 01:36:29.549
I'd say you're in the clear.

01:36:33.054 --> 01:36:35.088
Good job!

01:36:37.058 --> 01:36:39.025
I could kiss ya!

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:40.360
Maybe I'll just take that drink.

01:36:57.412 --> 01:36:59.412
Two questions.

01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:01.815
Why aren't you in Tucson?

01:37:01.817 --> 01:37:04.918
And how the hell
did you get in my house?

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.220
Make me a drink
and I'll tell you.

01:37:07.222 --> 01:37:10.356
Maybe I'll just put you
in cuffs.

01:37:10.358 --> 01:37:13.159
Are you arresting me. Officer?

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:14.360
On what charge?

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:17.897
Breaking and entering.

01:37:17.899 --> 01:37:21.501
Okay. well that would be the
illegal entry into a building

01:37:21.503 --> 01:37:23.603
with the purpose
of committing an offense.

01:37:23.605 --> 01:37:25.238
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.174
But see. I haven't
committed an offense.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.210
- Yet.
- Mm.

01:37:30.212 --> 01:37:33.146
Trespassing on private property?

01:37:33.148 --> 01:37:36.182
The honor of this property
actually gave me key.

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:37.984
- Back when I was his nurse.
- Oh.

01:37:37.986 --> 01:37:41.187
So. you'll have
to take it up with him.

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:44.991
Well. I mean.
perhaps you could persuade him

01:37:44.993 --> 01:37:46.626
to drop the charges.

01:37:46.628 --> 01:37:48.628
Hmm.

01:37:55.136 --> 01:37:57.570
Yeah.

01:37:57.572 --> 01:37:59.873
The answer is yes. by the way.

01:37:59.875 --> 01:38:01.174
What's the question?

01:38:01.176 --> 01:38:03.309
Do you wanna stay the night?

01:38:03.311 --> 01:38:05.879
Hey. uh. do you wanna
stay the night?

01:38:05.881 --> 01:38:08.281
No thanks.

01:38:10.318 --> 01:38:12.151
I'm not that kinda girl.

01:38:17.425 --> 01:38:19.425
I'm not going to Tucson.

01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:23.162
Why not?

01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:25.198
I'm not going anywhere.

01:38:46.554 --> 01:38:48.488
Come on. come on. come on.
come on.

01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:54.427
Hey. come on.
Go. go. go. move. move. move.

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:56.996
You stupid loser.

01:38:56.998 --> 01:38:58.231
What did you say?

01:38:58.233 --> 01:38:59.999
What did you say to me?

01:39:02.203 --> 01:39:04.270
Oh. hey. Mason.

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:08.074
Congratulations
on your early retirement. huh.

01:39:08.076 --> 01:39:10.710
Screw you. Eddie.

01:39:10.712 --> 01:39:13.212
Let's give him
a round of applause. boys.

01:39:19.054 --> 01:39:22.021
Thank you for all being here
tonight.

01:39:22.023 --> 01:39:25.224
After what has been a very
difficult year for all of us.

01:39:25.226 --> 01:39:27.026
it's nice to come together

01:39:27.028 --> 01:39:31.664
to honor someone's years
of good service.

01:39:31.666 --> 01:39:35.535
We're here to celebrate
not only Frank's promotion.

01:39:35.537 --> 01:39:40.206
but to welcome him back
after clearing his good name.

01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:44.744
So. um. without further adieu.
I think we need to hear

01:39:44.746 --> 01:39:50.516
from the man of the hour.
Detective Frank Shankwitz.

01:39:50.518 --> 01:39:52.986
- Here's to you. Frank.
- Well. I'd like to say to that.

01:39:52.988 --> 01:39:54.721
- thank you. Sarge.
- Mm-hmm.

01:39:54.723 --> 01:39:58.224
Now. it's nice to think
that you're all here for me.

01:39:58.226 --> 01:40:01.995
But then I remembered
it's an open bar. so...

01:40:01.997 --> 01:40:05.231
Now I'm not a man for speeches.
but I got the floor.

01:40:05.233 --> 01:40:07.533
so I might as well
say something.

01:40:07.535 --> 01:40:13.439
Now. I've been a fighter
all my life.

01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:18.044
And I'm tired of not knowing
what to fight for.

01:40:20.048 --> 01:40:22.682
Ever since I was a kid.
I've always been on my own.

01:40:24.452 --> 01:40:29.522
You know. I never had any reason
to care about anyone else.

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:32.625
Until now.

01:40:32.627 --> 01:40:35.795
But now I'm at a crossroads
in my life.

01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:37.797
and I'm choosing which path
to take.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.503
This year. I met a young man

01:40:43.505 --> 01:40:48.241
who taught me what it is
to be brave.

01:40:48.243 --> 01:40:50.343
And I was not expecting that.

01:40:54.182 --> 01:40:58.584
Being special to someone
was never something that. uh.

01:40:58.586 --> 01:41:02.388
I was used to.

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:04.824
But Michael.

01:41:04.826 --> 01:41:07.126
well. Michael thought
I was a hero.

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:13.633
Now. if I can do it.
anyone can be a hero.

01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:20.173
I'm looking for a new path.

01:41:20.175 --> 01:41:22.775
A new path of hope.

01:41:22.777 --> 01:41:26.712
dreams. and everything
that's good in this world.

01:41:30.752 --> 01:41:34.654
A great man once told me
that if somebody needs help.

01:41:34.656 --> 01:41:36.689
give it to them.

01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:40.159
Now. I never thought
that I could make a difference.

01:41:40.161 --> 01:41:41.561
I was wrong.

01:41:41.563 --> 01:41:44.163
I've seen it.

01:41:44.165 --> 01:41:48.367
A simple act of kindness
can have a ripple effect.

01:41:48.369 --> 01:41:50.303
And we helped Michael.

01:41:50.305 --> 01:41:53.840
And now. with your support.
we can help other kids

01:41:53.842 --> 01:41:58.244
all over the world.
one wish at a time.

01:41:58.246 --> 01:42:00.346
'Cause I'm starting
a non-profit.

01:42:00.348 --> 01:42:03.483
What? Now... now. wa...
Are you quitting. Frank?

01:42:03.485 --> 01:42:05.551
You shitting me?
I just made detective.

01:42:05.553 --> 01:42:07.453
Well. good.

01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:10.490
I just found something new
to fight for.

01:42:10.492 --> 01:42:12.358
Here is my idea.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.561
We create a foundation
that acts like a kinda genie.

01:42:15.563 --> 01:42:18.631
We find other kids like Michael.

01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:23.469
They tell us their wish
and we make them come true.

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:25.771
Now. even if it's just
for one day.

01:42:25.773 --> 01:42:30.343
I'll be damned if we don't
give them a day of their lives.

01:42:30.345 --> 01:42:33.346
Now. according to Arizona
corporation commission.

01:42:33.348 --> 01:42:36.749
we need five members
to make this happen.

01:42:36.751 --> 01:42:39.719
That's my signature at the top.

01:42:39.721 --> 01:42:41.254
Who's with me?

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:50.764
Who's that?

01:42:54.202 --> 01:42:56.302
Oh. my.

01:42:56.304 --> 01:42:57.603
No.

01:42:57.605 --> 01:42:59.539
Come here.

01:43:02.544 --> 01:43:04.343
Wow.

01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:06.679
So. what are you gonna call it?

01:43:26.234 --> 01:43:27.633
Bye-bye.

01:43:27.635 --> 01:43:30.836
Hello? Uh. yes.
can you just give me one minute?

01:43:30.838 --> 01:43:33.339
Hello? Yes.

01:43:33.341 --> 01:43:35.274
Go.
Yeah. uh-huh.

01:43:35.276 --> 01:43:37.030
Yeah. we will be right with
you. absolutely.

01:43:39.948 --> 01:43:43.683
Frank Shankwitz. go ahead.

01:43:43.685 --> 01:43:45.384
Make a wish.
