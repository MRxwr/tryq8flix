[narrator]<i> Every possession by
a demon occurs during three stages.</i>

4
00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:49.248
<i>The first is called
the Presence.</i>

5
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.687
<i>This is when a demon or entity begins
to make its presence known to the host.</i>

6
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.724
<i>The second stage
is called the Affliction.</i>

7
00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:05.431
<i>when the entity begins to possess
and inhabit the body of its host.</i>

8
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:10.102
<i>Taking over all control of their physical.
mental and spiritual ability.</i>

9
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:18.138
<i>The infected begins to feel dirty.
like a pungent force taking over.</i>

10
00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:27.186
<i>But the demon cannot fully infect and
take over a person until the third stage.</i>

11
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.459
<i>It's when the person has finally
surrendered and consents to the demon</i>

12
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.128
<i>as being a part of their soul.</i>

13
00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.699
<i>Which is known as the Assent.</i>

Two hundred miles of interstate
and not a goddamn car in sight.

19
00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.769
Why do they build roads
if no one's gonna use 'em?

20
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.571
Hi. Rhonda.

21
00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:27.739
And don't you be
paintin' on my time!

22
00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:28.741
I'm not.

23
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:29.942
It's a sculpture.

24
00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:32.744
Painting. sculpture...
same damn thing.

25
00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.379
Still my dime!

26
00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.320
Here. Forty bucks.

27
00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:42.754
Now scoot!

28
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:45.891
For the whole day?

29
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.493
You see any goddamn
customers here?

30
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.264
Thanks. Rhonda.

31
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:54.900
So. tomorrow?

32
00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.636
Ten o'clock! I'm gonna sleep in.

33
00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:01.406
I should. uh. probably get home.
Mason's with a babysitter.

34
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.909
And clean up your
shit before you go!

35
00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:21.727
Hey. pal.

36
00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.962
Daddy. Daddy! Look. I can fly!

37
00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.999
Yeah. I can see! Be careful. though.
We don't want you flyin' away.

38
00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.602
Aww! [giggling]

39
00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.205
Did you get me anything?

40
00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:36.286
From work? Uh. no. But I can make you
somethin'. if you want. What do you want?

41
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.845
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:41.346
[Mason laughing]

43
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:44.983
Cassie! I'm home!

44
00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.486
Hey. Mr. Clarke. How was work?

45
00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:48.854
Yeah. well. it was good.

46
00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:51.423
Now. play with your toys
while I talk to Cassie. Okay?

47
00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.425
Okay.

48
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:57.863
Alright. listen. What did I tell you about
lettin' him play outside on his own?

49
00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:00.032
Oh. he's fine!
He's a big boy now.

50
00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:04.036
He's a smart kid. and he's
perfectly fine being left alone.

51
00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:07.739
I'm his dad. I just don't...
I think I know what's best for him.

52
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:08.741
Okay.

53
00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:12.544
Uh. okay. how much do I...

54
00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.314
Uh. $40 for the sitting
and $8 for the groceries.

55
00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:18.517
Groceries are $8?

56
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.319
Single portion for
Mason. like always.

57
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.654
But it was spaghetti and
meatballs tonight. so...

58
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.523
Look. I've probably got
some more money upstairs.

59
00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.258
Uh. Mr. Clarke.
don't. It's fine.

60
00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.992
- Don't worry about it.
- No. no-no-no-no. I can't let you do that.

61
00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:29.726
Consider it my treat. okay?

62
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.496
- Thank you. Cassie.
- Of course.

63
00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.734
Before you go. uh. I
need you to. um. do the...

64
00:05:36.704 --> 00:05:37.803
thing.

65
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.905
Uh...

66
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:46.978
- Need you to...
- Oh. yeah.

67
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.817
- Thank you.
- Okay. Of course. Mr. Clarke.

68
00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.520
Don't let the food
get cold. Okay?

69
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.990
Bye. Mason. I'll see
you next time. Okay?

70
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:00.625
Alright. pal. let's
get washed up.

71
00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.094
Now your girlfriend's gone...

72
00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.500
Thank you. Lord. for this
meal we're about to eat.

73
00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:11.403
Bless this food through
Christ our Lord.

74
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:12.504
Amen.

75
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:16.075
What was that?

76
00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.110
It's a prayer!

77
00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:21.079
Cassie taught me how
to pray before you eat.

78
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.516
She said. God gave us food
and we must thank him.

79
00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.018
I'm the one who puts
the food on the table. pal.

80
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.856
- So do I have to pray to you?
- No.

81
00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:32.291
I'm your dad.

82
00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:33.732
I take care of you.
That's what I do.

83
00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.828
Daddy. what are you making?

84
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.798
I don't know.

85
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.785
That's the thing about art. pal.

86
00:06:42.786 --> 00:06:45.771
Sometimes it comes to you much later.
and you just keep tinkering 'til it does.

87
00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:47.939
Can I be an artist one day?

88
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:50.142
If you want. You can be
whatever you want to be.

89
00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:51.743
But you have to eat
your dinner first.

90
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.747
- Aren't you going to eat?
- Yes. After you.

91
00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:59.918
But you need to eat if you're
gonna grow up all big and strong.

92
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.088
Well. you have to eat your dinner
if you are gonna be big and strong.

93
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.856
I'm already big and strong.

94
00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:06.992
Yes. I am already
big and strong!

95
00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:11.129
If you want to be strong like me.
you have to eat that dinner.

96
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.598
So. eat your meatballs!

97
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.702
Where are those muscles?! Where
are those muscles? Come on!

98
00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:23.542
Aah-aah! No. not Mason! The
meanest man in town! Ow...

99
00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:25.110
He's so big!

100
00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:40.992
Good night. pal. I love you.

101
00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:44.129
- I love you too. Dad.
- Hmm.

102
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:46.231
<i>Whooo! My name is Camper.</i>

103
00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.099
And I love you too. Camper.

104
00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:51.203
Camper loves you too.

105
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:01.947
And I miss you.

[calling cat with kisses]

114
00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.343
Good cat.

[man on radio]<i> We're talking
about schizophrenia here. folks.</i>

116

<i>Seeing things. hallucinations!</i>

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.299
<i>That's what the
prison records say.</i>

118
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:11.670
<i>But yet Father Lambert
Bowman is released today.</i>

119
00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:14.873
<i>only three years from the death
of five-year-old Edward Martin.</i>

<i>It's not just a case of a failed
exorcism. it's negligence.</i>

[crowd screaming]

125
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.964
Father Lambert!

126
00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:44.302
Father Lambert. are you
taking any interviews?

131
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:10.495

What do you think of this whole debacle?</i>

- Turn that thing off!

137

So...

138
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:30.749
Are we all set?

139
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.317
Down to the last detail.

140
00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.886
The Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith

141
00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:38.256
issued an indefinite suspension
of your clerical duties.

142
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.226
Typical.

143
00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:44.195
With the public uproar.
distancing yourself is probably the wisest?

144
00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:46.030
Have you heard
from the Martin family?

145
00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:52.403
Involuntary restraining order
against you from the State.

146
00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:54.139
Hmh!

147
00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:55.907
I got everything you asked for.

148
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.777
But this is dangerous
if the Diocese finds out.

149
00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.979
Even though it
is not your fault.

150
00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.182
It's not fault.

151
00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:05.350
I feel.

152
00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:16.094
[Dr. Maya] Have you still
been seeing these things?

153
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:19.197
The figures you were
telling me about last time?

154
00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.568
Joel?

155
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.903
Sorry.

156
00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.538
Um...

157
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.474
Still have them sometimes.
It's been better since the medication.

158
00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.111
Plus. see I uh... I
found a new way...

159
00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:37.315
- New way?
- Yeah. This is. uh...

160
00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.083
it's my boss's old camera.

161
00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:40.952
I've been borrowing
it. and when I...

162
00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.922
see something I'm
not sure is real. I...

163
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.493
Picture helps me
tell the difference.

164
00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.461
That's a creative way
to combat schizophrenia.

165
00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:55.834
It's important we learn to identify
what is real and what isn't.

166
00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:59.904
This'll look good on
your custody report.

167
00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:02.507
Now... do you have
something for me?

168
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.579
I have receipts.

169
00:14:07.581 --> 00:14:09.447
Days she worked.
proof of payment.

170
00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.540
Very good.

171
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:21.225
This is our proof to the A.S.F.A. of
your ability to take care of your son.

172
00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:24.295
Plus. your cooperation
with the medication.

173
00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.130
And how's the job
hunting coming along?

174
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.033
I'm still at Rhonda's.

175
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.270
Joel...

176
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.875
Rhonda's isn't a job.

177
00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:40.545
You're not getting benefits.
and you're paid below minimum wage.

178
00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:43.732
I'm managing fine.

179
00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:46.017
The house is paid for by Mason's
mum before she died. I'm...

180
00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:47.118
You're living day-to-day.

181
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.556
You need to start planning and
thinking more about the future.

182
00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.058
Longer terms.

183
00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:56.895
- We talked about this.
- I know. I know.

184
00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:04.202
This is how people
take advantage of you.

185
00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:10.675
You need to learn to start making
better choices for yourself.

186
00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:28.059
Uh. please. uh. come in.
Uh... make yourself at home.

187
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:29.360
[Father Lambert] Did
you bring the tapes?

188
00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:30.662
Oh! Yeah.

189
00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:40.305
Um. I haven't had a chance
to organize them all. bu...

190
00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:41.639
Let's get started.

191
00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:44.943
It's gonna be a long night.

192
00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:54.585
Mason! Time for dinner!

193
00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:59.057
Mason!

194
00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:04.162
[Mason whispering] My daddy
will be here any minute.

195
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.970
He's waiting downstairs.

196
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.273
Mason?

197
00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.409
I'm going to sleep soon.

198
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.578
No. I can't play.

199
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.580
No. I can't play.

200
00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:25.416
Why don't you come back later?

201
00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:27.318
He won't be angry.

202
00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:32.290
Shhh! Don't make him angry.

203
00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:41.132
[thunder rumbling lightly]

204
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:13.398
He's waiting there.

205
00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:17.402
Who's waiting there. buddy?

206
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:22.240
The man that looks like a
goat and walks like a dog.

207
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.689
Hey!

208
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.092
Your money's on the table.

209
00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:45.663
Finish up in the front. and uh. don't
forget to lock the door on your way out!

210
00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.099
Thanks. Rhonda.

211
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:49.367
[slamming door]

212
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:20.264
[phone calling]

213
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:29.357
[Dr. Maya]<i> Hello?</i>

214
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.118
Doctor Maya. I uh. I
have a question for you.

215
00:18:31.511 --> 00:18:33.711
<i>- Joel?</i>
- Yeah. is schizophrenia hereditary?

216
00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:36.230
<i>Joel.</i>

217
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:37.747
<i>- Please make an appointment if you have any questions.</i>
- I know. I know.

218
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.318
It's just. um.
just one question.

219
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.487
It's. it's important.

220
00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.822
Please.

221
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:51.496
<i>It's hard to say. Joel.
Schizophrenia does have a genetic compound.</i>

222
00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:53.397
<i>Is this about Mason?</i>

223
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.900
No.

224
00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:13.651
- Daddy. Daddy!
- Hey! Ahhh. there he is! Hey. look at me.

225
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.653
Look at me.

226
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.288
- I just wanna see...
- Daddy. stop!

227
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.222
Okay.

228
00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:19.624
- Okay.
- [doing dishes]

229
00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:20.758
Where's your girlfriend?

230
00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:23.928
That smells amazing.
What is it?

231
00:19:25.899 --> 00:19:28.166
Uh. roast chicken.

232
00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:33.671
I decided today that we're going
to actually eat a proper meal.

233
00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.189
All of us.

234
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.706
Cassie. I told you
single portions.

235
00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:37.675
This one's on me.

236
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.477
Just give me the
$40 for the day.

237
00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:53.558
Mr. Clarke. I have something
I need to talk to you about.

238
00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:59.714
Yeah?

239
00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:02.700
I. I got accepted
into a university.

240
00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.902
On. on full scholarship.

241
00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:07.271
That's great! Which one?

242
00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:09.340
Vanderton?

243
00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:13.611
In Philadelphia.

244
00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.252
I'm gonna get my degree
for. for teaching.

245
00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:16.881
Philadelphia?

246
00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:18.749
That means...

247
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:21.285
I can't babysit anymore.

248
00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:24.872
- Cassie!
- I'm sorry. Mr. Clarke.

249
00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:28.458
I'm... you knew that I was waiting on an acceptance.
and that I took this job in the meantime.

250
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:32.230
I can't find another babysitter.
I-I-I don't make enough.

251
00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:34.699
I figured we'd keep doing this.
until I-I find a better job.

252
00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:36.834
I-I can't keep doing
this forever. too.

253
00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:40.571
I mean. you know I've always
wanted to go to college.

254
00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:45.509
If I don't have a babysitter. or a real
income. the state's gonna take Mason away.

255
00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:49.814
When do you leave?

256
00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.250
In a few days.

257
00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:58.656
It's a new town and all. so even though school
doesn't start for a couple of months. I need time

258
00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:00.524
to settle in and...

259
00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:01.692
So. your last day?

260
00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:03.629
Today.

261
00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:09.834
It's the weekend. so you'll
be with him anyway. Right?

262
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.405
This is so sudden.

263
00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:15.473
I'm so sorry.

264
00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:16.941
No. you're not!

265
00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.676
You don't get to say that!

266
00:21:18.678 --> 00:21:24.282
You're just like everybody else. You leave as
soon as soon as something better comes along.

267
00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:27.818
You act like you care.
but you don't care.

268
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.289
- You don't...
- Yeah. you don't care!

269
00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:35.860
Never should have trusted you.

270
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.261
Why don't you go upstairs to
play. and I'll come and get you.

271
00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:56.847
[whispering]

272
00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:19.403
[turning tap off]

273
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.820
Kitty!

274
00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:37.555
[thunder rumbling]

275
00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:42.693
Kitty? [whistling]

276
00:22:51.637 --> 00:22:52.670
Weird.

277
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.446
[door closing]

278
00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:08.552
Last one.

279
00:23:15.661 --> 00:23:16.961
Let me see it.

280
00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:28.406
[demon speaking Latin]

281
00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.650
<i>In manuum figuli?</i>

282
00:23:40.887 --> 00:23:42.887
Are you familiar
with those words?

283
00:23:43.723 --> 00:23:48.559
Not in any. uh. religious text.

284
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:50.161
You think it means something?

285
00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:52.663
I think it's the lead
to our next victim.

286
00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:57.134
You know demons leave
traces of their hunger.

287
00:23:58.204 --> 00:24:00.171
Do we have any
grammar resources?

288
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:03.507
In the next room. top shelf.

289
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:15.085
Daddy! Can you come
play with me tonight?

290
00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:16.487
Yeah. give me a minute.

291
00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:20.791
[stumbling and hitting]

292
00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:34.638
Mason?

293
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.107
Did you do this?

294
00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:40.144
He keeps moving it.

295
00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:42.547
Who does?

296
00:24:43.483 --> 00:24:45.683
The man with ugly faces.

297
00:24:54.093 --> 00:24:55.593
There's nothing there. pal.

298
00:24:56.863 --> 00:24:58.095
He's in there.

299
00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:06.070
Mason. do you know what this is?

300
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:10.324
This is a camera.

301
00:25:10.325 --> 00:25:12.976
And what it does is it shows
us what's really there.

302
00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:17.248
So. we're gonna take a
picture of your cupboard.

303
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.284
And then it's gonna show us there's
nothing to be afraid of. Okay?

304
00:25:21.654 --> 00:25:24.522
So point the camera.

305
00:25:24.524 --> 00:25:26.023
And then press the button.

306
00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:30.961
There we go.

307
00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:32.997
You see?

308
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.735
No? You wanna do another one?

309
00:25:37.737 --> 00:25:38.737
Go on.

310
00:25:38.738 --> 00:25:39.870
Point.

311
00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:53.617
There we go. Do you see?

312
00:25:54.554 --> 00:25:56.153
Nothing to be scared of.

313
00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:59.323
Can I sleep with you tonight?

314
00:26:01.027 --> 00:26:02.927
Yeah. pal. Of course you can.

315
00:26:05.131 --> 00:26:08.933
Do people who are schizophrenic
see the same things?

316
00:26:08.935 --> 00:26:10.701
Like what?

317
00:26:10.703 --> 00:26:12.002
Dark figures.

318
00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:13.804
Black figures.

319
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.575
Shadows are a thing
that many people see.

320
00:26:17.577 --> 00:26:22.212
Now. if we're talking about hearing
the same words or voices. then it's

321
00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:23.247
a different story.

322
00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:27.435
But highly unlikely.

323
00:26:27.436 --> 00:26:30.688
But if you see these figures.
it means you're schizophrenic. right?

324
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.674
Not necessarily.

325
00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:36.659
Alzheimer's. Parkinson's. dementia.
Charles Bonnet syndrome...

326
00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:38.862
Or even just the
trick of the eye.

327
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:45.970
Am I missing something? Where are the
babysitter's receipts for yesterday?

328
00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:48.239
She left.

329
00:26:49.308 --> 00:26:50.874
Going to university.

330
00:26:51.711 --> 00:26:53.644
- Still looking for a new one.
- Joel.

331
00:26:54.347 --> 00:26:57.214
Mason needs a babysitter.
You cannot leave him by himself.

332
00:26:57.216 --> 00:26:58.649
I don't.

333
00:26:58.651 --> 00:26:59.817
I'm staying at home with him.

334
00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:01.285
No.

335
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:03.954
He needs someone who has
a proper tutoring certification.

336
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:05.889
Or get him into a day
care before kindergarten.

337
00:27:05.891 --> 00:27:08.225
You know I can't afford that.

338
00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:11.362
Look. I will find a new
babysitter. Okay?

339
00:27:11.364 --> 00:27:14.064
She just... she dropped
it on me so suddenly.

340
00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:18.736
I'm sure it won't take long. I
just. I just can't do it today.

341
00:27:18.738 --> 00:27:20.738
You know? I can't do it now.

342
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.674
But Mason's fine. I don't. I
don't take my eyes off him.

343
00:27:23.676 --> 00:27:26.276
Is that why he's waiting
outside in the reception area?

344
00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:29.880
We're going to the
library after this.

345
00:27:29.882 --> 00:27:31.715
He's. uh.

346
00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:33.684
He's already
read all his books.

347
00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:36.253
He's a very smart boy.

348
00:27:36.255 --> 00:27:37.255
Joel...

349
00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:42.693
You're gonna need to find a babysitter
and tutor as fast as possible.

350
00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:44.061
I'm trying.

351
00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:47.931
All I want is what's
best for you.

352
00:27:54.874 --> 00:27:56.073
You have one week.

353
00:27:56.075 --> 00:28:00.778
I'm gonna go by to your house next
week and check up on you over there.

354
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.780
instead of having
our sessions here.

355
00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:06.817
Thanks.

356
00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:12.256
- Daddy!
- Hey. pal! Hey.

357
00:28:12.258 --> 00:28:13.957
Ahh!

358
00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:15.793
Who are you talking to?

359
00:28:15.795 --> 00:28:18.028
Someone who thinks
they can help us.

360
00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:26.003
Dad. could you help me read?
I don't feel like it today.

361
00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:27.905
In a minute. pal.
Just let me finish this.

362
00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:32.176
Why are you painting
the eye blue?

363
00:28:32.178 --> 00:28:33.210
It's a talisman.

364
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:36.480
Or an even eye!

365
00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:39.817
Ancient Mesopotamians thought
it protected us from bad luck.

366
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.320
Why are you putting
it in Camper?

367
00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:46.123
So that Camper can protect you.

368
00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:48.025
But you protect me.

369
00:28:48.027 --> 00:28:49.359
Mummy too.

370
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.864
Mason. mummy isn't here.

371
00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:55.299
But I see her.

372
00:29:00.139 --> 00:29:04.341
Mummy's in a much
more special place now.

373
00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:07.311
She's right here.

374
00:29:07.313 --> 00:29:08.345
With me.

375
00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:11.315
And I'll never leave you.

376
00:29:12.318 --> 00:29:15.185
'Cause in the end. it's
us against the world.

377
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:18.122
And...

378
00:29:18.124 --> 00:29:19.490
Camper!

379
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.093
He gets to sleep
with me tonight.

380
00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:24.995
Yes. he does! Like every night.

381
00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:27.264
Oi! Haven't finished
your nuggets.

382
00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:29.667
- Oi.
- [Mason laughing]

383
00:29:29.668 --> 00:29:32.069
I'm coming to get you!
I'm coming to get you!

384
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:36.840
And here we gooooo!

385
00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:38.809
And go to bed!
Go to bed. go to bed.

386
00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:44.148
Daddy. can you come
sleep with me tonight?

387
00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:03.433
Mason...

388
00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:04.802
Mason!

389
00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:07.004
Where'd you get this?

390
00:30:07.006 --> 00:30:08.539
Wasn't me. Daddy.

391
00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:11.041
You know you're not supposed
to touch things in Daddy's room.

392
00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:12.576
But I didn't do it.

393
00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:14.244
Promise.

394
00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:20.585
[knocking on door]

395
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.424
Hi. Father.

396
00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:29.959
Hey. Cassie! What
are you doing here?

397
00:30:29.962 --> 00:30:34.598
Uh. I stopped by your parish. but Susan says
you haven't been around for a few days. and...

398
00:30:35.601 --> 00:30:37.868
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

399
00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:40.604
Sure.

400
00:30:40.606 --> 00:30:41.839
Come in.

401
00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:47.344
- Would you. uh. like some coffee?
- Please.

402
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.614
Uh...

403
00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:51.982
something...

404
00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:56.119
something weird happened.

405
00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:57.387
Last night. with...

406
00:30:57.389 --> 00:31:04.389
Joel. the guy whose son I've been
babysitting for almost two years now.

407
00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:05.929
The mechanic.

408
00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:08.065
[exhaling]

409
00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:15.472
I told him I was going to college.
and that I couldn't look after Mason anymore.

410
00:31:15.474 --> 00:31:19.643
And I... I knew he wasn't gonna be happy
about it. but he sort of blew up at me.

411
00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:23.146
Mason did too.

412
00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:28.285
It was like they
were growling at me.

413
00:31:29.989 --> 00:31:31.455
It was dark.

414
00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:32.623
It wasn't...

415
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:38.061
Normal. I mean. I... I don't even. I don't
even know if I was just hearing things

416
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:40.530
in the heat of the
moment. Or-or people...

417
00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:44.902
people blow up and... and get angry. right?
But this was different.

418
00:31:44.904 --> 00:31:47.170
I felt something.

419
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.375
Like the room went dark.

420
00:31:52.912 --> 00:31:55.612
I was just spooked out all day.

421
00:31:57.516 --> 00:32:00.584
And as I was walked out.
I sensed something.

422
00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:03.687
You know. in your sermon a
couple weeks ago. you were

423
00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:08.425
talking about how The Devil
makes itself... you know.

424
00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:15.265
Oh.

425
00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:17.434
This is Father Lambert.

426
00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:19.569
The Diocese asked
me to look after him...

427
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:21.638
Who is this person
that you mentioned?

428
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.140
...for the time being.

429
00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:24.207
Joel.

430
00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:30.681
Joel Clarke is the father.
and Mason is his son.

431
00:32:30.683 --> 00:32:34.952
He's a Brit that married a
local girl. Sarah Howland.

432
00:32:34.954 --> 00:32:36.620
She died in a car crash.

433
00:32:36.622 --> 00:32:39.156
Joel never really moved on.

434
00:32:39.158 --> 00:32:42.693
Since then. he's been socially isolated.
not active in the church...

435
00:32:42.695 --> 00:32:44.962
Not active anywhere.

436
00:32:44.964 --> 00:32:47.965
If he's not at the shop. then
he's at home. making his...

437
00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:50.701
weird sculptures.

438
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.709
Look. the whole thing just sort
of threw me off. okay? It was...

439
00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:04.314
it was scary. and I. I'm
scared for Mason too.

440
00:33:05.184 --> 00:33:06.544
Could you maybe
go check on them...

441
00:33:07.453 --> 00:33:08.285
for me?

442
00:33:08.287 --> 00:33:12.322
Father Lambert and I
will go see him tomorrow.

443
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:14.758
Thanks. Father.

444
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.994
Do you think...

445
00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:20.497
<i>In manuum figuli.</i>

446
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:23.100
In the hands of the potter.

447
00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:27.371
He's a sculptor.
creator with his hands.

448
00:33:27.373 --> 00:33:30.107
And he was
Abaddon's last words.

449
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.652
[thunder cracking]

450
00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:49.092
[whispering]

451
00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:55.365
Mommy!

452
00:34:13.118 --> 00:34:15.318
[whispers grow louder]

453
00:35:16.415 --> 00:35:17.514
[door moving]

454
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.447
[whispering]<i> Joel</i>.

455
00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:13.630
Mason?

456
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.550
Mason!

457
00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:31.808
The cosmic Lord of Death
seeks a new battleground.

458
00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:35.945
Abaddon awaits.

459
00:38:41.687 --> 00:38:43.620
Let me handle it
when we get there.

460
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.956
I sense we're getting close.

461
00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:49.592
Close? Like you can feel it?

462
00:38:50.996 --> 00:38:55.465
When one comes close to such
evil. part of the soul withers

463
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:58.902
from such contact with the
opposite of humanness.

464
00:38:58.904 --> 00:39:02.672
The essence of evil has
attached itself within me.

465
00:39:03.742 --> 00:39:05.342
No rest for the wicked.

466
00:39:21.126 --> 00:39:23.493
Hey. Hey. look...

467
00:39:25.964 --> 00:39:27.497
That creep.

468
00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:29.566
It's that fuckin'
child killer. isn't it?

469
00:39:51.623 --> 00:39:52.989
[whispering]

470
00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:10.640
It's the house. but I
don't see an entrance.

471
00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:14.811
Let's try around back.

472
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:40.104
Hello!

473
00:40:41.473 --> 00:40:42.705
Anybody home?

474
00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:46.643
[knocking on door]

475
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480
[father] Hello!

476
00:41:04.463 --> 00:41:07.864
Hello? Anybody home?

477
00:41:09.034 --> 00:41:10.467
Hello?

478
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.138
Doesn't look like
anybody's here.

479
00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:20.109
[whispering]

480
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.520
It's him! He's hurt.

481
00:41:31.756 --> 00:41:32.789
Do it!

482
00:41:50.075 --> 00:41:53.142
We found the pills
in your pocket.

483
00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:54.277
Ugh!

484
00:41:56.982 --> 00:41:58.702
Who are you? What are
you doin' in my house?

485
00:42:00.652 --> 00:42:01.784
Ugh...

486
00:42:02.754 --> 00:42:03.887
Mason.

487
00:42:03.889 --> 00:42:05.121
Easy now.

488
00:42:06.057 --> 00:42:08.191
You fell down
a flight of stairs.

489
00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:10.159
You're lucky you didn't
break your neck.

490
00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:12.028
Where's my son?

491
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.931
He's fine. He's
upstairs sleeping.

492
00:42:14.933 --> 00:42:17.133
He is still very unresponsive.

493
00:42:18.537 --> 00:42:19.769
But this place is...

494
00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:25.141
like a breeding ground
for negative energies.

495
00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:28.811
- I have to see my son.
- Hey. We're here to help!

496
00:42:29.681 --> 00:42:34.284
"Rejoice in the darkness. ye
shall appear before his horns."

497
00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:35.318
Mason!

498
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:37.687
Mason...

499
00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:40.223
Mason. come on.

500
00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:41.624
Hey. hey.

501
00:42:41.626 --> 00:42:43.192
Come on now.
Come on. You're okay.

502
00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:46.596
Come on. pal. Mason.
look at me. Mason.

503
00:42:46.598 --> 00:42:48.932
Look at me. Come on.
buddy. you're okay.

504
00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:51.568
What's happening?

505
00:42:53.038 --> 00:42:54.337
Say something!

506
00:42:57.175 --> 00:42:59.008
We have much to talk about.

507
00:43:07.285 --> 00:43:08.985
You've been marked
by him. my son.

508
00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:13.723
We're not dealing with
any ordinary demon here.

509
00:43:13.725 --> 00:43:18.127
Goes by many names.
taking on identities

510
00:43:18.129 --> 00:43:21.631
from myths. fear. legends...

511
00:43:21.633 --> 00:43:23.266
throughout mankind.

512
00:43:23.268 --> 00:43:29.005
It goes by Abaddon.
Mephistopheles. bete noire...

513
00:43:29.007 --> 00:43:33.242
Throughout the world. he's called Lucifer.
Prince of Darkness. Satan himself!

514
00:43:33.244 --> 00:43:37.981
You listen to yourself. you're telling me
that my family has been marked by Satan.

515
00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:41.884
There's only way
to purge this demon.

516
00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:44.187
And that's for you to begin

517
00:43:44.189 --> 00:43:45.922
your faith in our Lord.

518
00:43:45.924 --> 00:43:49.993
To purge? Do you even...
do you even hear what you...

519
00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:54.163
I need my meds.

520
00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:57.165
There are illnesses known to us.
like Parkinson's or dyslexia.

521
00:43:57.168 --> 00:44:00.203
that were mistaken
for possession before.

522
00:44:00.205 --> 00:44:05.942
Science does play an important role. but we
have reasons to believe this is something more.

523
00:44:07.946 --> 00:44:14.384
Remember this: The Devil
makes the sane insane.

524
00:44:14.386 --> 00:44:16.319
And the insane. sane.

525
00:44:17.222 --> 00:44:20.790
He lives so far into the
shadows of modern society.

526
00:44:20.792 --> 00:44:25.328
hidden by the face of science.
that we forget that he even exists.

527
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:29.032
And in that time. he has gotten
stronger and stronger every day!

528
00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:34.103
We don't see him coming.
because we don't know who he is.

529
00:44:35.306 --> 00:44:41.811
His grip on our souls can be so deep
that the only way out is an exorcism!

530
00:44:43.815 --> 00:44:45.114
An exorcism?

531
00:44:46.284 --> 00:44:48.785
- Exorcis... isn't that just...?
- Highly legal.

532
00:44:49.688 --> 00:44:52.255
First Amendment
protects exorcisms.

533
00:44:52.257 --> 00:44:56.426
for the exercise of religion.
in and of itself. is legal.

534
00:44:57.862 --> 00:45:00.063
Give me 18 hours.

535
00:45:00.065 --> 00:45:01.898
I will banish this demon.

536
00:45:04.803 --> 00:45:06.869
I just need Mason to be fine.

537
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.905
He will be taken care of.

538
00:45:08.907 --> 00:45:12.275
Our associate. Dr. Hawkins.
is on her way now as we speak.

539
00:45:12.277 --> 00:45:16.913
Take the help that is given to you here.
or forever risk damnation.

540
00:45:16.915 --> 00:45:18.815
[knocking on door]

541
00:45:20.118 --> 00:45:21.184
That's the doctor.

542
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.791
Doctor Hawkins. Please. come in.
We're all upstairs.

543
00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:31.728
Doc Hawkins! So
glad you could join us.

544
00:45:33.832 --> 00:45:37.300
I don't think you're supposed to be here.
Did you get a permission from the Bishop?

545
00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:40.303
You're the only ordained
doctor in the Diocese.

546
00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:42.138
- Hmm.
- Who was I gonna call?

547
00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:49.946
No. I've told you
already. I'm fine.

548
00:45:49.948 --> 00:45:51.881
Go check on my son.

549
00:45:51.883 --> 00:45:53.483
Joel. you're the one that
needs attention right now.

550
00:45:53.485 --> 00:45:55.752
Check on my son.

551
00:45:56.521 --> 00:45:59.222
Okay. But we're gonna have
to come back and look at it.

552
00:46:01.893 --> 00:46:02.959
[Joel] Follow me.

553
00:46:17.075 --> 00:46:19.842
Well. the good news is that
he's breathing normally.

554
00:46:20.879 --> 00:46:25.148
No broken bones. no signs
of external trauma.

555
00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:29.051
Medically speaking. he's fine.

556
00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:31.888
- Like in a deep sleep.
- Except that he is unresponsive.

557
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.790
Will he wake up?

558
00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:36.092
It is too early to
tell at this point.

559
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:47.036
[faint grunting]

560
00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:52.009
What?

561
00:46:55.113 --> 00:46:56.512
I'm hearing voices.

562
00:46:57.916 --> 00:47:00.383
- Latin.
- That is the third sign.

563
00:47:00.385 --> 00:47:02.151
The third sign of what?

564
00:47:04.189 --> 00:47:08.224
Well. there are six classic
signs to possession.

565
00:47:08.226 --> 00:47:12.562
There's aversion to the cross.
rolling of the eyes. what we just witnessed-

566
00:47:12.564 --> 00:47:15.531
speaking in a language that
no one has a knowledge of.

567
00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:18.034
And that's what it takes to
declare someone possessed. is it?

568
00:47:18.036 --> 00:47:22.605
Predicting future events. uh. speaking in
voices. antipathy towards the Church...

569
00:47:22.607 --> 00:47:24.307
Mason has none of these.

570
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:27.510
For goodness sakes. Lambert.
we don't know anything yet.

571
00:47:31.249 --> 00:47:32.548
Mason.

572
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.517
[whispering] Don't
listen to him. Dad.

573
00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:37.253
Mason! Mason!

574
00:47:47.632 --> 00:47:49.565
You guys. you need to come up.

575
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:50.967
Mason's awake.

576
00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:00.243
[animal-like breathing]

577
00:48:03.014 --> 00:48:06.582
- It's cold.
- Mason? Mason. hi! Hi.

578
00:48:06.584 --> 00:48:13.584
<i>Exorcizamus te. omnis immunde spiritus.
omni satanica potestas...</i>

579
00:48:15.159 --> 00:48:17.560
<i>Omnis immunde spiritus.
omni satanica potestas...</i>

580
00:48:17.562 --> 00:48:19.095
What's he saying?

581
00:48:19.097 --> 00:48:21.214
[Father Lambert]
The Roman Rites.

582
00:48:21.215 --> 00:48:23.332
I know it's the Roman Rites.
but how can it speak the holy...

583
00:48:23.334 --> 00:48:26.135
The Devil has to know the
scriptures in order to twist it.

584
00:48:27.472 --> 00:48:30.239
<i>Eradicare et effugare...</i>

585
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:36.145
Mason!

586
00:48:43.521 --> 00:48:46.656
I believe you. but why
should I trust you?

587
00:48:47.525 --> 00:48:51.260
Because I've seen the work
of Abaddon before. my son.

588
00:48:56.434 --> 00:48:59.702
On a boy not much
older than your son.

589
00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:02.971
Imagine you're... you're drowning!
And he couldn't breathe. just like you now.

590
00:49:02.974 --> 00:49:08.411
with a thousand glass shards shooting
through his body. cutting him.

591
00:49:08.413 --> 00:49:13.282
The pain was so great that he claws at
his teeth and rips off his fingernails.

592
00:49:18.222 --> 00:49:23.292
We're not fighting physical
or spiritual deaths here.

593
00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:26.429
They will be redeemed
in God's eyes!

594
00:49:26.431 --> 00:49:29.732
It's the eternal death
that we fear.

595
00:49:31.436 --> 00:49:33.102
God doesn't abandon.

596
00:49:34.172 --> 00:49:36.339
But the Devil will take.

597
00:49:42.113 --> 00:49:45.314
I just want things to go
back to the way they were.

598
00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:50.119
I know this is a. a lot for
you to swallow at once.

599
00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:55.658
I've spent my entire life with the entities.
and I still have much to learn.

600
00:49:56.761 --> 00:49:58.561
But do not worry.

601
00:49:58.563 --> 00:50:00.096
This is the end.

602
00:50:01.566 --> 00:50:05.101
It's us against this world!

603
00:50:16.014 --> 00:50:17.213
I'll trust you.

604
00:50:17.215 --> 00:50:21.584
But if anything happens to Mason.
God won't save you from me.

605
00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:27.590
Do you have a cassock?

606
00:50:27.592 --> 00:50:30.626
[father] I know
where to get one.

607
00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:33.661
All right. We're gonna need a few things.
We're gonna need a purple stole...

608
00:50:33.664 --> 00:50:37.299
- Mm.
- Two surplices. some holy water from the church.

609
00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:39.535
I need another copy
of the Roman Ritual.

610
00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:41.771
I'll be back with everything.

611
00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.444
I need someone
to go into that room.

612
00:50:48.446 --> 00:50:50.513
- He has to be restrained.
- What?

613
00:50:51.416 --> 00:50:54.216
- Okay. I can help with that.
- No. no. no. no. no.

614
00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:56.585
If anyone's restraining
my own son. it's me.

615
00:51:05.163 --> 00:51:09.265
"Our Father who art in heaven.
hallowed be Thy name."

616
00:51:09.267 --> 00:51:11.700
[distorted voice]
Come to us. Joel.

617
00:51:11.702 --> 00:51:14.537
Come to us!

618
00:51:14.539 --> 00:51:16.839
Hear us. Joel!

619
00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:20.843
It's just me. pal.
It's just daddy.

620
00:51:20.845 --> 00:51:26.816
"Thy kingdom come. thy will be done.
on earth as it is in heaven."

621
00:51:26.818 --> 00:51:28.684
[mumbling]

622
00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:37.093
"Give us this day
our daily bread.

623
00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:38.694
And forgive us our trespasses."

624
00:51:38.696 --> 00:51:41.831
Mr. Clarke. Mr. Clarke.
can you hear me?

625
00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:45.167
It is us who commands you.

626
00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:48.170
I have no idea what's going on.

627
00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:50.506
You need to wake up.

628
00:51:50.508 --> 00:51:52.741
You worship false Gods!

629
00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:56.579
Do you hear that? You
will rip his heart open!

630
00:51:58.816 --> 00:52:02.318
You're not Mason.
You're not Mason.

631
00:52:03.221 --> 00:52:04.653
Daddy?

632
00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:06.522
Forget them.

633
00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:08.124
Come to me.

634
00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:14.130
Don't you love me. Daddy?

635
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:18.567
- Come here.
- [woman] Can you see me. Joel?

636
00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:19.869
Come back to me!

637
00:52:24.609 --> 00:52:27.476
Joel. Joel...

638
00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:33.249
Remember your greatest
weapon now is your faith.

639
00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:34.884
[crying]

640
00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:47.429
My son. know that I will fight
with my life for your salvation.

641
00:52:47.431 --> 00:52:49.498
I don't care about me. Father.

642
00:52:51.235 --> 00:52:53.802
I just... can't lose Mason.
He's all I've got.

643
00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:57.239
You don't have
to worry about him.

644
00:52:57.241 --> 00:52:58.707
I'll be here watching.

645
00:53:03.948 --> 00:53:06.916
What happens inside
someone that's possessed?

646
00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:09.885
Well. it begins with something simple. like
a babel in the head disguised as knowledge.

647
00:53:09.887 --> 00:53:14.723
You. you don't really the
word. but rather you feel it.

648
00:53:14.725 --> 00:53:19.395
Deny the existence of God
through incomplete science.

649
00:53:19.397 --> 00:53:24.700
looking for clues and proof
that God doesn't exist.

650
00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:26.335
Does he know he's possessed?

651
00:53:26.337 --> 00:53:27.903
No.

652
00:53:27.905 --> 00:53:30.272
They never know
until it is too late.

653
00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:36.845
Demons. they work in the shadows.
hiding and becoming familiar in your life.

654
00:53:36.847 --> 00:53:40.249
Many times.
you cannot differentiate between what's real

655
00:53:40.251 --> 00:53:42.651
and what is under
the Devil's influence.

656
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:48.891
Sometimes you think you're in
control. and you finally realize

657
00:53:48.893 --> 00:53:55.364
that the Devil has such a hold on you
that only an exorcism can save you.

658
00:53:55.366 --> 00:53:56.432
[door closing]

659
00:54:07.645 --> 00:54:14.645
You keep saying "demons." then you say.
"the Devil." Are they not different things?

660
00:54:14.752 --> 00:54:17.453
Well. demons are just a
form that the Devil takes.

661
00:54:17.455 --> 00:54:20.589
I mean. we use many
names just to confuse us.

662
00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:23.359
Like Mephistopheles. Lucifer...

663
00:54:23.361 --> 00:54:27.730
Whatever it is. if it's hurting
Mason. I want it gone.

664
00:54:28.933 --> 00:54:31.767
You are to stay put
through this whole thing.

665
00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:32.901
No. he's my son.

666
00:54:32.903 --> 00:54:35.571
You've seen what
its lies can do!

667
00:54:35.573 --> 00:54:38.874
We need you to stay objective
through this whole event.

668
00:54:38.876 --> 00:54:44.313
I've spent more time convincing the Church
that people are possessed than that they are.

669
00:54:44.315 --> 00:54:47.349
If anything happens
at this exorcism...

670
00:54:48.286 --> 00:54:50.319
I will be the first
one to stop it.

671
00:54:51.489 --> 00:54:54.923
I'm a woman of my word.
and a woman of science.

672
00:54:57.428 --> 00:54:58.428
It's time.

673
00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:02.731
This is it.

674
00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:08.971
Joel. are you ready
for the exorcism?

675
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:14.343
[exhaling]

676
00:55:15.946 --> 00:55:17.413
Yes. Father.

677
00:55:22.386 --> 00:55:23.952
[growling]

678
00:55:34.532 --> 00:55:36.098
[Joel] Does he even blink?

679
00:55:37.368 --> 00:55:40.336
The longer we wait during
the Affliction. the worse it is.

680
00:55:40.338 --> 00:55:41.737
There must be
something I can do.

681
00:55:43.374 --> 00:55:45.808
Just your undying faith
and submission to God.

682
00:55:46.644 --> 00:55:51.980
Maybe. maybe if I'm in there. if he gets
upset. I can talk him down. reason with him!

683
00:55:51.982 --> 00:55:55.351
This demon is different
than any other. Joel.

684
00:55:55.353 --> 00:55:56.819
You can't just reason with it.

685
00:55:56.821 --> 00:55:59.855
It's got no desires. no needs.

686
00:55:59.857 --> 00:56:03.025
You can't coax it
with love or negotiate.

687
00:56:03.027 --> 00:56:05.461
It feeds on the darkness within.

688
00:56:07.498 --> 00:56:11.633
You want to help? Keep the Lord's
Prayer close to you at all times.

689
00:56:16.407 --> 00:56:18.073
[grunting]

690
00:56:43.534 --> 00:56:46.435
"In the name of Jesus
Christ. God and Lord...

691
00:56:47.605 --> 00:56:49.772
[distorted screaming]

692
00:56:49.774 --> 00:56:52.007
[Father Lambert] "Through the
intercession of the Immaculate Virgin.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:57:01.717
we are about to undertake the
expulsion of a diabolical infestation.

695
00:57:01.719 --> 00:57:05.687
and all the Saints relying on the
holy authority of our office..."

696
00:57:05.689 --> 00:57:10.492
We are about to undertake the expulsion
of a diabolical infestation...

697
00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:20.569
[father Lambert talking]

698
00:58:54.732 --> 00:59:00.669
Mmm! Ugh! Ugh!

699
00:59:17.955 --> 00:59:20.822
[distorted noises]

700
00:59:35.205 --> 00:59:38.206
[father Lambert
speaking in Latin]

701
01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:05.901
In the name and by the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ. we cast you out!

702
01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:12.608
Every unclean spirit. every satanic power.
every onslaught of the infernal adversary...

703
01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:17.879
In the name and by the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ...

704
01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:22.384
- It's burning!
- Come on.

705
01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:33.161
[growling]

706
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.641
[Joel] Here.

707
01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.409
Give me your clothes.
I'll wash them.

708
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.121
Enough rest. We
gotta keep moving.

709
01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.128
Uh...

710
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.096
Doctor. I-I have a question.

711
01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:10.999
Yes?

712
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.901
I heard Father Lambert say that
exorcism's legal. Is it true?

713
01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:15.937
The First Amendment
protects religious liberty.

714
01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:18.974
but it doesn't sanction
intentional abuse.

715
01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:22.911
But that's why I'm here. to make
sure that no abuse happens.

716
01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:26.181
It's a requirement by the
Church for exorcism.

717
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.216
So. you believe in
demonic possession?

718
01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:33.088
It's my belief that possession
stems from a psychological guilt

719
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.724
that religion has been
known to indoctrinate.

720
01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:40.462
I mean. but it could be.
like. ergot poisoning. huh.

721
01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:44.066
dermatographic
urticaria. epilepsy...

722
01:01:45.436 --> 01:01:46.935
schizophrenia.

723
01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.237
Schizophrenia?

724
01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.338
Yes.

725
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:55.377
Uh. it's a psychosomatic
condition that's historically

726
01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.813
been confused with
demonic possession.

727
01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.047
Do you think he might
be schizophrenic?

728
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.083
I've seen your medication. Joel.

729
01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:05.921
It has all gone on record
and into consideration.

730
01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.957
But that does not explain the
voices I heard inside of him.

731
01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:14.730
The poltergeist activity.
this allotriophagy. I...

732
01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:15.732
The allo what?

733
01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:18.033
Allotriophagy.

734
01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:21.970
It is a symptom of vomiting things
that should not be in our body.

735
01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.139
eating things that
should not be eaten.

736
01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:29.845
All I can tell you is that Mason is not
in any direct threat or risk right now.

737
01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.147
Thank you. doctor.

738
01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:45.527
[exhaling]

739
01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:52.535
Oh!

740
01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.339
Maya. you scared
the life out of me.

741
01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.175
What are you doing here?

742
01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.844
I told you I'd come by
and check up on Mason.

743
01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:04.913
No-no. wait-wait-wait. uh...

744
01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.283
What is it?

745
01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.420
Uhhh...

746
01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:12.788
Now's probably
not the best time.

747
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:17.993
Joel. the purpose of my visit
is not at your convenience.

748
01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:21.296
"Now is not a good time" is the probably
the very reason why I should be here.

749
01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.831
Y-yeah. but I...

750
01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:26.034
Uh. ha-ha...

751
01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:29.070
uh. this is gonna sound insane.

752
01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:30.338
Insane?

753
01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.574
Yeah. uh...

754
01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:36.444
Mason's with
a priest right now. So...

755
01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.214
- Priest?
- Yeah.

756
01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.817
Um. something's
happened in the house.

757
01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:47.489
And I think that. um... I mean. we... think
that something's happened to Mason. and...

758
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.257
Define "something happened."

759
01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:52.894
He's unconscious.
he's unresponsive.

760
01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:55.530
Joel. Mason needs
to see a doctor now!

761
01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:56.498
There's a doctor in the house.

762
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.550
A priest or doctor?

763
01:03:58.551 --> 01:04:01.431
Both! There's both of them. They're
looking after him during the exorcism.

764
01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.339
Please. tell me you did
not just say "exorcism."

765
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.775
Maya. it's completely safe.

766
01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.210
What. are you crazy?
You're subjecting your son to an exorcism?

767
01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.563
All the signs are there.

768
01:04:11.564 --> 01:04:13.914
They're there! H-h-he's
speaking in other languages.

769
01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:17.157
- there's just things flying around the house. and...
- Oh. so you're Catholic now?

770
01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:24.926
I've seen things that I
didn't believe in. until now.

771
01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.596
When were you last
on your medication?

772
01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:30.065
Uhhh. a few hours ago.

773
01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.017
Where are your pills?

774
01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:33.978
Um. they're upstairs.
I left them in the bathroom.

775
01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.277
Joel. you are destroying
everything we worked for.

776
01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.479
What choice do I have?

777
01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.281
Mason.

778
01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.483
Mason is your choice!

779
01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:52.621
If something happens to Mason. he needs
to get a proper psychiatric evaluation

780
01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.223
and medical check-up.
There are procedures and...

781
01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.925
Will you just trust me?

782
01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:01.897
Sorry.

783
01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.298
It's just...

784
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.168
Right now...

785
01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:11.573
I don't have any other choice.

786
01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:17.045
You're saying there's
a doctor in there?

787
01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:22.550
[growling]

788
01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:36.298
[Father Lambert praying]

789
01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.275
This is so wrong.

790
01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:50.078
Hey. open up!

791
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.346
They won't respond.

792
01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:58.153
I'm going to call the cops.
I mean. is that even a real doctor in there?

793
01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.988
Nobody's doing
anything in my house.

794
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:03.224
I am... I am practicing my religious freedom.
This is legal.

795
01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:05.660
Not in your situation!

796
01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.729
Maya. just please.

797
01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.564
Just give me some time.

798
01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.767
Okay?

799
01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:14.208
And I'll take full responsibility
for all of it when it's over.

800
01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.741
I want to talk to the priest.

801
01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:25.547
You have 15 minutes. or I will have
the police. CPS. AHSC. you name it!

802
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:28.650
I'll have the entire cavalry
here. if I have to.

803
01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:32.053
No one is leaving here until
I know what is going on.

804
01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.556
Just speak to him.
and you will see.

805
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.127
Make it happen now.

806
01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:42.364
I'm gonna go check
on your pills.

807
01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:43.431
You better be taking them.

808
01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.372
[glass breaking]

809
01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:58.480
"I command you. unclean spirit.
whoever you are. along with all your minions

810
01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.615
now attacking this
servant of God.

811
01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:03.351
by the mysteries of the incarnation.
passion. resurrection.

812
01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:06.021
and the ascension of
our Lord Jesus Christ!"

813

"By the descent
of the Holy Spirit!"

[distant voice]<i> Daddy!</i>

815

<i>Daddy!</i>

[whispering]<i> There's
not much time!</i>

817
01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.454
<i>I sent you them!</i>

818
01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:45.126
<i>Come back to me.</i>

819
01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:56.671
[screaming]

820
01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:17.225
[growling]

821
01:08:19.463 --> 01:08:20.562
Lambert!

822
01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:32.474
Father. my psychiatrist is here.
She's not happy. She wants to talk to you.

823
01:08:32.476 --> 01:08:34.509
Not now. my son.

824
01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:37.112
Whatever it is that's
happened can wait.

825
01:08:37.114 --> 01:08:38.379
What about him?

826
01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.150
This work's not cut
out for everybody.

827
01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:45.687
What... what does that mean? Where...
how's the exorcism going? How's Mason?

828
01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:55.296
Now is the time for the Assent.

829
01:08:57.234 --> 01:09:02.804
Whatever happens now.
whatever choices between good and evil.

830
01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.273
will be forever.

831
01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:07.709
How much longer?

832
01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:09.911
[father vomiting]

833
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.715
It's all in God's hands.

834
01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:36.271
There you are.

835
01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.192
I've got you now.

836
01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:00.895
No one can touch you.

837
01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:13.775
God. this is too much.

838
01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:18.980
I won't rest until I destroy
and abolish this demon.

839
01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:21.516
You promise me you
won't let him go?

840
01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:24.919
Mason'll be fine.

841
01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.355
He'll have his life back
when this is all over.

842
01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.526
You know. you are the first person
I trust that will take care of him.

843
01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.296
I lost one once.

844
01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:38.766
I won't let this happen again.

845
01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.676
Maya.

846
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.649
Maya!

847
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:55.917
Joel...

848
01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:01.289
Is this what all this is about?

849
01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.557
So. you believe me now?

850
01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:03.992
Believe you?

851
01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:10.732
Dust specks. lens reflections. motion blur...
these are all just natural causes from technology.

852
01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.234
No. no. no. no.

853
01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:13.735
What about this one? What
about. what about the shadow?

854
01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:14.869
Finger on the lens.

855
01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:15.937
In the middle?

856
01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.307
Maya!

857
01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:21.308
No. Joel. You need
to stop all this now!

858
01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.712
You haven't seen what I've seen.

859
01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:31.519
Maybe it's because you haven't
been taking your medication.

860
01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.559
Joel.

861
01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.696
Listen to me.

862
01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:48.803
Remember when I told you
about making choices?

863
01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:52.874
You're gonna have
to make a choice now.

864
01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.043
For you.

865
01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:57.879
For Mason.

866
01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:02.583
It's all in your head!

867
01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:08.456
You can vanquish this. just say
it. You can make the choice.

868
01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.926
Choice?

869
01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.728
What choice?

870
01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:15.530
[whispering voice]
<i>I tried to warn you!</i>

871
01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:21.069
Do you trust me?

872
01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:25.106
I'm so tired!

873
01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.348
Do you believe in me. Joel?

874
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.887
I can fix this.

875
01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.524
You won't have to worry anymore.

876
01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:48.062
Just surrender to me.

877
01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.000
Can you do that. Joel?

878
01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:54.669
[whispering]

879
01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:05.546
That's all I need
from you. Joel.

880
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.654
We can do this together.

881
01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:16.124
I need you to say
it one more time.

882
01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.892
You gotta mean it!

883
01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:21.796
Yes.

884
01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:23.731
Yes!

885
01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:29.437
Yes!

886
01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:39.847
It's over.

887
01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.067
Maya?

888
01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:06.541
Mason?

889
01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:16.485
Mason.

890
01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.079
Lambert!

891
01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.715
Lambert!

892
01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:54.255
Lambert!

893
01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:55.956
[distant voice]
<i>Daddy. Daddy. wake up!</i>

894
01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:57.558
Father Michael!

895
01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.259
Daddy!

896
01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.961
Hawkins?

897
01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:03.598
Anyone!

898
01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.537
[whispering]
<i>We were trying to save you.</i>

899
01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:11.973
[Father Lambert] It begins
with something simple.

900
01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:15.243
like a babel in the head
disguised as knowledge.

901
01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.548
You not only hear the
word. but rather you feel it.

902
01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.618
You've been marked
by him. my son.

903
01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.121
- Joel. you're the one that needs attention right now.
- Check on my son.

904
01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:34.729
[Father Lambert] Demons. they work in the shadows.
hiding and becoming familiar in your life.

905
01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:38.032
Many times.
you cannot differentiate between what's real

906
01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:41.068
and what is under
the Devil's influence.

907
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:45.573
Sometimes you think you're in control.
and you finally realize that the Devil

908
01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:51.078
has such a hold on you that only
an exorcism can save you.

909
01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:02.723
Reality blinds those who only
see what they want to see.

910
01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:08.095
The eyes are useless
when the mind is blind.

911
01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:09.564
[Joel] What... ahhh...

912
01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:16.671
The priest believed an exorcism would save
him. but it only brought you closer to me.

913
01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:17.838
No.

914
01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:20.575
He was helping Mason.

915
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.611
We'll see.

916
01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:31.636
Joel. Joel. Joel!

917
01:16:31.637 --> 01:16:35.956
Or were you so blinded by imperfection.
you believed your son was afflicted?

918
01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:40.127
Mason saw the darkness in you.
the same way he sees many things.

919
01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:41.729
You tricked me!

920
01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:43.831
No.

921
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:49.337
You assented.

922
01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:55.209
You heard the voices calling out for you
during the exorcism. and yet you paid no heed.

923
01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:59.246
You're so far into the darkness that
your soul has become part of it.

924
01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:00.681
Where's Mason?

925
01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.918
Where's my son?

926
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:08.823
Do not concern yourself
with the outside world.

927
01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:14.762
You built this house and your mind
with the darkness and your sickness.

928
01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.135
That's why I choose you. Joel.

929
01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.273
My life is nothing
without Mason.

930
01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:29.043
He's all that matters.

931
01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.082
In time. he will make
his own choice.

932
01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:41.322
And as life spirals into oblivion
from his parents abandoning him.

933
01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.190
we shall be there waiting.

934
01:17:45.028 --> 01:17:48.295
Don't you worry.
We'll get him back.

935
01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:50.264
You don't touch Mason!

936
01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:54.101
[Maya] It'll be his choice.

937
01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:58.439
That'll always be a choice.

938
01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:02.410
You are just the first. Joel.

939
01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:10.851
Together. we will build our
orphanages in darkness.

940
01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:15.089
For the children of filth.

941
01:18:18.828 --> 01:18:23.964
[narrator]<i> Every possession by a
demon occurs during three stages.</i>

942
01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:26.834
<i>The first is called
the Presence.</i>

943
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:33.874
<i>This is when a demon or entity begins
to make its presence known to the host.</i>

944
01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:37.812
<i>The second stage
is called the Affliction.</i>

945
01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:43.417
<i>when the entity begins to possess
and inhibit the body of its host.</i>

946
01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:48.155
<i>taking over all control of their physical.
mental and spiritual ability.</i>

947
01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:56.030
<i>The infected begins to feel dirty.
like a pungent force taking over.</i>

948
01:18:56.966 --> 01:19:03.037
<i>But the demon cannot fully infect and
take over a person until the third stage.</i>

949
01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:05.840
<i>which is known as the Assent.</i>

950
01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:10.444
<i>It's when a person has finally
surrendered and consents to the demon</i>

951
01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.279
<i>as being a part of their soul.</i>

952
01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:14.315
Who are you talking to?

953
01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:16.283
Someone who thinks
they can help us.

954
01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:25.993
[narrator]<i> Remember this: The
Devil makes the sane insane.</i>

955
01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:28.329
[Father Lambert]
<i>And the insane. sane.</i>

956
01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:33.067
Joel. are you ready
for the exorcism?

957
01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:37.171
Yes. Father.

958
01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.398
[door opening]

959
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.533
[woman] Mason?

960
01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.936
It's late.

961
01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:10.304
You should be in bed now.

962
01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.040
[Mason] Okay.

963
01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.876
[woman] Look.

964
01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:21.415
I know how hard it's been.
after all these years.

965
01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.386
But you're making
great progress.

966
01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:27.588
I just...

967
01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.225
miss him sometimes.

968
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.499
Letting go doesn't mean
that you have to forget him.

969
01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:42.903
It means it's time to move on.

970
01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:48.976
I think I'm gonna
try to sleep now.

971
01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:51.245
Okay.

972
01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:01.422
[door closing]

973
01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:37.124
<i>Who are you? My name is Camper.</i>

974
01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.460
<i>Will you be my friend?</i>
[distorting]

975
01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:51.405
