00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.739
So exactly what does a man say
when you've taken 38 years of

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:22.289
his life and thrown it away
without so much as a thank you?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.670
Well. I don't think you wantme
saying what I said exactly.

00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:29.190
but it sure did
feel good to say it.

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:29.898
Yes. sir.

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:31.149
I'm sure you're sure it did.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.899
Mmm-hmm. and anybody who wants
to can go ask him what I said

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:35.250
because I don't care
who knows it.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.039
What they did was not right.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.149
Not to me or
none of the other boys.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.039
I put my back into the plant.

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:43.259
I missed a lot of
stuff I will never have back.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.530
I was never young when I
was there. but I spentup what I

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:47.579
had left of it
when I was there.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.219
I don't know why I
never tried to leave earlier.

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:51.859
I think it's because we was all
in it together it felt like .

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:54.479
Well. if that ain't
the point of it all.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.850
You know. I may be
sitting pretty now.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.719
I can't complain.

00:00:57.803 --> 00:00:58.530
I want for nothing.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.229
But I've been there more times
than I can count.

00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:03.450
I know what it's like going
down that tunnel with no

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.158
end in sight.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.989
Now. life. I mean. it puts you
through the wringer. but all

00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:08.849
you can do is make the
best of what it gives you.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.310
You got to buckle your
ass down. find your people.

00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:13.920
grab that silver lining and
hold onto it for every damn bit

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:14.909
of life that you're worth.

00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:15.618
Ain't that right?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.079
That's a way you
say it. I guess .

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.840
Thank you for calling KTXJ.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:30.709
How may I help you?

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.700
One last thing. old timer.

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:36.180
Do you have any wisdom
for our young folks out there?

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:37.819
Oh. yeah.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.500
Yeah. I suppose let's hear it.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.980
You know. I heard him say it.
but looking back. I figure I

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:47.010
really do regret the things I
didn't do more the little

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:48.269
things I did do.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.314
I know.

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:50.023
That's right.

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:51.810
Well. that's a nugget. a front
porch wisdom if I've

00:01:51.893 --> 00:01:52.518
ever heard it.

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:53.489
Thanks for the talk. old.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.659
Are you have yourself a good
night's keep on doing what

00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.099
you're doing for the
rest of you out there.

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:00.150
You do the same.

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:02.420
You're old buddy Rooster here
is pulling for you.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.409
Well. it looks like
we got one more caller.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.450
Then we're going to take a
break and put a little

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.310
reason to unite.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.020
Hey there. Umbrella.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.039
Talk to me.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.949
Hey. Rooster. I'm having
a hard time.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.719
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:17.370
What you got going on us?

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:20.009
I was supposed to have the
kids tonight. but my ex-wife

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:22.740
called and said that I can't
see them until we have no idea

00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:23.530
what we're talking.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.009
She's moving in with her
boyfriend down in Dallas.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.620
Unless I want to drive an extra
six hundred miles a week on

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.020
have my visitation cut week
in a month.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.439
I feel your brother a lot of
people get on the court system

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:36.580
and find out that it
ain't too kind to daddies.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.650
You got a plan?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.240
I don't know. man.

00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:41.240
I was just calling because.
you know. I'm not doing too.

00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:42.840
you know. wanted to
make a request.

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:43.548
Oh. sure.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:44.256
What can we play for you?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.719
U14.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:47.039
You fourteen.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.215
Oh. man.

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:48.930
You know. you're fourteen.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.439
You're going to have to refresh
my memory a little. buddy.

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.289
You've played in a real
long time. but I know you've

00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:56.310
got to still have it up there.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.330
You're fourteen. man.

00:02:57.413 --> 00:02:58.860
I'll write you fourteen.

00:02:58.943 --> 00:02:59.969
We'll we'll dig it up.

00:03:00.053 --> 00:03:00.678
All right.

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:01.500
Thanks for comin.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.139
Little reminder out
there. folks.

00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:06.180
Hold those babies tight because
you never know what this world

00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:06.900
is going to bring you.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.000
This world spins hard
and fast.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.979
And whether or not you
know it. the ground you're

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:12.990
standing on right
now spins with it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.409
seems like we've got a
lot of sad people out there.

00:03:16.493 --> 00:03:19.530
And I don't it well. let's put
a little sad song on for

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:22.050
everybody to make them
feel a little less alone.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.300
How bout a
little alten. Perry?

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:25.164
All right.

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:25.979
We're going to the music.

00:03:26.063 --> 00:03:27.750
Sit tight. hum along if
you know it.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.680
And you should.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.849

that morning show.

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:03.730

oldies anymore. but I remember

That's Christopher Bell.
ladies and gentlemen. make your

00:08:57.313 --> 00:09:00.139
way on out to Houston
or San Antonio whenever he's in

00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:03.179
town anyhow. as you
all surely know by now.

00:09:03.263 --> 00:09:05.539
There's nothing I love more
than to listen to you guys on

00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:07.009
those late and lonely nights.

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:09.009
And you've been
real talky tonight.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.225
Sure.

00:09:10.308 --> 00:09:10.933
What's going on out there?

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:13.220
But I'll be damned if
I believe you guys hang in.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.940
So we're going to try a little
experiment here. a bona fide

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.700
blast from the past for
all those. you know.

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:20.809
you out there.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.809
So fingers crossed.

00:09:22.893 --> 00:09:26.990
And without further ado.
I present you 14.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.049
Sometimes the real get
it down.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.399
No body.

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:08.289
no body. no bodies failed and
so far invented by.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.679
And we are back.

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:31.750
I hope you didn't miss
me too much.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.490
I'll be doing OK out
there tonight. folks.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.330
We are going to get
to some callers real soon.

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:39.159
But first. we're going
to get some music going.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.370
Keep listening to KTXA is
your man Rooster.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.600
And we'll be right back.

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:52.970
Connie. what the hell.
how long we've been off?

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.580
Thank you for calling KTXA
is your man.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.379
What can I do you for?

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.350
Wow. the rooster above the
whole damn building finally

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:10.950
burned to the ground
long as you've been out.

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:11.658
No. no. no.

00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:12.620
We're all good up here.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.379
Just some technical
difficulties when it comes to

00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:17.840
the territory of having too
many buttons and switches and

00:11:17.923 --> 00:11:18.889
not enough brain cells.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.210
Glad to hear it.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:22.509
Glad to hear it.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.269
Say. if you want to make it up
to me. why don't you folks pop

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.059
in you 14 for old time's sake.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.370
You're 14.

00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:33.110
Yeah. you 14.

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:35.929
Glad to hear
from me again. Rooster.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.360
I'll take care now.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.120
Anyhow. as you all surely know
by now. there's nothing I love

00:12:57.203 --> 00:12:59.789
more than hearing from you
folks out there. almost those

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.230
and lonely nights that you've
been real talking to.

00:13:02.313 --> 00:13:04.889
Not sure what's going on
out there. but I'd sooner

00:13:04.973 --> 00:13:07.590
rather give my right arm than
I'll leave you folks hanging.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.730
So we are going to try a
little experiment. a bona fide

00:13:11.813 --> 00:13:15.029
blast from the past. a little
gift from me to you.

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:16.980
So without further ado.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.080
You 14.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.730
Some time the real
get pinned down.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.080
No body.

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:45.509
no body. no bodies built
and so far has been an.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:53.370
Connie. Connie. do you see that
the young girl who's there.

00:13:53.453 --> 00:13:54.090
you can't be riding a.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.590
I can hear somebody the morning
I wake up praising him. I say.

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:03.080
why did I do it?

00:14:03.163 --> 00:14:09.000
Nobody else will fight it
better than I did in my.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.649
I'll be right back. OK?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.210
My baby girl. my. my.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:32.159
It's so far to go
by and by and do.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:51.570
Christina. by the way. you know

00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:20.359
This is all perfectly normal.

00:17:20.443 --> 00:17:23.359
This isn't the time to be
sensitive for your safety.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.369

playing you for change

former head of the gang.
