00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.821
You know you think just
because you got a badge

192
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.473
lets you talk to
people like that?

193
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.629
Gives you the merit to
speak to people like that?

194
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.653
Yes. it does.

195
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.444
I got ID in my carr.

196
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.229

197
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.237
Just calm down.

198
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.533
Got a gun!

199
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:55.323
Hey. hey. no. no.

201
00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.108
I'm a cop

202
00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.412

203
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.579
Hey. step back.

204
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.876
Step the fuck back!

205
00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:07.838

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.418
Oh god. Oh. oh god.

207
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.002
Motherfucker shot me.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.382
Yo. you stupid? He's a cop!

209
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.470
What are you doing?

210
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.512
Man. he shot me.

211
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:16.805
Oh god.

212
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.515
Shoot him.

213
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.094
Shoot that motherfucker.

214
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.724
Call an ambulance!

215
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.056
Call an ambulance.

216
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.851
Hey Chris. Chris.

217
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.151

218
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.194
Okay. Okay.

219
00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.243
Sir. hold for me one second.

220
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.543
Fxcuse me.

221
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.105
My husband. detective
Chris Jones was shot.

222
00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.460
Yes

223
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:50.290
do you know?

224
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.295
He's on the second floor icu.

225
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.591
Okay.

226
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.792
Okay. um...

227
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.302
Okay.

228
00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.117
You go right through
the doors. please.

229
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.220
Do you know if he
was wearing his vest?

230
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.231
He's an officer.
He should've had on his vest

231
00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.367
you can't tell.
You can't call anybody and ask?

232
00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.256
No. we
don't have the report yet.

233
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.533
What information
did they give you?

234
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.615
They didn't give me anything.

235
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.501
How long do I have
to wait again?

236
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.206
How long?

237
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.678
How are you feeling. Mr. Jones?

238
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.695
All right.

239
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.049
Yeah. you've been through a
lot the last couple of days.

240
00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.529
Your body needs some rest.

241
00:10:58.825 --> 00:10:59.905
You do need some time off

242
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.737
that's for sure.

243
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.916
I think you're
getting a lot better.

244
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.873
Just need some rest.

245
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.635
What are you gonna do

246
00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:28.097
about this motherfucking
nigger cop that shot my son?

247
00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.476
Okay. you need...

248
00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:32.013
You need to keep
your voice down.

249
00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.024
We don't address our
officers by color.

250
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.061
but by last name or rank.

251
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.610
I can see that you're angry.
but so are the Jones family.

252
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.993
They are both cops and
they're both in our prayers.

253
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.988
You need to go to the hospital.

254
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.657
Be by your family's side.

255
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.825
They need you more
than ever now.

256
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.573
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.117
We tried to resuscitate him.
but his wounds were fatal.

258
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.420
Nol

259
00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:36.672
nol

260
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.349
We can fix this.

261
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.730
I hope these motherfuckers...
It ain't no set up or no shit.

262
00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.909
My niggas know the whereabouts.
The where to be.

263
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.328
The where to be the fuck at.

264
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.163
Homie. I'm trying
to fix this shit. You feel me?

265
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.462
Well. check this out.

266
00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.209
if united both flags
is the new suicide.

267
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.500
then let it ring 'cause I'm
not gon' keep standing by.

268
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:24.822
Keep letting these
happy crackers

269
00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.507
keep having open season on us.

270
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.951
I rather die standin' on my feet
then live on my knees any day.

271
00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.090
You follow me?

272
00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:31.007
Why don't we do this right?

273
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.871
Then we both is all shooters
together and everything else.

274
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.135
You feel what I'm saying?

275
00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.145
Let's do the negotiations
on that part. b.

276
00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:37.146
Got you.

277
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:38.442
Aight. blue.

278
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.067
This motherfucker. man.

279
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.073
Aye yo blue. man.

280
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.530
Why you bringing this red
ghost slop up in here. man?

281
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.830
Aye yo chill. man.

282
00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.403
You house trained little poodle?

283
00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.364
Yo chill. du.

284
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.604
You gotta understand it's
the color you're wearing

285
00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:58.743
that incites the bull.

286
00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.537
Y'all already know what this is.

287
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.172
It's only right we sit down
and put our flags to the side

288
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.279
and create a truce.
especially with all this shit.

289
00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.863
Got all these police
keep killing us out

290
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:07.928
in these streets like this

291
00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.178
all right. crip.

292
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.714
'Cause you got to know
we wouldn't be here

293
00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.554
if it was any other option.

294
00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.434
I wouldn't want to have to

295
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.470
I got people all over. man.

296
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:18.934
Og's know. man.

297
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.098
He know me. hey. That part.

298
00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.318
So what you said is now
we got a temporary truce?

299
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.401
I mean I know we on y'all
side. y'all say cool.

300
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.534
You know. when this side over
here translation I say boom.

301
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.990
Du. tell the rest of the set.

302
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.871
Aye yo. man. you
trust this nigga?

303
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.327
Yo. you ain't gotta trust me.

304
00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:40.414
I'm Mr. word out 'cause the
word out is like word out

305
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:41.713
boom

306
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:42.836
that part right there.

307
00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:44.212
Dun. dun. dun.

308
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.509
Aight. cuz.

309
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:46.882
I'm like god on whoop gang.

310
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.668
These is bloody shoes.

311
00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.129
Fuck that nigga.

312
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.764
Yo cuz. I don't trust
that nigga. man.

313
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.060
Fuck that

314
00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.138
that nigga crazy.

315
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.018
A source tells us
this could have been

316
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.653
a case of mistaken
identity. but either way.

317
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.110
this entire
community is on edge.

318
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.810
Joining me live now
is Regina Clark.

319
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.151
Regina. you witnessed this all.

320
00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.493
What can you tell us?

321
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.245
He deserved what he got.

322
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.906
They come in our community.

323
00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.369
They kill our young black men

324
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.827
and they walk out without
a scratch. but not today.

325
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.543
Everybody was yelling and
telling him not to shoot

326
00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.958
and that the other guy was
a cop. too. just like him.

327
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.378
but because he was black.
he didn't wanna believe it.

328
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.930
It was self defense
if you ask me.

329
00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:37.144
Well thank you for that.

330
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.103
As you can see raw emotion
spilling out here to the streets.

331
00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.140
Daddy. do white cops
hate black people?

332
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.728
Back to you.

333
00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.608
Baby.

334
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.607
Baby. come here.

335
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.568
Careful.

336
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.528
Now. where'd you hear that?

337
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.537
What would make you
say that. Sabrina?

338
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.700
My teacher asked how's
your father coming along

339
00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.743
and then my friend Peter said

340
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.833
that white cops don't
like black people.

341
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.168
Oh. baby.

342
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.924
Your friend Peter

343
00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.137
he's wrong.

344
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:16.927
Now mommy and daddy would not
be cops if that were true.

345
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.132
- Yeah.
- Okay?

346
00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.596
Yeah. you know what Sabrina?

347
00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:23.059
Sometimes. um. when
people are afraid.

348
00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.689
sometimes they act out in anger

349
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:30.103
and it affects how they.
um. deal with other people.

350
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:31.406
Right?

351
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:34.073
And then. um. it
doesn't necessarily mean

352
00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:35.699
that they hate the person.

353
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.181
but just sometimes
people act out of fear.

354
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.991
Do you understand?

355
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.949
Okay.

356
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:41.364
Well. go brush your teeth.

357
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.782
Get ready for bed. okay?

358
00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:43.790
Okay.

359
00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:44.791
Night. night.

360
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.702
Love you. daddy.

361
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:47.540
Love you too. mommy.

362
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.840
Love you. baby.

363
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.999
Oh god.

364
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:56.713
Did you hear that?

365
00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:58.548
This is crazy.

366
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.967
Do you see how this is
affecting our child?

367
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.511
How are we supposed
to raise a child

368
00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.600
in this climate when
we're the boogeyman?

369
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.900
This is ridiculous

370
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:07.689
or some.

371
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.646
Like we're some
kind of racial group

372
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.358
that doesn't like people
for their differences

373
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.568
and beliefs and cultures.

374
00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.275
I tell you what though.

375
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:18.978
I swear to god.
I'll quit this force

376
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.611
before I let it
dilute our child.

377
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:27.084
Social media don't
make it no better

378
00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.503
let me go get her situated.

379
00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:17.714
I'm sorry for your loss.

380
00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.926
You've come to the
right place for support.

381
00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:27.475
I wanna show you something and
you give me your take on it.

382
00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:29.816
What do you see?

383
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.521
And what comes to mind
when you look at this?

384
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:49.284
All I see are niggers and spics.

385
00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:52.245
We see the same vision.

386
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.172
Yo. you know where that
come from?

387
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.341
Knowing the creator.

388
00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:06.851
But yo on some real shit.

389
00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:11.230
That shit happened so fast.
I thought I was a dead man.

390
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:12.230
Yeah. I heard.

391
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:13.936
My mans and 'em
out of Jamaica fam

392
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.352
was killed by one
of them devils.

393
00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.776
He said they tried to say
homie went for their weapon.

394
00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.822
That's the reason
they killed him.

395
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:22.233
Some bullshit.

396
00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:23.536
I'll tell you that.

397
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.865
Yo. I'm getting sick
and tired of this shit.

398
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.371
And you know what?

399
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.500
I'd rather be judged by 12
then to be carried by six.

400
00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:31.454
You feel me?

401
00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:32.243
Feel you.

402
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.205
Real talk.

403
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.666
Real talk.

404
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.001
Nigga. what you mean real talk?

405
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:38.837
Your dusty ass
ain't about nothing

406
00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.548
but stealing the coldest
beer out the arab store.

407
00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:42.927
Come on. nigga.

408
00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.509
Yo. chill out. man.

409
00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.140
Yo. this is some serious shit.

410
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.551
What other options
we have left for us?

411
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.345
You said yourself you'd
rather be judged by 12

412
00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.684
than carried by six.

413
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.018
Yeah. man.

414
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.318
That's a fact

415
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.061
what else y'all
getting into though?

416
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.196
Got some hos on mind.

417
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.115
I got a lot of shit on the mind.

418
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.403
Nah. seriously though.

419
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.489
I'm getting sick and
tired of these pigs. man.

420
00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:13.080
Yo look. I ain't no
killer or nothing.

421
00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.792
You know I'm a working
man. but I'm a man first.

422
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:18.297
That's what's up.

423
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.125
Ain't nobody gonna
save us but us.

424
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.340
Yo. this shit got to
stop. man. for real.

425
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.610
And I think we got to
do something about it.

426
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:28.303
I'm ready to do it with you.

427
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.163
Hey.

428
00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.344
I still can't believe he's gone.

429
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.846
Don't do this.

430
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.137
I can't either.

431
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:15.271
But we gotta hold up for mom.

432
00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:18.269
Can you do that?

433
00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:21.488
Yeah

434
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.530
okay.

435
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:24.365
Where's mom?

436
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:26.615
Upstairs.

437
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:29.652
And Josh?

438
00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.990
He's up there too. acting weird.

439
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:38.331
All right.

440
00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:40.833
This is what I'm gonna do.

441
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.669
I'm gonna go talk to Josh.

442
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:46.965
I'll be right back.

443
00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.473
No more liquor.

444
00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:55.140
Glad you're here.

445
00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.679
Okay.

446
00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:57.982
Hey.

447
00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.394
What did I say?

448
00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.024
No more liquor.

449
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:02.359
Okay?

450
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:03.770
Got jt.

451
00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:05.073
I promise.

452
00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:06.366
Okay.

453
00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:07.982
I love you so much.

454
00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:10.655
I love you.

455
00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:12.872
Okay.

456
00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:25.583
What's up?

457
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.255
What are you doing?
I was watching that.

458
00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:37.644
What were you and John

459
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.646
whispering about
at the hospital?

460
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:41.294
I don't know what
you're talking about.

461
00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:42.798
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

462
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:44.484
You fucking selfish prick.

463
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.235
Let me tell you something.

464
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:52.118
Mom had to bury one son
'cause of his fucking ego.

465
00:22:52.413 --> 00:22:55.450
Don't make it two in
the same fucking week.

466
00:22:55.749 --> 00:22:57.589
You don't think I don't
know what John's up to?

467
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.246
He's mind fucking you.

468
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.496
You done?

469
00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.255
I got more to say to you.

470
00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.633
You bring any fucking
pain into her house

471
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.338
any more than she's been
through.

472
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.970
You bring any trouble
in here and guess what?

473
00:23:12.266 --> 00:23:14.848
I'm gonna be the one who
fucking turns your ass in.

474
00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:16.304
Oh. you want revenge?

475
00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:17.263
You're a fucking man.

476
00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:18.268
It wasn't about me

477
00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:19.223
it's about him

478
00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:20.625
yeah. what are you gonna do?

479
00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:21.649
You gonna bring him back?

480
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.321
This is the stupidity that
fucking got him killed

481
00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:26.068
in the fucking first place.

482
00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.237
What are you gonna do?

483
00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:30.443
Get yourself fucking killed.

484
00:23:31.994 --> 00:23:33.263
Is everything all right in here?

485
00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:34.743
Yeah. it's okay. mom.

486
00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.492
Yeah. mom. we're. uh...

487
00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:41.621
We were just getting stirred up.

488
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.003
We're talking about
the good old days.

489
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.224
Morning.

490
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:09.569
Hey. gentlemen.

491
00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:13.566
How you feeling?

492
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:15.405
I've felt better

493
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.407
let's get this started.

494
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.451
My name is Jerry rifkin
from internal affairs.

495
00:24:23.754 --> 00:24:25.369
This is lieutenant
Michael rullan.

496
00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:26.913
Please state your name. rank.

497
00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:28.672
and precinct you're assigned to.

498
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:31.926
My name is detective Chris
Jones. 115th precinct.

499
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:33.711
All right. Chris.
can you tell us

500
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.720
what happened on the
night of June 16th?

501
00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:38.508
Yes

502
00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:41.927
a friend and I were
coming out of a bodega

503
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:45.314
where we were approached by
two plain clothes officers.

504
00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.489
How'd you know they were
plain clothes officers?

505
00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:50.102
One was wearing badge
beads around his neck

506
00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:52.988
all right. go on.

507
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.989
Detective McKenzie. rest
in peace. approached me.

508
00:24:57.287 --> 00:24:59.448
Though they were
both asking for ID.

509
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.909
detective McKenzie
seemed overly aggressive

510
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.621
for it to be
identification check.

511
00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.045
Then I spoke in
code to his partner

512
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:12.629
and I asked him if a call
had come in from central.

513
00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:16.141
He glanced over at me as
if he knew the language.

514
00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:20.016
That's when detective
McKenzie remained stoic

515
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.800
and things got confrontational.

516
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.469
You said confrontational

517
00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:25.012
what are you referring to?

518
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:31.936
The friend that I was
with stated to me verbatim

519
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.854
"talk to your fucking people.”

520
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:35.438
Detective MacKenzie must've felt

521
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:38.067
that he was directing his
frustration towards him.

522
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.534
That's when he stated
back to my friend.

523
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:45.996
"watch your fucking mouth
before I crack you in it."

524
00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:49.287
I stated to him. "you think
that badge grants you the merit

525
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.205
to talk to people that way?”

526
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.922
Detective McKenzie's
face remained aloof

527
00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:58.712
as if he had already
made his future decision.

528
00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:03.638
While all of this is happening.
I'm still looking for my ID.

529
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:07.309
I tell him that it must be in
the truck across the street.

530
00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:10.600
He glances over it.
but to no avail

531
00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:13.645
did any of them
take the initiative

532
00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:17.986
to validate my reasoning for
the identification delay.

533
00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:26.286
At that time his partner...

534
00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:33.130
He notices my backup weapon
and he yells out "gun."

535
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.592
And I said to him. "I'm a cop.”

536
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:40.755
"Don't shoot. I'm a cop.”
that's what I said.

537
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.685
Detective McKenzie
takes out his firearm

538
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.140
and he fires two shots at me.

539
00:26:48.232 --> 00:26:49.517
One hitting me in my body armor

540
00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:51.728
and the second one
penetrating in my hip.

541
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:56.237
I then returned fire
striking detective McKenzie

542
00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:57.942
while I'm on the ground.

543
00:26:58.242 --> 00:26:59.242
Two shots

544
00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:08.369
All right.

545
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:10.229
Is there anything
else you'd like to say

546
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.876
before we close
out this interview?

547
00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:20.465
I just wanna send my
condolences out to his family.

548
00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:23.839
All right.

549
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:25.508
We bring this
interview to a close.

550
00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:28.143
Time is now 11:14 am

551
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.768
You think just
because you got a badge

552
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:37.257
lets you talk to
people like that?

553
00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:38.883
Gives you the merit to
speak to people like that?

554
00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.022
Yes. it does.

555
00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:41.645
Don't shoot. I'm a cop.

556
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:42.942
That's what I said.

557
00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:44.245
I'm a cop.

558
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:52.292
Don't shoot. I'm a cop.

559
00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:21.134
Has anyone got
word back from Chris?

560
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:22.944
Today he went for
his I ad interview.

561
00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:24.243
Oh. that's right.

562
00:28:24.411 --> 00:28:25.811
Yeah. not today.
We spoke yesterday.

563
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:27.569
I said we'd all come
by to cheer him up.

564
00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:31.019
You guys see how they're
rioting in different cities

565
00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:32.783
'cause unarmed black
men are being killed.

566
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:34.576
Fucking crazy.

567
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.357
It's scary because
there's so many good cops

568
00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.871
out here honoring the badge.

569
00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:39.210
Yeah. it's true.

570
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:41.420
It may sound crazy but
the good ones are looked

571
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.480
at even worse than the
ones abusing the badge

572
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:45.174
and that's because
we turn an open eye

573
00:28:45.474 --> 00:28:46.874
instead of doing
something about it.

574
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.766
Look. don't get me wrong.

575
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:51.472
Some of these perps
that we arrest.

576
00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:53.103
you wanna turn an open eye

577
00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.459
and put your hands
and feet on them.

578
00:28:54.483 --> 00:28:56.519
Yeah I would if I was
into that type of force.

579
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:59.138
Those would be the ones that
are your rapist and molesters.

580
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:00.321
You don't kill them

581
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:01.694
that's true

582
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.776
you know. it's a
gift and a curse.

583
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:06.887
Hey. what time we
headed over to Chris'?

584
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.902
I need to get home
to prepare dinner.

585
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:11.618
Oh. let's meet up like seven
being that it's Friday.

586
00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:12.917
Okay. great. Sound good?

587
00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:14.687
- See you guys later?
- All right.

588
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:16.031
- Get home safe.
- Yeah.

589
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.087
Oh my god. I still can't
believe what happened.

590
00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:20.543
Yeah. it's bullshit.

591
00:29:20.842 --> 00:29:22.582
That it is. That it is.

592
00:29:25.264 --> 00:29:26.944
Them shits gon' get
you too high. my nigga.

593
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.346
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:29.722
I don't fuck with that shit

595
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:31.508
them niggas better
not violate though.

596
00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:32.847
I'm telling you. man.

597
00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:34.146
Straight up.

598
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.439
Yo. man.

599
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:37.939
I don't think we even gotta
fucking wear this shit. man.

600
00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:39.235
You know what I'm saying?

601
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:42.395
Yo. man. who gives a fuck
what you think. my nigga?

602
00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:43.698
You know what I'm saying?

603
00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:47.237
Listen. I don't agree with
half of this shit out here.

604
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:48.901
But I listen

605
00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:50.204
you know what I'm saying?

606
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:52.866
Yo

607
00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.201
What up. cuz?

608
00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:55.206
What's going on with you?

609
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.207
What's popping. man?

610
00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:57.208
Just trying to stay sucker free.

611
00:29:57.504 --> 00:29:58.118
That's all. you know.

612
00:29:58.422 --> 00:29:59.422
That's all you can do.

613
00:29:59.506 --> 00:29:59.995
Aight. aight.

614
00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:01.584
What's up?

615
00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:02.372
What's good. man?

616
00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:03.945
When your brother
suave come home?

617
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:04.583
He still got about three to do.

618
00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.217
- Damn.
- Short.

619
00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:07.218
Three?

620
00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:08.094
That's what it is.

621
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.390
Shit. he'll be home soon.

622
00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:12.007
I know your ass was shook when
them shots ran out though.

623
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.931
It take you to say
something like that. right?

624
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.313
But to answer your question.
you damn right I was.

625
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:19.643
I'm a working man.

626
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.150
I ain't used to having guns
and shit pulled in my face.

627
00:30:22.446 --> 00:30:23.686
especially by the motherfuckers

628
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.112
that's supposed to
protect and serve me.

629
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:27.408
You feel me?

630
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:29.775
Nigga. I don't feel you.

631
00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:32.672
You know I'm only fucking
with you. my nigga.

632
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.451
I know. nigga. I know.
You already know. nigga.

633
00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.377
Good morning. sir.

634
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.213
I have something for you.

635
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.932
You can't be serious.

636
00:30:54.227 --> 00:30:55.717
First degree murder?

637
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.310
Do you love your job?

638
00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:00.063
You know what?

639
00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:04.227
Ponder that before you answer
and bring me a real case.

640
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:13.277
You know they're talking about

641
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.224
trying to bring charges
up against you. right?

642
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:17.079
Yeah. tell me about it.

643
00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:20.368
My lawyer told me
something like that.

644
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.126
Also told me not
to worry about it.

645
00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:23.502
I don't get it.

646
00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.879
If this were vice versa.

647
00:31:25.175 --> 00:31:26.569
it would have been
considered a friendly fire.

648
00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:27.878
Yeah.

649
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:28.792
Give a fuck. cops. come on.

650
00:31:29.096 --> 00:31:32.259
All I can say is that
today is a new day.

651
00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:33.557
Is 117?

652
00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:35.553
As long as you address
your deepest sympathy

653
00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:38.764
to the McKenzie family
and made peace with god.

654
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.650
amen.

655
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:43.936
Yeah. that's true.

656
00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:47.269
So how did the
I.A.D. Briefing go?

657
00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:50.772
Better than I anticipated.

658
00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:53.158
Yeah. you know the
drill. you know.

659
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.819
What happened before
the fatal shot?

660
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.906
What they really
wanted to know was

661
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:01.495
at what point in time did
I state that I was a cop?

662
00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:03.398
That's exactly
what they wanted to hear.

663
00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:05.458
Everything else was
circumstantial to their ears.

664
00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:06.757
You know it.

665
00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:08.444
Yeah. I'm just happy you
wore your body armor.

666
00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:10.488
Yeah. well you're gonna have
to thank Jackie for that

667
00:32:10.512 --> 00:32:13.970
because she makes me wear it.
ugh. everywhere besides bed.

668
00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:15.881
Damn right 'cause
you never know.

669
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:18.766
Well. I'd say she just
proved a point. huh?

670
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:20.302
Enough said.

671
00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.562
It's just ridiculous
because you know.

672
00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:26.601
we take this job with the
notion to protect people.

673
00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.319
Then we. as cops
have to come home

674
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:34.825
and hear our child ask us do
white cops hate black people.

675
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.235
It's crazy.

676
00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:37.723
That's what she
said to us the other day.

677
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:39.362
- Are you serious?
- Man. now that hurts.

678
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:42.157
And what's sad is that
not every white cops

679
00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:43.621
have those hateful feelings.

680
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.162
The moral of it all is that
we have a job to uphold.

681
00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:51.175
and before we go out there
and perform our duties.

682
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.836
get down on our knees and
you thank god for waking up.

683
00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.139
That's right.

684
00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:56.387
We kiss our loved ones.

685
00:32:57.601 --> 00:33:00.308
And we tell ourselves
at the end of the day

686
00:33:00.604 --> 00:33:04.062
that we are gonna make it
home one way or another.

687
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:07.308
Yeah

688
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:09.522
well. it's getting late.

689
00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:12.859
Yeah. I agree.

690
00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:14.739
Jackie. it's always
good to see you.

691
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.530
Help me up. Help me up.

692
00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.549
When's the next time I
see you to the range?

693
00:33:19.748 --> 00:33:21.909
You might see.
I need to be on this morning.

694
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:23.209
I'll let you know.

695
00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:24.376
Yeah. okay.

696
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:25.704
Careful.

697
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:27.044
I hope you see us

698
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:28.316
back out there
sooner than later.

699
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.580
You know that

700
00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:31.589
continue getting that
work comp disability

701
00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:33.466
or whatever you've
been getting there.

702
00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:34.842
You crazy.

703
00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:36.138
Get out of my house.

704
00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:37.181
Have a good night.

705
00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:44.428
Y'all get home safe.

706
00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:01.987
We are gathered
here to praise god

707
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.372
to witness to our faith
and to give thanks

708
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:08.252
for the life of our
dear brother Peter.

709
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:11.710
Blessed are the dead who die
in the lord says the spirit

710
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.291
for they rest from their labors

711
00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:18.837
and their works follow them
all the days of their life.

712
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.553
Are there members of the family

713
00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:25.810
who would like to offer
any last words for Peter?

714
00:34:32.654 --> 00:34:34.690
He wanted to make a difference

715
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.947
how proud he was to
serve as an officer

716
00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:43.487
in the New York City
police department.

717
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:48.533
You will be missed. my son.

718
00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:52.546
Now people of god is to
go forth upon this day

719
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:54.126
and upon this hour.

720
00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:56.925
We live into the
blessing and the service

721
00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.508
and the life of Peter
that as he helped

722
00:35:00.807 --> 00:35:04.049
and blessed this world. we
go forth with the same spirit

723
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:07.139
within our hearts
and upon our souls.

724
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:09.600
From this day forward
and forevermore.

725
00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:11.271
Amen.

726
00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:41.044
How you coming along?

727
00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:42.633
I'm okay. captain.

728
00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:44.513
Just one day at a time.

729
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.849
It's a sad day for us all.

730
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.100
Why are you here?

731
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.060
Why?

732
00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.605
You're not one of us.

733
00:36:17.634 --> 00:36:20.626
Detective Jones. is there
anything you'd like to say?

734
00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:24.092
How do you feel about the loss
of detective Peter McKenzie?

735
00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:28.141
Do you feel this whole
incident was racially motivated

736
00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:30.597
due to all the unarmed
African American men

737
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:31.897
who are being gunned down

738
00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:33.558
in this country by
police officers?

739
00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.223
Please

740
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.983
you as an African
American detective.

741
00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.599
what do you think
needs to be done

742
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:41.814
to address this senseless
violence against latino

743
00:36:42.117 --> 00:36:43.477
and African American
men by police?

744
00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:45.533
Accountability.

more questions.

766
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:23.047
Good morning.

You nervous?

768
00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:32.684

The time is 10030 am.

770
00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:42.393
The day June 30th. 2018.

00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:46.404
My name is internal affairs
detective Jerry rifkin.

772
00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:49.406
This is lieutenant
Michael rullan.

773

775
00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:57.869
My name is officer
David Mitchell

776
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:00.080
and I'm assigned to
the 12th precinct.

777
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.871
Can you tell us to the
best of your knowledge

778
00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.961
what happened on the
day of June 16th?

779
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:08.884
My partner officer
Peter McKenzie

780
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.671
and myself were performing a
routine identification stop

781
00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:14.717
when we observed two
African American males

782
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.681
coming out of the bodega
on ninth and 40th Avenue.

783
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:19.892
who appeared to be
loud and disturbing.

784
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:23.816
At that point. we jumped
out of our unmarked cruiser

785
00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.438
and approached the two men.

786
00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:29.188
When you say
appeared to be loud.

787
00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:32.825
can you amplify a little
more on what appeared means?

788
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:35.407
Sure.

789
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:36.707
They were talking loud.

790
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.686
At that point I started
performing a warrant check

791
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.747
on one of the men while
officer McKenzie tried

792
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.083
to contain Chris Jones.
but within five minutes.

793
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.823
Chris John started
acting belligerent

794
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:49.960
and crazy and refused to
surrender his identification.

795
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.922
And at that point I happened
to notice his firearm.

796
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.216
I alerted Peter and
we both drew our guns

797
00:39:56.519 --> 00:39:58.279
and ordered Chris Jones
to lie on the ground.

798
00:39:58.354 --> 00:40:00.140
At that point. it
looked like Chris Jones

799
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.146
was going for his
gun and that's when

800
00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:05.024
officer McKenzie
fired striking Jones.

801
00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:08.645
At any point in time.
did officer Jones state

802
00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:10.779
that he was an officer?

803
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:13.191
No

804
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:21.658
Are you sure that
at no point in time.

805
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:24.703
did officer Jones
state to the best

806
00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:27.748
of your knowledge
that he was a cop?

807
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.379
Not that I can recall

808
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:39.593
You stated when you both
observed officer Chris Jones

809
00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:42.638
and Jason Johnson you were
performing a routine stop.

810
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:44.806
- Correct?
- That is correct

811
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.770
on who?

812
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.856
I'm sorry I don't
understand your question.

813
00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:53.319
On who were you performing a
routine identification stop

814
00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:55.324
when you noticed
officer Chris Jones

815
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.282
and Jason Johnson
appearing to be loud?

816
00:40:58.581 --> 00:40:59.581
On no one.

817
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:01.702
That was our
assigned patrol duty.

818
00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:06.160
I have two more
questions and I'm done.

819
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.378
Do you acknowledge
officer Chris Jones

820
00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:13.214
as your fellow officer?

821
00:41:13.805 --> 00:41:16.217
Of course.
Why would you ask that?

822
00:41:16.516 --> 00:41:18.973
Why didn't you fire your
weapon. officer Mitchell?

823
00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:20.268
Excuse me.

824
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.010
Well. in this report it states.

825
00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.304
you didn't discharge
your weapon. Why?

826
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:27.895
My partner had already
fired striking Jones.

827
00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:31.019
I'm sorry. What...

828
00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:32.937
Are you saying I
didn't do my job?

829
00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:36.741
Officer Mitchell. is there
anything else you'd like

830
00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:38.947
to state before we
close on this inquiry?

831
00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:46.083
No. thank you.

832
00:41:50.258 --> 00:41:52.419
The time is 10:40.

833
00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:54.835
This inquiry has
come to a close.

834
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:14.361
Look at all the stolen
bikes in the pile over here.

That's from where the guy
got shot the other day.

840
00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:25.498
They took the tape
out to put it over it.

841
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:27.033

Again.

907
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:16.421
Fuck you guys doing?

908
00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:18.462
Too easy.

909
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:19.758
What we got. what we got?

910
00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:21.278
What is this? What do you have.
what do you have?

911
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:22.446
The only reason y'all around

912
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.989
this motherfucker
harassing motherfuckers is

913
00:45:24.013 --> 00:45:25.969
because of that dead
ass. lying. racist. cop.

914
00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:27.380
What the fuck did you say?

915
00:45:27.683 --> 00:45:28.843
You heard what he said.

916
00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:30.704
- I'm not talking to you.
- The only reason y'all around

917
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:33.595
this motherfucker is 'cause
of that damn racist cop.

918
00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:35.308
Oh shit.

919
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.391
Come get this nigga.

920
00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:42.270
Oh shit.

921
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.689
That's enough. Fucking bounce
this motherfucker.

922
00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:46.357
Yo. yo. yo.

923
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:48.447
I need backup on 41st Avenue.

924
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:50.202
Right between your fucking eyes

925
00:45:50.498 --> 00:45:52.238
and nobody here will
know the better.

926
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:56.083
He ain't do nothing.

927
00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:01.460
We need equal standards
around here. man.

928
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:04.375
Calm him down. man.
Yo. he ain't do nothing.

929
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.670
Fucking finish your life
right now. motherfucker.

930
00:46:06.973 --> 00:46:08.679
I'm sick of this shit

931
00:46:08.975 --> 00:46:09.975
don't shoot

932
00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:11.184
you don't want this.

933
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.310
- Hold up.
- Excuse me.

934
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:15.390
Yo! Hey. they about to shoot me.

935
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.930
Fuck over here on the hood

936
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:18.393
piece of shit

937
00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:27.317
I gotta wrap her hair?

938
00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:28.983
No. she wants her hair down.

939
00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:30.777
This is what she wants

940
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.287
Sabrina. go brush your
teeth before you go to bed.

941
00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:34.947
I already did.

942
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:36.251
Fxcuse me.

943
00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:38.163
Mommy thinks that
you don't know her.

944
00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:42.125
All of a sudden out of nowhere

945
00:46:42.425 --> 00:46:44.461
don't treat me like a boy.

946
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.966
I don't care

947
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:46.876
I don't care

948
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:47.668
tell him again.

949
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:49.087
Chris. get up.

950
00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.139
You're gonna hurt her.
She's a qirl.

951
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:54.175
That's my baby.

952
00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:56.594
Yeah

953
00:46:56.897 --> 00:46:58.433
you know what time it is. right?

954
00:46:58.733 --> 00:46:59.347
Yes

955
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.650
bedtime

956
00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:02.391
- bedtime.
- Give mommy a kiss.

957
00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:06.529
Fun. fun. fun.
Goodnight. sweetie.

958
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.314
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

959
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.195
She's getting so big.

960
00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.326
I know. That's your child.

961
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:15.704
I'm not ready for teenage years.

962
00:47:17.752 --> 00:47:19.162
This is it.

963
00:47:19.462 --> 00:47:20.668
You ready?

964
00:47:24.592 --> 00:47:26.457
Not today. What?

965
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:28.501
Dude. I went on a
fucking limb for you

966
00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.964
to get this information.

967
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:31.424
I said I'm not ready!

968
00:47:31.724 --> 00:47:33.160
What are you scared of?
I mean...

969
00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:34.594
Sh. sh. sh. sh.

970
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.601
There's nothing there.

971
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:39.682
Come on. man. Come on.

972
00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:41.126
All right. fuck it. fuck it.

973
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:42.919
You don't wanna fucking do it?
Let's go. Let's go.

974
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:44.649
- Come on. man.
- Fucking pussy.

975
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:46.560
Let's go. go.

976
00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:01.788
Lights going over
that manhole cover.

977
00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:04.791
Oh man.

978
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.633
He did say he was a cop
before we opened fire on him.

979
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.460
Pull over to the right.

980
00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:14.588
What did you just say?

981
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.600
License and registration.

982
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:28.664
Yeah. Can you tell me why
you pulled me over?

983
00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:30.187
What?

984
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:32.231
Can you tell me why
you pulled me over?

985
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:40.869
Excuse me. You're free to go.

986
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.829
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

987
00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:46.295
Did you tell internal
affairs the same story?

988
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.251
No. because we had
a beer that night.

989
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:49.791
It was game night.

990
00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.584
Peter was having
trouble at home and

991
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.674
we pulled over to perform a
routine identification stop.

992
00:48:54.974 --> 00:48:56.305
but this guy was hitting Peter

993
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.040
with questions only
a cop would know.

994
00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:00.350
I kept looking over at Peter.

995
00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:03.308
but Peter was off in his
own world being Peter.

996
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:09.067
He even said that his fucking ID

997
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:10.773
was in the truck
across the street

998
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.480
did you validate
that information?

999
00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.137
Did you go across the
street to the truck?

1000
00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:16.961
No. because I was holding
a perp I'd attained.

1001
00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:19.015
Plus I thought maybe he
just knew those questions.

1002
00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:20.620
You know?

1003
00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:23.703
Hey look. I would've never
expected to go the way it did.

1004
00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:27.586
But by then it was
too late anyways.

1005
00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:31.257
I saw his gun and
I alerted Peter.

1006
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.551
He was a cop for
crying out loud.

1007
00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.431
You both ignored him
and a life was taken.

1008
00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:47.389
Two families are broken
because of you both.

1009
00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:06.662
Yeah. Chris.

1010
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.213
Hey. “Welcome back.

1011
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:12.569
Good to see you. man. “Thanks

1012
00:50:12.593 --> 00:50:14.424
feels good to be back. Hey.

1013
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.471
Welcome back. partner.

1014
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:20.847
Hey.

1015
00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:22.583
Thanks for all the
love to all y'all.

1016
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:23.997
Good to see
you back on your feet.

1017
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:25.341
I wouldn't be able
to do it alone.

1018
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:26.687
It's always love.

1019
00:50:26.982 --> 00:50:27.982
Yeah. yeah.

1020
00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:30.149
If I'm not mistaken. I
think you owe me some money.

1021
00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:31.684
This guy and his money.

1022
00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.227
The game. I almost forgot.

1023
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:36.134
Yeah. I knew I was gonna have to
pay the reaper one way or another.

1024
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:38.069
Nah. it's cool.
Glad to have you back.

1025
00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:39.654
Nice.

1026
00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:41.723
You ready to
hit the bricks or what?

1027
00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:42.747
Yeah. let's get it.

1028
00:50:42.915 --> 00:50:43.955
- Let's do it.
- All right.

1029
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.250
See you guys later.

1030
00:50:45.543 --> 00:50:46.077
Be safe out there.

1031
00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:46.911
Yeah. you too.

1032
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:48.747
Detective

1033
00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:50.502
hey. cap.

1034
00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:53.998
It's good to have you back.

1035
00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:55.507
It's good to be back. captain.

1036
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:58.294
Keep your eyes open.

1037
00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.713
Not everybody's in
favor of the turnout.

1038
00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:02.096
Feel me?

1039
00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:03.678
I understand

1040
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.514
good.

1041
00:51:05.813 --> 00:51:07.223
You watch out for each other.

1042
00:51:07.523 --> 00:51:09.229
Of course. cap.

1043
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.232
Get out of here.

1044
00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:15.315
You driving?

1045
00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:16.614
Of course.

1046
00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:25.408
Unbelievable.

1047
00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:27.852
For six months I heard about
how I missed the barbecue.

1048
00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:29.582
'Cause I'm working.

1049
00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:30.878
It's like god forbid.

1050
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:32.582
Yeah. so you better be there.

1051
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:35.497
If I'm not there. I'm gonna
have somebody kicking my ass.

1052
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:36.801
That's right.

1053
00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:38.755
You know the Korean temper.

1054
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:42.470
It's good to have you back here.

1055
00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.097
I appreciate that.

1056
00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:46.638
You been watching the news?

1057
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:50.304
What are you gonna tell me?

1058
00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:53.520
Yeah. I watched the news. but
not that much. I don't know.

1059
00:51:54.737 --> 00:51:56.568
You know what the
news will do to you?

1060
00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:59.150
It'll make you quit this job.

1061
00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:02.570
We don't get enough bad news.

1062
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.510
Go 'head.
What bad news you wanna tell me?

1063
00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.653
It's all over the
news that the cop

1064
00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:09.118
that shot your brother
is back on the beat.

1065
00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:12.910
Yeah. Well that's good
'cause he's a cop.

1066
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.044
He's got mouths to feed.

1067
00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:16.626
He's got a home to go home to.

1068
00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:22.010
It's honorable to
hear you say that.

1069
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.465
Don't get me wrong.

1070
00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:30.015
I love my brother.

1071
00:52:31.857 --> 00:52:33.688
As much as I honor this badge.

1072
00:52:34.943 --> 00:52:36.524
But only the people
that were there

1073
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.685
and god truly know what
happened that night.

1074
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.235
It's not honor

1075
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:47.198
it's accepting the
fate of our decisions.

1076
00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:49.955
And I gotta trust in god's will.

1077
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:56.412
Surrender. right?

1078
00:52:58.634 --> 00:52:59.714
Surrender.

1079
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.970
You know all about surrender.
I would hope. right?

1080
00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:04.929
Surrender. Surrender.

1081
00:53:05.224 --> 00:53:07.340
I'm trying my best
to fucking surrender.

1082
00:53:07.643 --> 00:53:09.179
And the rest of your family?

1083
00:53:09.478 --> 00:53:10.809
They're surrendering?

1084
00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:13.053
Irish catholic
families don't know

1085
00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:15.097
what the fuck surrender means.

1086
00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:18.355
They're surrendering
to the liquor stores

1087
00:53:18.654 --> 00:53:20.485
is what they're
surrendering to these days.

1088
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:22.317
No. they're doing
the best they can.

1089
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:25.232
I love them. I mean. I'm trying.
They're getting there.

1090
00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:29.027
It's Josh that I worry about.

1091
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:32.949
What's going on with Josh?

1092
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.458
It's nothing. I just...

1093
00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:40.998
I worry about him.

1094
00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:48.410
All right. all right.

1095
00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:50.245
- Fucking move.
- All right.

1096
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:52.976
What is that?
What the fuck are we doing?

1097
00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:55.388
Come on. Oh shit.

1098
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:58.057
Look man. I'm not ready.
I think I should go.

1099
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.568
Fuck up and give me
the crowbar. dickhead.

1100
00:54:01.864 --> 00:54:03.695
Give me the crowbar.

1101
00:54:10.038 --> 00:54:11.494
Ah fuck.

1102
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:13.364
Fuck

1103
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:14.947
- fuck is wrong with you?
- Shit.

1104
00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:16.443
- Come over here.
- Fucking hand.

1105
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:17.788
- Fucking baby.
- Fuck.

1106
00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.168
Fuck up.

1107
00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:29.384
Fuck

1108
00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:31.014
come on. dick.

1109
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.425
What are we doing?

1110
00:54:33.729 --> 00:54:35.139
Get the fuck over here.

1111
00:54:35.898 --> 00:54:37.308
Come on. Do you hear that?

1112
00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:39.586
Shut the fuck up.
Look. I think we should go.

1113
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.022
Give me the flag.
So what are you a fucking child?

1114
00:54:42.321 --> 00:54:43.606
Give me the fucking flag.

1115
00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:45.521
Fuck out of here. Come on.

1116
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:46.483
Hurry.

1117
00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:47.784
Fuck

1118
00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:35.036
I'm just so fucking glad that
Sabrina wasn't here. Fuck!

1119
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.538
Where's Sabrina?

1120
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:38.449
She's at her
grandmother's house.

1121
00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:42.002
Can you imagine if she
would've been in there?

1122
00:55:42.297 --> 00:55:45.004
Can you imagine if Sabrina
would have been in the house?

1123
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.790
Got him.

1124
00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:48.425
Oh my god.

1125
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.132
Whoever did this.
left something behind.

1126
00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:52.591
Thank god.

1127
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:54.973
That's good. You take that down
to the lab right now

1128
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.429
and you get that checked out.

1129
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.179
Yeah. asap.

1130
00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:59.686
Look. we're gonna get
this motherfucker. okay.

1131
00:55:59.982 --> 00:56:01.688
Yeah

1132
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:06.149
they're gonna start
to get some looks. okay.

1133
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.066
- This is just pure hate.
- It's okay.

1134
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.365
Nah. that's hate. man.

1135
00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:11.398
I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow.

1136
00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.368
Bye. guys.

1137
00:56:16.373 --> 00:56:18.864
What the fuck is going on?

1138
00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:20.953
It's okay.

1139
00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:25.499
A very emotional day for
Anthony Williamson's family.

1140
00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:29.041
We just received word that
NYPD officer Michael Garrett

1141
00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:31.175
will not face any
criminal charges

1142
00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:33.086
in the shooting
death of Williamson.

1143
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:35.301
He was unarmed at the
time when the officer

1144
00:56:35.601 --> 00:56:38.308
allegedly mistook his
cell phone for a handgun.

1145
00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:40.720
The family members just
left court here minutes ago

1146
00:56:41.023 --> 00:56:43.389
devastated over these
latest developments.

1147
00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:46.183
For now we're live
outside queens criminal court.

1148
00:56:46.486 --> 00:56:48.226
Nicole Johnson. Back to you.

1149
00:56:57.497 --> 00:56:59.328
Hey Garrett.

1150
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:05.995
Get down. get down.
Get on the ground.

1151
00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:07.458
Garrett. Garrett!

1152
00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:09.544
Anybody else hit?

1153
00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:12.050
Anybody else hit?

1154
00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:13.506
Garrett! Medic!

1155
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.119
Stay with me. Secure the area.

1156
00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:16.713
Secure the area!

1157
00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:21.225
The tenants in this neighborhood

1158
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:22.916
are still very upset
that there has been

1159
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.522
10 consecutive days
of no running water.

1160
00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:28.313
Breaking news.

1161
00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:29.923
Officer Michael
Garrett was just killed

1162
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.357
inside his district precinct.

1163
00:57:31.657 --> 00:57:33.022
Oh shit.

1164
00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:35.345
No idea
to what connection the shooter...

1165
00:57:35.369 --> 00:57:36.449
There is a god.

1166
00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:37.745
Ma!

1167
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:40.829
Lord Jesus. why?

1168
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.365
Why would my son go and do that?

1169
00:57:43.669 --> 00:57:45.830
Oh god. all this shooting.

1170
00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.120
It's got to stop.

1171
00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:49.913
There must be a path to justice

1172
00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:51.753
with all this
senseless shooting.

1173
00:57:57.891 --> 00:58:00.098
Mr. mayor.
did you see the news today?

1174
00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:01.394
'Course I did.

1175
00:58:01.603 --> 00:58:03.969
Well. obviously you realize
that we have a broken system.

1176
00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:06.228
And people are starting
to take justice

1177
00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:07.765
into their own hands

1178
00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:09.183
now I get it.

1179
00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:11.147
It has to go
through legislation.

1180
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:13.687
It has to go through congress.

1181
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:16.323
It has to go through the
house and so on and so on.

1182
00:58:16.618 --> 00:58:19.655
But accountability must
be a moral obligation

1183
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:21.555
to the people and it
must start somewhere

1184
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:26.033
and somewhere has to be right
here and right now. Mr. mayor.

1185
00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:27.917
Ses er tee ee

1186
00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:29.453
thank you.

1187
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.373
Congressman. I agree with you.

1188
00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:33.923
Accountability starts here
and I accept that challenge

1189
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:37.382
and the people will know
I accept that challenge

1190
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:39.296
when I start to
implement change.

1191
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:43.262
My moral obligation is to
the people of this city.

1192
00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:46.099
but the fight can't
just be by myself.

1193
00:58:46.398 --> 00:58:48.389
legislature and congress.

1194
00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:50.853
The very people that object
to the way these laws

1195
00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:53.644
are being enforced and
governed are the same people

1196
00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:55.467
that voted for them
in the first place.

1197
00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:56.855
Yes I mean. I'm the first one

1198
00:58:57.159 --> 00:58:58.599
to take responsibility
for my people.

1199
00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:01.034
You know. I am them
and they are me.

1200
00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:04.241
But the reality is.
leadership begins at the top.

1201
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:08.454
It starts at the top.
And you and I both know

1202
00:59:08.754 --> 00:59:11.211
attitude reflects leadership.

1203
00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:14.172
It's time. Mr. mayor.

1204
00:59:15.594 --> 00:59:18.927
Congressmen. know that I
hear the cries for justice.

1205
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.178
Mr. mayor. you hear
my cries for justice.

1206
00:59:21.475 --> 00:59:25.935
but the reality is we
feel the pain just us.

1207
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:28.515
If you'll excuse me. gentlemen.

1208
00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:39.447
Chris!

1209
00:59:39.743 --> 00:59:41.529
Come down here before
your food gets cold.

1210
00:59:43.622 --> 00:59:45.542
I'm so proud of you that
you ate your food today.

1211
00:59:45.665 --> 00:59:47.496
Thank you. mommy.

1212
00:59:47.793 --> 00:59:51.160
Did you pack my money
in my bag for my trip?

1213
00:59:51.463 --> 00:59:52.703
Yes. I have.

1214
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:55.998
You have badgered
me about it morning.

1215
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:57.791
noon and night. little girl.

1216
00:59:58.095 --> 00:59:59.926
You're the best. mommy.

1217
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:01.822
Okay. and you're the
best seven year old.

1218
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.175
Chris!

1219
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.969
Hey baby. did
you see what I saw?

1220
01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.388
Who the hell is knocking
at the door like?

1221
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.397
Officers.

1222
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.058
Hello.

1223
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.353
Wait. hey. Chris.

1224
01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.146
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hold up.

1225
01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.655
Come here. baby.

1226
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:21.951
What's the problem?

1227
01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:23.244
Good morning.

1228
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.906
My name is detective Jack mullen

1229
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.045
and this is my partner
detective Keith Edwards.

1230
01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.482
No. I didn't ask you your names.
I asked you why you're here.

1231
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.366
I'm sorry. but we
don't make the rules.

1232
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.456
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

1233
01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.666
Respect you as one of us.

1234
01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.126
With that being said.

1235
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:40.167
We won't treat you any
less than your rank

1236
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.960
and we won't handcuff you.

1237
01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:45.923
What is detective Chris
Jones being charged for?

1238
01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.226
We don't know

1239
01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.792
our orders were only
to bring him in.

1240
01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:49.974
That's all we know. sargent.

1241
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.686
That's all you know?

1242
01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.688
This is some bullshit.

1243
01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.440
This... this is ridiculous

1244
01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:57.896
hey. hey. shhh.

1245
01:00:58.196 --> 01:00:59.732
It's okay.

1246
01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:03.239
Don't you worry.
Look. Hey. don't you worry.

1247
01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.900
You know what to do

1248
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.662
don't touch me. man.

1249
01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:15.794
Yo. how you feel about
that situation. Jay?

1250
01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.171
What they trying to give
you some stupid ass payout

1251
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:19.922
for some mental
anguish or something?

1252
01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.218
Yeah. I wish.

1253
01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.877
Look. all he worried about is
me never missing a day's work.

1254
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.701
Yo. you know what my
boss had the nerve

1255
01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.047
to say to me the other day?

1256
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.965
"Watch the people
you keep around you

1257
01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:31.100
"because if you miss
another day at work.

1258
01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.387
I'ma have to find
somebody to replace you."

1259
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.646
Typical plantation talk. see.

1260
01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.523
I hate that cracker.
Word to my mother.

1261
01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.650
It ain't all what it seems.

1262
01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:40.946
Read the newspaper.

1263
01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.199
What the fuck he talking
about read the newspaper?

1264
01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:45.402
Everybody know that
they lock Chris up

1265
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.283
for killing that devil.

1266
01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.288
Could they even do that?
Ain't he a police officer?

1267
01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:51.662
Easy. Just do it.

1268
01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.577
Exactly.
Shit ain't gonna be real to them

1269
01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.209
until we start murdering these
motherfucking crackers. man.

1270
01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:58.369
Start shooting them
unarmed white kids

1271
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:00.626
yeah. you ain't never lie.

1272
01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.006
Them some wicked folks

1273
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.509
yeah. I was looking at this
farrakhan video last night.

1274
01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.420
Like basically he went on to say

1275
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.635
how if the legal justice
system fucked up.

1276
01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.096
the next step is to
result in violence.

1277
01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.555
I isten

1278
01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:16.392
I don't never agree
with nothing he say.

1279
01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.683
but I can honestly
say I definitely agree

1280
01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.317
with this one right here.

1281
01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:22.733
I fucks with farrakhan. man.

1282
01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:23.864
Fuck that. Yeah word.

1283
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.384
Before I got my flag. I
had knowledge of self.

1284
01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.345
He was always dropping bombs
about racism and them devils.

1285
01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:30.736
but then when his man
Khalid Muhammad got smoked

1286
01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.530
and he didn't respond. that's
when I fell back on him.

1287
01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.119
Yeah. I heard about
that with Khalid.

1288
01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.626
I fucked with Khalid.
but that's like me

1289
01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.628
not riding out for
the peoples. man.

1290
01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.414
Never would I do that.

1291
01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:43.903
All right 'cuz. you see?

1292
01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:46.964
What up. cuz?

1293
01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.699
- What up. og?
- What's happening?

1294
01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.304
Cuz. what's up?
What's happening?

1295
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.200
Justice. let me holla
at you right quick.

1296
01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:53.975
Come on. let's talk about it.

1297
01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.728
Oh boy.

1298
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.368
Daddy.

1299
01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:13.664
Hey. Princess.

1300
01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.572
Woo. how was your day”?

1301
01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.537
Good.
Mommy made a surprise for you.

1302
01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:20.202
She did?

1303
01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.917
Yup. but you have to promise me

1304
01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.672
you won't tell her I told you.

1305
01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.083
Oh. I don't know.

1306
01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.106
You know. we don't keep
secrets around here.

1307
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.336
You know that

1308
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.924
aw

1309
01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.681
Okay. you can tell me.

1310
01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:34.977
What is it?

1311
01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.308
Red velvet cake.

1312
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.639
What?

1313
01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:38.939
My favorite.

1314
01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:41.644
Kimberly. where are you?

1315
01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.649
I should have known
when she disappeared.

1316
01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:44.945
- Hey baby.
- Hi_

1317
01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:46.196
How was your day?

1318
01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.654
Interesting.

1319
01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.189
All right. well get cleaned up.

1320
01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.492
Dinner is ready.

1321
01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.408
Okay. I'm hungry.

1322
01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:53.704
Papa's hungry.

1323
01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:54.913
Oh. and another thing.

1324
01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.033
Yeah?

1325
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.198
I'll just tell you at the table.

1326
01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.866
Oh. okay.

1327
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.035
Kimberly. come.
Help me set the table. okay?

1328
01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:03.875
Okay. Okay.

1329
01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.381
Oh man.

1330
01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:32.900
You didn't tell your father
what we made for him. did you?

1331
01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.238
Huh?

1332
01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.277
Kimberly?

1333
01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.331
I tried to keep it a
secret. but it's hard.

1334
01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.333
Daddy gets everything out of me.

1335
01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.371
Your father is your
kryptonite to Superman.

1336
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.673
What's that?

1337
01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.415
What's that?

1338
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.380
That's I love you!

1339
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.175
All right. before we can eat.

1340
01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:56.595
it's your turn to say grace.

1341
01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.258
Okay.

1342
01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:02.554
Thank you god for this
good food mommy cooked.

1343
01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:05.223
Oh. and the red
velvet cake for daddy.

1344
01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.392
Yaaay!

1345
01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:09.026
Oh boy. this looks delicious.

1346
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.278
Papa is hungry.

1347
01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:12.859
Thank you.

1348
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.649
Can you cut my chicken?

1349
01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.097
Sure. just pass your plate.

1350
01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:17.201
I'm not the cupcake.

1351
01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:18.577
You're the cupcake.

1352
01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:22.115
You're my two favorite
women in the whole world.

1353
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.666
Oh wow.

1354
01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:29.752
I et's eat

1355
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.891
What'd you wanna tell me?

1356
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.805
I have nothing to say.

1357
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:47.849
I just wanna ask you
how you're feeling.

1358
01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:50.314
It seems like you have
a lot on your mind.

1359
01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.944
Yeah

1360
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.801
I can tell this guy
thinks I'm against him.

1361
01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.066
Try not to let it worry you.

1362
01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.575
Like you always say to me.

1363
01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:59.827
You have your strategy.

1364
01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:01.829
Mm hm. But I think in this case.

1365
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.242
it flares up some
extenuating circumstances.

1366
01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.746
Do you got this. babe?

1367
01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:12.085
You know. at no point
in the interview

1368
01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:17.425
did officer Mitchell refer to
detective Jones as an officer.

1369
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.427
And two. he never
discharged his weapon.

1370
01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:22.558
Why wouldn't he
discharge his weapon?

1371
01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:25.687
I don't know what to tell
you when it comes to that.

1372
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.018
Yeah. selective memory.

1373
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.854
A lot of these young
cops are never screened

1374
01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.019
for mental evaluation

1375
01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.359
they've been bullied as kids

1376
01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.444
or they're just
fucking closet racist.

1377
01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:38.824
Well

1378
01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.912
that's good that you're
the one on the job.

1379
01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.915
And you know I don't
like closet racists.

1380
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:46.916
Really?

1381
01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.497
I did not know that

1382
01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.752
really?

1383
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.193
Thank you for that velvet cake.

1384
01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:53.878
You're so welcome.

1385
01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.511
How you feeling?

1386
01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.257
Let me tell you. cap.

1387
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.425
I'm not gonna be taking that.

1388
01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:05.764
- Cap.
- No

1389
01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.304
look captain. it's protocol.

1390
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.063
- It's totally...
- It's protocol.

1391
01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.940
Conversation is
totally off the record.

1392
01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:12.817
Yes it is

1393
01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:18.568
I can't sit around and
feel like I'm participating

1394
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.950
in this whole ordeal

1395
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:22.531
it has to stop.

1396
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.700
You are a great detective.

1397
01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.914
Your safety is my concern.

1398
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.249
Now don't get me wrong.

1399
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.429
My pain goes out to the
McKenzie family as well.

1400
01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.754
but there's too
much at stake here.

1401
01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.550
So.

1402
01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.931
From this point on...

1403
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.354
You are officially relieved
from your duty as detective.

1404
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:54.271
Starting effectively today you
will be assigned desk duty.

1405
01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:01.525
Something tells me you're
gonna be needing this.

1406
01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:29.886
I was thinking about having
dinner for the holidays

1407
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.180
at my place this year.

1408
01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.183
Okay. good.

1409
01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.818
Thank you.

1410
01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.825
What happened to your hand?

1411
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120
Huh?

1412
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.736
What happened to your hand?

1413
01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:49.499
I cut it

1414
01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.207
it's no big deal.

1415
01:08:54.422 --> 01:08:55.422
We good?

1416
01:08:55.632 --> 01:08:56.963
Yeah. we're good.

1417
01:08:57.258 --> 01:08:58.373
All right.

1418
01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.502
Is everything all
right here with him?

1419
01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:03.805
Yes.

1420
01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:05.763
Why do you ask?

1421
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:10.017
How you doing. pop?

1422
01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.553
Morning to you. son.

1423
01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:14.598
It's not so good to me.

1424
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.061
Let me get out of here.

1425
01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:21.696
Love you. mom.

1426
01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:25.240
See you later. pop.

1427
01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:28.824
Ease up on the sugar.

1428
01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:32.911
Hey.

1429
01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:35.577
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1430
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.338
Mom and pop are
pretty blank this morning.

1431
01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:42.592
You know. Peter could do
no wrong in their eyes.

1432
01:09:42.887 --> 01:09:44.343
You know that

1433
01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.675
he just keeps playing
it over and over.

1434
01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.556
It's hard to move on.

1435
01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:51.760
They're getting better.

1436
01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:55.228
And you?

1437
01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.265
How you doing?

1438
01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:01.444
Different days.
different feelings.

1439
01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:08.198
So tell me. did Josh tell you
what happened to his hand?

1440
01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:12.079
Oh. he said something about
cutting it on something.

1441
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.617
but I don't really
get into it with him.

1442
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.455
I get it.

1443
01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.708
Let me get out of here.

1444
01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:21.167
I love you. Okay.

1445
01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:22.627
I love you.

1446
01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.219
How are you?

1447
01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.353
What's the word on Chris?

1448
01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:38.480
I know. I know.

1449
01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:40.336
Me and my husband was
talking last night

1450
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.189
about how easy it can
be swept under the rug

1451
01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.069
when they the ones
behind the gun.

1452
01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.401
And I love my job.

1453
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:50.910
I really do. Lisa. but when
it comes to my family...

1454
01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:53.321
My baby...

1455
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.532
I'm treading.

1456
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.275
Girl. you ain't gotta tell me.

1457
01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:58.876
- Really treading.
- I know.

1458
01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.412
It's crazy out here.

1459
01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.706
Sometimes I feel...

1460
01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:04.794
You ready to get this work?

1461
01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.459
Get this work. You crazy.

1462
01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.523
- Get out of here.
- Hey sergeant. what's up?

1463
01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.091
- How you doing?
- What's up?

1464
01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:12.427
Let's go. come on.

1465
01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:15.806
Ain't he though?
And he sexy. too.

1466
01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:19.268
You just gotta love him.

1467
01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:22.775
Look. for real though.
You need something. you call me.

1468
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.149
Watch yourselves out there.

1469
01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.609
Safety first.

1470
01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.524
- Love you.
- Love you back.

1471
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.739
- Sarge. you have a good day.
- I will. at home.

1472
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.503
That's great. buddy.

1473
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:48.793
Yo man

1474
01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.303
you know. they giving
little Chris Chris 25 years

1475
01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:52.679
for defending himself. man.

1476
01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.261
Self fucking defense.
Quarter fucking century. nigga.

1477
01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.847
See. that's the
bullshit right there.

1478
01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.147
You know what I mean?

1479
01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.268
I find it real funny
how they can kill us.

1480
01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:04.934
Shoot black cops and shit
like they did ole' boy.

1481
01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:06.238
The cop from queens.

1482
01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.322
That part.

1483
01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.259
And never even see the
entrance of a courtroom.

1484
01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.693
Like what part of
the game is that?

1485
01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.278
Yo bro. pass the blunt. man.

1486
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.116
I hate how they do us.

1487
01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.280
but we have to blame
ourselves too sometimes.

1488
01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.458
Fuck you talking about. Deb?

1489
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.585
Why don't you listen?

1490
01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.959
It's like I said.

1491
01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.045
Them white cops are scared. too.

1492
01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.881
Okay. imagine some of them
growing up in a white school.

1493
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.716
surrounded by all
white students.

1494
01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.095
dreaming of becoming a cop.

1495
01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.028
Never really coming
into contact with blacks

1496
01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:38.635
except through the
social media and news.

1497
01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.179
Right?
Then they pass the cop test.

1498
01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:43.313
Get dropped into areas like ours

1499
01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.816
where people are killing
each other like a sport.

1500
01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:47.977
First person they
come into contact with

1501
01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:49.396
happens to be a flag leader

1502
01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:53.612
with tattoos all over his face
tripping off of this sour.

1503
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.311
Why are you looking at me?

1504
01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:56.496
You know what I'm saying.

1505
01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:57.869
Yeah. I know.

1506
01:12:58.165 --> 01:12:59.371
You blowing mine.

1507
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.123
Listen.
No. listen. she blowing y'all

1508
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:04.206
'cause the fucking
smartphone dumbed you down.

1509
01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:06.917
Look. This ain't fucking
Utah and shit.

1510
01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.252
Some old hick ass shit
where it's only two niggas

1511
01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.383
in the whole goddamn state. man.

1512
01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:13.715
It's the fucking
mecca in the culture.

1513
01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.576
All this shit that's out
here worldwide. nigga.

1514
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.431
This motherfucking
New York. blood.

1515
01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.388
That's a fucking
excuse for them niggas

1516
01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:21.473
to just be fucking stupid. yo.

1517
01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:23.888
They wanna hold something.
Hold these nuts. nigga.

1518
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:25.551
I need something
to get on my feet.

1519
01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:26.973
The best way to get on your feet

1520
01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.349
is to get the fuck off your ass.

1521
01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.067
Blood on that

1522
01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:30.728
if you don't fight
for something.

1523
01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.613
you gon' fall for
everything. blood.

1524
01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.069
That's what this truce's for.

1525
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.840
I already beat up that
motherfucking truce.

1526
01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.390
I don't know. Anybody got a
motherfuckin' question about it?

1527
01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.406
Anything? I already beat that
truth is popping like that.

1528
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:43.520
Nana. you finished them
taters back there and shit?

1529
01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:44.829
This shit ain't even lit

1530
01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:46.273
y'all niggas hungry?

1531
01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:48.834
Trigger. you ain't stupid
like some people. all right.

1532
01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:51.499
One thing I can say that
speaks volumes to young people

1533
01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:54.293
and cops is that we
can come together.

1534
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.096
That truce slash
unity that you have

1535
01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.474
with croft and them
crips supports that.

1536
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.852
That shit speaks volumes
to people like me.

1537
01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:04.917
but they're scared of that shit.
And you wanna know why?

1538
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:05.305
Why?

1539
01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:07.169
Because they don't like
blacks coming together

1540
01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:09.104
because we're too influential

1541
01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.359
you know it. I know it.

1542
01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:13.396
Look at how hip hop
affected their children

1543
01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.031
with listening to hip
hop. dealing with racism.

1544
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.902
They're not so much scared
of the guns that we bust off.

1545
01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.992
They're scared of us uniting.

1546
01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:26.204
My bitch deep.

1547
01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:29.291
See that? You go. girl.

1548
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.627
Boy please. you're my bitch.

1549
01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.727
Don't try to impress
trigger because you know.

1550
01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.346
Shit.

1551
01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:43.134
Blood sample that was
submitted last week

1552
01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.052
came back inconclusive.

1553
01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.854
So the blood sample
is from a human.

1554
01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.606
not an animal. correct?

1555
01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.142
That is correct.

1556
01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.233
The only problem is
that person's name

1557
01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.277
isn't in our system.

1558
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.286
That is correct.

1559
01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:05.740
Do me a favor

1560
01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.079
have it run through
an ncic check.

1561
01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:09.994
Something might come up.

1562
01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:11.297
Got jt.

1563
01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.202
You didn't think I fucking had
it like that. you cocksucker.

1564
01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:24.037
You got this one. partner.
I'll see you outside.

1565
01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:25.722
I'll see you later.

1566
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.294
Yeah. don't worry.

1567
01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:57.879
Appreciate it.

1568
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.840
We good?

1569
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.630
All right.

1570
01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:08.553
Got you now. fuck boy.

1571
01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:10.016
Fuck you.

1572
01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.480
I can't Walt.

1573
01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:21.144
You're like a fucking child.

1574
01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.574
- Get the fuck out.
- Goddamn.

1575
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.781
Fucking take a
piss every five minutes.

1576
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.280
Yeah. just leave my door open.

1577
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.539
Fucking jerk off.

1578
01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.203
Fuck man. I'm
pissing all over myself.

1579
01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.543
Let's go. dick.

1580
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:37.922
Oh.

1581
01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:39.584
Oh.

1582
01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.752
Oh fuck.

1583
01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.376
Let's go. All right. man.

1584
01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.013
Fucking jerk.

1585
01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.738
Maybe if we
didn't fucking day drink.

1586
01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:49.848
I wouldn't have to piss so bad.

1587
01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:51.898
Ah. look at this.

1588
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.265
Look at this. you
fucking jerk off.

1589
01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:55.774
Just relax.

1590
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.839
Look. I'm just gonna tell
him my brother's a cop.

1591
01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:58.863
we'll get out of this.

1592
01:16:58.948 --> 01:16:59.948
- Yeah. okay.
- Relax.

1593
01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.593
- Let's see if that works.
- Be cool. man. Relax.

1594
01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.097
You had to go to the fucking...

1595
01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.948
'Cause you know what we
got in the fucking back.

1596
01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:08.363
What you got?

1597
01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:10.657
It looks like we're having
a little party here.

1598
01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.960
I was telling him

1599
01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:14.439
that we gotta get back to the
house for my mother's dinner.

1600
01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.623
That you do.

1601
01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:18.130
Let me see some ID.
license. registration.

1602
01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:19.961
You. you pissing
on the sidewalk.

1603
01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.239
You see a sign that says
fucking bathroom on the wall?

1604
01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:24.345
Oh no. officer.
I'm so sorry. man.

1605
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.846
My brother...

1606
01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.450
Oh yeah?
What's your brother's name?

1607
01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:31.264
Kevin McKenzie

1608
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.476
as in detective McKenzie.
brother to Peter?

1609
01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.141
Yes. sir.

1610
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:38.896
I'm sorry for your loss.

1611
01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:40.436
Peter was a friend

1612
01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:42.821
that was hard news. Yeah.

1613
01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:45.358
All right. so. so can we go now?

1614
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.301
All right. here's what we can do

1615
01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:48.823
if there's nothing in the car

1616
01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:50.909
and your identifications
coming back clear.

1617
01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.073
this never happened. okay?

1618
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.749
Okay. cool.

1619
01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:56.660
No. no. why can't
we just go now?

1620
01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:57.578
We're already running late.

1621
01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:58.917
It's still procedure.

1622
01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:00.402
Step out of the car.

1623
01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:02.633
We at the 110 all
sympathize with your loss.

1624
01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.554
Oh. watch out.

1625
01:18:16.984 --> 01:18:18.879
Against the car.
Hands behind your back.

1626
01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:20.768
I need back up on 86th
street and 25th Avenue

1627
01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:22.356
across story boulevard.

1628
01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:24.496
White male wearing black
tee shirt. blue jeans.

1629
01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.073
Possibly armed.

1630
01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:48.217
Come on. man.

1631
01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.547
He's being printed.
All right. do me a favor.

1632
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.571
Take detective McKenzie
over to see officer Fuller.

1633
01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:07.531
All right.
Detective. sorry for your loss.

1634
01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.441
Your brother and I
were good friends.

1635
01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.952
Thank you. Appreciate that.

1636
01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:14.989
What's Josh being charged with?

1637
01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:17.374
Right now we didn't
put him through.

1638
01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.956
All in good faith because
you're his brother.

1639
01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.081
They found two guns
in the back of a car

1640
01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:25.545
owned by a guy named
John macintosh.

1641
01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:28.339
The car isn't under
your brother's name.

1642
01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.220
You see where I'm
going with this?

1643
01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.472
I see.
Where's John being held now?

1644
01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.168
John took a run for
it at the scene.

1645
01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.851
He got away.

1646
01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.554
Okay. Thank you.

1647
01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.438
Can I get a minute with him?

1648
01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.440
Sure. Take your time.

1649
01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.226
I appreciate that.

1650
01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:52.276
Sit down! Sit the fuck down now!

1651
01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.101
What were you and John planning
on doing with those guns?

1652
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.285
What guns?

1653
01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:58.949
The guns in the trunk

1654
01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:00.893
of that fucking car
that you both were in.

1655
01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:02.911
That's what guns.

1656
01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:05.206
I told you before.

1657
01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:08.717
You come in here. you bring
any problems to the family.

1658
01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:11.049
and I bust your ass myself.

1659
01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:14.674
Do you think I was
joking with you?

1660
01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:19.220
I really didn't know there
were any guns in the car.

1661
01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.139
Nothing. I didn't know.

1662
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.276
I'm gonna get you
out of this one.

1663
01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:34.784
but if I find out you knew...

1664
01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:39.042
Sit.

1665
01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.870
We have a problem.

1666
01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:45.208
What's the problem?

1667
01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.293
Your brother has an
outstanding warrant.

1668
01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:50.005
An outstanding warrant for what?

1669
01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.545
You're not gonna believe this.

1670
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.471
Josh's fingerprints
were found at the scene

1671
01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.968
of the detective that's accused
of killing your brother.

1672
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.392
Are you fucking kidding me?

1673
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.807
The media's gonna have a
fucking field day with this.

1674
01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:17.076
I just found out how
you cut your hand.

1675
01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.455
What?

1676
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.918
Notify the district precinct
who put the warrant out.

1677
01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:26.750
You gotta be kidding me. man.

1678
01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:30.048
What do you wanna
do about this situation?

1679
01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:31.337
Charge him.

1680
01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:34.128
What? Hey. Come on. man.

1681
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:36.012
Come on. Kevin

1682
01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:39.266
Kevin. come on. man. Kevin.

1683
01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:42.848
Come on. man. I'm your brother.

1684
01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.147
Come on. Get me out of here.

1685
01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:47.603
Kevin!

1686
01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.077
Hold your head. my nigga.

1687
01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.488
I'm trying.

1688
01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:01.951
Yo du. you good?

1689
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.082
Why. what's up?

1690
01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:15.545
Don't worry 'bout them. They
ain't gonna do shit. Fuck 'em.

1691
01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:17.429
What's up?

1692
01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.055
You guys got some ID on you?

1693
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.262
I look like a kid to you?

1694
01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:23.427
Come on now. boys.

1695
01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.730
- You heard what he said.
- Yeah. what's happening?

1696
01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.101
Fuck you gonna do?

1697
01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:28.761
You don't have
nothing better to do

1698
01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.184
than harass these kids out here?

1699
01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:32.523
Yo. you see my man
grandmom's out here. right?

1700
01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.342
Damn. man.
That's somebody's grandmother.

1701
01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:35.468
Y'all being real disrespectful.

1702
01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:37.303
And she needs to watch her
mouth before she gets locked up. too.

1703
01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.264
Yo. watch how you talk to my
motherfucking grandmother.

1704
01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.808
Yo. yo. get my
grandmother out of here.

1705
01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.809
- Fuck you gonna do?
- What you mean what I'ma do?

1706
01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:43.948
What the fuck you gonna do?

1707
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:45.251
Yo. yo!

1708
01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.671
Move so I can shoot
this motherfucking cop.

1709
01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:04.145
I need backup.

1710
01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.895
Be advised. my radio is stolen.

1711
01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:15.942
Yo. who the fuck this
nigga coming in here

1712
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.241

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:23.616
Yo. Yo! Ah.

Oh. oh. oh. Better get

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.298
Put that gun down.

No

1727
01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:31.146
I think you're a lying scumbag.

1728
01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:32.556
The fuck you talking about?

1729
01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:35.145
You can tell me now or you
can tell the judge later.

1730
01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:37.645
All right listen. I already
fucking told you everything.

1731
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.341
- Okay?
- You don't fucking tell me now.

1732
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.091
you'll never see your
wife and son again.

1733
01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.989
You know. fuck you and
fuck that nigger cop.

1734
01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:48.288
Listen. Listen. Mitchell.

1735
01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:50.120
You tell me what
the fuck happened

1736
01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.831
on the night of June 16th. Huh?

1737
01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.130
Tell me

1738
01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.917
I already fucking
told you everything.

1739
01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:57.877
I said tell me.

1740
01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:08.095
Weak. man.

1741
01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:10.556
Yo. take care of
yourself out there today.

1742
01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.812
Detective. can
I talk to you for a sec?

1743
01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.393
Hey. cap.

1744
01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.024
Of course.

1745
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:22.318
I'm sure you already know
about the big commotion

1746
01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:24.279
that took place in
your old neighborhood

1747
01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.418
between 110th precinct
and the two rival gangs.

1748
01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:28.536
The bloods and the crips.

1749
01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.914
Yeah. I see where
this is going. cap.

1750
01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:34.246
To make a long story short.

1751
01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:36.628
I just got off the
phone with the 110th

1752
01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.047
and they're asking for your help

1753
01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.299
in retrieving the
radio that was taken

1754
01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:43.795
during that big incident
between them and the two gangs.

1755
01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:47.305
Cap. what makes them think
that I could get it back?

1756
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:49.466
That's not what they're saying.

1757
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.852
It's only a request
with a strong hope

1758
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:55.890
that you'll be able to make
that radio materialize for them.

1759
01:25:57.527 --> 01:25:59.063
You puttin' me at
great risk. cap.

1760
01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:01.319
but if that's what you're
asking me to do then...

1761
01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:03.822
I mean. technically I've
been relieved of my duties.

1762
01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:05.757
I'm supposed to be on
desk duty right now.

1763
01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:07.408
I explained that to them.

1764
01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:08.819
That's one

1765
01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:12.865
and two I would never compromise
nor negotiate your safety.

1766
01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.453
You know that

1767
01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:19.417
this is again. it's a
request all in good faith.

1768
01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:24.217
All right. cap.

1769
01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.674
If that's what you
want me to do then.

1770
01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.016
I'm good.

1771
01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.515
Can I go now? Yes

1772
01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:31.846
no

1773
01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:39.187
Never let the sickness
like race or religion

1774
01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:43.070
of another man's mind be
your crutch for deviating

1775
01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:46.857
from the moral obligation
you still hold to that badge.

1776
01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.698
We all took an oath

1777
01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:53.158
we all share

1778
01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:57.076
now I don't agree
with a lot of politics

1779
01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:59.995
or policies that
our badge protects.

1780
01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:02.206
but I don't make the rules

1781
01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:03.999
I just follow them.

1782
01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:10.088
You got it. cap.

1783
01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.928
You got it.

1784
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:38.579
How you holding up?

1785
01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:40.870
Good. ash.

1786
01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:43.380
I'm okay. Seen better days.

1787
01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.381
How's mom?

1788
01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:47.383
I miss you so much.

1789
01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:51.012
Come on. ash.
Don't cry. You gon' make me cry.

1790
01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.673
I'm sorry.

1791
01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.762
Ma's fine.

1792
01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:56.642
Cries a lot.

1793
01:27:57.522 --> 01:28:00.013
We saw you on the news
and she just broke down.

1794
01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:05.609
Had to do what I did

1795
01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:09.231
couldn't keep coming home
looking ma in the face

1796
01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.650
and just not doing
anything about it.

1797
01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:15.286
Then on top of that them
cops is sitting there

1798
01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:18.244
laughing at us like
they making fun of us.

1799
01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:20.913
I'm not mad at all

1800
01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:22.828
I just wish it could've happened

1801
01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.496
where you didn't get caught.

1802
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.290
Honestly. once I
made peace with god.

1803
01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.675
getting caught was the
least of my worries.

1804
01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.679
I'm okay.

1805
01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.598
I miss Michael. but I ain't
want him to die in vain.

1806
01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.847
You know?

1807
01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.472
Hey. remember when
we was younger

1808
01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.515
and we would go to Nana's house?

1809
01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.309
She'll make that chocolate cake

1810
01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:47.212
and let us mix the
icing off the blender.

1811
01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:48.570
You remember that?

1812
01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:50.230
I remember.

1813
01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:52.149
You and Michael
used to fight over

1814
01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:56.570
who would get the bowl and
Nana would give it to me

1815
01:28:56.873 --> 01:29:00.286
to be fair by not giving
it to neither of you.

1816
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.785
Only if you knew
that I used to start

1817
01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:05.608
with Michael on purpose
'cause you was the little one

1818
01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:07.588
so you would never
beat us to the punch.

1819
01:29:07.884 --> 01:29:09.090
For real?

1820
01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:10.876
Yeah. for real.

1821
01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:14.095
Visit's over.

1822
01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:15.511
Don't go. I have to.

1823
01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:18.016
I have to. ash. all right.
but kiss mommy for me.

1824
01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:20.552
Tell her I love her. okay.
They can't break me.

1825
01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.583
I love you.
All right. I'ma be aight.

1826
01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:23.626
Please don't hurt my brother.

1827
01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:25.561
- I love you.
- Ashley!

1828
01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:26.861
Remember that

1829
01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.702
I'm only doing this
'cause of you. blue.

1830
01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:43.708
This better not be no bullshit.

1831
01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:45.960
I got you. c.

1832
01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:04.349
Check this out. my nigga.

1833
01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.014
I don't talk to police.

1834
01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:08.274
I don't fuck with police.

1835
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:11.027
Only reason I'm doing this
is 'cause you from the hood.

1836
01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.405
Niggas say you 100
so speak on it.

1837
01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:16.949
Now croft. I appreciate
you taking out

1838
01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.906
the time to meet with me.

1839
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:23.327
Now there was an incident
that allegedly occurred

1840
01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:25.583
between the crips and
two detectives

1841
01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:29.371
from the 12th precinct.
which led to a man being shot

1842
01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:31.665
and a police radio being taken.

1843
01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.669
What this shit's about a radio?

1844
01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:36.972
A motherfucking radio?

1845
01:30:37.223 --> 01:30:39.680
What. somebody told you
I was there or some shit?

1846
01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:40.976
Hey.

1847
01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:43.309
Is this a set up or some
bullshit? What's going on?

1848
01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:45.186
Hold up. I'm alone. I'm alone.

1849
01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:47.543
Yeah cuz. what I don't get
is why the fuck you worried

1850
01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.103
about them cracker's
radio so much?

1851
01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:51.267
Aren't they trying to
send you to prison?

1852
01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.821
You know. I asked myself
the same question.

1853
01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:58.187
Why the fuck am I standing with
these people in the battle.

1854
01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.867
but I'm alone in the war?

1855
01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:02.495
And you're right.

1856
01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.032
You're fucking right.

1857
01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:10.378
It's 'cause I took an
oath as you both did.

1858
01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:13.547
Now we may not agree
with all the things

1859
01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:15.379
that happened under that color.

1860
01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:18.011
but we still find a
way to protect it.

1861
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:21.764
which means having a truce
with them red ghost bloods.

1862
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.642
That's to help
things along the way.

1863
01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:28.809
We do what we gotta.

1864
01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.774
I need your help.

1865
01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:37.443
Either I come and get it or
they gonna come and get it

1866
01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.742
and you and I both
know only two things

1867
01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:42.823
are gonna happen if they come.

1868
01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:45.034
That's injustice and injustice.

1869
01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:48.291
Neither's good for business
or for the community.

1870
01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:52.878
Check this out. my nigga.

1871
01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.667
I believe you give
respect. you get respect.

1872
01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:00.804
You had a lot of balls coming
here just fucking with me.

1873
01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:03.598
So I'm gonna do what I can do.

1874
01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:05.258
I put that on the set.

1875
01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.428
I ike I said

1876
01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:11.189
thank you for taking the
time out to meet with me.

1877
01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:13.850
Yeah

1878
01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:15.360
I think we done

1879
01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.611
keep moving.

1880
01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:31.876
What you think. croft?

1881
01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:34.128
Fuck the police. man.

1882
01:32:34.424 --> 01:32:36.005
Fuck 'em.

1883
01:32:42.932 --> 01:32:46.174
I want you to listen to this.

1884
01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:48.469
Check this out.

1885
01:32:48.772 --> 01:32:50.292
I had an idea that he was a cop

1886
01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.389
once he asked us
"why did you stop us"

1887
01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:56.810
and "did a call come
in from central?"

1888
01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.978
He said he was a
cop the whole time.

1889
01:32:59.282 --> 01:33:01.819
Wanted to go get his wallet
from a Jeep across the street.

1890
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:07.195
Mind fucker. huh?

1891
01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:10.115
Got that scumbag.

1892
01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:11.418
You heard it.

1893
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:14.285
I'm demanding a dismissal
and for my client

1894
01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:17.046
to be placed on full. active
duty effective immediately.

1895
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.876
All charges are hereby dropped

1896
01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:23.135
and you are placed back
on full active duty

1897
01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.467
as a detective
effective immediately.

1898
01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:32.221
Hey. thank you
for being there for me.

1899
01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:33.934
I'm trying.

1900
01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.735
Detective Jones. are you
planning on filing a defamation

1901
01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:45.866
of character lawsuit
against the city?

1902
01:33:46.162 --> 01:33:47.572
No comment at this time

1903
01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:48.486
thank you.

1904
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.281
What. if anything. did you
learn from all of this?

1905
01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:53.870
Say something.

1906
01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:55.501
I can't

1907
01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:59.381
you know. I really
enjoy being a detective

1908
01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:03.294
and despite all of
our differences. okay.

1909
01:34:03.596 --> 01:34:06.508
most of all our legal
justice system works

1910
01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.345
once we held them accountable
for their actions.

1911
01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:10.258
Thank you.

1912
01:34:10.562 --> 01:34:11.997
Anything else you
wanna share with us?

1913
01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:14.103
No. thank you.
Excuse us. please. Thank you.

1914
01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.890
Detective. one more question.

1915
01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:15.998
And the world will never rise

1916
01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:18.751
to its full moral.

1917
01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:22.881
or political. or
even social maturity.

1918
01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:28.257
until racism is
totally eradicated.

1919
01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:32.265
Well. it may be true that
morality cannot be legislated.

1920
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.596
but behavior can be regulated.

1921
01:35:35.521 --> 01:35:40.060
It may be true that the law
cannot change the heart.

1922
01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:44.319
but it can restrain
the heartless.

1923
01:35:44.614 --> 01:35:48.448
It may be true that the law
can't make a man love me.

1924
01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:51.450
but it can restrain
him from lynching me

1925
01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:54.954
and I think that is
pretty important also.

1926
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:59.584
And so while the law may not
change the hearts of men.

1927
01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:03.463
it does change the habits of men

1928
01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:06.044
if it's vigorously enforced.

1929
01:36:41.504 --> 01:36:45.713
J it's a difficult
idea to comprehend j

1930

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:07.378
j I don't need to change
myself to fit a mold j

1955
01:38:07.673 --> 01:38:09.834
j I'm not caught up
with them boutiques j

1956
01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:12.170
j 'cause I am special
'cause I'm unique j

1957
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:14.381
j I don't need to
feel accepted j

1958
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.545
j I hope you get the message j

1959
01:38:18.768 --> 01:38:21.805
j so I'm just
gonna love myself &
