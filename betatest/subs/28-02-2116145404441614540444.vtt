THE HOLY LAND. 1177

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:19.223
It's him.

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:21.893
The devil with the red cross...

00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:23.186
Al Ghouti.

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:30.568
Why does he help us?

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:32.236
Al Ghouti.

00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:00.765
<i>Arn!</i>

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.977
<i>Arn!</i>

00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:16.698
Arn!

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.953
Arn! Come on out now!

00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:26.416
Arn. where are you?!

00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:29.627
Why do I always
have to be a Sverker?

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:35.133
The Folkungs are coming!

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:52.608
Arn. where are you?

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.112
Arn!

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.948
This isn't any fun!

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:01.784
The Folkungs won again!

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.954
Why do I always
have to be a Sverker?

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:24.098
Arn?

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.565
Arn! Eskil!

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:39.322
Have you seen the boys?

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:41.657
No. Mistress Sigrid.

00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.831
What are you doing out here
on your own?

00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:32.667
This is no place for little children.

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:35.044
I'm not little!

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:38.464
Oh. really?

00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:53.938
THE KNIGHT TEMPLAR
Based on the story by Jan Guillou

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:59.402
Episode One

00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:07.076
WEST GOTHIA. 1157 AD

00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:20.256
Go fetch Squire Magnus.
His brother is here.

00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:28.055
- I found these two near the creek.
- What?

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.391
On Sverker land.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.810
Have you lost your minds?

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:36.272
What were you thinking?

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:41.986
You are not to go
into the woods alone. ever!

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.114
Now go inside.

00:06:48.618 --> 00:06:51.203
What brings you here.
Birger Brosa?

00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:55.166
You generally have a purpose.

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:56.876
Birger!

00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:02.465
Magnus!

00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:09.972
It's been far too long since you
graced Arnäs with your presence.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.891
What brings you here. my brother?

00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:13.351
The King is on his way.

00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:22.068
Our loyalties are beyond question.

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.363
Our clans have always sided
with one another.

00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:28.157
So let us raise our glasses...

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:33.454
and drink to Erik Edvardsson.
our king.

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:35.373
Cheers!

00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:44.632
Why does Knut get to sit there?

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:47.134
Because his father is the King.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:50.388
Your cause is our cause.
King Erik.

00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:53.516
But the church to be blessed...

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:56.644
It stands where it stands.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.607
Exactly where I had it built.

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:03.526
On Sverkersson's land.

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.236
Birger...

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:08.948
Who is your spokesman?
You or your brother?

00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:11.117
- My brother.
- Well. then.

00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:13.244
But I merely express
what we both feel.

00:08:13.369 --> 00:08:14.203
Birger...

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:17.707
You talk big...

00:08:17.832 --> 00:08:19.625
but you are as anxious as old ladies.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.919
That is as it may be.

00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:26.132
but so far we have lived in peace
with Sverkersson.

00:08:26.257 --> 00:08:27.800
Kings come and go.

00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:31.846
but our neighbors
belong to the Sverker clan.

00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:36.976
I'm talking about cementing our ties
on holy ground.

00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:41.230
And here you are. squirming like slaves
that need to take a crap.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.734
Will you Folkungs
ride with me or not?

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.529
The church is already built.
It cannot be undone.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.116
It is a house of God.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:56.704
And if that angers the Sverkers.
we must stick together.

00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:59.957
The rest is in God's hands.

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:05.588
Knut. take that creature
out of here at once!

00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:17.600
Knut!

00:09:23.439 --> 00:09:25.274
Hello. Arn.

00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:31.322
Where did you get that bird?

00:09:31.447 --> 00:09:34.325
I caught him near the castle.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.036
My father doesn't like him.

00:09:38.704 --> 00:09:41.582
Will you be king
when you grow up?

00:09:41.707 --> 00:09:43.417
My father says so.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.128
He says it's the will of God.

00:09:46.337 --> 00:09:48.339
And he says
that my son will be king.

00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:51.550
and my grandson.
and my great-grandson...

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:55.179
And your great-great-great-
great-great grandson...

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.604
May I hold him?

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.531
Sorry.

00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:17.868
That's all right.
He always comes back.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:05.017
How dare you?
This is a house of God!

00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.687
No!

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:11.357
Father!

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:41.095
Listen to me. Folkungs!

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.140
As of this moment. there is only one
rightful king of West Gothia.

00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:49.353
and that is me. Karl Sverkersson.

00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:03.492
Who is that boy?

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:08.580
His son?

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:13.961
No. he's with me.

00:13:57.546 --> 00:14:00.090
Will there be war?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.848
We have a new king. that's all.

00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.767
That's all.

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:11.643
Where's Knut?

00:14:14.063 --> 00:14:16.357
He's in Norway.

00:14:17.775 --> 00:14:20.235
With his kin.

00:14:20.736 --> 00:14:24.114
With God's help.
he will reclaim the throne.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.618
So we must be patient.

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:30.245
No. No!

00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:35.918
- Ingmar. those go to the smithy.
- Arn. come on!

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.145
Look!

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.148
It's Knut's bird.

00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:20.129
No. you're not allowed up there!

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:22.464
Arn!

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.052
Arn!

00:15:27.845 --> 00:15:30.889
You're not allowed!

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:38.564
Come down now!

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:51.076
Aah!

00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:59.334
Arn! Come down!

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.211
Come down!

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.104
Arn? Arn?

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.190
Can you hear me? Arn?

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.743
Arn...can you hear me?

00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:34.328
Where is he?
What happened?

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:36.997
I told him not to go up there.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:40.667
Arn? Arn!

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:42.688
Dear Lord...

00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:45.899
Please let Arn come back to life.

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:52.322
If You let him live.
we promise to repay You.

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:57.703
You have our word. dear Lord.

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:01.957
He will be Your servant
here on Earth.

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:06.712
We will yield him up
to Your Holy service.

00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:12.426
Dear Lord.
we give You our word.

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:18.432
Dear Lord.
we give You our word.

00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:27.399
We give You our word.

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:49.880
Amen.

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:36.885
Praise the Lord!

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:16.007
Come. Eskil!

00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:18.153
No!

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.072
It's the right thing to do.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:26.453
No. Sigrid. I will not send
my boy to a monastery.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.079
We gave our word.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.291
We made a promise to God.
that if He let Arn live.

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.169
we would send our boy
to serve Him.

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.213
He's only a child.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:38.799
Why do you think He let Arn live?

00:21:38.924 --> 00:21:41.134
For our sakes?!

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.804
God has a purpose in mind for Arn.

00:21:43.929 --> 00:21:46.139
I will not send my son
to a monastery.

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:50.519
Do you actually believe
that I want to send him away?

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.939
- No. Sigrid.
- I have postponed it.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.358
Hesitated.

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.907
God is punishing us. Magnus.

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:06.201
We have gone back on our word.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:11.456
This is how He reminds us
of our obligations.

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:20.048
We must keep our promise.

00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:53.915
Why do you want to send me away?

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.919
We don't want to send you away.

00:23:09.598 --> 00:23:11.766
It is the will of God.

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:17.105
Why does God
want to send me away?

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.074
He let you live.

00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:30.827
He has chosen you.

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:35.457
Why couldn't he choose
Eskil instead?

00:24:25.006 --> 00:24:27.008
- Father Henri.
- My child.

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:31.221
Father. I need your help.

00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:33.765
What is it. my child?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.860
Come in.

00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:52.909
Father Henri.

00:24:53.034 --> 00:24:54.744
Brother Guilbert.

00:24:58.039 --> 00:24:59.958
Please...

00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:06.047
Brother Lucien examined the mother.

00:25:06.923 --> 00:25:10.176
The sores on her face
are quite consistent with swine fever;

00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:11.928
that we can cure.

00:25:12.053 --> 00:25:14.305
But the arm...

00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:18.268
it's blood-poisoning.

00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:38.580
Arn...

00:25:39.706 --> 00:25:41.750
Arn. wake up.

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.044
Come with me.

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.701
My dear little boy.

00:26:21.498 --> 00:26:25.502
Father Henri has promised me
that you can stay here.

00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:28.004
Be obedient.

00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.673
Do as you are told.

00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:33.676
Promise me you will.

00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:38.139
Are you going to stay here. too?

00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:46.981
It's the will of God. Arn.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.650
Do you understand?

00:28:12.692 --> 00:28:14.277
<i>Tu veux essayer?</i>

00:28:15.195 --> 00:28:17.488
<i>Viens.</i>

00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:20.074
Like to have a go?

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.961
<i>Ça va?</i>

00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:33.755
<i>Tiens.</i>

00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:41.387
Hold it tight. and now aim.

00:28:51.648 --> 00:28:53.691
Very good!

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.113
That place my mother went to.
is it like it is here?

00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:04.911
<i>On vit tous dans la maison de Dieu.</i>

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:10.250
With God we're all at home.

00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:14.212
I want to go home. too.

00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:24.264
You are home. my son.
Varnhem is your home now.

00:29:30.979 --> 00:29:32.146
<i>Vo cas.</i>

00:29:32.563 --> 00:29:33.356

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.378
<i>Vo cant.</i>

00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:09.225
Good. Again.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.518
Good. Again.

00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:12.312
Very good.

00:30:12.437 --> 00:30:13.813
Hey. look!

00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:17.900
I told you. always in my eyes.

00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:19.944
Go.

00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:23.865
Arn!

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.373
Yes.

00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:34.083
Your turn.

00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:37.503
<i>"...omnis scientiae fundamentum."</i>

00:30:37.628 --> 00:30:38.671
Mm-hmm.

00:30:38.796 --> 00:30:44.218
To read is the foundation
of all knowledge.

00:31:02.737 --> 00:31:05.239
In which hand does it feel
most comfortable. hmm?

00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:10.328
Both.

00:31:26.219 --> 00:31:27.762
Very good. Good boy.

00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:32.016
You seem to be training him
to be a warrior.

00:31:33.643 --> 00:31:35.937
Is that entirely wise?

00:31:36.771 --> 00:31:43.486
I am merely strengthening the skills
that God has already given him.

00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:47.615
Until God tells us
what he has in store for Arn.

00:31:48.116 --> 00:31:52.495
he should be trained for the spirit
as much as for combat.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.959
"You have stolen my heart.
my sister. my bride."

00:31:58.084 --> 00:32:02.547
"You have stolen my heart
with one glance of your eyes.

00:32:02.672 --> 00:32:08.803
with one jewel of your necklace."

00:32:08.928 --> 00:32:13.349
The Song of Solomon. the most beautiful
words of love ever written.

00:32:13.474 --> 00:32:15.226
One day. you will understand.

00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:18.187
How can you steal someone's heart?

00:32:18.312 --> 00:32:22.191
It's a figure of speech.

00:32:24.902 --> 00:32:27.321
I'd like to show you something.

00:32:29.282 --> 00:32:31.200
You have a new friend. Look!

00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:40.168
What kind of horse is that?

00:32:40.376 --> 00:32:42.545
It belongs to the noblest.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:47.049
the fastest. the most resilient breed
there is.

00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:50.595
They're war horses.

00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:56.225
And the one you get to know
will become your most faithful friend.

00:33:06.486 --> 00:33:07.528
Come here.

00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:20.833
You are a very fine horse.

00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:23.961
Strong and intelligent.

00:33:28.883 --> 00:33:31.260
I think he likes you.

00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:35.431
What's his name?

00:33:36.015 --> 00:33:37.433
Chamsiin.

00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:38.267
Cham...

00:33:38.392 --> 00:33:40.061
...siin.
- ...siin.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.021
It means "desert wind."

00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:44.565
He's as fast. as relentless.

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:49.237
Do you want to ride him?

00:34:09.423 --> 00:34:10.299
Good!

00:34:10.591 --> 00:34:13.219
Can you feel
the strength of the horse?

00:34:13.427 --> 00:34:14.554
Good!

00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:35.384
Help me!

00:35:35.509 --> 00:35:36.844
There she is!

00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:37.678
Look. Gunnar.

00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:39.221
Please help me!

00:35:39.347 --> 00:35:40.848
There! Come on. Gunnar!

00:35:40.973 --> 00:35:42.350
I don't want him! Help!

00:35:42.475 --> 00:35:44.393
The sinful wench!

00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:49.231
No! Let me go!

00:35:49.357 --> 00:35:51.317
- Justice will be made.
- No! Let me go!

00:35:55.946 --> 00:35:58.199
Trying to steal my bride. eh?

00:35:58.324 --> 00:36:01.035
He's innocent! Let him be!

00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:02.787
As innocent as you. then?

00:36:02.912 --> 00:36:05.206
Running away from your wedding?

00:36:08.042 --> 00:36:10.544
Do your duty. brother.

00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:13.798
Come to your senses.

00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:15.591
He's but a young monk.

00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:28.229
Pick it up. boy!

00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:31.065
Pick it up!

00:36:35.736 --> 00:36:37.613
Pick it up!

00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:42.535
Go on!

00:36:51.419 --> 00:36:53.170
Show him. Gunnar!

00:37:07.977 --> 00:37:09.145
Watch out!

00:37:36.881 --> 00:37:40.676
I've committed the gravest of sins.

00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:47.308
I've killed two men.

00:37:49.685 --> 00:37:52.146
That is the end of your confession.
my son?

00:37:56.317 --> 00:37:58.903
All my sins. I thee forgive.

00:37:59.028 --> 00:38:00.279
<i>Te absolvo.</i>

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:04.033
In the name of the Father.
and of the Son. and of the Holy Ghost.

00:38:05.743 --> 00:38:08.245
I do not understand.

00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:09.538
Sit.

00:38:15.252 --> 00:38:17.463
You killed those men in self-defense.

00:38:17.588 --> 00:38:19.215
They were sinners.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.801
trying to force that poor girl
to marry against her will.

00:38:21.926 --> 00:38:27.723
It may not have been a miracle.
as that simpleminded priest said.

00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:33.771
But who. if not God. was it
that put them in your way?

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.447
Arn...it was your mother's will --
and God's --

00:38:43.572 --> 00:38:45.241
that you be raised here
in this monastery.

00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:49.286
Well. now you're grown up.
you must do the Lord's calling.

00:38:49.912 --> 00:38:52.998
Brother Guilbert and I
have discussed this.

00:38:53.123 --> 00:38:56.252
and we have reached a decision.

00:38:58.462 --> 00:39:01.715
The time has come
for you to go home. Arn.

00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.635
You must go back to your family.

00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:10.558
<i>"In Hoc Signo Vincus."</i>

00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:14.270
"In this sign thou shalt conquer."

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.695
Before I came here to this...
peaceful monastery.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.114
I served another order:

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.412
God's Holy army.
the Knights Templar.

00:39:33.747 --> 00:39:40.129
For 12 years I fought with this sword
in The Holy Land.

00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:44.967
With this sword.
no one has ever defeated me.

00:39:49.013 --> 00:39:53.100
You may never draw it in anger
or use it for your own gain.

00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:58.105
It has to serve God's good cause.

00:41:21.647 --> 00:41:24.525
No. no. no!

00:42:45.064 --> 00:42:47.399
Your livestock
is grazing the King's land.

00:42:47.524 --> 00:42:49.359
That is not the King's land.

00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:52.237
Have you no honor?
Are you a bald-faced liar?

00:42:52.362 --> 00:42:54.990
Liar?
You are the one to stretch the truth!

00:42:55.115 --> 00:42:58.410
The land at Forsvik
has always belonged to our clan.

00:42:58.952 --> 00:43:00.996
And many a man
can swear to that fact.

00:43:03.707 --> 00:43:06.460
We'll see what the tribunal
has to say about that.

00:43:16.345 --> 00:43:18.138
Liar!

00:43:20.015 --> 00:43:21.934
And who may you be?!

00:43:28.315 --> 00:43:30.025
Eskil.

00:43:31.527 --> 00:43:33.362
Father.

00:43:40.786 --> 00:43:42.162
Arn?

00:43:43.622 --> 00:43:45.999
What the devil?

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.217
I didn't recognize you.

00:44:05.018 --> 00:44:08.730
I thought we had lost you
to those monks.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.777
It's good to have you back.

00:44:39.553 --> 00:44:40.804
Magnus.

00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:41.763
Brosa.

00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:43.557
Eskil.

00:44:45.559 --> 00:44:46.894
And Arn.

00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:50.689
Good to see you back at Arnäs.

00:44:53.442 --> 00:44:54.902
You haven't changed. Uncle Brosa.

00:44:55.027 --> 00:44:57.988
Those monks had you for years.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.991
Were you taught to read?

00:45:02.159 --> 00:45:05.579
I see. so you can read.

00:45:06.246 --> 00:45:08.165
Is Knut here. too?

00:45:08.749 --> 00:45:10.792
No. he's better off in Norway.

00:45:11.585 --> 00:45:14.421
His time has not yet come.

00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:17.382
With regard to the dispute
with Ulvbane.

00:45:17.507 --> 00:45:21.094
we'll have to buy time with silver.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.804
I know.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.182
I will propose a settlement.

00:45:25.557 --> 00:45:29.728
But the ties between Ulvbane
and Sverkersson have me concerned.

00:45:29.853 --> 00:45:33.607
A tense king
is an unpredictable king.

00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:58.173
We are gathered here at Axevalla
to hold a tribunal.

00:45:58.298 --> 00:45:59.633
We come in peace...

00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:03.387
and we shall leave in peace.

00:46:03.512 --> 00:46:09.351
Whoever breaks this peace
will be seen as an evildoer.

00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:15.440
The tribunal is now in session.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.699
Now to the land dispute

00:46:23.824 --> 00:46:28.745
between Magnus Folkesson
and Emund Ulvbane.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:34.293
I understand that Magnus Folkesson
is willing to settle.

00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:36.169
That is the case.

00:46:36.586 --> 00:46:40.007
And I am willing to pay
Emund Ulvbane

00:46:40.132 --> 00:46:42.843
the sum of 30 pieces of silver.

00:46:45.095 --> 00:46:47.973
That is more than one could ask.

00:46:48.348 --> 00:46:52.602
For peace between neighbors
is worth far more than silver.

00:47:00.944 --> 00:47:02.904
The settlement has been accepted.

00:47:10.537 --> 00:47:17.252
As the tribunal has ruled.
I must comply.

00:47:25.552 --> 00:47:31.099
But 'tis a shame that silver
outweighs honor and truth.

00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:35.437
'Tis also a shame to be obliged
to deal with a man without honor.

00:47:36.313 --> 00:47:40.233
You. Magnus Folkesson...

00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:42.069
You are not a man.

00:47:43.945 --> 00:47:46.615
And your sons are no better.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.951
They are but puny girls.
a nun and a beer keg.

00:47:58.627 --> 00:48:01.588
Mark my words. that Sverker
on the throne planned this.

00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:04.633
He whispered those insults
in Ulvbane's ear.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.302
Ulvbane knew every word
to the letter!

00:48:07.427 --> 00:48:08.595
Why?

00:48:08.929 --> 00:48:12.391
The Sverker clan
wants to weaken us.

00:48:12.516 --> 00:48:17.813
He fears we will support Knut
in his bid for the throne.

00:48:17.938 --> 00:48:20.190
I wish there were a way out.

00:48:20.774 --> 00:48:27.114
But a public insult must by law
be redressed through single combat.

00:48:29.825 --> 00:48:32.285
There has to be some way
to defeat him.

00:48:33.203 --> 00:48:35.872
Ulvbane is the best warrior
in the Sverker clan.

00:48:35.997 --> 00:48:38.959
None of us can compare.

00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:46.508
No one in our clan has ever chosen
the dishonorable route.

00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:49.594
No one will follow
a dishonored man.

00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:52.472
I have made up my mind.

00:48:53.306 --> 00:48:55.851
I will do battle with him tomorrow.

00:48:57.102 --> 00:48:59.563
May the Lord protect me.
