{\an8}And on my birthday. I'm going to sing you
a special song. "Rain On Our Love."

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:46.815
<i>Each raindrop drip drops</i>
<i>On the roof of her porch</i>

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.943
<i>Secretly desiring a look</i>
<i>Waiting. and then not…</i>

5
00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:51.319
I'm leaving for work.

6
00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.530
Mom. I'm recording!

7
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.079
Just keep messing with that camera. buddy.
then. when you break it.

8
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.623
you'll get a real bruising.

9
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.167
Lock the door after I leave.

10
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.127
Yes. Mom.

11
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:13.174
<i>The forecast for today</i>
<i>is heavy showers with thunder.</i>

12
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.218
{\an8}<i>with a high level of magnetism.</i>

13
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.761

{\an8}<i>Residents. please take caution</i>

15
00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.017
I've cooked you dinner.
Eat and then go to your tutor.

16
00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.525
Mom. you should stay home today.
It's about to rain.

17
00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.361
You think food grows on trees or what?

18
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.950
Mom. do you remember what day tomorrow is?

19
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.285
What's tomorrow?

20
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.662
Go get my raincoat.

Here's your raincoat. Mom.

23
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.093
Thanks.

24
00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.145
Mom. do you really not remember
what day tomorrow is?

25
00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.024
It's the day I get paid.
What day do you think it is?

26
00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.192
Be good. I'm going to work.

27
00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.284
She never remembers anything.

28
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:13.294

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.783
Pick up the phone. Mom!

31
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:57.922
<i>The number you have dialed</i>

32
00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.262

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.227

Help me! Anybody. help! I don't know
where this kid came from.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.442
Wrap it for me. please.

41
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.069
Your son is really going to like it

{\an8}<i>After pouring down</i>

49
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.385

AND COMPLETE THE TASK

52
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.071
Hey. how come you're playing
video games and not sleeping?

53
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.825
I can't sleep.

54
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.827
Can't sleep? Why can't you sleep?

55
00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:59.914
{\an8}This room is so cold. As cold as <i>bingsu</i>.

56
00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:03.209
{\an8}Oh. okay. So you're
playing games to warm up?

57
00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.087
{\an8}Here. I know how to
warm you up real quick.

58
00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.132
Don't. don't! Yeah. I'm warm!

59
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.927
-Are you warmed up yet? Huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.428
-You're warmed up. right?
-Yeah.

61
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.389
Okay. Then get ready to go to school.

62
00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.102
Hurry.

63
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:32.029
{\an8}Hey. Puppy. I put the permission slip
to go camping in your backpack.

64
00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.156
{\an8}Remember to give it to your teacher.

65
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.199
Yes. Mom.

66
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:33.633
Don't tell me it's a long way home.
You promised to come home.

67
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.344
Puppy was waiting for you all night.

68
00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:40.681
If it's too far. Let's just
move back to the old house.

69
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:41.974
I haven't even taken
all our stuff out yet.

70
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:42.892
<i>Come on.</i>

71
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.062
I don't want to have to
spend the night away from you either.

72
00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.440
<i>There are so many things going on</i>
<i>right now. I need you beside me.</i>

73
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.818
Okay. I'll make it up to you
this afternoon. Everyone is here.

74
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:53.736
<i>I have a meeting.</i>

75
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:57.823
Hey. don't forget
we're eating dinner with Trung.

76
00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:58.824
<i>Yeah. I remember.</i>

77
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.993
Love you. Bearcake.

78
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.705
Go work.

79
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.463
After he calls you Bearcake.

80
00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:14.715
you look nice and fresh.
like you've just had an energy drink.

81
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.966
You're such an idiot.

82
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.764
If I were you. I'd just stay home.

83
00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.641
be a housewife. and let my husband
take care of me.

84
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:27.395
You better get on the prowl. then.

85
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.025
Yeah. sure I'm a cougar.
but who's gonna hunt me at this age?

86
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:37.822
Looks like you've been doing
some hunting of your own.

87
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.661
Hey. how's your new house?

88
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.291
It's pretty big. nice and open.

89
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:53.629
It's just a little tough because it's
so far from Puppy's school.

90
00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:55.423
Quan leaves early in the morning
and only comes home at night.

91
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.138
I don't understand why he has to buy
this house and move out so quickly.

92
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:09.019
He's a businessman. When you get
a good deal. you grab it right away.

93
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.525
Come on. Let's get to work.
I want to go home early today.

94
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.495
Congratulations. Doctor.
Your new paper is excellent.

95
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.080
Especially the section
discussing crossover

96
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.498
between the temporal lobes and memory.

97
00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:31.667
That's the heart of it.

98
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.628
-Trang.
-Yes?

99
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.673
How did your surgery exam go this month?

100
00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:40.009
I'll probably wait for the next one.

101
00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:48.434
Trang. how long are you going to wait?
You could become one of the best doctors.

102
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.730
But I've already chosen
to be the best mom.

103
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.359
-But--
-Doctor. we can't find patient Quang!

104
00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:03.407
I'm sure I locked the door.

105
00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:06.785
When we pushed the cart in here.
Mr. Quang wasn't there.

106
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.009
Why is this door not locked?

107
00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:24.303
I'm not sure why.

108
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.932
He obviously climbed
out the window into the yard.

109
00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.726
Go look at the security
camera footage. Hurry!

110
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:31.810
Yes. Doctor.

111
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:52.331
Twenty years! And no one
believes my research.

112
00:13:58.295 --> 00:13:59.296
Mr. Quang!

113
00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:04.677
Mr. Quang. wait!

114
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.891
The hurricane is here.
Sam is going to destroy everything.

115
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.480
No. look around. It's a beautiful day.
There's no storm coming.

116
00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.357
The magnetism is everywhere.

117
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:21.694
Radio waves will be lost.
Everything is going to explode.

118
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:25.865
I know. but that was hurricane Sam
20 years ago.

119
00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.368
There won't be a hurricane today.
The weather forecast said so.

120
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:30.452
That's right.

121
00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:35.040
What does the weatherman know?
What do you know?

122
00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.001
-I know.
-Twenty years ago. you were just a kid.

123
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.879
Because I'm also
a victim of hurricane Sam.

124
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:42.965
What?

125
00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:52.975
What happened to you?

126
00:14:55.102 --> 00:15:01.692
It's a long story. Just put it down

127
00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:06.906
and I'll tell you. Okay?

128
00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:33.349
I'm so sorry for putting you out again.

129
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:41.815
I know you're busy. but we have to figure
something out. I can't do this forever.

130
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:45.361
Okay. I know.
next time. I'll work it out better.

131
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:50.240
Don't worry about it. Oh. remember
to bring Puppy early tomorrow.

132
00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:51.659
They're going on their camping trip.

133
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.494
Okay. Thank you so much.

134
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:55.079
-I have to take this call.
-Yeah.

135
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.172
Puppy.

136
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:07.466
Mommy.

137
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.392
-Let's go home.
-Okay.

138
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.434
Let's go.

139
00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:48.757
Hi. Daddy!

140
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.510
Come here. Daddy
came home early to see Puppy.

141
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.346
Hey Bearcake. you're home late.

142
00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:58.600
Where are you going? Give me
your backpack. Give me your jacket.

143
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.564
-Give me!
-I win! I win!

144
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:06.025
-This is my room. I won!
-You're so fast.

145
00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:08.861
Okay. this is your room. so tonight.
you sleep here by yourself. all right?

146
00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:11.363
No. I'm sleeping with Mommy and Daddy.

147
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.868
Hey. honey. is this our stuff or theirs?

148
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.369
This is the old owner's stuff.

149
00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:21.457
Okay. Make sure we give it back to them.
Are you ready to go eat?

150
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:27.212
It's still early. Let's try and get some
work done first. Puppy. go downstairs.

151
00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.173
Mommy and Daddy are going to clean up.
It's going to be really dusty.

152
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.841
But I want to help Daddy clean up.

153
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.260
Hand me those books.

154
00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:36.680
Good girl.

155
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.771
Mommy. what is this?

156
00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:46.774
Oh. ask Daddy.

157
00:17:47.274 --> 00:17:52.654
What? Oh. this! This is a souvenir
from the first time Daddy and Mommy met.

158
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.157
It's pretty. isn't it.
you little sleepyhead?

159
00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.203
Here!

160
00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:05.084
Sometimes. if you miss
an appointment by an hour.

161
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.295
you have to wait a hundred years
before you meet again.

162
00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:14.051
Do you remember what I had to
go through to get you that clock?

163
00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:16.887
Yes. I remember.
You don't shut up about it.

164
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.641
Do you remember Trung lost a bet to me?

165
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.601
Mommy!

166
00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:25.562
There's a TV here. Mommy!

167
00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.363
It still works.

168
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:39.034
Hey. that's cool.

169
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.703
-Is that guy in our room. Mommy?
-<i>And on my birthday.</i>

170
00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.372
-He lived here before.
-<i>I'm going to sing you a special song.</i>

171
00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:44.706
<i>"Rain On Our Love".</i>

172
00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.626
<i>Each raindrop drip drops</i>
<i>On the roof of her porch…</i>

173
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:51.713
November 22. Hey. that's today.
In 1999. if this kid was this big…

174
00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.551
Now he's probably about your age.
Were you like him then?

175
00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.136
<i>Secretly desiring…</i>

176
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:03.976
<i>Each raindrop drip drops</i>
<i>On the roof of her porch</i>

177
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.519
<i>Secretly desiring…</i>

178
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.315
What was that?

179
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.491
Turn it off.

180
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.744
-What?
-It's okay.

181
00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.712
It's okay.

182
00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:33.213
Come here. I got you.

183
00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:35.757
Come to Daddy.

184
00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:07.414
Hi. Trang!

185
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.099
How many times have I told you.
Don't mess with stuff in the kitchen.

186
00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.937
I just wanted to help you.

187
00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:34.733
All right. go study.

188
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:38.904
My finger hurts.
How am I going to do my homework?

189
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.200
That's your left hand.
You still have your right hand. right?

190
00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:49.164
Mommy. come upstairs with me.

191
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:53.001
Don't be so whiny. If I go up with you.
who's going to clean up this mess?

192
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.342
I'm coming up to check in a little bit.

193
00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.769
How am I going to hide it?

194
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.938
Everyone knows. man.

195
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.235
Oh. thanks. You didn't have to.

196
00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.570
Here. this is for your dad.
to show him our gratitude.

197
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.490
Oh man. I don't know about gratitude.
but these will definitely get eaten.

198
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.575
Thanks a bunch.

199
00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.202
Back in the day.
if I had a little more guts.

200
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.954
this guy would be the neighbor.
I'd be the husband.

201
00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:33.125
Man. how can a Honda Wave
compete with a Harley?

202
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:36.044
What were you guys
whispering about just now?

203
00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:40.424
Oh. Trung wants to invest in
some real estate. I'm helping him out.

204
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:47.180
Oh right. Because my truck is so old.
I have to invest in land to get a new one.

205
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:51.101
Stop scratching your elbow.
Tell the truth.

206
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.772
Actually. we were just
talking about that kid. Nothing much.

207
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.025
What kid?

208
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.903
The kid in the video. He's Trung's friend.

209
00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:05.240
Oh. great. Can you help me
take all his stuff back to him?

210
00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:11.163
This stuff? How can I? He's dead.

211
00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:18.587
How did he die?

212
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:25.385
Because… He got hit by a truck.

213
00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:29.473
I remember. It was on this date
20 years ago.

214
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.017
I feel most sorry for his mom.

215
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.228
She went to the market
to buy a guitar for his birthday.

216
00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:38.106
When she got back. he was dead.

217
00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.942
How can it be such a coincidence?
Are you sure you remember right?

218
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.945
Yeah. I remember very clearly. I saw it.

219
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.698
It was when…
when hurricane Sam came through.

220
00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.367
I have no idea why the kid went out
in the wind and rain like that.

221
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:51.119
Something was bound to happen. Man.

222
00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:52.454
Or maybe because of the scream?

223
00:22:54.664 --> 00:22:55.499
What scream?

224
00:22:57.959 --> 00:23:03.840
In the video we saw. the boy was recording
when the neighbor screamed.

225
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:08.178
The neighbor? Oh. Mr. Son.

226
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:09.930
What Mr. Son?

227
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:12.682
Mr. Son across the street.
Who do you think?

228
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.684
There. that's his house.

229
00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.019
Across the street.

230
00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:18.688
Listen to me. Go home. You're drunk.

231
00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.607
You're crazy. I'm not drunk.
He was the one who was drunk.

232
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.192
That's why he killed his wife.

233
00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:29.991
All right. that's enough.
Go home. Come again another day.

234
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:39.793
On that day. he killed his wife.

235
00:23:39.876 --> 00:23:42.003
The police came and took him away.
The whole neighborhood knew.

236
00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:45.382
But actually. he wasn't arrested.
he confessed.

237
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:49.344
He even confessed that he was intending
to bury his wife's body at Gate 3

238
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.554
of the hydroelectric dam.

239
00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:55.433
I'm not telling you these things
to scare you

240
00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:57.811
because. actually.
this happened a long time ago.

241
00:23:57.894 --> 00:24:00.939
Twenty years ago. Mr. Son
might even be out of prison by now.

242
00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:06.319
Trung! Hey. Trung!

243
00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:08.572
-Yeah?
-Trung. come home.

244
00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:10.949
-What's up. Mom?
-Trung. let's go home.

245
00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:12.868
Mom. you're sick.
Why did you come over here?

246
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.911
Come home. quick. The hurricane
is almost here. Come home.

247
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.706
Auntie. calm down. The weather report
said the hurricane is going to blow over.

248
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.332
-Yeah.
-What do you know?

249
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.252
Mom.

250
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.047
{\an8}<i>Hurricane 11</i>
<i>has unexpectedly changed course.</i>

251
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.925
{\an8}<i>In two hours. it will hit</i>
<i>the western part of the city.</i>

252
00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:30.260
<i>It is projected that this storm will have</i>

253
00:24:30.343 --> 00:24:34.598
{\an8}<i>the same destructive power</i>
<i>as the record-breaking Sam from 1999.</i>

254
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.308
{\an8}WEATHER FORECAST

255
00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:49.946
I told you. I want to
move back to the old house.

256
00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:54.451
Be careful with this door.
If you close it. it'll lock.

257
00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:55.952
Tomorrow I'll change the lock.

258
00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.122
Did you hear what I said?

259
00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:04.961
Accidents happen everywhere.
People die everywhere.

260
00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:08.590
But this isn't an accident.
This is murder!

261
00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:14.721
Twenty years. Maybe he is out of jail now.
Don't you care about Puppy?

262
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.357
Come over here and sit down.
I want to talk to you.

263
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.283
Listen to me. My company has data
about all the people around here.

264
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:38.036
As for the boy. he died a long time ago.

265
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:43.124
Mr. Son was arrested. There's nothing
more to it. This area is very safe now.

266
00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:49.673
I know it is difficult for you and Puppy.

267
00:25:49.756 --> 00:25:53.301
but everything has its price.

268
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:57.806
In two months. this area is going up
for zoning reimbursement.

269
00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:06.815
So what's more important to you?
Money or your wife and daughter?

270
00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.860
I'm making money for us.

271
00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:16.241
We don't know what could happen tomorrow.

272
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:21.371
I'm right here.
There's nothing to worry about.

273
00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:30.672
Okay. fine. I'll trust you for now.

274
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.468
But what about this?

275
00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:40.307
Do you know who that belongs to?

276
00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:46.187
I don't know.
I just know it was in your bag.

277
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:53.695
Come here. I want to see
if my feeling is right.

278
00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.659
Looks pretty good. doesn't it?

279
00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:05.540
I know you're busy. but do you remember
what the day after tomorrow is?

280
00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:12.881
You don't remember?

281
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:15.925
Our wedding anniversary.

282
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.971
Yeah. I bought them yesterday morning.
When I went to look for them.

283
00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:23.600
I only found one earring.
I'll buy another pair.

284
00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:33.026
I'm sorry.

285
00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:36.071
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be all right.

286
00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:46.331
But I really feel sorry
for that kid and his mother.

287
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.335
Yeah. but what can we do about it?

288
00:28:35.004 --> 00:28:38.299
Quan.

289
00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:42.011
Quan.

295
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:52.350
<i>This storm is as strong as</i>
<i>the record-setting Sam.</i>

296
00:31:57.123 --> 00:31:59.000
<i>Hey. Who's there?</i>

297
00:32:00.668 --> 00:32:02.712
A ghost!

298
00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:04.464
<i>Ghost? Where?</i>

299
00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:15.516
Quan. Quan!

300
00:32:20.396 --> 00:32:24.359
<i>Wait. Hey. miss.</i>
<i>You can't open it that way.</i>

301
00:32:32.825 --> 00:32:36.746
Please don't hurt my family!

302
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.916
<i>Miss. are you speaking to me?</i>

303
00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:46.923
<i>Why does it look so much like my room?</i>

304
00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:51.219
<i>The only thing that's different</i>
<i>is that clock over there.</i>

305
00:32:58.351 --> 00:32:59.727
<i>I'll tell you how to open the door.</i>

306
00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.148
<i>But stay here and play with me</i>
<i>for a little bit.</i>

307
00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:11.864
<i>Right on the handle.</i>
<i>there's a little hole.</i>

308
00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:16.369
<i>Just get a stick and stick it in.</i>
<i>pull it down. and it'll open.</i>

309
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:22.458
<i>There! Miss!</i>

310
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:39.767
<i>Hey. miss. someone's</i>
<i>getting beaten up over there.</i>

311
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:42.854
<i>I saw someone stabbing them with scissors.</i>

312
00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:46.315
<i>I have to find someone to help.</i>

313
00:33:47.066 --> 00:33:48.943
Phong! Don't go!

314
00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:56.492
<i>But they need my help!</i>

315
00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:58.202
If you go. you're going to die!

316
00:34:00.413 --> 00:34:02.832
<i>What do you mean?</i>

317
00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:09.172
Phong. you must believe me
because I come from the future.

318
00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:11.132
You like "Rain On Our Love".
by Dan Truong. right?

319
00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:18.222
Phong. just stay put in your room.
Your mom's about to come home.

320
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:19.974
She's going to give you
a guitar for your birthday.

321
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:23.061
<i>Miss. I can't hear you clearly.</i>

322
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:25.897
Phong. just stay in your room.

323
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.815
-Your mom's about to get home.
-<i>Miss. Miss!</i>

324
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.234
Phong! Your mom's about to get home.

325
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.195
<i>Phong. just stay in your room.</i>

326

<i>Phong.</i>

329

Miss. Miss!

330
00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:03.142
Hey. do you even know how to drive?

331
00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:04.811
Hey someone's gonna get killed
with that kind of driving!

332
00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.131
Mom!

333
00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:36.008
Hey. Why aren't you in bed yet?

334
00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:38.469
Mom. something really weird just happened.

335
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.263
Are you dreaming again?

336
00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:43.057
That's what you get for watching
those violent shows all day long.

337
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:47.019
No. it's not that. I saw a lady.
She came from the future.

338
00:35:47.103 --> 00:35:50.106
She even said that you're
going to buy me a birthday present.

339
00:35:53.067 --> 00:35:57.572
You don't need to remind me.
Here's your present.

340
00:35:58.072 --> 00:35:59.657
Wow! Thanks. Mom!

341
00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:04.912
You're a big boy now.
You should help me out more.

342
00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:17.341
SOMETIMES A HURRICANE CAN RESULT
FROM THE FLAPPING OF A BUTTERFLY'S WINGS

343
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.510
THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY.

344
00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:24.056
A SMALL CHANGE IN ACTION CAN LEAD TO
A MONUMENTAL CHANGE IN OUTCOME.

345
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.893
THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT

346
00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:50.708
Puppy.

347
00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:22.240
Quan.

348
00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:54.438
Puppy.

349
00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:00.778
Taxi!

350
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.339
Teacher.

351
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:26.304
Excuse me. miss. but did Puppy
go on the outing this morning?

352
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:31.058
The outing was canceled
because of the storm.

353
00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:33.602
but there's no one here called Puppy.

354
00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:40.735
What do you mean. miss?
Puppy is Nguyen Phuong My.

355
00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:42.695
your student for over two years now.

356
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.907
I'm sorry. There's no one here
by the name of Nguyen Phuong My.

357
00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:56.792
Good morning. Teacher!

358
00:38:56.876 --> 00:38:58.085
-Miss.
-Sit down. kids.

359
00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.837
Puppy sits right here. miss.

360
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.882
I told you. in this class.
there's no one called Puppy.

361
00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:06.385
Chuong. Puppy sits
right here. doesn't she?

362
00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:07.511
I don't know.

363
00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:14.810
It's time to start class now. Please leave
the classroom. If not. I'll call security.

364
00:39:14.894 --> 00:39:17.271
What is this? Where's my daughter?

365
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.982
Hey. kids. Puppy sits here.
doesn't she. kids?

366
00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:39.752
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is not in service. Please…</i>

367
00:39:42.004 --> 00:39:43.547
Thank you. sir.

368
00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:47.968
<i>Storm update. Due to a sudden change</i>
<i>in direction yesterday.</i>

369
00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.929
<i>Storm 11 has had several complications.</i>

370
00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:53.682
<i>In the city center. near the eye</i>
<i>of the storm. it is quieting.</i>

371
00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:57.603
<i>but within the next 24 hours. there</i>
<i>could be a heavy downpour and high winds.</i>

372
00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:58.854
<i>followed by thunder and lightning.</i>

373
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.481
<i>All residents. please be forewarned.</i>

375
00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.244
{\an8}THE BEAT OF SPLENDOR

376
00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:16.789
So how many here believe
they're going to be millionaires?

377
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:25.089
Very good. There is no easy path. Only
hard work leads to millions. am I right?

378
00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:26.841
-Yes.
-Quan.

379
00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:29.468
There are no difficult customers.

380
00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:32.346
only customers whose perspective
we don't yet understand.

381
00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:35.683
For example. this young lady.
for instance.

382
00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:38.018
She's not very well-dressed.

383
00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:42.106
but who knows. she may potentially be
a very valuable customer. Right?

384
00:40:42.982 --> 00:40:44.150
Quan. I can't find Puppy.

385
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:51.157
Did you hear that? It appears that
she needs an apartment that allows pets.

386
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.242
I went to the school.
and I couldn't find her anywhere.

387
00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:56.162
And you need it to be

388
00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:58.914
near your child's school for easy drop off
and pick up. is that right?

389
00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:00.875
I'm serious. I'm not joking.

390
00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:06.088
There. Remember to never become
simply a middleman in the eyes of--

391
00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:07.882
Stop it! Our child is missing!

392
00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:16.015
Listen. I don't know who you are. but this
is a very important meeting for me.

393
00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:17.641
Don't bother me. Go away.

394
00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:22.855
Quan. Look at me. I'm your wife. Quan.

395
00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:24.690
-Look at me.
-I'm not your husband.

396
00:41:24.773 --> 00:41:25.733
Look at me. Quan.

397
00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.651
-I'm your wife. Quan.
-Are you crazy?

398
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:28.694
-Look at me. I…
-Are you crazy?

399
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:32.656
Quan. look at me.

400
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.535
I'm your wife. Let me go.
Quan. I'm his wife.

401
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.495
It's just a misunderstanding.

402
00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:38.537
Let me go!

403
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:39.955
I'm your wife! Let me go!

404
00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:40.873
There's no problem.

405
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.134
Ms. Vu Thu Trang.

406
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:04.480
Please sit.

407
00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:13.572
So you misidentified your husband?

408
00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:20.829
I went to find Quan to tell him
our daughter is missing.

409
00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:30.297
You are charged with creating
a disturbance at Asia Real Estate.

410
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.174
and Nguyen Trung Quan.

411
00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:33.968
the man you claim is your husband.
is the one pressing charges.

412
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.097
Nguyen Trung Quan is my husband.

413
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:45.479
All right. Do you remember anything
about your husband and daughter?

414
00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:52.319
I was talking to him…
Everything is still very clear to me.

415
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:56.615
<i>Le Phong. Would like to play</i>
<i>the song "Rain on our Love". Miss!</i>

416
00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.411
Oh. I met a boy.

417
00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:03.455
I thought you had a girl.

418
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:10.546
Yes. but that boy…
lived in my house 20 years ago.

419
00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:14.216
And so how did you meet him?
Do you remember anything about him?

420
00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.226
Come on. We're wasting time.

421
00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:35.487
If you don't give me all the necessary
information. then we can't help you.

422
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:44.705
Le Phong is the name of the boy.
That's all I remember.

423
00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:57.426
Ms. Trang. according to the information
you've provided.

424
00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.720
along with our investigation.

425
00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:03.641
Mr. Nguyen Trung Quan
and you are not married.

426
00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:07.061
There is no birth certificate
for Nguyen Phuong My.

427
00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:10.105
I know that you're quite disturbed
at the moment.

428
00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:13.317
but I need to do some paperwork
before I can let you go.

429
00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:29.291
Give me another one.
This bill is torn. How can I use it?

430
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:34.463
Come on. This is still good. Here.

431
00:44:34.546 --> 00:44:35.422
Thank you. miss.

432
00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:41.679
You don't have any bigger bills?

433
00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:44.515
Hey. do you know where Mr. Son is?

434
00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:45.474
I've been by a few times.
but he's never home.

435
00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:49.186
How should I know? I don't live with him.

436
00:45:03.158 --> 00:45:07.162
<i>The people's committee of the city donated</i>
<i>the friendship clock to the post office</i>

437
00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:10.499
{\an8}<i>at 7 a.m. this morning</i>
<i>to celebrate the post office bus station</i>

438
00:45:10.582 --> 00:45:12.251
{\an8}<i>officially coming into service.</i>

439
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.713
Hey. Mom.

440
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.967
It's 30.000 dong more than last month.

441
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.219
Mom. look at the TV. At the post office.

442
00:45:22.302 --> 00:45:26.932
they put up a clock exactly like the one
belonging to the lady from the future.

443
00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:32.896
Hey. Mom. yesterday I heard someone
screaming from inside Mr. Son's house.

444
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.607
How many times have I told you.

445
00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:37.860
Don't stick your nose
into other people's business.

446
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:38.777
But…

447
00:45:39.027 --> 00:45:43.198
But nothing. You're not
watching TV. Why is it on?

448
00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:47.327
Because I'm waiting
for the lady from the future.

449
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.163
Who knows. Maybe she'll come back.

450
00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:54.960
I knew it. Watching movies all the time.
you're brain's turned to mush.

451
00:45:55.335 --> 00:45:58.714
Here. take this money to auntie Duyen.
buy me a bottle of soy sauce.

452
00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:01.967
so I can cook tonight.
So many things to do.

453
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.971
{\an8}LITTLE FLOWERS

454
00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:11.101
Hey. do you remember
what that lady said the other day?

455
00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:16.940
She just told me not to go outside.

456
00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:22.112
And how the heck did she know my mom
was buying me a guitar for my birthday?

457
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.531
Sounds like Doraemon.

458
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:43.050
Hey. man. I have to get going.
My mom's going to yell at me.

459
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:44.510
Okay. See you later.

460
00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:45.427
Yeah.

461
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.304
What are you looking for?

462
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:31.139
I need a barrel.

463
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.106
Here. Exactly the kind you need.

464
00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:45.153
Really waterproof. With the lid on.

465
00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:49.992
Waterproof. Airtight.

466
00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:12.848
It looks like the temporal lobe has been
affected. so it's created false memories.

467
00:48:12.931 --> 00:48:16.560
Doctor. I've helped you
with hundreds of cases like this before.

468
00:48:16.643 --> 00:48:17.978
I'm perfectly fine.

469
00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:23.275
We need to take an MRI so we can have
a good look at that hemisphere.

470
00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.903
I haven't had brain surgery.
Why do you need to take an MRI?

471
00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:31.325
It's a request from the police.
They need to see the results.

472
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.956
Go ahead.

473
00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:17.746
Please go to the examination room.

474
00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.129
Le Phong… the song… "Love Song."

475
00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:32.344
I'm so dizzy all of a sudden.

476
00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:38.725
All right. Go take a rest
in the next room. Okay?

477
00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:50.195
How many times have I told you. You're not
allowed to wear this inside the hospital.

478
00:49:50.278 --> 00:49:53.115
But I'm cold.
The storm's about to get here.

479
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:56.660
Let's go.

480
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:07.254
Thank you. I'm so thirsty.
Can you get me a cup of water?

481
00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:11.425
It's probably a side effect
of the medicine. I'll get you some water.

482
00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:12.342
Thanks.

483
00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:19.850
<i>I have to connect with the boy.</i>

484
00:51:59.699 --> 00:52:03.411
Hello? I told you not to call.

485
00:52:05.163 --> 00:52:06.414
Everything is okay.

486
00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:12.838
What necklace? Okay. I'll look for it.

487
00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:16.466
Just follow the plan.

488
00:52:41.741 --> 00:52:44.619

489
00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.835
I remember this door was locked.

490
00:52:52.794 --> 00:52:55.088
Nguyet. Where are you. Nguyet?

491
00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:54.189
Phong.

492
00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:09.996
<i>To the lady from the future. You didn't</i>
<i>come back. so I took the TV. Phong.</i>

493
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.707
Mom.

494
00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:31.059
Mom. Catch me. Mom!

495
00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.561
Mom.

496
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:35.188
Slow down.

497
00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:39.776
Honey.

498
00:54:46.866 --> 00:54:47.867
Call the police.

499
00:55:43.548 --> 00:55:46.259
Hey. why don't you just let Trung do that?

500
00:55:46.718 --> 00:55:49.012
I'm still healthy enough to do it.

501
00:55:49.095 --> 00:55:51.306
Then can you take this box
out for me. Dad?

502
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:53.641
Hey. you're the strapping young man here.

503
00:55:53.725 --> 00:55:56.936
Trung. why don't you just go tomorrow?
It looks like a storm's coming.

504
00:55:57.687 --> 00:56:00.732
I know. Mom. but if I don't go now.
they're going to dock points off.

505
00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.694
And I'm just going out
to the district market.

506
00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:06.529
Guarantee I'll be back before the storm.

507
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.116
This kid. Will it kill you to just wait
until the storm passes?

508
00:56:10.492 --> 00:56:12.535
Yeah. Me and my business.

509
00:56:13.078 --> 00:56:14.204
I can't believe you.

510
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:15.955
I'm leaving now. Mom.

511
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:21.419
Hurry back home. Don't make
your mom wait up. You hear?

512
00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:24.798
Yeah. I know. I'll be back soon. Dad.
Stay home and take care of Mom.

513
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:47.779
Why did the storm have to come today?
It's been 20 years. right?

514
00:56:51.032 --> 00:56:52.826
I'll drop by there.

515
00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:06.631
It's cold outside.
Why don't you tell your boyfriend

516
00:57:06.714 --> 00:57:08.341
to come over and hug you tight?

517
00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:10.969
Why are you working so hard right now?

518
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:14.347
Come on. I don't have a boyfriend

519
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.265
Liar.

520
00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:17.684
-I'm still single.
-Oh shit.

521
00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:18.977
Nothing.

522
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:20.645
-What's wrong?
-No.

523
00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:30.405
Trung.

524
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:31.531
What?

525
00:57:31.906 --> 00:57:33.199
I…

526
00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.826
Get out! Who are you?

527
00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.619
We used to know each other.

528
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:37.620
What?

529
00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:41.416
You have a habit of scratching
your elbow every time you lie.

530
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:45.587
When you were a kid. your hair used to be
curly. so they called you Curly Trung.

531
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:47.589
You have a friend named Phong.

532
00:57:47.672 --> 00:57:51.509
And even now. you still like to read
Doraemon comics.

533
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:59.392
So you're a fan.
Are you really into me or what?

534
00:58:00.768 --> 00:58:03.229
Trung. I need to find Phong.

535
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.288
You mean you connected with Phong
through his TV?

536
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:24.209
So then you told him to wait at home
for his mom to give him that guitar. yes?

537
00:58:27.962 --> 00:58:28.880
How did you know?

538
00:58:28.963 --> 00:58:32.800
You act like you're the only one
who's read that book. I read it too.

539
00:58:33.593 --> 00:58:35.762
You and Phong tell exactly
the same story as the book.

540
00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.933
Here. Right?

541
00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.186
PARALLEL

542
00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:44.103
I swear.

543
00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:48.316
{\an8}The guy who wrote this

544
00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:51.069
{\an8}also knew that Phong's birthday
was the same day as Storm Sam.

545
00:58:51.819 --> 00:58:52.987
It's a pretty good read.

546
00:58:53.071 --> 00:58:54.989
It's just all that about
the butterfly effect. or the bird effect.

547
00:58:55.073 --> 00:58:56.574
I don't get it.

548
00:58:57.325 --> 00:59:00.161
As for the TV and the camcorder. sounds
exactly like the one he used to use.

549
00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:04.040
Hey. now that I think about it.
you're just like the drawing.

550
00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:08.419
So. who's the owner of that book?
You or Phong? And who is Professor Sam?

551
00:59:09.629 --> 00:59:12.799
The Institute for Research and
Technological Development of Electricity.

552
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:15.885
Where is that?

553
00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:21.599
It's close to here. If…
No. I can't take you there.

554
00:59:21.683 --> 00:59:25.061
I still have deliveries to do.
and I still don't have a wife or kids yet.

555
00:59:25.144 --> 00:59:27.772
There's a lot of electricity in there.
Step in there. I'll definitely be sterile.

556
00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:32.944
Trung. I need to go there.
For my daughter.

557
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:45.039
Okay but I'm only taking you there.
then I'm leaving. all right?

558
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:50.086
Thank you. You always help me out.

559
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:54.424
You crazy? This is the first time
we've met. What are you talking about?

560
00:59:55.633 --> 00:59:59.178
In another reality. we were friends.

561
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:06.019
<i>Back then. I was a first-year student</i>
<i>at medical school.</i>

562
01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:11.107
<i>Every morning. I would wake up at 6:05.</i>

563
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.192
<i>then leave the house by 6:20.</i>

564
01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:18.823
<i>I would buy banh mi at the shop</i>
<i>across the street before bus 16 came.</i>

565
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:29.834
<i>After three songs. I'd get to</i>
<i>the transfer station at the post office.</i>

566
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:38.176
<i>Five minutes before bus 24 arrived</i>
<i>to take me to school.</i>

567
01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:42.597
<i>Every day was like that. Until one day.</i>

568
01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.851
<i>That day. I had an exam.</i>
<i>I woke up five minutes late</i>

569
01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:48.311
<i>because I stayed up late the night before.</i>

570
01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:56.194
<i>I quickly left the house. When I got</i>
<i>to the bus stop. the bus had just left.</i>

571
01:00:56.277 --> 01:00:57.945
Hey!

572
01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:03.117
<i>Five minutes later. another bus came.</i>

573
01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:09.582
<i>I knew that if I was quick.</i>
<i>I'd still be able to catch bus 24.</i>

574
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:15.421
<i>I ran after the bus. but I didn't know</i>
<i>that waking up late that morning</i>

575
01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:17.674
<i>would change my life.</i>

576
01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.186
<i>That was when we met.</i>

577
01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:35.400
<i>That was the first time I saw Quan.</i>

578
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:44.033
<i>Then we got married</i>
<i>and had a lovely daughter together.</i>

579
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.550
Hey. freshen up. We're here.

580
01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:07.682
This is the last stop for me. all right?

581
01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:19.485
Hey. The storm's about to come.
Get home soon.

582
01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:23.781
You too.

583
01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:43.092
Mister. can you…

584
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:45.136
Mr. Quang?

585
01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:50.933
-Mr.…
-Do we know each other?

586
01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.270
Excuse me. I need to
talk with Professor Sam.

587
01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:55.605
-Do you know--
-The professor is very busy.

588
01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:57.064
He doesn't have time.

589
01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.234
But I need to ask about this book.

590
01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:03.070
Why do you believe in those silly books?

591
01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:07.992
I believe in it because
I'm the woman in this book.

592
01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.042
Follow me.

593
01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:39.649
Hello. lady from the future.
I'm Sam. Professor Sam.

594
01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:44.445
You… You're the one who wrote that book?

595
01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.323
Yes.

596
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:51.202
But how did you know
about me and that boy?

597
01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.125
It happened 20 years ago.

598
01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:01.420
<i>I remember the event 20 years ago</i>
<i>very clearly.</i>

599
01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.381
If we can create a cloud
that's electrically charged

600
01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:05.550
enough to work with
the compatible equipment.

601
01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.635
time machines are possible.

602
01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:08.886
Time machines?

603
01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.304
Exactly.

604
01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.853
<i>Everyone thought I'd lost my mind</i>

605
01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:20.314
<i>when I spent all my time researching</i>
<i>breaches in time.</i>

606
01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:25.319
<i>That was when that woman appeared.</i>

607
01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:32.869
<i>That day. she told me the story.</i>
<i>and I listened.</i>

608
01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.538
<i>She told me a story</i>
<i>that sounded impossible.</i>

609
01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:40.084
<i>A meeting between her son and a woman</i>
<i>from the future through the TV.</i>

610
01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:45.590
<i>Leaving the question.</i>
<i>could that actually happen?</i>

611
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:55.683
<i>At that time. I only dared to</i>
<i>tell her that it might be possible.</i>

612
01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:01.480
Maybe.

613
01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:04.942
Thank you. sir.

614
01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.111
Bye.

615
01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:15.036
<i>After that. I became Phong.</i>

616
01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:22.585
To write the book about you in the hopes
that someday you would appear

617
01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:26.380
and my research would be completed.

618
01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:36.140
Ms. Trang. can you tell me
how your story ended?

619
01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:43.981
I just want to know how to get back.

620
01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:59.664
In theory. you can return
on three conditions.

621
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:04.168
One. equipment.
The actual TV and camcorder.

622
01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:07.213
Second. location.
You must be at Phong's house.

623
01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:10.841
And third. the same electrical conditions

624
01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:14.762
as the storm that was happening that time.

625
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:23.145
But what if the storm has already passed?

626
01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:29.694
Then that opening will be forever closed.
and you'll never be able to return.

627
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:34.657
<i>At this time. Hurricane 11 is moving</i>
<i>in a west-southwest direction</i>

628
01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.951
<i>at 25 km per hour.</i>

629
01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:38.911
<i>It is estimated that the destructive power</i>
<i>of the storm will be at its highest</i>

630
01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.540
{\an8}<i>in the next eight hours before weakening</i>
<i>and becoming a tropical depression.</i>

631
01:06:42.623 --> 01:06:45.251
{\an8}<i>It is recommended that all residents stay</i>
<i>in their homes until the storm passes.</i>

632
01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.877
<i>We'll continue to update you</i>
<i>with further information.</i>

633
01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:47.920
Ms. Trang.

634
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.548
Why are you here?
I didn't do anything wrong.

635
01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:56.178
That's my car. The only way
you're going to leave here.

636
01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:02.935
After 20 years. a big storm
and the name "Le Phong".

637
01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.980
Though I didn't have many leads.
I was able to find you.

638
01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:12.028
Let's go back to the hospital.
then let's go to the station.

639
01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:16.032
What for? I don't have much more time.

640
01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.492
The boy. Le Phong. is connected to a case
that is presently under investigation.

641
01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:21.787
Are you saying you want to go by yourself?

642
01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:30.963
I know the case you're talking about.

643
01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:36.260
I even know where they've hidden the body.

644
01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:44.226
I think we need to negotiate.

645
01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.444
OUTFALL NO. 3

646
01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:07.833
Detective.

647
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:16.884
Looks like there's something here.

648
01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:24.869
PARALLEL

649
01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:58.986
{\an8}SIX HOURS BEFORE THE STORM ARRIVES

650
01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.578
So you're not letting me go yet?

651
01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:09.246
We had an agreement.

652
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:13.375
Everything's changed.
Now. you're a witness of a crime.

653
01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:14.627
So I have to keep you to investigate.

654
01:10:17.838 --> 01:10:19.590
But I don't have much more time.

655
01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:30.476
Ms. Trang. have you ever questioned
your life as it is right now?

656
01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:35.522
You've never been married. have you?

657
01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:41.403
I wish this was just a long dream.

658
01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.782
Tomorrow morning. I'll wake up.
and everything will return to normal.

659
01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:02.091
I can only help you until here.

660
01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:05.886
{\an8}MIRAGE APTS. ROOM 501

661
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.554
What is this?

662
01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:08.889
Didn't you say
you wanted to find Le Phong?

663
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.516
-Yes. But why--
-Go!

664
01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.142
Before I change my mind.

665
01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:24.530
<i>The city police have put out a warrant</i>

666
01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.115

<i>They are suspects</i>

668
01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:29.952
-<i>in a murder case where the body</i>
-You came here to watch the news?

669
01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.121
<i>was hidden near the hydroelectric dam</i>
<i>20 years earlier.</i>

670
01:11:33.747 --> 01:11:37.376
My name is Le Thi Duyen.

671
01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:44.258
Tell us what your relationship is
with Mr. Ha Quang Son.

672
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:47.011
We are husband and wife.

673
01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.765
So. have you found the thing I requested?

674
01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.559
Yes. we found it on Ms. Duyen's person.

675
01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:03.277
Hello. sir.

676
01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:15.998
Mr. Son. how do you feel
upon seeing your wife again?

677
01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:21.295
I don't understand what you're asking me.

678
01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:26.508
As we're waiting for the results
of the tests. let me tell you a story.

679
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:33.766
<i>On exactly this date 20 years ago…</i>

680
01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:36.518
<i>On an afternoon of a big storm.</i>

681
01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:41.357
<i>there was a poor woman standing</i>
<i>on the corner. looking towards a house.</i>

682
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:48.781
<i>She hesitated for a long while.</i>
<i>then decided to walk towards the house</i>

683
01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:52.534
<i>because she wanted to find</i>
<i>someone in that house.</i>

684
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.705
<i>Or more correctly. find the truth.</i>

685
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:06.256
<i>The woman should have</i>
<i>turned around and gone home.</i>

686
01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.805
-Nguyet?
-What do you want?

687
01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.432
There's someone I need to meet.

688
01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:16.475
I'm here by myself.

689
01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.393
I'm sorry.

690
01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:20.187
-Phong. Le Phong.
-<i>Because. that way.</i>

691
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:22.689
<i>she could have avoided seeing a truth</i>
<i>that hurt her deeply.</i>

692
01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:34.535
Hey. I have to go into the meeting now.
Yeah. everyone's here. What?

693
01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:38.497
Of course not. I love you. Bearcake.

694
01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:09.153
That's my spot.

695
01:14:12.906 --> 01:14:14.867
So you're the neighbor?

696
01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.664
So you slept with this
entire neighborhood. you old whore.

697
01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:22.207
Shut up.

698
01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.586
Yeah. I'm a whore. but at least I was able
to give your husband a child.

699
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:26.503
What?

700
01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.215
What is she talking about?

701
01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:35.888
Huh?

702
01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.979
Please don't say anymore.

703
01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:45.147
You…

704
01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:47.191
Honey.

705
01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:48.108
Run.

706
01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:50.652
Let me go.

707
01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.827
Stop! Stop!

708
01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:05.417
Anyone! Help me!

709
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.999
When you were doing this.

710
01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:51.421
did you ever think about your child?

711
01:15:54.424 --> 01:15:55.759
That's none of your business.

712
01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:59.638
This is my personal affair. As long as
I go home and do my duties as a husband.

713
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:10.524
Quan. I need to access
your company's information.

714
01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:12.067
No. you can't.

715
01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:13.360
That's confidential.

716
01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:17.281
Really? This seems
pretty confidential too.

717
01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.704
Do you recognize this necklace?

718
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:29.835
What necklace?

719
01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:34.256
All right. I'll look for it.

720
01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:40.554
Just follow the plan.

721
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.601
<i>On November 23. 1999.</i>
<i>at the Vietnam - Laos border.</i>

722
01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:48.145
<i>Ms. Luong Thanh Thu crossed into Laos.</i>

723
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.397
<i>She used a fake passport</i>
<i>because. at that time.</i>

724
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.191
<i>Ms. Thu was inside a barrel under</i>
<i>the runoff of the hydroelectric dam.</i>

725
01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.068
<i>The person who crossed the border</i>
<i>was actually Ms. Le Thi Duyen.</i>

726
01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:59.615
<i>the owner of this necklace. Your plan</i>
<i>was perfect. except for one thing.</i>

727
01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:07.372
-No.
-Give it back to me. please.

728
01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:13.629
-No.
-Phong.

729
01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:36.360
-<i>Le Phong</i>...
-Phong!

730
01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:37.944
<i>...the boy that picked up the necklace</i>

731
01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:39.905
<i>and accused you of murder.</i>

732
01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:40.822
Phong!

733
01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.700
That didn't happen.

734
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.827
He's a thief.

735
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:46.745
He's a liar.

736
01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:51.708
Yes.

737
01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:53.710
He's a liar.

738
01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:55.879
He's a thief.

739
01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:58.674
Or you turned him into a liar.

740
01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:01.051
You made him a thief.

741
01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:12.771
-Hello.
-Hello.

742
01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:15.148
-Just now. Phong was over at my house.
-Yes.

743
01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:18.735
He took my wife's necklace as a joke.
I'd like to have it back. please.

744
01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:20.070
Oh. I'm so sorry.

745
01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:23.573
<i>The boy became a thief</i>

746
01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:31.915
<i>and a liar in the eyes of his own mother.</i>

747
01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.797
Give it to him.

748
01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:55.355
At that time. that boy.
Le Phong. was defeated by you.

749
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.988
But that boy never stopped
looking for the truth.

750
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.951
There's only one person named Le Phong.

751
01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:10.537
That's the only reason
he's lasted until now.

752
01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:17.085
So this guy lived in my house
20 years ago.

753
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:22.424
After 20 years.

754
01:19:22.507 --> 01:19:27.637
the storm has returned and blown away
all the lies that you created.

755
01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:36.772
You mean…

756
01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:38.857
Yes.

757
01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:43.278
I am Le Phong.

758
01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:47.741
It's time you paid for your crimes.

759
01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:55.957
Right now. I'm in the western part
of the city. and the rain is pouring down.

760
01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.584
The wind has broken many branches.

761
01:19:57.667 --> 01:20:00.879
making it extremely difficult
to get around.

762
01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:03.381
Luckily. the residents of the city
have evacuated in time.

763
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.176
The storm will continue
to move west-southwest

764
01:20:06.259 --> 01:20:10.013
and is expected to be
the strongest storm in five years.

765
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.271
OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT

766
01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:27.113
{\an8}THE STORM ARRIVES

767
01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.055
Phong.

768
01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.436
Phong! Le Phong!

769
01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:08.238
So you've come?

770
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.621
Why did you do that?
Why did you joke around with me?

771
01:21:19.499 --> 01:21:21.042
Because you saved my life.

772
01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:29.134
<i>After that. everything started to change.</i>

773
01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:35.765
<i>Not long after. my family moved.</i>

774
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:45.275
<i>I had to see a therapist.</i>

775
01:21:47.777 --> 01:21:51.072
<i>I wanted to end everything</i>
<i>so I wouldn't have to suffer anymore.</i>

776
01:21:54.868 --> 01:22:00.332
But then… I thought of you.

777
01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:03.209
I thought of the person that saved me.

778
01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:13.011
<i>The only clue I had was the clock.</i>

779
01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:19.017
<i>I wanted to see you again to thank you.</i>

780
01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:25.148
<i>I would always sit there.</i>
<i>and the clock would always be running.</i>

781
01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:29.694
<i>As for you. I never saw you.</i>

782
01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:36.451
<i>I got hired</i>
<i>as a postal delivery man there.</i>

783
01:22:55.553 --> 01:22:58.223
<i>Until I was tired of waiting.</i>

784
01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:02.060
<i>And I was afraid that I was delusional.</i>

785
01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:07.399
<i>But just at that moment.</i>

786
01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:10.777
<i>I saw you.</i>

787
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:38.221
<i>My past and my future</i>
<i>met at that place and time.</i>

788
01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.099
<i>You saved my life again.</i>

789
01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:08.501
You tricked me. I need the TV.

790
01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:35.695
The TV… Where is it?

791
01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:38.323
I need the TV.

792
01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:41.826
I don't have much more time.

793
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:42.994
The TV.

794
01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:03.755
I remember now.

795
01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.551
I was always afraid this day would come.

796
01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:13.056
The day you would disappear from my life.

797
01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:18.436
<i>Then it happened.</i>

798
01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:21.022
So you misidentified your husband?

799
01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:23.691
<i>You were treating me like a stranger.</i>

800
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:32.241
<i>I took you to Doctor Minh.</i>
<i>but you still didn't remember anything.</i>

801
01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:34.118
<i>Then you escaped the hospital.</i>

802
01:29:34.827 --> 01:29:36.579
<i>And I looked for you everywhere.</i>

803
01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:42.752
<i>Then. when I found you again.</i>
<i>I followed you to make sure you were safe.</i>

804
01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.093
I'm sorry.

805
01:29:52.011 --> 01:29:53.346
I'm so sorry.

806
01:29:59.685 --> 01:30:01.104
It's okay. Everything is okay now.

807
01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:09.570
You're back with me now.

808
01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.075
Mommy!

809
01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:22.959
I…

810
01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:28.965
I can't. I can't stay here.

811
01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:35.304
Why not?

812
01:30:36.639 --> 01:30:38.558
I can't forget my daughter.

813
01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:43.062
Puppy needs me.

814
01:30:45.314 --> 01:30:47.900
But Puppy and that life don't exist.

815
01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:51.571
It would have existed
if you didn't look for me.

816
01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.624
What about me? What am I to you?

817
01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:09.630
I wish…

818
01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:16.345
we would have met in a different way.

819
01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:52.840
Trang.

820
01:31:53.424 --> 01:31:54.258
What are you doing?

821
01:31:59.096 --> 01:32:02.850
I know you still have the TV.

822
01:32:03.226 --> 01:32:04.101
Calm down.

823
01:32:05.102 --> 01:32:06.729
Tomorrow.
everything will be back to normal.

824
01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:12.735
Yes. tomorrow.
everything will be back to normal.

825
01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:18.366
Trang.

826
01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:20.284
Don't you see this is unfair to me?

827
01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:23.454
-Trang.
-I saved you once.

828
01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:25.122
Trang.

829
01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.083
Now it's your turn to save me.

830
01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:33.256
Trang.

831
01:33:30.646 --> 01:33:32.023
-Phong.
-<i>Mister… Mister…</i>

832
01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:34.483
-<i>Who are you? Mom!</i>
-Phong. I'm you in the future.

833
01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:38.154
Dan Truong. Dan Truong.

834
01:33:38.237 --> 01:33:40.072
"Rain On Our Love". Remember?

835
01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:43.576
<i>Where is the lady from the other day?</i>

836
01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:47.288
-Forget her.
-<i>Mister. I can't hear you.</i>

837
01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:50.541
-Phong.
-<i>Mister.</i>

838
01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:51.625
Don't look for her.

839
01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:55.755
-<i>Mister.</i>
-Don't look for her.

840
01:33:55.838 --> 01:34:00.051
Then she will return.

841
01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:49.433
Puppy!

842
01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:09.036
Why are you crying. Mommy?

843
01:35:12.623 --> 01:35:13.999
I love you.

844
01:35:20.589 --> 01:35:23.092
Why are you getting so emotional
so early in the morning?

845
01:35:26.929 --> 01:35:32.351
Puppy. go and pack your things. We're
going to Grandma's house for a few days.

846
01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:35.020
Yeah! Let's go. Daddy!

847
01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:36.689
-What's going on?
-No school!

848
01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:39.191
Today is our wedding anniversary.

849
01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:42.278
Go celebrate with your girlfriend.

850
01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:57.710
Mommy. why isn't Daddy going with us?

851
01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.631
Because he has to go
with someone more important.

852
01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:04.633
Then let's leave him at home. Let's go!

853
01:36:05.676 --> 01:36:07.636
Get on the bike.

854
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.138
Let's go.

855
01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:39.210
POLICE DEPARTMENT

856
01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:44.632
<i>I'd like to report a murder.</i>
