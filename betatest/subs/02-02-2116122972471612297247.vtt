00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:36.109
THE VANISHED

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.654
Don't worry about a thing.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.782
and get some rest.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:06:53.079
[background music]

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.423
You're sweating.
are you okay?

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:07.218
A bit thirsty.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.637
Could you get me a drink?

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.524
Kiddo. what's he up to?

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.568
Instagramming daily outfits. probably.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.403
Okay. the report's done.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.530
- I did that.
- Thank you.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.032
Shouldn't we send the witness
to a hospital

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.534
and send the report first?

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.995
The chief is on the way.
hold your horses.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.664
His phone is off.
let's just ditch him.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.541
What's the point of him
showing up?

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.543
He'll just check in and
take off again.

00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:43.921
Today's case is hardcore.
I doubt he will.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:47.425
He can't function without booze.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.555
I heard he was a legend
in homicide back in the day.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.975
He solved that mutilation case
a few years back.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.062
What's a 'legend'?
An unauthenticated story.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.439
No one saw it.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.274
I did. on the news.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.152
He's got a President's Award for it.

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.821
The President will call and say
he'll want it back.

00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:11.824
Why'd someone that good
come to our district?

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.243
Didn't the superintendent
bring him?

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.579
Chief worked for him then.

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.748
That's bullcrap.
no one brought him.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:23.002
He may be drunk everyday.
but he's a true detective.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.047
Have some respect
for your superiors.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.925
Remember going on a case
with him a month ago?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.301
What the heck?

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.470
Isn't that the chief's car?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.138
Like a true detective.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.190
Gosh. my head...

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:46.275
Salute!

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.985
It's not a bumper car.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.737
I'm getting a new one soon anyway.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.113
I've heard that before.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.823
Why don't you answer
your phone?

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:56.661
My battery's low.
I turned it off for important calls.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.789
Your phone'll last longer
than your car.

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:01.749
get a new one. will you?

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.168
Cars can be just swapped.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.296
but phones have to be backed up.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:09.257
You know how annoying that is?

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:11.467
These things are
getting more complicated.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.636
So what's the important call?

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.014
I gotta go to a funeral later.

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.434
Lt. KWON Chang's mother
passed away.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:21.394
Who?

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.104
You don't know him.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.065
Set an alarm for midnight.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.151
- What for?
- For the funeral.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:36.367
He's being taken care of.
He says he was struck from behind.

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:38.077
So he passed out?

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.079
And he worked here
for a long time?

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.789
Yes. 4 years.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.375
He doesn't remember
how he passed out.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.671
Guards here get freaked out
even with a phone call at night.

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.131
He got scared too. I guess.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.551
The night guard says
he saw a ghost.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.304
- A ghost?
- Weird. eh?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.681
Wanna meet him?

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.976
Who? The ghost?
Forget it.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.895
What do you think?

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:07.565
I think he's stabilizing.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.151
You idiot. not that.

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:12.737
Oh. right.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.949
He can't be ruled out.
but he has no motive.

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.452
and doesn't fit the profile.

00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:23.205
Right. he doesn't look like a criminal.

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:26.375
No need to keep him.
let him go.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.460
Okay.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.172
So why were
the security cams busted?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:35.426
Actually. the cams went out
because of a blackout earlier.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.845
Control room isn't accessible yet.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.389
- Why not?
- The door's locked.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.266
Who's in charge?

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.851
The technicians.

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:47.605
Blackout killed the door.
and the code doesn't work.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.066
So useless...

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.276
Just get them to kick it down!

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:53.736
Right away. sir.

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.739
Any signs of intrusion?

00:10:56.989 --> 00:11:01.369
No. all the doors were locked.
and no other entry ways.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.788
What do you make of it?

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.749
We don't really have any
evidences to go on.

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:24.892
YOON Seol-hee. age 45.
chairman of Barron Holdings.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.937
She's the heiress of Ilsin Group.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.773
Married to Prof. PARK Jin-han.

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.526
he was named CEO
of a Barron affiliate.

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.570
They're a celebrity couple.

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:39.907
He became famous for
being a trophy husband.

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.702
Initial cause of death
is cardiac arrest.

00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:48.332
He accompanied her body
until she arrived here.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:49.792
Yo. Lego.

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:51.293
Sir?

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:55.089
Where did you get this file folder?

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:56.507
Online.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:12:01.387
Good. order me one too.
it's light and sturdy.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:06.434
Her body vanished here for sure.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.353
We kept a lid on the media.

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:12.690
but they'll swarm in
in the morning.

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:16.318
Why'd anyone steal a body?

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:21.699
Some religions are against autopsy.
maybe she was part of it?

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.452
She had a Christian name. Veronica.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.371
Hey. they could have switched to
something else.

00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:29.707
Have you contacted the husband?

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.834
Should we call him?

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:35.588
He can't be easily
summoned for nothing.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:39.717
And you summon me
for nothing everyday?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.760
It's also the fact that

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.638
his wife just died.
he might be in a bad mood.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.099
I'm in a bad mood.
you think I like being here?

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.309
Call him!

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.103
Morning sickness?

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.147
Not yet.
it's only been 6 weeks.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:57.401
7 weeks you mean.
some never have it.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.196
Hye-jin.

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:04.742
Yes. hello?

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.121
What?

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.585
Pardon?

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:18.631
What do you mean
the body's gone?

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.678
I'll be right there.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.185
Who was that?

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.188
Professor!

00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.191
The cops.

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:38.901
I think something's wrong.

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:41.529
What do you mean
the body's gone?

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.155
I better check it out.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:46.617
Can't you send someone?
Something's not right.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:49.620
No. people could get suspicious.

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:53.040
Don't worry and
get some dinner.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.000
But we just ate together.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.878
Got any painkillers around here?

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.298
There's some in that cabinet...

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:04.176
But what for?

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:06.929
I'll call you later.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.080
Illegal Parking Warning

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.361
What was that?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.281
It's nothing.
don't worry about it.

00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:14.038
Did I tell you to wear that suit?

00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:15.789
It wasn't this?

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:19.543
Got a lecture today?
You look like a student.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.046
Change the tie.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.256
Sure.

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.926
How was the business trip?

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.261
Boring. obviously.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:32.598
Got anything stronger?

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:37.353
Anything stronger will
interfere with your jet lag.

00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:40.022
Wine is your style.

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.650
Have some too.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.401
I gotta get to work.

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.529
I got a strategy meeting.
and a lecture too.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.199
KIM will send you
the meeting report.

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:53.035
Oh yeah. KIM won't be
coming into work.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.329
What?

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.207
I didn't like her much.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:01.085
She's sloppy at her work.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.838
I went to mother's
2 days ago.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.758
She wasn't recovering well
after the surgery.

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.009
so I told KIM to...

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:11.345
You go there a lot
for a busy man.

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.975
Mom must be trying to
take you away from me.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:22.022
It was a short visit.
so I told KIM not to report.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.649
No.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.777
I told her to report everything.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.947
Why do you make
all decisions by yourself?

00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:37.538
Because it's my company.

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:46.046
Right. my mistake.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.635
Drink this
and get some rest.

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:06.775
Just my style.

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:34.845
Let's go away.
cancel your class.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:39.558
You don't take my job seriously.
do you?

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.114
So cute.

00:17:57.659 --> 00:18:00.329
You're cute when you're flustered.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:30.484
Sorry for the late call.
please come inside.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:46.333
I'd like to apologize again
for bringing you down so late.

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.796
I'll brief you on the incident
as told by the night guard.

00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:54.716
At 8:10 PM. he went to check
on a weird noise coming from the morgue.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.803
and found that Mrs. YOON's body
had vanished.

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.389
But he must have been
shaken up.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:03.934
and his testimonies are
inconsistent.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.815
Please continue.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.777
As I've said.
what he witnessed...

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.948
Hye-jin: I keep getting weird calls
from an unknown number.

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:21.618
Sorry.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:25.539
The night guard isn't too credible.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:30.502
Pardon me.
could you get to the point?

00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:35.716
Someone may have
stolen her body.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.646
You can't smoke in here.

00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.107
No. it's okay.
Please. go ahead.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:21.678
How does a government agency
lose a body?

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:25.849
We didn't lose it.
just to be clear.

00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:30.312
Who should I talk to then?
The superintendent?

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.522
Should I get him?

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:35.150
We wanted to tell you
we're doing everything to help...

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:36.485
Help?

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.529
Sorry.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.157
We'd like to ask you
for your cooperation.

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.871
I am cooperating.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:54.169
Was there anyone
who had any ill will against her?

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:56.964
None.

00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:59.633
She ran a business.
she could've made enemies...

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.385
She didn't have any.

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.679
What about you?

00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:11.311
Are you asking
if I stole her body?

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.772
Of course not!

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:22.364
Someone could've targeted her
as a way to get to you.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:23.782
None.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.701
What about the other bodies?

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.828
The perp could've stolen it
because he needed bodies.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:31.289
He wasn't interested in
other bodies.

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:33.917
None of the body bags
were opened.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.462
The zippers are new.
so they're stiff.

00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:40.966
but other bags were
zipped up properly.

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:45.512
He couldn't have
closed them so neatly.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:48.515
No traces of physical contact too.

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:53.145
They were specifically
after her body.

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:57.524
Why would these people
steal her dead body?

00:21:57.774 --> 00:21:59.693
Not plural.

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:07.200
That door is weighted.
so it closes automatically.

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:12.289
Here's the weird thing.

00:22:12.914 --> 00:22:14.541
The floor.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.297
The floor's been scratched.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.637
That wouldn't be necessary
with 2 people.

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:32.059
Right. the other could've
held the door open.

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:35.854
But the perp used that
to hold it open.

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:49.618
Only something as heavy
kept the weighted door open.

00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:52.954
Mr. PARK.

00:22:57.834 --> 00:22:59.961
May I bum you a smoke?

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.930
Chief.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:11.515
Chief?

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:13.350
Dr. CHA's here.

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:16.353
She has something
to ask the professor.

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.442
She flew in overnight
from the States?

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.694
She had a fear of flying.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:28.240
Cause of death is cardiac arrest.
possibly due to stress.

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:30.826
Did she have...

00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:34.538
epilepsy or signs of
psychological illnesses?

00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:40.252
Are you asking
if my wife was crazy?

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:43.797
No. I read her medical records.

00:23:44.297 --> 00:23:47.092
but she and her spouse
know more in depth.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.677
Just check her records.

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:52.514
But still. I didn't live with her.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:53.432
Nothing.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.271
But why is that important?

00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:02.691
There is a theory
I'd like to rule out...

00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:10.866
Have you heard of catalepsy?

00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:12.409
Catal-what?

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.998
So you're saying
she's not dead?

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:23.837
Wait. Dr. CHA.

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:26.631
What are you saying?
She's not dead?

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.884
It's nearly impossible.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.554
but a person can be falsely
pronounced dead.

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.806
Which is why our funeral
takes over 3 days.

00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:37.309
That's impossible.
she could've screamed.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.519
Let's think practically.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:44.191
Even if it's theoretical.
we can't rule it out.

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:48.111
Is this a shaman's shrine?
This is the National Forensic Service!

00:24:48.528 --> 00:24:52.032
Some bastard stole it.
why complicate things?

00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:53.909
Who'd steal it though?

00:24:54.117 --> 00:24:56.244
You sure about the cause of death?

00:24:56.661 --> 00:25:00.916
I didn't verify it myself.
but it's 99% certain.

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:03.084
1%!

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.214
All cases are murders
until proven otherwise.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.759
The cause can't be 100% proven
without an autopsy.

00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:13.720
and without a body.
autopsy can't be done!

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.972
Evidence has disappeared.

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:18.058
So she was murdered?
By whom?

00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:20.477
By someone who'd
benefit most from it.

00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:23.939
Lego. your thoughts?

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.858
He's annoying.

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:32.280
I doubt it.
I don't think that's it.

00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:35.033
Right. I think you went overboard.

00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:38.119
The professor even requested
autopsy himself.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:40.789
Maybe he wanted to avoid suspicion.

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:46.169
Warrant for the body'd be issued.
and he'll get all of her fortune.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.880
Just stop it.

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:52.217
We shouldn't suspect anything
so carelessly.

00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:53.718
He's a VIP.

00:25:55.262 --> 00:26:00.100
Forget what she said.
I got some questions.

00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:05.105
You said she didn't
have any enemies.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:08.358
then who was she close to?

00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:14.447
Her sister.
she didn't have friends.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.285
She didn't have anyone

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.455
who followed her
or contacted her?

00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.541
Are you asking
if she cheated?

00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:26.960
Did it sound like that?

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.336
Not at all.

00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:30.380
- How'd you know?
- Know what?

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:35.468
How'd you know if she
cheated on you or not?

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.559
She was my woman.
I'd know.

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:44.769
Okay. Mr. PARK.

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:48.106
Where were you
between 9 and 10?

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:48.982
Why?

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:52.360
We called your house.
but no one answered.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:53.987
Is that a problem?

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:56.573
Somewhere inconvenient to say?

00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:03.413
I went to the pharmacy
to get migraine pills.

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:04.831
I got the call there.

00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:07.542
And you came right away
from there?

00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:08.918
Right.

00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:12.422
Then you must have the pills.
can I take a look?

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:25.185
Detective.

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:28.188
Am I a suspect?

00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:37.489
On your windshield.

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.369
Looks like a parking warning.

00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:45.205
Were you at the pharmacy long?

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:48.124
This is getting weird.

00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:51.544
You lost her body.
but I'm getting the heat?

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.129
Professor. we didn't lose...

00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:56.049
- It's a formality.
- Formality?!

00:27:57.425 --> 00:27:59.219
I've never heard of
such formality.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.806
Of course not.
it's your first time.

00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:04.307
Yeah?

00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.646
Let me make a call.

00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:11.606
Sure thing.
please do.

00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:16.820
- Chief?
- What?

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.365
It's almost midnight.
that funeral you mentioned...

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:24.702
It's been cancelled.

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:29.332
Funerals get cancelled?

00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:42.220
Attorney PARK. can you talk?

00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:44.973
Why are you suddenly overreacting?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.060
You're not being really objective
right now.

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:54.566
I'm a very subjective person.

00:28:56.734 --> 00:29:01.030
Shouldn't that bastard be
jumping up and down.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.741
if he heard his wife could
still be alive?

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.118
Humans tend to

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:08.747
act abnormally when they're
under extreme circumstances.

00:29:08.955 --> 00:29:11.916
He's too abnormal.
is what I'm saying.

00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:14.127
Something's off.

00:29:15.628 --> 00:29:20.049
You exhibit victim mentality
towards the wealthy.

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:22.260
or a type of trauma...

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:30.685
Right. trauma.
it's an illness.

00:29:32.812 --> 00:29:34.230
I'm sorry.

00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:37.650
I blabber too much
as I age.

00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:39.235
Not at all.

00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:42.197
You were always like that.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.658
It's okay.
it's all in the past.

00:29:47.702 --> 00:29:51.498
Accepting your loss
leads to a full recovery.

00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:55.293
Get some exercise.
eat properly.

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:57.462
and drink less.

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.548
The dead will kill the living.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:05.303
What's the point?
I'm paying for my sins.

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:08.264
Why do you always...

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.558
What the heck?

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:44.050
[door opening]

00:31:07.073 --> 00:31:12.328
[box opening]

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:53.369
This was originally developed
for anesthetic.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.497
but it never reached the market.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.834
It dissolves fast.
and has no odor.

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.712
But also fatal.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:09.093
Full body paralysis in 8 hours.
loss of consciousness.

00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:11.220
and death.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.806
You know what's scarier?

00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:16.059
Scarier than death?

00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:20.521
There's no trace.
nothing left behind.

00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:23.900
Even an autopsy can't find it.

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:28.529
A perfect crime would be possible.

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:33.242
Shouldn't this be destroyed?

00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:38.373
No.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.918
There may be some use for it.

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:58.810
Mr. PARK. what're you doing here?

00:32:59.894 --> 00:33:01.813
I heard some noise...

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.816
This shouldn't be here.

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:08.486
That looks like my wife's.
shouldn't you take a good care of it?

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.571
Check with the list.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.866
Cell phone's missing.

00:33:16.202 --> 00:33:18.204
Empty your pocket.

00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:19.956
What?

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:23.251
Let's see what's in there.
Get everything out.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.589
Are you accusing me
of taking her phone?

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:31.175
- Empty it. please.
- Pull what?

00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:33.428
I saw everything!

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:36.931
- You have no right...
- This is your last chance!

00:33:37.056 --> 00:33:38.891
Even cops have due process!

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.686
What are you doing?!
Let go!

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.026
What's this?

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.072
I don't know.

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:56.242
How dare you
treat me like this!

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:57.744
What is this?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.247
This isn't ours.
I'm not sure.

00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:03.166
- Can you test it?
- Yes.

00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:05.460
I'm done with this.
talk to my lawyer.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:08.171
Mr. PARK. don't you get it?

00:34:08.671 --> 00:34:11.299
You can't leave until
we know what that is!

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.216
I don't know!

00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:15.678
That's why you must
stay here until we do!

00:34:26.522 --> 00:34:27.440
Yes. superintendent.

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:31.110
Chief WOO. are you by any chance.

00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:33.905
holding Prof. PARK
in your custody?

00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.741
Well. that's what's happening.

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:40.286
I got a call from
the prosecutor's office!

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.038
Just let him go.

00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:44.624
I see. I'm sorry.

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.584
It'll be over soon.
don't worry about it.

00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:49.921
Over soon?
You'll be over soon!

00:34:50.546 --> 00:34:53.591
You said you'll stay low.
what the hell are you doing?!

00:34:54.008 --> 00:34:57.136
Are you trying to screw me over?

00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:01.474
PARK had a bottle that
could be the murder weapon.

00:35:01.557 --> 00:35:03.101
Murder weapon?

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.145
You're my murder weapon. bastard!

00:35:06.479 --> 00:35:08.606
I don't know what you're up to.
but stop! Right this second!

00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:09.482
Okay.

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.068
Happy? Can I leave now?

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:15.780
Dr. CHA. proceed with
the analysis of the sample.

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:20.785
And you. you may wait here.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:22.328
Didn't you hear his order?

00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:23.830
Goddammit!

00:35:25.498 --> 00:35:28.126
These phones are getting worse!

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:30.962
It's like a freaking speakerphone.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.717
Hey. put a man on him.
keep him safe.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.053
So nothing happens to him.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.263
Yes. sir.

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:49.814
The control room placement is
different between 2 floors.

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:53.693
See? There's an extra space
underneath.

00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:57.905
Look for a vent system
to the basement.

00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.782
I marked it in red.

00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:01.951
- All of them?
- Get going.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.122
YOON's personal lawyer
is her sister. right?

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:06.956
Right.

00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.541
- Made contact yet?
- Yes. I have.

00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:10.543
I'm heading out now.

00:36:10.793 --> 00:36:13.921
Look for any dirt
surrounding their fortune.

00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:15.631
Right away.

00:36:17.049 --> 00:36:20.553
Dammit!
These shoes are brand new...

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.223
What a terrible weather.
just like how I feel.

00:36:24.557 --> 00:36:28.603
That professor is weird though.
carrying around weird meds.

00:36:28.769 --> 00:36:31.355
Chief is the weirdest one.

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:35.776
He should be gone by now.
and he's going way overboard.

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.364
If this goes bad. we're screwed...

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:43.117
Nature calls.

00:37:00.509 --> 00:37:01.677
Hey!

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:04.555
Look over there.

00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:06.891
Oh. okay. sure.

00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:10.353
- Did you see?
- I sure did!

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:13.439
I'm serious.
did you see it?

00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:16.108
You can't even see it.
it's so small...

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:21.155
You mean this?
What about it?

00:37:24.867 --> 00:37:26.202
Shall we?

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.580
It's all wrong.
not going in there.

00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:35.002
It's like my life.
all messed up.

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:38.047
Are we getting overtime for this?

00:37:38.464 --> 00:37:40.132
Why is this cut?

00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:44.845
I didn't touch anything.

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:51.936
What the hell!

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.354
- Hello there.
- Sorry.

00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:56.357
Why are you here?

00:37:56.732 --> 00:37:58.317
70cm wide. 65cm high.

00:37:58.526 --> 00:38:00.653
this vent is connected
to the outside.

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.488
It's about 30m long.

00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:05.908
I intuitively thought the perp
used this vent to get inside.

00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.868
Good work.
I'm proud of you.

00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:12.873
Can the blackout cause
the door to jam?

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:16.168
It's not that.
the code was changed.

00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:17.461
Who'd change it?

00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:20.006
Who knows.
it wasn't us.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:24.552
Why were the cams busted?

00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.513
The circuitry's burned up.

00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:31.684
The leak from the rain could've caused
an electric shock.

00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:33.894
but the odd thing is.

00:38:34.228 --> 00:38:37.398
with safety measure in place.
it shouldn't get this bad.

00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:39.275
So someone tampered with it?

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.027
Yes. probably.

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:46.365
But that's on.

00:38:46.782 --> 00:38:49.243
That's the roadside cam.

00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:52.204
isn't that managed by the city?

00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:56.667
Yeah. this feed is online.
it wasn't affected by the blackout.

00:38:57.126 --> 00:39:00.254
Yeah? So it's recorded?

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.381
Sure. I think so.

00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:11.807
Sorry for calling you
about this.

00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:14.310
Let's get together soon.

00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:24.028
Where's the washroom?

00:39:24.236 --> 00:39:26.238
Pardon?
Over there.

00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:49.428
Professor.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:52.431
You can't call so often.
they could suspect me.

00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:54.225
I'm just worried.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.935
What kind of calls are you getting?

00:39:56.018 --> 00:39:57.603
I was scared
so I didn't answer.

00:39:58.187 --> 00:40:00.439
What did the cops say?

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:03.859
Someone must've
taken Seol-hee's body.

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:06.529
That's crazy... Who?

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:09.156
I don't know.
something's wrong.

00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:12.326
TH-16 was in
her personal belongings.

00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:14.912
What do you mean?
Didn't you destroy them all?

00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:18.582
I destroyed everything
after the job was done.

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.043
Did you mention it
to anyone?

00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:23.587
Are you nuts?
Why would I?

00:40:24.547 --> 00:40:28.509
Maybe people she fired
knew about it.

00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:31.053
No. that's impossible.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.973
No one knows about TH-16.

00:40:57.329 --> 00:40:58.831
To my love.
Prof. PARK

00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:04.253
Professor!

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:07.548
Hye-jin!

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.759
What happened?
What did the ER say?

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:12.178
It's okay.
no big deal.

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.263
And the baby?
Is the baby okay?

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.892
Yeah. baby's fine.
it's just a wrist sprain.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.227
You sure it's not broken?

00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:23.230
Did you see the driver's face?

00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:25.941
Security cams or dash cams?

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.445
Cops came by.
but no witnesses.

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.657
What kind of car was it?

00:41:34.241 --> 00:41:38.454
It was black. but not sure.
I was just scared.

00:41:39.413 --> 00:41:41.957
I thought you had a meeting.

00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:48.547
It's fine.
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:14.740
You're late.

00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:18.077
Sorry. I got a lot of work lately.

00:42:19.328 --> 00:42:20.913
And my calls?

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:23.791
I was in a meeting.

00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:27.336
You weren't at the lab either.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:31.632
I met with the Ministry of Health
about potential investment.

00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:36.345
Let's halt new med research.
it'll take too long.

00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:38.847
Halt it altogether?

00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:41.559
And the work so far?
All the researchers?

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.644
MOON will take care of it.

00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:46.105
What the hell does he know?!

00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:54.863
You think you're the CEO
because you're so smart?

00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:04.957
I'm sorry.
I won't forget it.

00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:14.633
What is more important
than work?

00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.432
It's my fault.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.644
I'll reserve the tickets again.
let's go see it tomorrow.

00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:31.483
Do you love me?

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:35.446
Of course.
is there ever any doubt?

00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:40.451
Let's go live
in the States for a year.

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:42.828
Sure. let's plan it.

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:47.708
Do you need anything. honey?

00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.753
Want a new car?

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:54.632
That's alright.
I just got a new one.

00:43:58.427 --> 00:44:01.639
You know that you can't
leave me. right?

00:44:05.684 --> 00:44:10.272
But it's so hard to have you.

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:23.118
Hello? Professor?

00:44:23.285 --> 00:44:26.622
Someone knows something.
about us.

00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:27.873
Professor?

00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:31.335
Chief is looking for you.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.925
You're saying...

00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:43.305
someone murdered my sister?

00:44:43.597 --> 00:44:45.849
It's a principal
of forensic science.

00:44:46.392 --> 00:44:48.018
all deaths are...

00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:49.853
Did you show him that?

00:44:51.438 --> 00:44:52.648
The prenup.

00:44:53.273 --> 00:44:54.566
What for?

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.111
You know...

00:44:57.403 --> 00:44:59.029
Prenup?

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.323
This is brutal...

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.910
May I make a copy?

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.539
Mrs. YOON?

00:45:16.588 --> 00:45:19.091
This is the front entrance feed.

00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:23.095
All the cars going in and out during
the time of crime are captured.

00:45:23.303 --> 00:45:24.805
Let's watch.

00:45:25.013 --> 00:45:28.016
Your car. my car.

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.768
My unit's car.

00:45:30.644 --> 00:45:32.062
Ambulance.

00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:38.193
So what?

00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:42.364
No other cars
beside ours.

00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:45.033
The perp didn't drive.

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.744
He walked here
over that hill.

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:52.207
But would he have
carried the body over it?

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.043
It's a long walk
even without the body.

00:45:55.502 --> 00:45:57.421
So what'd he do?

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:04.720
The body could be nearby.

00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:08.682
We're canvasing it.
so please wait.

00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:23.614
Eh? July 20. 2007?
That's busted too.

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.328
Boss

00:46:31.997 --> 00:46:32.956
Let's go.

00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:42.508
Lego

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.761
Did you find anything?

00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:48.013
I'm on my way to
YOON's office now.

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:49.264
What for?

00:46:49.431 --> 00:46:52.559
I don't understand
what happened.

00:46:52.851 --> 00:46:54.520
but we got something.

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.313
What do you mean?

00:46:56.438 --> 00:46:58.732
Her sister received a text.

00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:02.069
the sender is YOON Seol-hee.

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:02.778
What?

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.241
It could be a prank. but we're
headed to YOON's office just in case.

00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:09.117
Okay fine.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:11.912
Yeah?

00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:14.039
Sir. I found a footprint.

00:47:15.415 --> 00:47:17.501
What? A footprint?

00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:21.421
Yeah. but it's a bit.
I mean. very weird.

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:23.215
It's a woman's print.

00:47:23.715 --> 00:47:25.467
About size 6...

00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:29.471
Okay. hang up for now.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.891
What the hell?

00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:37.813
Come over here.
this way.

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:40.315
I don't know why
the sprinkler activated!

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:43.402
Follow me!
What's with today?

00:47:57.082 --> 00:47:57.791
Professor!

00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:01.420
Hye-jin. those calls you got.
what's the number?

00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:05.674
It ended with 4104.

00:48:06.258 --> 00:48:07.467
What is it?

00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:12.139
That's Seol-hee's number...

00:48:12.472 --> 00:48:13.390
What?

00:48:14.474 --> 00:48:18.854
Don't go outside
and lock the door.

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.397
Don't worry.

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:22.482
You're scaring me...

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.154
Professor?

00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:30.407
Professor? Are you there?

00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:38.248
Professor!

00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:40.542
Seol-hee is alive.

00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:43.670
What?

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:47.591
She's here.

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:49.301
What do you mean?

00:48:49.509 --> 00:48:52.888
July 20. only she and I
know about that date.

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:54.640
She framed me.

00:48:54.806 --> 00:48:56.391
so the cops would be
suspicious of me.

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:59.394
Are the cops onto you?

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.271
It doesn't matter.

00:49:01.396 --> 00:49:04.316
If she's alive. I didn't do
anything wrong.

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.527
You said she was dead.
how did this happen?

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.656
If TH-16 didn't affect
the nervous system...

00:49:11.156 --> 00:49:12.949
It can't be...

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:16.995
If she used recreational drugs.
it could excite the central nerves.

00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:18.413
and suppress TH-16...

00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:20.374
That's impossible.

00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:23.502
Then she normally took drugs?

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:28.548
No. she knew from the start.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.149
She's not someone
who'll end things so easily.

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:51.363
Is she trying to avenge us?

00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:55.867
Hello? Hye-jin?

00:49:56.243 --> 00:49:58.245
Hello? Hello?

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:35.782
How could she...

00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:41.288
It has to be a prank...

00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:50.130
It's possible to track
the sender. right?

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:51.715
What?

00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:54.593
We'll have to get a warrant...

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.678
From YOON Seol-hee

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.972
To YOON Seol-hee

00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:01.016
She sent this to herself?

00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:09.608
Found this in the bathroom.

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.444
Someone tossed it
in the trash.

00:51:12.652 --> 00:51:15.405
As the fire spread.
the sprinkler activated.

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.116
PARK smoked this brand.

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:20.786
Chief WOO!

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:23.163
Is it analyzed?

00:51:23.288 --> 00:51:27.167
It's a form of poison that
shuts down the nervous system.

00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:28.126
A poison?

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:30.128
Could I get a complete report?

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:33.006
Exact analysis could take
some more time.

00:51:33.381 --> 00:51:35.550
So it really is a murder?

00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:37.803
That's why the perp
hid the body.

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:40.055
- Could you hurry?
- Okay.

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.518
Boss

00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:46.686
Where are you?

00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:48.021
At the scene. sir.

00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:52.108
I told you to release him!
You don't have a warrant!

00:51:52.734 --> 00:51:55.862
Sir. could you send me some men?

00:51:56.154 --> 00:51:58.240
What? Are you insane?!

00:51:58.406 --> 00:52:01.576
I'm sure PARK's the perp.
we got the murder weapon...

00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:03.829
Get with the program!

00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:06.748
His wife died today.

00:52:07.082 --> 00:52:10.961
Look what you're doing.
you've been through this too.

00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:15.382
He's not himself today. if you...
You know what. forget it!

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:18.552
I'm coming over right now.
don't do anything!

00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:20.220
But what I'm saying is...

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:25.350
Goddammit...

00:52:27.018 --> 00:52:29.521
That's why I'm doing this.

00:52:38.155 --> 00:53:22.991
[background music]

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:28.163
Hello?

00:53:28.455 --> 00:53:30.332
Honey. where are you?

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:34.127
I'm so sorry.
I even marked the date.

00:53:34.252 --> 00:53:38.131
It's okay.
there's always next time.

00:53:38.256 --> 00:53:39.341
Where are you?

00:53:39.507 --> 00:53:42.802
- I'm already heading home.
- What did you take?

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:46.514
- There are plenty of buses.
- It's the middle of nowhere.

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.683
- My feet hurt.
- I'm almost done here.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:50.435
should I come pick you up?

00:53:50.685 --> 00:53:53.188
- Forget it. that'll take longer.
- Det. WOO. finish this up first.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.981
It's faster on my own.

00:53:55.148 --> 00:53:57.943
The town is nearby.
Don't worry.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:57.877
[rain dropping]

00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:02.924
You're cute when you're flustered.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:56:13.661
[background singing]

00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:45.944
YOON Seol-hee

00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:51.658
Hello?

00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:55.036
Is this really you?

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.373
Hello? Hello?

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.291
YOON Seol-hee

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:04.587
YOON Seol-hee

00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:11.136
Your call cannot be connected...

00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:53.928
Seol-hee: I'll be at our secret place.
July 20. 2007.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.060
Please leave a message
after the beep.

00:58:01.936 --> 00:58:04.898
Hye-jin. my phone is dead.

00:58:05.023 --> 00:58:06.524
so call me here.

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:10.820
No. I'll call you.
so please answer!

00:58:18.411 --> 00:58:22.540
If I give you an order.
just follow it. you bastard!

00:58:23.082 --> 00:58:24.250
Where is Prof. PARK?

00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:26.169
The suspect is being interrogated.

00:58:26.294 --> 00:58:27.795
Suspect? You got evidence?

00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:30.089
Remove him!
Get rid of him!

00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:32.675
I can get the evidence soon!

00:58:32.967 --> 00:58:37.055
Since you're not following
the procedure.

00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:40.850
I get yelled at from upstairs.
and dragged my ass here to clean up.

00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:42.894
He's the one!

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:46.481
Give me 2 hours
with these men.

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:49.525
- it's game over with the body.
- Your game's over.

00:58:49.984 --> 00:58:51.277
Come on!
Get him out of here!

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:52.570
Sir. please listen...

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:55.240
How dare you grab me?

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:58.117
Dude. let's go to the station.

00:58:58.493 --> 00:59:00.995
Did you just laugh?

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:04.874
Assault of police officer.
obstruction of justice too.

00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:09.629
Okay. fine. let go!

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.056
Wait! Wait!

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:21.266
Chief!

00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:48.001
He's the superintendent.

00:59:48.209 --> 00:59:50.211
Sir. allow me to
thank you outside.

00:59:50.378 --> 00:59:54.299
Mr. PARK. we're not done.
please sit back down.

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.427
Yes. professor.

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.263
The situation is bad.
you should listen to him.

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:02.348
Please cooperate.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.642
Make it fast.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.603
Superintendent.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:10.148
Please sit.
let's go sit.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.864
Don't be arrogant.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.742
We can finish quickly.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.661
What did he mean
the situation is bad?

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:29.208
Professor. when did you
last see your wife?

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.547
Did you find the body
or not?

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:37.884
We found something else.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:41.971
Prenup

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:47.018
Your sister-in-law
is a lawyer. right?

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.857
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
it's really good.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:59.405
'When a party engages in
an extramarital affair.'

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:04.827
'the other party may request divorce.
and the cheater forfeits all rights.'

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:14.045
So what?

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:17.799
Listen till the end.
this is the fun part.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:23.596
Your wife employed these guys.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.686
JJ Investigation.
private detectives.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.233
They followed you around.

01:01:35.566 --> 01:01:37.527
and got something on you.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:42.031
Your affair was exposed.
and you killed her for it.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.123
Shall we listen
to their recording?

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:51.999
It's all ready.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.377
When Seol-hee gets in.
I'll get things started.

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:57.588
I'll use her fear of flying
as the scapegoat.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.928
It was recorded
the day before she died.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.143
They sent this to YOON.
but she never got to check.

01:02:10.351 --> 01:02:13.354
They were being discreet.
so she may've missed it.

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.815
And was killed as a result.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:17.859
By you!

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:33.207
Did he confess?

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.210
- Joong-sik!
- Yes?

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:39.422
Did you get it or what?

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.633
If you give me some more time...

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.510
- More time?
- Yes. sir.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.389
1 hour.

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.600
Either get his confession
or find the body...

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.685
What the hell?

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.521
I'm not even surprised.

01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:56.647
Look.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:59.150
It's an honor.
thanks to you. bastard.

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.694
You got 1 hour.
got that?

01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:02.862
Certainly!

01:03:03.404 --> 01:03:06.741
Hello? Yes. sir!
Not at all!

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:53.079
Hye-jin?
Where are you?

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:56.165
I'm home. Are you okay?
What's this number?

01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:58.251
Listen carefully.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.045
I'm listening.

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:03.631
It's nothing so don't worry.
The front door...

01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:04.298
What?

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.050
Is the front door locked?

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:07.718
Yes.

01:04:08.052 --> 01:04:12.557
Don't hang up
and open the door.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:14.809
What's with you?

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.061
Don't question me.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.814
just do as I say!

01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:23.526
Listen...

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:28.906
I think someone's
inside the house.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.993
What do you mean?

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:38.791
Pretend nothing's happening
and just walk out.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:41.711
Okay.

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.054
Hye-jin?
Can you hear me?

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:34.722
Professor...

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:36.057
It's her...

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.351
Hye-jin!

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:39.810
Hye-jin! Hey!

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:46.275
Seol-hee: At out secret place...

01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:50.988
Let go!

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:54.951
What's going on?
You can't leave yet.

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:57.286
Hye-jin. she's in danger!

01:05:57.495 --> 01:05:58.621
Hye-jin?

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:02.083
My wife could kill Hye-jin!
I have to go!

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.877
Professor. your wife is dead.
let's go inside!

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:07.004
Get out of my way!

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:09.757
Hey!

01:06:09.882 --> 01:06:10.967
My back...

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:39.578
I sent my men
to that address.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.957
Now. spill everything.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:47.628
Hye-jin? Let's start with her.

01:06:57.763 --> 01:07:02.852
After the new drug
developmen halted.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:08.190
I focused on teaching
since last year.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:23.664
What's an important factor
for this product to get R&D funding?

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:28.502
Yes?

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:36.594
How many people
it can potentially save?

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.764
This is for migraines...

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:46.979
That's when we first met.

01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:51.275
It wasn't even her major.
and she was different.

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:56.572
She always came up
for questions after class.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.159
She had so many questions.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.579
So why wasn't it developed?

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.499
Higher the risk.
higher the profit.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.418
Massive investment required.
in addition to time...

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:13.756
Why are you so curious?
It's not even your major.

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:17.092
Because I want to study.
curious too.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:21.972
So why do you want to study?
What's your goal?

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.975
Knowledge is my goal.

01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:28.104
Don't you have a dream?

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.856
A ton.
have a boyfriend...

01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:32.691
Do that later.

01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:35.736
Guys your age are too simple.

01:08:36.403 --> 01:08:38.322
I'm not interested in
guys my age.

01:08:40.574 --> 01:08:43.369
It somehow became a routine.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.748
I didn't think it'd ever
be a problem.

01:08:54.588 --> 01:08:56.882
Woah... Professor.

01:08:57.883 --> 01:09:00.344
Do you have a dream too?

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:05.349
Why don't you try again?
You're smart enough.

01:09:07.059 --> 01:09:10.896
Sometimes dreams are
better left alone.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:15.693
Is that something
you should tell a student?

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:20.239
I was just a prop
of Seol-hee.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.409
She had everything
she ever wanted.

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:27.913
But she was never interested in
what I wanted.

01:09:39.717 --> 01:09:41.010
I'll do it again.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.387
Let's slick it back.

01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:46.098
Because you're a strong man.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:48.267
- I am?
- Yeah.

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:51.604
Very masculine
and passionate.

01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:57.943
That was all.

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:03.449
But Seol-hee began to suspect.

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:09.079
Report to work everyday
for a while.

01:10:09.663 --> 01:10:11.373
What about the lecture?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.460
Why is that so important?

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:18.297
Stay there until I tell you otherwise.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:26.430
I wanted to stop.
I knew my wife too well.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.809
But it wasn't easy.

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.661
Hye-jin!

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.880
Professor. some dreams
are better left alone.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:19.984
I was alive because of her.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.279
I felt everything.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.368
and she made me
realize who I am.

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:34.832
Then Hye-jin became pregnant.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:46.385
YOON Seol-hee

01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:49.346
I chose Hye-jin.

01:11:49.596 --> 01:11:53.100
But Seol-hee was
watching everything.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:57.021
If it was about money.
divorce would've been easy.

01:11:57.229 --> 01:12:00.024
But she bit down
on others' weaknesses.

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.280
Yes? What happened?

01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:17.708
So that's why you killed her?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:18.959
No!

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.920
She orchestrated to
look like I did it.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:25.007
Come on. you planned all of this.

01:12:25.215 --> 01:12:26.800
Used the poison to kill her.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:28.719
and stole the body.

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:31.680
No body means no autopsy.
therefore no evidence.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:35.434
You requested the autopsy.
thus eliminating potential suspicion.

01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:39.104
No. she's alive.
She's pretending to be dead.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.856
Listen to yourself.

01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:42.274
It's possible.

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:45.569
We developed an anesthetic drug
with a few variants.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.613
she could've used it.

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.992
It reduces lung and
heart functions to almost zero.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:54.870
It could've looked like
she was dead.

01:12:54.995 --> 01:12:57.289
No. she was dead momentarily.

01:12:57.581 --> 01:13:01.335
She walked out on her own.
so she climbed the hill no problem.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:06.256
Why'd she attempt
something so dangerous?

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:08.092
She's more than capable.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.928
She was pronounced dead
at her hospital.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.221
and the footprints are hers too.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.890
Let's assume it's true.
what about the break in?

01:13:15.599 --> 01:13:17.434
Probably someone she hired.

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:20.687
She needed someone
to wake her up.

01:13:20.854 --> 01:13:24.483
He had to use a drug.
it's not a one-man task.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.152
That's enough!

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:30.197
The address you gave us
was under your name!

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:31.907
I bought it for her!

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.118
But no one lives there!

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.832
Yes. what happened?

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.001
No one lives here.

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:43.919
What?

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:45.087
You mean. no one's there?

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:49.049
I mean. there's no trace
of anyone living here.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.843
Seol-hee did it!

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.470
We contacted your school.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.931
They said KIM Hye-jin doesn't exist!

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.224
Is that also YOON's work?

01:13:57.307 --> 01:13:59.435
She's playing us all.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.563
She's been watching us
since the beginning.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:09.153
She planned everything.
to kill Hye-jin.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.363
YOON's dead.
Hye-jin doesn't exist!

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.239
No. I have to go...

01:14:12.322 --> 01:14:15.701
- Tell me the truth!
- You don't know her!

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:16.827
Where's the body?!

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:19.955
I have to go.
I gotta save her...

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:22.916
You crazy bastard!

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.878
You're trying to buy time
by screwing with us!

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:29.840
Hye-jin's in danger... Please...

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:39.725
Sir. the superintendent wants you.

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:45.189
I need just a bit more time...

01:14:51.945 --> 01:14:53.322
Wrap it up.

01:14:53.697 --> 01:14:55.282
We secured that recording.

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:56.950
We got a motive.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.578
Are you dealing with
local hooligans?

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.748
You know illegal wiretap
is inadmissible.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.166
Wrap it up.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.794
We can't let him go.
he's hiding something.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:09.546
How will you hold him?

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.715
With what evidence?

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.260
You said you can find it.
you scoured the hill.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:16.970
Did you find it?

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:24.645
Release him
and finish it up here.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:34.238
Are you alright?
Professor? Professor!

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.340
He's got some powerful connections.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.511
Give me the key.
I'll drive.

01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:02.975
Dang it. I think I left it inside.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.060
I'll get it.

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:17.447
Where did you leave it?

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:26.623
At our secret place...

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:46.351
Boss

01:17:44.868 --> 01:18:50.183
[ominous sound]

01:19:41.985 --> 01:20:20.148
[ominous sound]

01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:33.411
How did you...

01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:39.334
Is this it?
You hid the body here?

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:47.551
You've been screwing with me
from the beginning.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:55.100
No one would ever find it here.
It's so remote.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:57.477
You buried her here?

01:20:57.602 --> 01:20:59.354
It wasn't me...

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.649
Seol-hee's alive!

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.278
That again?
You're boring me.

01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:13.451
Right. it's hard to accept it.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:17.539
I used to have a fiancÃ©e.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.750
SONG Ji-young. this is her.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.128
Look at her.
pretty. eh?

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:27.716
It was anniversary of
her parents' death.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:29.759
We were supposed to
go there together.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.512
We were supposed to
come together.

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:37.225
That's what he does.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.480
It'll always be like this. I bet.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:49.112
But he's a good man.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:53.241
Who are you talking to?

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.538
Aren't you sad that
your sister's getting married?

01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.332
Of course not.

01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:05.712
You're not?

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.506
You're still not sad?
Even like this?

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.592
When you leave.
I get my own room.

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:11.551
What did you say?

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:24.105
Why are you so heavy?

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:26.149
Jesus...

01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:29.527
Does your leg still hurt?

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.821
Yeah. hurts so bad.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.492
Are you lying?

01:22:35.825 --> 01:22:38.244
Where does it hurt?
How does it feel?

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.664
My leg's red!

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.042
It's barely a scratch...

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:48.713
It's faster on my own.
The town is nearby. Don't worry.

01:23:37.929 --> 01:23:39.639
Anything at all.

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:44.185
whatever you remember.
tell me anything!

01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:46.312
Hwa-young!

01:23:47.939 --> 01:23:49.941
The perps took off.

01:23:50.316 --> 01:23:53.987
and Hwa-young
had no memory.

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:58.783
We gradually lost touch.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.175
Address?

01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:18.762
Then. one day.
I met her again.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:27.187
Your grandma said you were
doing well in school.

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:31.357
Is something bothering you?

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.239
Not for loan

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.122
Barron Pharmaceutical

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.294
Hwa-young...

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:53.421
never forgot.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:05.892
Barron's logo.
the black Lincoln.

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:08.728
car repair log.
PARK Jin-han!

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.856
July 20. 2007
on the broken calendar.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:13.983
you remember. don't you?

01:25:15.735 --> 01:25:17.112
Where's the body?

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:20.782
Where did you hide it?

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:22.534
Is it here?

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:27.789
Where did you hide
my fiancÃ©e's body?!

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.811
July 20. 2007

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.488
I have to call it in...

01:26:00.613 --> 01:26:01.573
No one saw it.

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.032
Out of nowhere...

01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:06.161
This can go away.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.496
Who... where do I call?

01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:14.210
Get it together!

01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:17.005
Your life can't end
like this!

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:18.756
You drank!

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.091
Then what?

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.385
Get rid of her first!

01:27:50.556 --> 01:27:52.058
It's okay.

01:27:54.602 --> 01:27:56.980
Just follow my lead.

01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:08.366
Confusing. eh?

01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:10.368
I was too.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:13.287
I thought maybe
she was still alive.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.915
Since there was no body.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:20.586
Isn't that why you thought
YOON was still alive?

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:24.590
Then you...

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.895
No other cars
besides ours.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:41.065
The body could be nearby.

01:28:55.788 --> 01:28:58.291
You probably think
I deceived you.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:02.754
Is that the case though?

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.215
People only see
what they want to see.

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:07.633
Heard of catalepsy?

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.177
The guard says
he saw a ghost.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:10.386
Is this really you?

01:29:13.097 --> 01:29:15.183
You convinced yourself.

01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:27.028
Paralysis will kick in.

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.156
My body...

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:33.993
Right. just as you did to YOON.

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:38.081
Don't kill me...

01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:39.957
Please...

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:43.377
Then tell me.
where is she?

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:57.475
Hye-jin...

01:29:58.267 --> 01:29:59.268
What?

01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:06.984
Hye-jin...

01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:10.696
Hye-jin didn't do anything.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.827
Please don't kill her.

01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:20.123
This is all me.

01:30:22.333 --> 01:30:23.334
Please...

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:24.794
Who's there?

01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:55.449
Do you really think
she has your child?

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:07.587
How do you think
I got to you?

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:25.354
Her real name is SONG Hwa-young.
Ji-young's sister.

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:31.527
She'd be a normal college student
if it wasn't for you.

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:41.746
Why didn't you tell me?

01:31:43.956 --> 01:31:45.917
It's what I have to do.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.712
Just watching them?

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.342
This world...

01:31:55.593 --> 01:31:57.762
isn't as easy as you think.

01:31:57.970 --> 01:32:00.348
You weren't an easy foe.

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:03.684
You'd get maybe 2 years
with the evidence we had.

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.437
And that's being optimistic.

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:08.481
Do you think they'll
confess easily?

01:32:08.981 --> 01:32:10.024
What'd happen?

01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:13.069
Forget jail time.
we'll never find Ji-young!

01:32:13.402 --> 01:32:14.862
Then kill them!

01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:21.244
I had forgotten.

01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:24.455
this wasn't my problem alone.

01:32:30.002 --> 01:32:33.381
I died inside a long time ago.

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:38.552
Let's never meet again.
even in hell.

01:32:46.477 --> 01:32:47.478
No.

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:50.231
There may be some use for it.

01:32:51.023 --> 01:32:52.567
Could you get me a drink?

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:02.785
I've never said this to anyone...

01:33:05.955 --> 01:33:07.790
To tell you the truth...

01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:17.133
No. it's nothing.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.563
Are you okay?

01:34:56.607 --> 01:34:59.276
Wakey wakey.
Professor.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:05.908
You're under arrest for
the murder of YOON Seol-hee.

01:35:06.575 --> 01:35:08.452
and disposal of a body...

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:11.789
We can chat in detail
at the station.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.791
Let's go.

01:35:16.627 --> 01:35:17.586
What?

01:35:18.462 --> 01:35:19.797
What's wrong?

01:35:49.452 --> 01:35:51.537
What are you doing?
Writing a report?

01:35:51.704 --> 01:35:52.621
Yup.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.167
Okay. that's enough.

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:57.501
- Show me.
- Sir!

01:35:57.793 --> 01:35:58.461
Yeah?

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:01.088
This was found in the room.
take a look.

01:36:01.338 --> 01:36:02.590
What is it?

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:10.723
Ketamine? Isn't that a drug?

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:13.768
Yes. it is.
he probably injected it.

01:36:13.976 --> 01:36:16.145
PARK had injection marks
on his arm.

01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:18.439
The professor was a major drug addict.

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:20.691
No wonder he was acting weird.

01:36:20.816 --> 01:36:22.818
Is chief still not reachable?

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.946
Why? You wanted to ditch him.

01:36:26.405 --> 01:36:27.490
When did I?

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.949
Last night.

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:31.744
You got good memory.

01:36:32.077 --> 01:36:34.705
The chief is pretty amazing.

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:37.500
Yeah. he was spot on.

01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:40.294

01:36:50.429 --> 01:37:15.746
