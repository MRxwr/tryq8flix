00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.800
Camera is running.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
I started my search
after Prime Minister Rutte's speech...

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.720
about herd immunity and what's going on
around coronavirus.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.200
Between mid-March and now.
which is September...

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.880
I've spent about 1.000 hours myself
researching the coronavirus problem.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.640
And many others with me. so overall
we've done about 5.000 hours of research.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.400
It was all about risk: who's going to
get sick and who's going to die?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
In business you always work with risk...

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.680
so the first thing I looked at was:
What are the facts here?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.840
How many people will die
and how many will fall victim...

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.440
to COVID-19?

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.720
Good evening.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.880
Our country has been gripped
by coronavirus.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.360
Ours and the rest of the world. My message
to you tonight isn't an easy one.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.840
The reality is that in the coming time
a large part of the Dutch population...

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.000
will be infected with the virus.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.840
What on earth's going on here?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.920
We're also interested
in the number of people...

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.600
whose immunity shows signs...

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.920
that it has been in contact
with the new coronavirus.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.640
You can see that represented here
for the Sanquin Research data.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.040
It's also being done
for the RIVM's PIENTER Study.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.120
Why is the RIVM national public health
institute telling us half-truths?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.360
It's just half-science.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.360
I don't understand.
it's not right.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.720
I'm a citizen and I want very much
to trust the government.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.040
I want to believe that what I read in
the media is correct and isn't censored.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.280
But when they tell so many lies and
half-truths. what am I supposed to think?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.800
Why pursue this policy when
there are many more non-COVID victims...

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.720
than COVID victims?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.480
Is this really about our public health?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.640
Clearly the pharmaceutical industry's
business model is to make profit.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.480
As much profit as possible.
It's got nothing to do with healthcare.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.240
If it did. they would have made sure
to produce good medicines.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.080
The new products they've put
on the market are generally poison.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.800
Nothing more.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.320
If you look closely
at the characteristics of the virus...

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.600
the measures taken and consequences are
out of proportion with the virus itself.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.520
This is certainly a time full of danger.
fear. change and transition.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.960
The virus triggered this.
but the consequences are much greater.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.600
That's what we need to look at.
They're drastic.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.560
When people talk about COVID-19
it's positioned more or less as an enemy.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.160
At first when we didn't know
what was coming. they said:

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.400
This is war.
We have to fight it. eliminate it.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.040
I thought: Hm. what is this virus?
I didn't know either.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.880
Viruses play a key role in nature.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.760
If you look at the timeline...

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.200
viruses and bacteria have been around
far longer than homo sapiens.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.000
Looking at how we're built.
in terms of our immune system...

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.880
it becomes clear how incredibly well
they work together.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.800
In nature it's all about collaboration:
between cells. bacteria. viruses.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.080
Yes. collaboration
is one of the key processes in nature.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.720
That collaboration arose
in the process of evolution.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.840
Apparently it was a better way of
organising than the other options we had.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.080
How do you see the timeline?
Other organisms are much older.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.000
Now humans are here. I sometimes feel
that we want to be at the top...

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.400
and to be able to engineer humankind.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.920
You see it with the virus.
'We're going to wipe it out.'

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.440
Is that even possible?
-If we really want to. it's possible.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.840
It's hard with a virus. It's much easier
to wipe out pandas or rhinos or tigers.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.680
Viruses are so closely linked to us
that they keep adapting and evolving.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.600
The flu virus is a good example.
For the flu jabs we have now...

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.240
we have to guess what flu virus is coming
but it's often quite different.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.280
After so many centuries
we still can't predict what it will do.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.160
Viruses are often too fast for us.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.120
Viruses survive because they mutate.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.360
That's why it's so hard to develop
a vaccine or medicine or a treatment.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.560
You don't know which direction it will go.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.560
You see that with flu vaccines.
You think: Hey. it works.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.880
But next time. it's changed again.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.440
It's great. a really big container
has arrived from India. So...

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.200
Sports bags again?
-Well. it was a very big one.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.880
Today? No.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.440
As part of the citizens' initiative
I wanted to find out all I could about it.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.160
This is the coronavirus bench
where we collected everything...

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.840
to quickly find out all we could
about coronavirus and what's going on.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.240
I'd already read a lot of books.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.480
Especially about scientific knowledge
from the past ten years...

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.200
in a very broad sense.
Everyone knows Yuval Harari.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:39.040
If you look at this. this was how
it all started. The panic about control.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.120
After a while you saw that the collateral
damage was much worse. The hospitals...

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.240
talked about 300.000 procedures
that had been postponed.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.160
And it caused huge financial difficulties
for hospitals.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.920
You could see in one article
that on the one hand...

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:06.120
we were trying to save life years
by getting coronavirus under control...

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.240
while on the other hand the scales were
tipping too far in a very negative way.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.800
Economically. but also for healthcare
and for society.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.680
Because this is derailing.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.400
I'm not against... I'm not an anti-vaxxer.
I'm not on the left or right politically.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.280
I have no interest in this.
no financial interest. not at all.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.040
I was looking primarily
at my children's future.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.360
If you build up lots of debt
you know someone will have to pay.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.760
I thought: This isn't going to work.
-I'll go move the car.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.480
I liked it at first when I started.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.440
Do you want something to eat?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.880
Ultimately. the government
is supposed to be there for society.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.680
The government can say:
We've got all these support measures.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.760
But we'll have to repay it all.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.560
In the end the citizens and business
owners will have to pay for it in taxes.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.240
Hey Feline. do you know Wim or not?
-No.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.760
This is Feline.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.320
I got this from you. Erwin.
-Yes.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.040
As an international entrepreneur...

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.520
I thought that a lot of the things
Rutte said were a bit strange.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.720
It's the collated file. Wim.
-It's quite a file.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.880
It's the first time I've seen it.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.880
That doesn't make sense.
certainly not for a business.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.400
I got stuck into it and after a while
I had all kinds of information.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.440
We were talking on the phone...

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.000
and I thought: Wait a minute.
My brother knows a lot about this too.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.920
He started telling me things.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.560
We're brothers
and talk to each other regularly...

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.000
but I didn't know that he knew
such a huge amount about this subject.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.960
His field of study
and everything he's done...

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.000
is related to coronavirus
because he also did SARS-CoV-1.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.920
We had so much common ground.
We really spent hours on the phone...

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.320
talking about it and how we saw things
and. above all. the questions we had.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.400
It was funny really
because the crisis started...

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.760
and at first everything's new.
For me. for Rutte. for everyone.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.400
It came in and we all wondered:
How bad is this and what's happening?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.320
It was certainly presented
as something that could be very serious.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.800
Then he started that citizens' initiative
and told me all about that.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.920
I went looking for publications.
I have a scientific background...

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.560
so I don't want to know all the stuff
on the internet and things like that.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.640
I know that half of it is unreliable.
No. I look in scientific articles.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.160
What's been published?
What do we know? What's been written?

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.720
As Nico said earlier
it started with SARS...

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:32.440
which had emerged once before
in the past. in 2003.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:38.880
Those kinds of articles were published
quite long ago. at that time.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.520
I looked back to see
what we already knew about it back then.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:52.040
And how did it relate to this new SARS?
This one is called SARS-CoV-2...

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.880
because it's the second. The first didn't
have a number then. but now it's SARS-1.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.240
I studied that in depth.
also so that I could answer questions...

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.000
especially about immunity.
What does it mean?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.600
And indeed. in the story...

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.360
they really talked at first exclusively
about immunoglobulin.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:24.520
Immunity as it is measured in the blood.
the way that Sanquin presented it too.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.840
That astonished me. because it's one
element of immunity that you can measure.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.720
But there's much more.
The immune system is wide-ranging.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.640
There are T-cells too. as he said.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:45.720
But there's also a first defence response
that can make a big difference.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.040
So you want to know
how all the pieces fit into the picture.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.760
When the Outbreak Management Team
was set up...

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.080
I was surprised that they spoke
very little about public health.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.840
It was all about virologists. That makes
sense because it's a virus. I get that.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.800
But public health
is about much more than just a virus.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.400
There's much more
to ensuring we're healthy.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.480
There are the lifestyle diseases
and so on.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.560
The other strange thing
was the social and economic side.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.440
As an entrepreneur I knew that
what was said would have a big impact.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.160
That wasn't mentioned. Then it transpired
that the other experts weren't in the OMT.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.680
That was so strange.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.720
That's when I started searching
for information myself.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.480
Eventually we were doing research
with 20 scientists in four countries.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.400
It was great. we got so much information.
Everyone had their own task.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.880
We had data scientists.
people looking at economics...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.360
accountants. there were doctors
among the scientists. and econometrists.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:14.240
It was amazing. In just eight weeks we
got a clear picture of what was going on.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.000
The big question for me was:
What actually happens?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.600
What does the virus do to the body?

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.000
You got me on the right track at once:
Nico. it's an overreaction.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.800
It's not so easy to explain.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:42.880
There are various different aspects
of the immune system you have to look at.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.960
It's like he said:
There were events everywhere...

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.760
such as in Italy in Vo'
and on the cruise ships...

00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:01.840
where infections were recorded but
not very many people fell seriously ill.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.800
That indicated that there must be
some kind of natural defence.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:15.480
Interestingly. there are full scientific
reports on the events in Vo' in Italy...

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.880
so that's my source. I take little notice
of what's on the internet or the news.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.840
I look at the publications.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.600
Reading that. you find out
that everyone in that village...

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.440
after the first serious incidence there...

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.640
which led to the death
of one of the inhabitants...

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:47.480
the whole village was locked down
and they tested everyone...

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:54.760
to find out: Who has and has not tested
positive? What symptoms do they have?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.320
And who is infecting whom?
They studied that and reported on it.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:09.720
They found that 50 percent of people had
no symptoms or no detectable symptoms.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.600
And although people seemed to be
passing it on to each other...

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.280
in the sense that
they got a positive result in a test...

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.560
there were no serious consequences.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.240
That indicates that there must be
some kind of natural protection.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.880
So you go looking for other articles.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.320
More and more of them appeared. even
in the early phase around April and May.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:46.040
We wrote in this document that
various articles confirmed back then...

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:53.720
that the T-cells play a huge role.
They cause a kind of cross-reaction...

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.840
that originates
in previous coronavirus infections.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:04.920
Because there are a large number of these
viruses that are all slightly different.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.640
That's what the immunity is built on.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:15.880
The T-cell recognises parts of the
coronavirus. according to the article.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
That means that other people
who have never seen the new variant...

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.480
can still demonstrate defence.
based on that.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.920
That turned out to be 40 to 60 percent.
based on T-cells.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:38.520
It was interesting that on the news
only immunoglobulin was mentioned...

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.920
which is made by B-cells
that are measured in the blood.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.240
That appeared in only five to ten percent
of the cases in Brabant...

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.720
which was a fairly large
infection hotspot.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.760
Interestingly. I thought.
it later turned out...

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.560
fragments had been published
but then the Swedish article appeared...

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.400
by the famous Karolinska Institute
in Stockholm.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.640
They measured everything:

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.680
The T-cell and the B-cell response
with immunoglobulin. etcetera.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.280
That brought everything together.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.480
They said that the B-cell immunoglobulin
that people always talk about...

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.000
was present only to a limited degree.
or even absent.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.240
But the T-cell responses were present
to a certain degree.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.720
Up to around 40 to 60 percent.
This again points to the conclusion...

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.040
that there is a natural resistance
to coronaviruses.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.880
That also explains
why a lot of people may test positive...

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.960
but don't have any symptoms at all.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.320
That was the basic picture.
which to me meant:

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.920
This is essentially
almost a classic immunity...

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.760
built up against viruses.
the kind we see all the time.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.080
The whole world
pursued more or less the same policy.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.520
There were two reasons for this.
First. the WHO.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.600
There's a lot of pharma money in the WHO.
so they're not impartial.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:33.440
The same happened in 2009.
They decide what the status of a virus is.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:40.520
Back then they classified swine flu
as Pandemic A: life-threatening.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.680
It proved not to be. but many vaccines
were produced and they were all sold.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.120
There was uproar about that.
because in hindsight it was all wrong.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.440
That wasn't how things were. It was
just pharma money pulling the strings.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.880
We don't seem to have learned anything.
as it's happening again now.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.200
The strange thing is that
the rules for that have been adapted.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.640
Looking back.
as our citizens' initiative shows...

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.280
the WHO doesn't want social distancing
and lockdowns.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.520
It's in a publication from 2019.
That's not the way to go.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.440
But they changed it nonetheless.
Very odd.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.680
They decide the policy for 193 countries.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.200
The panic and copying each other
is all a part of that too.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.160
There was great panic in Italy.
in Bergamo.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.720
Then India said: Let's do the same
as Italy. that must be the best thing.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.840
Meanwhile the same policy was laid down
for 193 countries around the world.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.880
In the end we tried to present this story
to politicians.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Because we knew that Sweden
was doing very well at the time.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.400
Focus on looking after vulnerable groups.
they're the ones that need it.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.480
We couldn't get through to politicians.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.640
We really tried.
with all the party spokespeople.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.200
We tried through Feike Sijbesma
and Barbara Baarsma. No response.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.000
We tried the newspapers. the media.
They won't publish it.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.000
There's a message from NRC: Dear
Mr Sloot. thank you for your submission.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.120
We get many articles on this topic
and must select stringently.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.000
Your contribution
is not eligible for publication.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.600
They decided that fast. Apparently
herd immunity isn't very important.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.720
That's that. then.
-Yes.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.400
There was huge pressure on Intensive
Care. and care workers did an amazing job.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.480
That was in the first three weeks.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.320
Then it became clear what was going on.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.920
Rutte said: With 50% of the facts
I have to make 100% of the decisions.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.600
That's fair enough.
But as a businessman I'd say that means...

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.720
you need to get hold of the information
as soon as possible.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:24.440
Strangely. it was clear after those three
weeks who the high-risk groups were:

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:32.560
Elderly people with an illness were the
ones who fell ill and were hospitalised.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.360
And a very big group of healthy people.
the economic workforce...

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.280
really weren't very much affected.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.080
Some were. but far fewer
than victims of road accidents.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:54.480
The strange thing is that Rutte told us
we all had to go into lockdown.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:02.360
I didn't understand that. I thought: Why
don't the people who need protecting...

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.120
who are also going into lockdown.
get fully protected...

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.120
and why not let the ones who are barely
affected keep the economy going?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.440
With a few measures that may help.
of course.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.320
It was also strange that the experts
in the OMT and the RIVM...

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.800
were mainly virologists.
I didn't understand that.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:35.000
After all those IC weeks. it was clear
this was about more than public health.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.880
And it's only a small part
of public health.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.360
If you look at lifestyle and road traffic
deaths...

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.520
there are many more things
that affect public health.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.800
It was odd that we didn't look
at the social and economic aspects too.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.760
Because imposing lockdowns like this
has quite an impact on your economy.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.320
Why aren't these experts being consulted?

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.880
We'd been writing to the House
of Representatives for months...

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.720
and getting no answer.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.520
But one hashtag from celebrities with lots
of followers gets everyone interested.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.040
The media want to talk to the celebrities
but not about anything of substance.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.240
They want the sensationalism
but not the content.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.080
If they do want content
they get two opposing camps together...

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.280
so you can never
get beneath the surface on TV.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.480
There's no scientific debate
on those kinds of programmes.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.520
I find that difficult.
It's quite a fine line to tread.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.920
I'm worried and above all
I feel I've reached my moral limits...

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.880
in the way we're treating public health
and humanity at the moment.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.600
It seems to me that
we're in one big behavioural experiment.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.080
And that we're damaging people.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:44.280
It's not clear what the added value is
of the actions taken recently.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.760
It's hard not to say what I think.
given the oath I have taken as a doctor.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.160
That's why I have said what I think.
firstly to the medical associations.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.560
That's not getting any real results.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.920
Doctors are quite media-shy and think
we should resolve things among ourselves.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:12.080
What is that?
-My hospital responded well at first.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.640
They said there's room for differing
opinions in a scientific debate.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.720
It's important in science to doubt and
ask questions. So there's scope for that.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.880
I see that in other hospitals too.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.200
The other side of it is that hospitals
often have several different interests.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.040
And my opinion
isn't necessarily the hospital's opinion.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.800
So the hospital is very cautious
and has warned me too:

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.040
Be aware that given your position
and place of work...

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:51.800
even if you say you're speaking as an
individual. people won't always see that.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.240
You see it in the media too. they often
do start referring to the hospital.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.480
This is my view. not my hospital's view.
I'm glad to be able to speak my mind.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.240
But it's actually weird to say:
I'm glad I can speak my mind.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.000
We have freedom of speech and should
be able to talk about it much more freely.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.640
I know that some people
are afraid to speak up.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.800
Or are afraid about their job
or their colleagues' opinions...

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.120
or to be out on their own.
-When did you first think that?

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.240
Because Rutte said from the start
that it's a dangerous virus.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.480
At what point did you think: Hm.
I'm not sure if that's what it really is.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.400
It's a new virus. much more infectious
and many people are getting sick.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.680
It can be a very nasty illness
and we have to provide much more care.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:52.200
So our care capacity during the epidemic
and during the peaks...

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.960
and maybe again in the coming period.
is insufficient.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.120
It's the norm for us
to have undercapacity.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.080
But there is a consequence...

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.520
in terms of what government policy
has been over the past years.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:16.280
In fact the flu virus in 2017 to 2018
was similar. Lots of people in hospital.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.440
But now
the focus is mainly on IC capacity.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.600
That made sense in the first three weeks.
After that. it was okay.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.120
But the focus now is still on healthcare.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.520
The problem is bedside care.
Massive cuts have been made there.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:40.440
And in nursing care. There's debate
about salaries. overtime and breaks.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.040
That's a problem around healthcare
and how it's financed.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.600
It's a stalemate.
We're in a healthcare crisis...

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.400
and that's magnified by coronavirus.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.040
We've had good plans in place
for pandemics for decades.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:06.360
Given current population growth.
a pandemic was to be expected.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.760
We have assumed for years
that this would happen at some point.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.040
On the other hand.
we've been downscaling beds for years.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.080
We have far fewer beds than five to eight
years ago and fewer bedside staff.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.320
That's led to extra problems now.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.760
Is that why they're sticking to all these
measures? To keep things under control?

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.120
Until there's a vaccine?

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.920
I hope not.
as that would be a very bad reason.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:41.560
That makes the patient and the doctor
part of the product in the...

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.400
In the system.
-In the system. In the business model.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.920
We can't allow that
to be an underlying drive.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.480
It should never be the reason
behind any measures taken.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.880
I hope people continue to see that
purely based on the facts.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.120
And that it's taken into account.
because money makes you blind.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.080
We need to be very critical.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:12.080
We need to look carefully at the links
people have with money flows...

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.040
and the decisions they take.
It's essential to keep that unbiased.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.760
But there's more to this.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:31.040
The research by PIENTER and Sanquin
always said there's grave danger.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:38.720
As Rutte and Feike Sijbesma said:
95 percent of people have no defence.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.320
Because Sanquin's study said only
5 percent have antibodies. B-cells.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.680
But we know for a fact.
as Robbert Dijkgraaf said...

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.440
and it's clear from the asymptomatic
cases that there is herd immunity.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.880
Together with my brother
I wanted to publish that story...

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.800
that science has proved
there is herd immunity.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.440
It's strange that in all this time
the RIVM. PIENTER and Sanquin...

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.440
have not once mentioned T-cells.
Now all of a sudden...

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.720
Feike Sijbesma. I asked him: As a medical
biologist you must know about T-cells?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.880
He said: Nico. T-cells are very important
in all this. So I asked:

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.320
You're close to the cabinet.
why don't you tell them?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.080
He said:
I have no say in the politics of it.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:36.040
A week later in the newspapers and on TV
he was still telling the same story:

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.680
Only 5 percent are protected by B-cells.
I thought: Feike. how can that be?

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.040
The crazy thing was
that the newspaper said...

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.040
that the T-cells need to be jump-started
by the vaccine.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.960
I thought: This is too much. So it's not
important if we have natural T-cells...

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:03.080
but if we make a vaccine it has to
encourage the T-cells to become active.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.480
I'm at a complete loss.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.520
But there's more. because Feike Sijbesma
struck a deal with AstraZeneca.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.400
Then it starts to make sense.
First it's a private deal...

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.560
between four European countries
and AstraZeneca to produce the vaccines.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:28.800
Then it turns out that Feike's brother
is the CEO in Germany.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.520
When that hits the news the coronavirus
special envoy suddenly has to go.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.000
Feike Sijbesma leaves the stage.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.040
And AstraZeneca suddenly says:
Yes. but we're doing the deal for the EU.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:50.680
So instead of being a deal for just
four countries. it's for the whole EU.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:57.160
At the same time. the media announces
that hopes of herd immunity are fading.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.560
And Feike tells the press the whole of the
Netherlands will need to be vaccinated.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.040
Like Bill Gates. who says: The whole world
will need to be vaccinated.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.560
But why?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.800
Feike says it's about the purchase price.
he bought it cheaply.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:21.160
But I'm an international entrepreneur
and it's a well-known fact...

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:28.240
that the pharmaceutical industry makes
three times as much profit as any other.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.800
Feike can't tell me. a businessman. that
it's suddenly a philanthropic institution.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.280
That because they're making a vaccine
for public health they're more or less...

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.120
doing it at cost price. for free?
No. it's just a second business model.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.240
That model is real...

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.160
as we now know that AstraZeneca
made the deal not just with Europe...

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:58.320
but with Brazil too. And with Korea. And
with China. And with the United States.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.960
They've already sold
three billion worth of vaccines.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.120
Welcome to AstraZeneca.
All our lines our busy at the moment.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.600
We'll be with you as soon as possible.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.320
AstraZeneca.
-Good afternoon. Nico Sloot speaking.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.360
I have a question about COVID-19.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.880
Do you have a special spokesperson
for that or is it Communications?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.640
Sir. you can send an email
to info.nl@astrazeneca.com.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.840
It's a pharmaceutical company.
-Send the question by email...

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.680
I'm just the receptionist.
-Goodbye.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.720
You can't get through.
They're not having it.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.720
The prevailing influenza
is caused by a so-called ultravirus.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:05.160
A tiny bacteria
one ten thousandth of a millimetre across.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.760
The Institute for Preventive Medicine
and Leiden University's virus labs...

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.720
collect research material
using liquid air...

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:22.440
made at the Kamerlingh Onnes lab and with
a temperature of 180 degrees below zero.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.560
This plane has not brought
a celebrity to Schiphol Airport...

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.000
but an eagerly-awaited. important cargo:

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.520
A large shipment of Salk vaccine
to combat infantile paralysis.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.960
Looking at pharma.
do you see that it's a business model?

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.840
That health is a business model?
-Yes. it's obvious.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.480
The pharmaceutical industry
makes an enormous profit on its products.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:02.840
If that benefited people's health.
you'd say: Fair enough. who cares.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.480
But there are increasing signs
that medicines play a key role...

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.120
in the falling life expectancy
in the United States...

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.280
and stagnating life expectancy
in the European Union.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.240
We've seen big scandals around Vioxx.
Rofecoxib. a simple painkiller.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:28.320
The medication for diabetes:
rosiglitazone. Avandia.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:33.800
Countless medications have cost hundreds
of thousands of people their lives.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.000
It just keeps on going. You would think
that after all of those tragedies...

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:45.600
the rules would be tightened. They're not.
in fact they're being relaxed.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.920
So pharma is a great business model.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.760
I've seen that in recent years
it has had the highest returns.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.680
They're at 17.5 percent. I know that
the average is five or six percent.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.400
So they earn three times as much. Is it
because of their powerful monopoly?

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.840
Is it due to patents? Exclusive rights?
Is that why?

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.840
It's largely due to patents.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.480
But there are a number of big players
that dominate the market.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.040
They've made agreements
with the registration authorities...

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.800
about the requirements they have to meet.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:32.520
These days. the European Medicines
Agency or EMA in Amsterdam...

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.160
the Food and Drug Administration or FDA
in America...

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:42.040
say very clearly on their websites
that they want to help manufacturers...

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:48.400
to bring their product onto the market.
That's a very strange situation.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:55.760
You would expect organisations like this
to put the citizens first.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.880
To only approve medicines
that have been proven to work...

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.600
and that have
the fewest possible side effects.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:11.040
What do politicians do? Edith Schippers
said. when she was Minister of Health:

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:17.200
This can't go on. the monopoly and
power of the pharmaceutical companies.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.600
Has anything changed in politics.
in your opinion?

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.000
No. As regards Schippers. she said
one thing and did the exact opposite.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.120
So that didn't get us anywhere.
I'm compelled to conclude...

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.440
that there's almost no expertise in this
subject in the House of Representatives.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.720
The same applies
to the European Parliament...

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.840
and the leaders of the Ministry
of Health. Welfare and Sport.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.880
So the manufacturers
get almost no pushback.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And that's serious. Very serious.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:58.920
How do you see that in relation to
coronavirus. the problem we're facing now?

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:05.640
There's a strong focus on the vaccine
now. I'll say more about that in a moment.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.200
And again on a virus inhibitor.
Remdesivir...

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.360
which was given provisional approval
for a few months in the EU.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:22.160
It's based on extremely bad research that
really doesn't support any conclusions.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.680
It's produced
by a company called Gilead...

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.680
the company that also put sofosbuvir.
Sovaldi...

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.680
for the treatment of Hepatitis C
on the market.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.720
Production costs: 150 euros. A course
of treatment costs 80.000 euros.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.840
Those are the kinds of companies
and people we're dealing with.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.800
If you look at our overreaction. say.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.160
We've seen
that COVID-19 causes a reaction...

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.240
mostly in people
with weaker immune systems.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:02.360
Worldwide the people who die
have an average age of 80. 80.5...

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:10.200
with a lot of underlying conditions.
Is that comparable with a bad case of flu?

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:16.680
It is. in fact. The people who die in
yearly flu outbreaks are mainly elderly...

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.800
with comorbidity.
in other words other illnesses...

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.080
and who use other medicines.
or comedication.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.200
That has been the case with flu for years.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:35.400
The people who die
are mainly residents of nursing homes.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:41.480
And it's the same with this illness.
this coronavirus pandemic.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.800
Given that. how do you view AstraZeneca?
What struck me in our research...

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:55.000
was that all the cards had already been
dealt. Feike Sijbesma made a deal...

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.280
with his brother. it turned out.
Four countries. then the EU.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.840
Now many countries have joined in and
three billion vaccines have been sold.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.520
Is that not comparable?

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:13.040
AstraZeneca is a company
like so many others. actually...

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:19.080
like GlaxoSmithKline. that are
regularly linked to serious fraud...

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.200
especially scientific fraud.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.120
There are some ongoing cases. right?
-Yes.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.520
Another thing I noticed
during my research...

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:36.000
is that these pharmaceutical companies
have an incredible marketing apparatus.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:41.400
In the Netherlands and worldwide.
Their representatives visit doctors.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.640
Can you say something about that?
They're very good at it.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.520
Yes. The pharmaceutical industry
is extremely powerful.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.080
They have a lot of power and money
and because of that...

00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:00.600
they're able to promote and market
their new treatments very effectively.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.880
And it works. It really works.
Otherwise they wouldn't keep doing it.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.720
Doctors are susceptible to marketing.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:14.000
Often they don't have expert knowledge.
they can't assess the research...

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.320
and they rely on what they're told
by medical sales representatives...

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.880
and medical opinion leaders.
-And can they earn more?

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.080
Is there a business model
for the intermediaries?

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:33.320
Yes. In fact when I was still practising
I was told by the medical sales reps...

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.320
that they were assessed on
whether the number of prescriptions...

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.280
of their new drug increased
in their region.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.360
Yes. yes.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.880
As well as that
there are doctors. specialists...

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.840
who are instructed or employed
by the pharmaceutical industry...

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.280
medical opinion leaders or MOLs...

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.680
who are actively engaged
in prescribing the new medications...

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.640
and to market them.
That works well.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.640
It works well in politics. as there are
no experts at the Ministry of Health...

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.720
or the House of Representatives.
So they can do as they please.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:21.760
The only people who play a significant
role in this are the patients.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.000
They're the ones you have to reach
and I see it as my task...

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.840
to inform people as much and as fully
as possible about medications.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:37.560
How come there is no accountability.
no product liability for pharma...

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.400
and they can make decisions
together in secret?

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.200
Why are we being advised
by Feike Sijbesma...

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:49.680
and Bill Gates that the world.
our whole country needs vaccinations.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:56.000
Surely we don't need vaccinations
but a solution to the coronavirus problem?

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:01.080
The problem is the overreaction
in people with low immunity.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.240
The average age of those
who have died is 80.5 worldwide.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.880
Aren't they the ones we need to protect?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.600
The solution
is to have the right medication for them.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.640
So I would say:
Take the time to find a safe vaccine.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.560
Surely we won't use a pressure-cooker
situation and business models...

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:27.360
to quickly produce a vaccine for the whole
of the Netherlands. for healthy people?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.560
I don't get it. it's not right.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:39.400
I'm going to call Feike Sijbesma now.
We've been in touch for quite a time.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.840
Hey Feike. good morning. It's Nico.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:50.720
Feike doesn't want to call on camera.
He later emailed the following:

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.000
Coronavirus has had a huge effect
on the lives...

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.880
of the young. working. vulnerable
and elderly. on all of us.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.480
We all want to return
to the life and freedoms we're used to.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.240
Tests. treatments and vaccines
can help.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.520
The EU is working for all 27 member
states to obtain treatments and vaccines.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.640
These must be effective and safe.
with fully transparent information.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:20.960
Their use must of course be voluntary.
individually decided and not obligatory.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.480
Good afternoon. NRC media. Thomas
Scholten speaking. How can I help you?

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:39.400
Hello Thomas. I'm Nico Sloot.
I subscribe to your newspaper.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.440
I want to ask a question
about an article you published in July.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.320
Is that possible?
-You can always ask.

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:56.320
I saw an article you published in July
by Feike Sijbesma about coronavirus.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.320
There were some surprising things in it...

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:06.200
that I couldn't imagine Feike Sijbesma.
as the coronavirus envoy. would say.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.920
I spoke to Feike Sijbesma about it...

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:15.360
and it turns out that he did not say
the things you wrote in the article.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:21.640
I'd like very much to write to the people
who wrote it but perhaps you can tell me.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.960
Why did you go ahead
and publish it like this?

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:32.920
If he says. 'I didn't say that'. then I
believe him. I've no reason to doubt it.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:39.680
I'll see if I can talk to someone
in the ranks and get it changed...

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.840
or at least discussed.
-Okay. Thomas. thanks very much.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.720
It was a pleasure. good luck. Bye.
-Goodbye.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.040
Over the past months the media
have headed in a very specific direction.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.480
We're being told news
in a very one-sided way.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:03.240
And I think the media have a pretty
big role given the situation we're in.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.000
And that they have a lot of influence
on how people feel at the moment.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.960
Take the Pieter Klok interview
in De Volkskrant newspaper.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.000
I was so astonished.
I couldn't believe what the man said.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:23.400
If you're the editor-in-chief of a major
Dutch newspaper and you say:

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.400
Due to the pandemic and the government's
position. I'm siding with them.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.600
That's just state television.
you're a state newspaper.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.480
In a crisis. especially.
you should check what's going on:

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:42.960
Is what the RIVM says true? The statistics
about the deaths have now proved false.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.280
We need a parliamentary inquiry
right away. This was Radio 1:

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.440
With so much fear around
we need to speak with one voice.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.360
You think so?
-Certainly.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:58.000
Isn't there a journalistic duty
to look at the consequences of policy?

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.920
You don't just swallow everything whole.
That's the right expression.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:08.400
Not usually. but when society is so afraid
we need to agree with each other...

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.960
and not magnify differences.
as happened yesterday.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.600
You can't expect everyone
to make up their own minds...

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.800
by getting all these virologists
to talk at them.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.120
But what should the media do
if the virologists don't all agree?

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.280
It's wise for a country to choose
one path and for us to support it.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.520
We all know that there's a lot
we don't know.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:37.160
So whichever path is chosen there will
be room for criticism. That's just a fact.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:43.080
But should you magnify the criticism
or simply support the chosen path?

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.840
They sow a policy of fear and say:
We're all scared. so just do as we say.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.400
That's basically what he said.
It's bizarre.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.280
Welmoed speaking.
-Hello. Welmoed. This is Nico Sloot.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:05.040
I have a question for you as a journalist.
What I've noticed since COVID-19...

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.840
just as a citizen and a father.
reading the newspapers and on TV...

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:16.800
is that they're mainly telling a one-sided
story. That's what I see in the media.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:23.200
So much so. that I really do think
as a citizen that they're being censored.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:30.920
What's your experience of that
as a journalist in the COVID-19 period?

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.480
I think that...

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.840
because people
know nothing about the subject...

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.560
people in general
and journalists in particular...

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.360
find it difficult. outside the...

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.120
to talk outside the scope
of the government line.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:01.560
Because if you have no knowledge
about the subject...

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.440
it's easy to mess up
by saying something that's not right.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.240
It's safer
to stick to the government line.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.440
Come on in. What would you do
if you were the prime minister?

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.720
Look at the media. they should
be critical. that's their job.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.360
But they're the helpers.
Is that not a bit strange?

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.440
That's what is so disappointing.
It's now very clear...

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:37.040
we no longer have critical media.
even in our own country.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.760
I'm shocked. as a citizen.
I didn't think it would go that far.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.160
I'm from the generation of journalists
who worked in the 60s.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:51.160
It was a great time for journalism.
We were highly critical and troublesome.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.040
We made life very hard for politicians.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.720
When I watch those two
at their press conferences...

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.640
during the questions I think: Why don't
you ask a critical question for once?

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.920
Why not do the research
and ask probing questions?

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.280
To my mind. and we made
a bit of game out of this in the 60s...

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.560
if you interviewed a politician
in the evening after a news show...

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.400
you rather hoped
he would feel a little sick all day.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.840
Because he'd be thinking: I don't know
what might happen this evening.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.520
What they might ask.
Joop van Tijn and the other fellows.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.680
They did their research so thoroughly...

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.160
I don't think Hugo de Jonge had diarrhoea
before any of the press conferences.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.240
But he should have.
A touch of nervousness...

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:46.920
Because we...
That's the next turn that the story takes:

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.000
We. the vast majority. the ordinary
citizens. are not represented.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.760
There's no lobby for us.
-No. Society needs its own lobby.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.760
That's very important. otherwise
everything will go to the other lobbies.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.560
But we don't have one.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:10.840
That's the nice thing about the term
'media': it suggests intermediation.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.440
To my mind it's a nice system:
There's reality.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:21.480
That's more or less complicated.
It's often less complicated than we think.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.960
So that's there. Then there's us.
all busy with our work. our families...

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.680
our careers.
-The end of the month and off we go again.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.160
So life is difficult enough
for a lot of people.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:39.560
You also want to know what's going on
in the world. for when you vote...

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.440
and to join in the chat at the pub.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:46.480
You need intermediaries for that.
and the intermediaries are the media.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:52.600
The quality of a democracy depends a lot
on the quality of the intermediaries.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.080
They need to be well-informed people
who have in-depth knowledge...

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.520
and who can say: But Prime Minister.
I remember that in March 1982...

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.200
your predecessor
formulated it very differently.

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:13.200
Someone who has really done the research
and asks critical. probing questions.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.920
That has disappeared.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.760
How can the media
be so fully on the side of the RIVM?

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.480
We've heard Pieter Klok's story.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:36.320
He simply says:
I only report the government's story...

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.920
because we're in a pandemic.
there's a lot going on.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:46.160
But it seems to me that the media should
be especially critical during a crisis.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.240
They should be asking
whether we are making the right decisions.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:57.040
But when they tell so many lies and
half-truths. what am I supposed to think?

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.200
To my mind. there's always a triangle:

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:11.000
It consists of the cartels.
clearly defined and with a clear agenda...

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.880
and the political decision-makers.
and the helpers.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.280
Political decision-makers are supposed to
represent the public interest.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:28.720
But that's not how the game plays out.
Politicians work best in the grey zone...

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:34.960
so that they can say. 'I didn't have all
the facts'. like Rutte said at the start.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.920
'We know 50 percent.'
-That was nonsense.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:43.280
From early January he knew far more
than he ever cared to admit.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:50.680
I think that for a politician that's the
best way to navigate. in shades of grey.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.000
You can keep your options open.

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:59.240
That's one factor. The other
is the lack of rational thinking.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:04.120
We always assumed that in politics
and economics. for example...

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:09.960
the decisions made are rational. But
most political decisions are irrational.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:16.120
That's because we. as human beings.
have a limited ability to act rationally.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:23.120
So every time the cabinet made an appeal
to people's rationality:

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.760
'Please understand
that you need to wash your hands.'

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:32.280
It was a highly rational approach.
But if psychology is right...

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.600
and humans have
what is known as a bounded rationality...

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:44.680
then it's entirely the wrong approach.
But that works out well for politicians.

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.720
Can they keep that up. Cees?
Citizens are better informed now.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:56.440
There's a lot of know-how in society.
more than in the cabinet itself.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:02.680
So as you said. it sounds
as if they're talking to pre-schoolers.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:08.720
That's how it came across to me.
And it was all about fear. fear. fear.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.480
I know that if I run my business
through fear it won't work.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.400
The same goes for my family
and for schools.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.720
As far as I know.
only regimes do that. Dictators.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.040
So it seemed very strange.
But still that is what happened.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.840
It's understandable
given the third leg of the triangle.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.120
Cartels have the biggest interest.
politicians muddle along.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.880
And then there are the helpers.
the assistants.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Those are the think-tanks. the lobbyists.
Politics is driven mainly by lobbyists.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:49.200
There's huge pressure on politicians.
That's why it's such a corrupt game.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:55.400
All the stakeholders except the public
know how to exert influence on them.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:01.560
And the key helpers in this case
especially have been the media.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.800
Helpers are needed
because decisions are made...

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:11.120
not in the interests of the vast majority
but of the small minority.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.200
They give a justification.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.280
Ultimately. taking into account
everything that's going on here...

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.040
you might wonder:
is this really about public health?

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.280
It's wonderful
to be able to help your children grow.

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:17.000
You can only do it if they accept it.
if they're okay with it.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.040
It's great to work together so much.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:28.240
I see my father as hard-working.
inspiring...

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.600
and always busy. always on the go.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.960
Here. Max. They came in here.
-Yes.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.600
More headlights.
-I've got some more.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.520
Let's see if they look good.
-Yes. Nice. right?

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:55.440
Let's look at the production
of the pistons and cylinders there.

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.120
I'll put this one back and open that one.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:09.560
I was at home and I got a phone call from
my father. He said: I don't feel well.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.600
Can you pick me up?
I said: Sure.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.080
Looking back. I drove there very fast.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.840
I couldn't explain it at the time.
but I had a feeling...

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.720
I got there very quickly.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:35.000
When I got there I saw my father. He felt
very unwell and went to the bathroom.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.600
I thought: If he's feeling bad
maybe going to the bathroom will help.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.880
Maybe he ate something that disagreed
with him. Let's see how it goes.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:58.840
I got to the bathroom and thought: This
is bad. I have to make sure I don't faint.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.000
When he got back
I could see he was in a really bad way.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.160
And that it was much worse
than just something like a stomach upset.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.160
He could see that too.
I asked if I should call an ambulance.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.040
So we did that as fast as possible.
and it came.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.080
All the energy drained out of me.
I thought: This is it.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:34.320
For a moment I thought:
I can't believe that my son...

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.040
is going to see me slip away here.
It just can't be.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.920
It turned out he was having a heart
attack. So the ambulance took him away.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.040
I drove as fast as I could
to the hospital.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.480
When I got to the cardiac ward
my father was just coming through.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.720
They were taking him to the operating
room. It was scary to see that.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.400
It shocked me. of course.
I could only hope that he would be okay.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.080
But I was sure he would.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.400
Two days later I was told the results.
A quarter of my heart had died off.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.200
But I had so much energy the next day that
I immediately flicked the mental switch.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.920
I thought: One quarter isn't okay.
but three quarters are okay.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.080
And I feel fine
so everything will be fine.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.440
Business is good.
we have a great management team.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.680
The nice thing is that it works
because you've set it up based on trust.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.680
That linked in well
with what happened around coronavirus.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.560
Politicians should trust society.
the way we do:

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.840
I trust my team
and I trust our people's autonomy.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.160
They know what they need to do.
they like working that way.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.520
That's how you achieve success.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.640
But strangely. the government
did the opposite: No trust. no autonomy...

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.440
restricting freedom.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.680
You see how important it is. Even if you
drop out. everything carries on as usual.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.080
That was the main thing
about the coronavirus story.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.600
I thought: Surely young people aren't
being locked down. losing their freedom...

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.680
people aren't amassing debt
when there's no need?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.360
I understand exactly what he's saying.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.840
I know he's very motivated
and I'm glad he's doing it for us...

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.640
and for society.
I have a lot of respect for that.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:16.440
It's fantastic
that my family is giving me the scope...

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:23.160
to share what we all know with society.
to tell people about it.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.560
To say:
Guys. there's another way.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.360
Why is it our policy
that the only hope is a vaccine?

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.840
In that case
there are other powers at play.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.160
So tell me. what do you think. Ad?

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.000
What I think. very simply.
I see it very pragmatically:

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.840
As long as we have
this financial system...

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.520
things will not be okay for us.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.800
I think the coronavirus
is just one part...

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.640
of an action
that has now been set in motion...

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.240
that really just
pulls the strings tighter...

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.360
from the position of those
who are in power at the moment...

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.480
and who want to retain that power
whatever the cost...

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.480
and who have certain ideas
about what to do with that power.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.080
Who have a vision of humanity
and the future of humanity...

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.120
which they want to bring about in reality.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.240
A few people
are going to determine our future...

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.800
effectively taking away
our right to self-determination.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:58.280
Effectively leading us towards a goal
set by them with no regard for us.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.600
So our autonomy...
-Coronavirus is being used for that.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:09.080
Here in the Netherlands.
about ten percent at most...

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.320
own 75 percent
of everything there is to own.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.960
And that will increase even more sharply.
with what is going on now.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:23.280
By now it might be five percent
who own 75 percent.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:29.480
That process is accelerating now
as small businesses go under...

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:35.400
and the self-employed go under.
All that's left are the big players.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.760
This is...

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.600
nine thousand billion.
if every 50-euro note...

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:50.880
represents 50 billion.
this is nine thousand billion euros.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
What are we doing here?
Let's go to the banking crisis first.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.720
In the banking crisis we built up
a 50-billion debt. roughly speaking.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.040
We had to cut costs for eight years
to get that back in order.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.120
In those eight years we also made cuts
in Intensive Care and healthcare...

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:18.680
from 2.200 beds in 2015 to 1.100 beds.
They say healthcare is having problems.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.440
We caused that ourselves.
as we had to cut costs...

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.720
because the banks. the financial sector.
had earned an awful lot of money.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.320
Moving ahead a step to 2020...

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.240
with all the measures we're taking...

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.280
we're heading towards one hundred billion
in debt.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.480
I understand that with a bit of a fight...

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.960
two. three. four. five. six. seven.
Seven times.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:56.280
We have 750 euros. 750 billion.
I should say. I'll just put that here.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:04.280
It was created as the European fund
for the coronavirus. 750 billion.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.200
The remainder...

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.040
is the money that has been earned
by the group you're talking about.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:17.160
PriceWaterhouseCoopers says: This
money is owned by the financial sector...

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:24.560
and by the corporate states. by people
like Bill Gates and Elon Musk.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.560
There's no democracy.
no supervision there.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.640
It's not about the money they earn.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.240
Because one billion more or less
doesn't make any difference at that level.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.080
It's about it being sucked away from us.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.720
I want to demonstrate that.
Because if you look at this...

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.960
You know this too. Ad.
-Literally sucked away.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.560
It's totally parasitic.
-It's incredible.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.280
Looking at
this 750-billion European fund...

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.760
we fought with Italy. the European
states are squabbling about it.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.800
If you look at the debt we're amassing...

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.800
for that 50 billion.
society will have to...

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.760
It makes me angry because it's about
how money is distributed in the world.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.560
We have complex tax systems
and allowances to share it out fairly...

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.320
but there's nothing fair about it.
And that 50-billion debt we had...

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:31.000
meant eight years of hard work. By whom?
Citizens and SMEs. they're the ones...

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.080
I'm one of them. an entrepreneur.
We're doing well so I pay top rate taxes.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.440
I don't mind that
because if I pay taxes...

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:46.200
it pays for infrastructure. healthcare.
police. we can pay them a good salary.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.560
I pay it as a citizen
and SME business owner.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:56.400
But these guys pay almost no taxes.
They have the power to avoid taxes.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.400
They pay no tax at all.
-They pay no tax.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.520
So small businesses and citizens
work hard for eight years...

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:10.160
The basis of this system. as I said.
is that tax is paid for the people.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.680
And the people pay.
-So...

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.440
We've been given as security
for the repayment of the debt.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:22.240
And now with the coronavirus
we're taking on a debt of 100 billion.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:28.320
So for sixteen years. small businesses
and citizens will have to work for that.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:32.200
I want to leave behind
the idea that the state looks after us.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.600
The state has no money.
We do that.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.280
The state's money is our tax money.
-Yes.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.760
When they say
the government will help to pay...

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.640
for any claims that may arise
from the vaccinations...

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.800
the coronavirus vaccinations...

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.000
There's now a guarantee
that the government will pay the claims.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.040
It's our money.
So we're paying for any claims.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.560
And that means...

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.520
that the pharmaceutical industry
is fully exempt.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:20.960
Finance Minister Prof. Lieftinck
requests your attention.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.960
Compatriots.
this newsreel is intended...

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:32.200
to better acquaint you
with pressing points of government policy.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.360
Pay close attention to the images
and think about them again at home.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.960
Government business is your business.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.840
The measures that must unavoidably
be taken for our country to recover...

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.840
include the long-expected currency
reform. much desired by the government.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.480
So to sum up:

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.960
For this pile of money no tax is paid
but there's no product liability either.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.880
Most of this money is going to biotech
and pharmaceutical companies.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.520
Since the swine flu in 2009 they've been
earning more than any other industry.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:18.320
Yes. but again. it's not about that. They
already have a colossal amount of money.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.040
You simply can't imagine how much money
is available at the highest level.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.720
It's not about that.
-It's about the distribution.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.440
It's about it not being distributed.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:37.800
It's actually about the real economy
being bled dry.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.800
If you look at the purchasing power
of the average person in recent years...

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:50.640
it has decreased dramatically. Why?
Because wages are barely rising...

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:56.520
benefits are barely rising. pensions
aren't rising. they've been frozen.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:04.200
But costs are going up. Housing costs.
energy costs. Healthcare costs.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.560
It's all going up and up and up.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:11.560
So the pressure on citizens
is growing and growing...

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.920
and the means to live a reasonable life
under that pressure...

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.280
are constantly shrinking. There must
already be an awful lot of households...

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.440
that can only afford the bare necessities.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.400
Anything beyond that
they can't do any more.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:37.640
The people with political power
don't have that problem.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:44.000
For now. they still get enough out of the
tax trough to afford a good lifestyle.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.800
So they don't understand the problem.
or don't want to. or ignore it.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.880
More and more Dutch people
are facing severe problems.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.280
And not just in the Netherlands.
elsewhere. too.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.720
And it's been deliberately orchestrated...

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.080
so they can impose their will
through money.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:09.760
Here's the money and the power.
Correct me if I'm wrong. Ad:

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.120
Suppose that like us...
I have companies in Belgium and France...

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:21.880
and we all have about the same tax rates.
On average I pay about 50 percent tax.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.520
In the other countries too.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:30.600
If we made these people over here
pay taxes. which should be the norm.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.880
I'm not talking about past taxes
they never paid.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.440
But if we make them pay half worldwide.
that's this much.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:45.960
So if we say. 'You have to pay tax like
everyone else'. and we distribute this...

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.680
nobody would have money problems.
There's no need.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.840
Basically with half of this they could
pay off all the coronavirus debt.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.720
All of it. If that money were freed up
we'd have no more poverty in the world.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.360
That poverty is deliberately maintained.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.040
It is maintained based on the fact
that we have a system...

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:14.280
in which self-interest
and greed and power-seeking...

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:22.560
are rewarded. facilitated. I don't see
the people in those positions...

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.720
who are so incredibly rich.
with a few exceptions...

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.920
voluntarily giving up that position.
It's not even about the money.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.320
It's purely about the position of power.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.320
Because power corrupts
and a lot of power corrupts massively.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.240
This is fascinating to see. Ad.
Because as you say...

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.080
I've only looked at the eight months
in the coronavirus period.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.280
That means in thirty years
this group has earned a lot of money.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.600
Calculate it over three centuries.
-Exactly.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:02.600
You're going even further back.
-You're showing a simple example...

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:10.040
of how it adds up in a short time. If you
take that back three centuries or more...

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.040
which is the period
that these practices have been possible...

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.080
it's easy to conclude
that there are a few people...

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.040
who have so much
that it's possible to imagine.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.560
The difference between rich and poor
keeps growing. in the Netherlands too.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.520
This study looked at 2.000 billionaires...

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.000
especially those who run biotech.
data and pharmaceuticals.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.280
Bill Gates and so on. as we said.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.600
It's interesting to see. like you said.
it's been going on much longer.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.240
So we need to break this pattern.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.760
Then there would be no problem with debt
and we could also...

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.600
But not within this system.
-Then how. Ad? What's your view?

01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:01.720
We need to get rid of this system.
This financial system took shape...

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.320
over three centuries ago.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:11.320
It was set up
in the interests of the ruling class.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.960
It was set up as a system
to make money available...

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:24.200
for the kings and the nobility so that
they could finance their operations...

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.720
and finance their lifestyle.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:35.480
It was never actually meant
for the people.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.240
The people were the ones
who had to pay off the debts...

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.200
incurred by the king and the nobility.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.320
We need to get out of this system
and move to a different one.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.920
Because the system we're in now
is simply not good for us.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.640
It's a destructive financial system.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.920
I think
people should do their own research...

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.680
and make the link
between what we've discussed now...

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.720
about money and power and positions
of power and what's done with them...

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.440
and the effect that has
in society and in politics.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:24.720
We're on our way to see Bob.
He's a strategist.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:30.080
He focuses mainly on the age
we're currently in. on capitalism.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:36.480
And the fact that we're transitioning
to biotech and data technology.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:44.000
Lots of people aren't really aware of it
but past history too has shown...

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:50.040
that when you move into a new age
a power vacuum of sorts occurs.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.960
We're going to talk about that.
It's interesting...

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.240
because the power that is in place
wants to hold on to that.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:04.040
That is what's going on.
if you look at how capitalism...

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.760
is making way
for biotech and data technology.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:17.280
So we need a new system and we need
to move to a new social structure.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.720
Many digital technologies
make it possible to create a new society.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:28.600
We're in the intermediate zone. the vacuum
between the industrial age behind us...

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.280
and the digital age we've moved into.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:37.160
We're figuring out how to do things
and what the new rules should be.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.760
We keep repeating old rules.
Really we should start afresh...

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.160
and think about how to make a new society
with these new factors.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:51.960
The factors are technology. capital.
a lot of data.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.400
There are different factors at play
so you need to make a new society.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:03.880
The platform you talked about is based
on technology and digitalisation...

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.800
but it's still primarily
about making money. the shareholders.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.040
They're really skyrocketing.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.600
We can see all around us
that these are very big companies...

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:20.240
earning so much money that it's more
than individual countries earn.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:26.120
Who controls that? I believe
you have called them corporate states.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.320
Yes. corporate states.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.480
At the end of the industrial age
and the start of the digital age...

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.560
capitalism continued. that's how
the new technologies were built.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:44.280
The really big tech companies are so big.
they're becoming so powerful...

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.040
they're more powerful than countries.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.400
For a very long time
our society was set up in such a way...

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.320
that rules were made
by society. politicians. countries.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:02.480
They made laws. and businesses
had to adapt to the laws to operate there.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.720
That only works if countries
are more powerful than companies.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:12.600
I call them 'corporate states' because
they're bigger and more powerful...

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:18.240
than most countries. Countries
like the Netherlands. Belgium or France...

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:25.560
have become relatively too small to hold
their own against those big companies.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.720
Corporate states behave like states.
They have their own rules and conditions.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:37.200
They decide where to go. whether to pay
tax. They're deciding more and more.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.200
And countries have to adapt to what
corporate states see as their interests.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.680
Those are still partly capitalist.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:52.480
We have to realise that a lot of things
are going to become uncertain.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:57.520
A lot will change. and the virus
is actually the least of the problems.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.480
We're in transition and the politics of
the old age doesn't work in the new age.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:13.240
Major players are making use of this
period to safeguard their interests.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:20.280
There is polarisation and tension in
society. it's not one big civic movement.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.720
If we want to get through this
to a new period and get out of the fear...

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.440
we need to decide to do it together.
to help each other...

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.080
and overcome our differences
and create a better society.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.120
If we don't take that decision to create
a better society. to unite citizens...

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:48.520
we'll create scope for parties that
want to exploit the uncertain period...

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.720
and the tensions that arise.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:58.080
It's up to citizens to decide to step up.
to unite so we can make something good.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.000
If not. there are powerful forces
at work...

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.400
that will take the opportunity
to exploit things.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.640
That's the crossroads we are at.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.160
We must make that choice.
not let others make it for us.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.960
There has to be inequality in society
so that people work for a better life.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:25.160
That's what is known as
'just right inequality'.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.000
But too much inequality
creates discontent.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.880
We've seen that happen several times
in the past few centuries.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.400
That led to the First World War.
discontent about too much inequality.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.840
The best example may be
the Storming of the Bastille.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:50.400
At the time. the French king
had a very extravagant lifestyle.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.840
He cared about nothing and life
got worse and worse for the citizens.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:02.080
He behaved increasingly badly. Then the
very popular finance minister was fired.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:07.720
That led to the people's revolt
and the Storming of the Bastille.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:13.520
So when the inequality between
rich and poor becomes too great...

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.120
a countermovement emerges
in civil society.

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.000
That can play out smoothly
or become a revolution.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.360
The way things are distributed now
it's starting to head in that direction.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.280
The gap between rich and poor is growing.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.640
A few families
own a large part of the whole.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.000
A few companies hold the most power.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.480
Then there are all the masses
with little power and little money.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.040
The gap becomes ever greater.
the rich become richer.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.760
That gives rise to unrest and tensions.
You can feel it happening in society.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.880
The Italians are deeply worried.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.560
In spring the government promised money
to people who were forced to stay at home.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.960
Only part of the money was paid out.
A lot got lost in Italian bureaucracy.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.680
So a lot of people
never received any money.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:32.800
Hundreds of thousands of them are still
waiting for unemployment benefits...

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.480
from the spring.
from June. July. some even from May.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.200
About 20.000 people
have received nothing at all yet.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.760
So they are facing
serious financial problems.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.080
That's why people are obeying the rules
less in the second wave.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:59.560
They're more afraid about their financial
situation than the virus itself.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:06.000
There are demonstrations
almost every day at the moment.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:11.120
They often get out of hand
because people are desperate.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.880
They think: I've got nothing to lose.
I have to work or I won't earn anything.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.600
The Italian benefit system
isn't as well developed...

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.720
as for example in the Netherlands
and Germany.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.240
That means that people who don't work
have no income...

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:34.160
and often have serious financial problems.
they're even going hungry.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.840
There are stories that in cities
like Naples. and Palermo in Sicily...

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.800
people are going hungry
because they have no money.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:49.360
That's making this second wave
different from the first wave in January.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.360
People are more concerned about their
financial situation than the virus itself.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.680
The ice boat
is far faster than the summer boat...

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.600
from the mainland
to the island of Marken.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.360
There has recently even been a service
from Monnickendam to the island.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.520
Outside the harbour the ice boat glides
swiftly over the smooth Gouwzee.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.040
It's not a busy route.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.600
Within half an hour
the island is in sight.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.240
The connection was good until
the thaw started. Then it all changed.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.440
Marken became isolated. as transport
was impossible on the weak ice.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:45.240
The ice broke up. The strong westerly
wind drove the ice up onto the dyke...

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.880
as far as the houses.
Some jetties were crushed.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.640
There was a risk that in a flu epidemic
help would be unable to reach Marken.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.880
So Dr Pasdeloup. the local doctor.
asked the inhabitants to get vaccinated.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.120
They responded to the request
in large numbers.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.480
Dr Pasdeloup's surgery
had never been so busy.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:31.240
One by one. hundreds of islanders
aged twelve and up came for the injection.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:41.320
There are two scenarios or different
kinds of society we're moving towards:

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:48.400
In one society. the one percent
gain even more power and money.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:53.800
It is the elite. the one percent.
who like in feudal times are the masters.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:59.960
That's an elite society. The ordinary
citizens have to fend for themselves.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:04.760
That's one scenario. In the other
scenario. and history has shown this...

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.560
in other cases like the extravagant king.
a social countermovement emerges.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.760
You see it happening. entrepreneurs
and citizens creating a countermovement.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:22.840
There are bottom-up citizens' groups
in the Netherlands who've had enough.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.120
They want more of a civil society.
So our society has two movements:

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.280
The elite side and the civil side.
The question is: Who will win?

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.680
I don't know that. of course.

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.920
But they are two models
taking shape side by side.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:45.640
In the past. whenever the group
of citizens. the movement. grew too big...

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:51.600
a real force emerged.
Because ultimately the civil majority...

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.560
will always beat a small elite...

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.680
even if they have access to key
technologies. money and so on...

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.960
it's very likely the citizens will win.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.880
So I think that in the coming years.
first some tensions will arise...

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.680
between the two models. elite and civil.
and of course polarisation doesn't help...

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.920
That will happen too.
-Yes. polarisation in the civil movement.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:22.080
As a result it's not strong enough to act
or provide opposition.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:24.440
They're not really united.
-No.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.000
And there are some people
who want to keep it that way.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.880
But if we can create a civil movement...

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.680
that says: We don't want this. We want to
get back to what matters. To friendship...

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:43.800
being close. having fun. having parties.
normal human things.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.720
If we all agree that we want to go back
to a humane society...

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.360
that movement can provide opposition.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.360
The good news in all this is that
the technology we're talking about...

01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:02.040
digital technology. biotech.
a number of technological developments...

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.960
the platforms you mentioned. blockchains.
artificial intelligence...

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:13.680
they can make the elite more powerful
but they can also empower the citizens.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.880
The technology is neutral.
it depends on how we use it.

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:27.680
We can use technology to create
a decentralised. local economy.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.880
With solar panels and wind
we can generate our own energy.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.560
We don't need companies for that.
local societies can do it together.

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.280
There are robots to make strawberries
and tomatoes.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.680
You can automate
vegetable and fruit production.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.240
We're developing cultured meat.
all kinds of technologies...

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.840
that make it possible
for local communities...

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.600
to function
without the need for the big companies.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.840
The question is: Will it go that way?

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:04.680
Or will our generations have to work
even harder due to the coronavirus debt?

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.880
We have to change the economic model.
-How?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.320
That's the old industrial model.
You work. get paid. provide a service.

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:17.320
Wellbeing is financed by that model.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:23.080
That industrial model will be replaced
by a whole new economic model...

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.920
in which we're less dependent
on those kinds of parties.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:34.040
In times like that there's always someone
who thinks: Hah!

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.760
There's a vacuum. people are confused.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:42.280
And they try to use that for their own
gain. to get power or money.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.960
Things often go wrong then. It's a
pattern but it has never succeeded yet.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.880
In the past
companies were located in a country.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.800
The big issues and companies
are no longer in a country.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.200
It's all global.
-The world is their playing field.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:06.480
And many big issues are global issues.
They used to be national issues.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.960
The climate is a global issue.
The Netherlands can't solve it.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:18.240
Healthcare is a global issue. More and
more issues now cross over borders...

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.240
onto the world stage. But there's
no democracy on the world stage.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:30.160
The big companies aren't democracies.
Nongovernmental organisations...

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:36.080
act as the public bodies looking after
the environment. health and education.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.560
But they're not democracies either.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.880
Then there are a number
of big global investors. as you said.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.880
And a number of global charities. In my
view. what most of them are doing is good.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.080
Like Greenpeace.
whatever you may think of them.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:58.320
You may not agree with them but they
really believe in what they're doing.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.520
That's how most of those
organisations are. But not all of them.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.320
Loosen the right side.

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.680
What really astonished me
is that the scientists...

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:27.720
who didn't have an interest in pharma
didn't get to speak...

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.640
although they had a strong story. the
same as ours. That goes for doctors too.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.760
It's always tricky for doctors.
it's hard for them to speak up.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.680
I've seen in this research
that the people who made the decisions...

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:48.240
and that wasn't 193 countries.
it was a few people in the WHO...

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:53.200
and some important virologists
around important politicians:

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.520
Mr Drosten. a virologist
who invented the PCR test.

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.360
He has shares in his own company
so he has a strong interest in this.

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.600
Fauci too has a big interest in pharma
in America.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.720
Ferguson in England and Ab Osterhaus
in the Netherlands have a big interest.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:21.520
I don't understand why. when we seek
advice about public health. our health...

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:26.360
these are the kinds of people that
are chosen to tell us what we should do.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.000
If you scare people enough.
they can't think straight.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.320
This experiment in fear
has been going on for seven months now.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:39.360
It will be a big problem
trying to reverse that in due course.

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.560
It's not going to be easy.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.000
If we'd acted on what we found out
at the end of April...

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:54.360
we would have incurred under a third
of the debt we have now. Maybe even less.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.520
We'd have had fewer deaths too.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:02.640
We'd have protected care homes right
away. where most deaths occurred.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:09.160
They're doing it again in this second
wave: fear. panic. a kind of experiment.

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.320
Just because the ray of hope is a vaccine.
That's the cause of all the trouble.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:32.360
During our research
an article came in from The Lancet.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.960
The Lancet
is a leading scientific journal.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.880
In it. they drew the same conclusion
that we drew:

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.800
That it's a syndemic.
Of course. that needs a bit of explaining.

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.600
A syndemic means that you have
two conditions at the same time.

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.960
In this case we had the virus. of course:
COVID-19.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.240
It turned out that in addition...

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:09.800
the people who were vulnerable
all had underlying conditions.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:16.920
We know now what they are. They can be
cardiovascular disease. cancer. diabetes.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.360
So mainly lifestyle diseases
and mainly related to obesity.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.640
If you have both those things
at the same time it's called a syndemic.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:34.240
In some cases they can exacerbate each
other. And that's when the problems start.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:37.800
So what we're dealing with is a syndemic.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:41.360
Research has shown
that 98 percent of people...

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.640
are unaffected or barely. It's really
about the 2 percent that are vulnerable.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.440
We must do all we can to protect them.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.840
But for the rest? It's now clear
that all the measures were unnecessary.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.320
We wasted so much money
and it simply wasn't necessary.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.800
We must stop this right now
and get back to normal.
