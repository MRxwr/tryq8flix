2
00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:25.479
Good afternoon.
my darling sons of bitches!

3
00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.849
Let me introduce myself.

4
00:02:27.882 --> 00:02:29.817
My name is Brandon

5
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:31.552
and I'll be trying to
entertain you

6
00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:33.888
over the next hour.

7
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.223
You've probably
never heard of me

8
00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.726
that wouldn't be a surprise
because I'm nobody.

9
00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.897
They say time flies
when you're having fun

10
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.198
so this would
seem like forever

11
00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.466
because my jokes suck.

12
00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.403
But please stay until the end

13
00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:51.405
we have so much to talk about

14
00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:52.874
and I have a surprise for you.

15
00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:58.211
Let me tell you a story
about how I came to be here.

16
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.282
Once upon a time I was married
to a beautiful woman

17
00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.284
named Phillipa.

18
00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.821
She was everything you
could hope for in a woman

19
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.656
she was adorable

20
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.525
everybody loved her.

21
00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:12.694
All our friends
however wondered

22
00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:14.896
what is she doing
with an jerk like me?

23
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.465
And they were right.

24
00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.737
I was a shy. boring guy
obsessed with my work

25
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.273
stuck in my ways. who never
had anything interesting to say.

26
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.644
Are there any
accountants out there?

27
00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:34.649
We really are the most boring
mother fuckers you know.

28
00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.720
Did you hear the story about the
woman that went to the doctor

29
00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:39.721
for a check-up?

30
00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:44.391
The doctor told her she only had
six months left to live.

31
00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:47.327
She's crying. she's desperate.

32
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.965
she said: Doctor there must be
something I could do.

33
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.601
"Sure." said the doctor.
"You could marry an accountant."

34
00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.570
"What?

35
00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.304
Would it make me live longer?"

36
00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.773
"No." said the doctor

37
00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:00.508
"But he will make your last
six months here

38
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.275
seem like an eternity."

39
00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:10.417
So one day Phillipa woke
up and thought to herself.

40
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.719
They're right.

41
00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:14.321
I am beautiful and adorable

42
00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.924
and I do shine like a
star on a cloudless night.

43
00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:19.459
What am I doing with this jerk?

44
00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:23.430
So she dropped me
like a hot tamale

45
00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.666
and this tamale fell far.

46
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.603
I'd never been with another
woman besides Phillipa

47
00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:30.337
and when she left me.

48
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.440
I was alone. and hopeless.

49
00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.577
And then one day

50
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.313
I found a flyer on the
ground that said. "Stand up!"

51
00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:43.618
And here I stand.

52
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:46.020
Don't I kill as a comedian?

53
00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:48.455
Are you having a good time?

54
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.761
Let me tell you a story
about George C. Parker.

55
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:54.829
Have you heard of him?

56
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.633
He was a legendary
con man in New York City.

57
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.869
Who could sell
anything to anyone.

58
00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.005
The turn of the 20th century

59
00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:06.874
he became infamous for selling
rich tourists

60
00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:08.743
the Brooklyn bridge.

61
00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:11.913
They say he even sold one
Russian billionaire

62
00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:13.380
the Statue of Liberty.

63
00:05:14.782 --> 00:05:19.020
Well right now I feel like
George C. fucking Parker.

64
00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.557
so listen very carefully

65
00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:27.394
because I have tremendous.
fabulous.

66
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:31.398
wonderful stories to sell you.

67
00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.566
How was that?

68
00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.703
Is that like too
much gurgling or?

69
00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:45.506
Uh no. no. no.

70
00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:46.073
It was fine.

71
00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:55.650
Oh hey any chance I could
get my SAG card after this?

72
00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:57.218
Yeah. and I'll be getting
my acceptance letter

73
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:58.986
to the Director's Guild
any day now.

74
00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:04.125
Hey look on the bright side.

75
00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:06.661
You get to work with the
world-famous Father Lance.

76
00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:08.461
You'll be saved from the forces
of darkness in front

77
00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:09.664
of millions of viewers!

78
00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.135
Where do you want
the rest of these cables?

79
00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:16.537
They're fine where they are just
make sure you're wired up

80
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.973
and don't. forget to mic up
our starlet here.

81
00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.449
Do you want me to moan more?

82
00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:32.920
I can. like no problem.

83
00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:34.487
You're doing fine. Hailey.

00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:35.656
Okay.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.258

86
00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.535
I think keep it classy. okay?

87
00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:49.503
Let's go to a club.

88
00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:52.006

go if I have table service.

89
00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:55.076
Hey. freshy get ready.

You guys go without me.

92
00:07:58.546 --> 00:07:59.647
I'll meet you there.

93
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.215
You're gonna miss pre-game!

98
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.202

100
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.415
You've never heard of
"Father Lance"?!

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.000
Every week. an incredible
deliverance!

102
00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.879
Is that what they call
special effects these days?

103
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.464
Here.

104
00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:27.799
You're gonna like this.

I like "The Mindy Project".

106
00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:32.638
Don't you want to witness
divine intervention?

107
00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:45.960
Bryce.

108
00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:47.194
Want me to take it away?

109
00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:49.130
But Dad. "The Cleansing Hour"
is almost on.

110
00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:50.297
First you finish your dinner.

111

Vegetables too Come on.

112
00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.309
God damn it. Lance.

113
00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:09.183
Somebody call for an exorcist?

114
00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.153
Well hey sugar.

115
00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:14.021
Where the hell you been.

116
00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.089
I was

117
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.690
counseling?

118
00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:17.792
Is that fucking lipstick?

119
00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.996
Well you know they
can't resist a man in uniform.

120
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.931
Tell me again why I put up
with your shit.

121
00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:25.966
I'll give you five million
reasons and climbing.

122
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.069
Yeah. and if one of those
reasons happens to snap a pic

123
00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.671

down some IHOP waitress's skirt

124
00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:31.205
we're done!

125
00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.139
It's over!

126
00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:33.607
Drew that's offensive.

127
00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:35.142
I'm a Denny's man.

128
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:36.744
What?

129
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:37.378
Would you watch it?

130
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.913
That's our lifeline!

131
00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:40.915
What is your deal today?

132
00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:42.883
I think he's just trying to say
you should show more respect

133
00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:43.818
for technology.

134
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:47.922
Who the fuck's that guy?

135
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:49.190
Braden.

136
00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:51.258
Sound.

137
00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.194
What happened to Chris?

138
00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:56.297
He's under the weather.
Asked me to fill in.

139
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.666
Okay well just don't
get your boom in my shot.

140
00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.301
And make sure you
sign an NDA form.

141
00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:01.702
Wow!

142
00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:02.970

146
00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:07.641

147
00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:09.643

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:17.818
I'm gonna place these in your
nose. they'll dissolve

152
00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.820
after five minutes instant
nosebleed.

153
00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:20.754
Drew will direct you.

154
00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.257
Thank you.

155
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.658
I'm just gonna move your hair
a second

156
00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:25.392
and put this in your ear.

157
00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:26.360
Okay.

158
00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:31.799
Ooh!

159
00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:32.867
Sorry!

160
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.101
That's always the most
awkward part.

161
00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:35.002
No problem.

162
00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:40.341
This looks legit!

163
00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:41.142
Where'd it come from?

164
00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:42.810
Found it at a garage sale.

165
00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:45.045
30 seconds take
your mark. Padre.

166
00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:46.714
All right. guys!

167
00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:49.083
Let's make it a quick one I got
a date with destiny tonight.

168
00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:50.217
Probably not her real name.

169
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:51.452
Ah. Jesus!

170
00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:53.420

Lord's name in vain.

I cast you out in
the name of the Lord. Jesus Christ!

176
00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.208
You are at
the mercy of the Creator!

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:36.230
An innocent soul.
tortured

181
00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:37.932
by the only family
she'd ever known.

182
00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:41.769
Molested by her father.
beaten by her mother

183
00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:44.405
Sabrina sought escape from her
unimaginable pain.

184
00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:46.907
in the form of drugs. alcohol

185
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:49.877
and ultimately. prostitution.

186
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.313
'Cause he's rich Well.
not just 'cause he's rich!

187
00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:57.785
Well anyway.
so it's Josh or Kyle.

188
00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.120
The enemy of
God exploited her frailty.

189
00:12:00.154 --> 00:12:03.090
and took control of her body.
but tonight

190
00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:06.427
by the grace of God with
my help and your prayers.

191
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.231
Sabrina will be
rid of this evil!

192
00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:13.467
Okay. that's great. Heather!

193
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.436
Keep your head down.
whatever they can't see

194
00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:16.370
will terrify them.

195
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:21.408
In nomine Patris et Filium
et Spiritum Sanctum.

196
00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:24.546
All right. great
Heather. now try and bite him.

197
00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:31.018
Sabrina is exhibiting incredible
strength and aggression.

198
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.187
This could be a stage four
possession.

199
00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:38.025
I command you. unclean spirit

200
00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:40.828
by the mysteries of
the incarnation.

201
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.463
hatched in the resurrection

202
00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:45.165
and the ascension of
our Lord Jesus Christ

203
00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:47.801
that you tell me your name
and obey me to the letter!

204
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.870
Speak your name. demon!

205
00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.507
Okay. Heather

206
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.809
your demon name is

207
00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:57.144
Slubgob.

208
00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:59.213
Repeat: Slubgob.

209
00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:03.817
Your name. demon.

210
00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:05.520
Speak!

211
00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:11.959
Damn. Heather. very nice!

212
00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:15.563
Tell me your name. in the
name of our Lord. Jesus Christ!

213
00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:24.539
We are Thoth.

214
00:13:24.572 --> 00:13:27.441
Collector of fractured souls!

215
00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:31.011
Soon we'll be
thousands in number.

216
00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:34.014
Limitless in strength!

217
00:13:38.252 --> 00:13:41.121
Just go with it. she said
her name was Thoth.

218
00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:43.023
Uh. Heather I appreciate your
enthusiasm.

219
00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:44.224
but please stick to the script.

220
00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:49.930
Our Father. who art in heaven.

221
00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.533
Hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come.

222
00:13:51.566 --> 00:13:53.100
What on Earth are
you two watching?

223
00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:57.588
Are you seeing this?

224
00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:02.009
Thoth.

225
00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:06.347
Abhor and slime of Hell.
servant of Satan.

226
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:09.950
See the cross
of the Lord Jesus

227
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.285
and submit

228
00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:13.521
to the authority
of the Almighty!

229
00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:15.557
Fight Sabrina!

230
00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:17.124
Fight!

231
00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:18.359
Do not give in!

232
00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:19.159
Fight!

233
00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:31.606
That wasn't me.

234
00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:35.510
Must've slipped.

235
00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:38.546
Fuck you. deceiver!

236
00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:41.549
Fuck you for all of the masses!

237
00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:44.552
You will take the world
and the bounty it provides.

238
00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:47.421
You're nothing but a pawn
in the eyes of the Great One!

239
00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:48.222
Silence!

240
00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:50.424
Silence. demon!

241
00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.595
I cast you out in the name of
our Lord. Jesus Christ!

242
00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:55.663
Be gone and depart from Sabrina.

243
00:14:55.697 --> 00:14:58.132
who is but an innocent
creature of God!

244
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.102
For it is He who commands you.

245
00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:04.371
He who flung
you from the heights of Heaven

246
00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:06.340
to the depths of Hell!

247
00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:07.207
What the fuck?

248
00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:12.179
Is that you?

249
00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.588
Hearken therefore
and tremble in fear.

250
00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:25.727
For you are at the mercy
of the creator of all things!

251
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.630
Submit and depart from us!

252
00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:39.106
Holy shit!

253
00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:40.508
Heather?

254
00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:49.383
We've got a problem.
something's wrong Heather?

255
00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:50.050
Heather!

256
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:51.753
I don't think she's acting!

257
00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:54.054
I got to end transmission!

258
00:15:54.589 --> 00:15:56.123
Don't you dare!

259
00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:57.024
Look at the numbers!

260
00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.293
Help me. Father Lance!

261
00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.562
Please!

262
00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:03.096
We've got to fix this!

263
00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:06.467
Don't break the fourth one!

264
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.368
13 million people are gonna
watch this girl die.

265
00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.436
Who do you think
they're gonna blame?

266
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.506
Help me. Father Lance.

267
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.075
Give me the book!

268
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.211
I'm the exorcist. right?

269
00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:20.582
Read it out loud.

270
00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:21.381
Yeah.

271
00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.184
Help me. Father Lance!

272
00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:41.636
Repel

273
00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:48.242
Repel. O Lord the devil's power.

274
00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:52.479
Break asunder his
snares and traps

275
00:16:55.683 --> 00:16:57.451
Put the unholy
tempter to flight

276
00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:01.656
I cast you out. demon!

277
00:17:02.657 --> 00:17:04.692
Be gone. be gone. be gone!

278
00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:07.729
Depart from us in the name of
Jesus Christ!

279
00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.031
Be gone!

280
00:17:28.883 --> 00:17:29.851
Sabrina?

281
00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:34.221
Are you with us?

282
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.734
Sabrina?

283
00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:50.203
Sabrina. are you with us?

284
00:17:58.546 --> 00:18:00.180
S-Sabrina?

285
00:18:00.213 --> 00:18:01.783
Sabrina. are you...

286
00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:03.317
are you with us?

287
00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.260
Are you with us?

288
00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:22.469
Get her off me!

289
00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:28.643
Drew!

290
00:18:28.676 --> 00:18:29.844
Help!

291
00:18:29.877 --> 00:18:30.745
I'll get her legs!

292
00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:31.546
I'll get her legs!

293
00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:33.615
What the fuck?

294
00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:36.350
Got her legs!

295
00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:37.085
I got her legs!

296
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.251
What the fuck?

297
00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:06.179
What happened?

298
00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:08.448
Did I do a good job?

299
00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:12.219
You did good. Heather.

300
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:14.622
You did good.

301
00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:15.590
I did it.

302
00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:17.825
I fucking did it!

303
00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:38.378
We have to take
a selfie before we go!

304
00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:06.473
Bitch!

305
00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:07.608
I am not.

306
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:24.291
So God created man in his image.

307
00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:25.927
And then

308
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.894
he created women.

309
00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:29.764
And he said unto them

310
00:20:29.797 --> 00:20:32.934
fruitful and multiply

311
00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:34.902
and populate the Earth

312
00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:35.870
and subdue it.

313
00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:38.906
And so we did.

314
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.842
We fucked like rabbits.

315
00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:42.543
Populated the planet.

316
00:20:42.577 --> 00:20:43.778
And fucked it all up!

317
00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:48.816
Out of the mouths of babes

318
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:49.751
and The Bible.

319
00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:52.352
Words hurt huh?

320
00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:56.824
Man's words hurt even more.
because they're filled

321
00:20:56.858 --> 00:21:00.360
with nothing more than lies
and bad intentions.

322
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.834
Why don't you just give up. and
let the demon into your body?

323
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:11.338
And you. demon!

324
00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:13.674
Why do you hesitate
to enter this woman?

325
00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.309
She's not as bad as the others.

326
00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:21.448
Jesus. being an
exorcist is really tough!

327
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.584
I mean a real nightmare.

328
00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:26.453
We used to have to
convince the demon

329
00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:27.487
out of the body.

330
00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:30.625
But now we are so fucked up

331
00:21:30.658 --> 00:21:32.359
they're too scared
to possess us!

332
00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:35.763
Of course.
it's all God's fault.

333
00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:36.731
He's a workaholic.

334
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.666
I mean

335
00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:42.036
he could've been like everyone
else and worked Monday to Friday

336
00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:44.705
but no. he's an
overachieving asshole

337
00:21:44.739 --> 00:21:46.741
who wanted to
work six days a week

338
00:21:46.774 --> 00:21:48.375
and only rest on Sundays.

339
00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:52.412
We could've been so cool
but he was in such a rush now.

340
00:21:53.147 --> 00:21:55.016
He made us human.

341
00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:57.618
There are many
others like him

342
00:21:57.652 --> 00:22:00.054
that take things
too seriously.

343
00:22:00.087 --> 00:22:01.923
Work more than they need to

344
00:22:01.956 --> 00:22:03.356
slaves to their job.

345
00:22:04.357 --> 00:22:06.694
These workaholics are the
ones you have to watch

346
00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:10.097
especially the evil ones.

347
00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:32.513
That was fucking creepy.

348
00:24:07.982 --> 00:24:08.816
Hello?

349
00:24:11.686 --> 00:24:12.553
Hello?

350
00:24:27.034 --> 00:24:27.902
Hello

351
00:24:42.183 --> 00:24:43.551
Hello. Mia

352
00:24:43.584 --> 00:24:44.618
Dave?

353
00:24:44.652 --> 00:24:45.786
Sorry. my fucking Bluetooth.

354
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.121
What are you doing?

355
00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:49.724
Well I'm talking to you
on the phone and driving over

356
00:24:49.757 --> 00:24:50.925
to your place.

357
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.827
You know you're late by the way.

358
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.996
Yeah well.
I might have had to make a stop.

359
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:56.564
What for?

360
00:24:56.597 --> 00:24:58.232
I got you something.

361
00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:00.201
Last time I got a gift from
you. it was football tickets.

362
00:25:00.234 --> 00:25:01.702
Yeah.
and those were really good seats.

363
00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:02.903
You know I don't watch football.

364
00:25:02.937 --> 00:25:04.238
What?

365
00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:05.106
What do you mean you don't watch
football. since when?

366
00:25:05.139 --> 00:25:05.973
That was a fun day.

367
00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:07.608
I got us on the kiss cam.

368
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:09.143
We had beers. I got you those
fucking nachos you wanted.

369
00:25:10.244 --> 00:25:11.946
Being romantic
is not your thing.

370
00:25:12.747 --> 00:25:13.714
Okay. I'll be there soon.

371
00:26:06.634 --> 00:26:08.169
Come on. come on. don't hit me.

372
00:26:08.202 --> 00:26:09.336
What the fuck is wrong with you?

373
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.638
Are you on fucking steroids
or what?

374
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:11.939
Oh my gosh!

375
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:13.774
That is what you
get for being an idiot.

376
00:26:13.808 --> 00:26:15.876
Oh my gosh.
you're so adorable

377
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:16.977
when you're upset.

378
00:26:17.011 --> 00:26:18.379
What if I had a knife
in my hand?

379
00:26:18.412 --> 00:26:19.880
What if you had a knife
in your hand?

380
00:26:19.914 --> 00:26:21.248
I don't know. what would happen?

381
00:26:21.282 --> 00:26:23.350
Maybe you'd stab me

382
00:26:23.384 --> 00:26:25.386
cut me right here. and I'd get
blood all over you.

383
00:26:25.419 --> 00:26:26.620
You'd get all wet.

384
00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:29.290
I got you a bear.

385
00:26:29.323 --> 00:26:31.092
You are so creepy.

386
00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:31.792
His name is Bill.

387
00:26:32.293 --> 00:26:32.960
Bill?

388
00:26:32.993 --> 00:26:34.061
Mhm.

389
00:26:34.095 --> 00:26:35.696
Bill is not a cute
name for a bear.

390
00:26:35.729 --> 00:26:36.897
I think it's a cute
name for a bear.

391
00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:38.699
And I got you flowers.

392
00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:40.801
Does that make up for it?

393
00:26:40.835 --> 00:26:42.136
Am I romantic enough for you?

394
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:43.704
Yeah?

395
00:26:44.638 --> 00:26:46.107
I like how my shirt
looks on you by the way.

396
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.774
Really?

397
00:26:46.807 --> 00:26:47.675
It's pretty hot.

398
00:26:47.708 --> 00:26:48.876
Yeah?

399
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:50.344
But I am going to
need it back right now.

400
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:52.213
I need you to take it off.

401
00:26:52.246 --> 00:26:53.180
Oh!

402
00:26:53.214 --> 00:26:54.215
Should I just take it off?

403
00:26:54.248 --> 00:26:54.949
Like right now. yeah.

404
00:26:56.016 --> 00:26:57.051
Yeah. just like right now.

405
00:26:57.818 --> 00:26:58.819
Yeah. like right now.

406
00:26:58.853 --> 00:26:59.787
That's good.
that's a good start.

407
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:02.189
A couple more buttons

408
00:28:56.003 --> 00:28:57.438
911.
where is your emergency?

409
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:58.540
Oh my God. please!

410
00:28:58.573 --> 00:28:59.974
Help me. he's coming after me.

411
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:08.282
What do you want?

412
00:40:56.157 --> 00:40:57.892
Sorry.

413
00:40:57.925 --> 00:40:59.459
I haven't had breakfast.

414
00:41:00.061 --> 00:41:01.128
Anyway.

415
00:41:02.697 --> 00:41:05.566
back to the
story of Phillipa.

416
00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:07.768
I always wanted
to be a father.

417
00:41:09.103 --> 00:41:10.905
I wanted children

418
00:41:10.938 --> 00:41:12.239
with all my heart.

419
00:41:13.975 --> 00:41:16.777
But Phillipa didn't.

420
00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:20.614
She was perfect

421
00:41:20.648 --> 00:41:23.517
being pregnant
would ruin her figure.

422
00:41:24.452 --> 00:41:27.254
And she would probably
lose followers on Instagram.

423
00:41:28.089 --> 00:41:30.057
After we divorced

424
00:41:30.091 --> 00:41:32.727
Phillipa quickly moved on

425
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.563
and started dating
some other asshole.

426
00:41:35.596 --> 00:41:37.598
Who was even
more boring than me.

427
00:41:39.633 --> 00:41:41.202
A year later

428
00:41:41.235 --> 00:41:42.603
she fell pregnant.

429
00:41:44.138 --> 00:41:46.173
So what the hell happened there?

430
00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:51.045
Perhaps Phillipa thought
she would get more

431
00:41:51.078 --> 00:41:53.247
likes and comments

432
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.815
if she was holding a puppy.

433
00:41:55.516 --> 00:41:58.319
She always liked
to do it doggy style.

434
00:41:58.352 --> 00:42:00.988
She probably thought she
was gonna have puppies.

435
00:42:02.023 --> 00:42:04.558
I loved her dearly

436
00:42:04.592 --> 00:42:06.560
but she was too shallow.

437
00:42:06.594 --> 00:42:09.030
Too

438
00:42:09.063 --> 00:42:11.565
dependant on her appearance.

439
00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.734
I mean. you can't blame her.

440
00:42:13.768 --> 00:42:15.636
Who isn't these days?

441
00:42:15.669 --> 00:42:17.238
A culture based

442
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:19.540
on appearances and hypocrisy.

443
00:42:20.307 --> 00:42:21.976
That's what this is!

444
00:42:22.877 --> 00:42:24.245
Perhaps

445
00:42:24.278 --> 00:42:25.679
that's why I'm here.

446
00:42:27.648 --> 00:42:28.983
Because

447
00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:30.684
I wasn't true to myself.

448
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.921
But No more!

449
00:42:35.623 --> 00:42:38.325
Now it's a time to change.

450
00:42:39.393 --> 00:42:40.961
Now

451
00:42:40.995 --> 00:42:42.329
it's time to be free.

452
00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:58.495
It's nice we can choose
the clothes together.

453
00:42:59.204 --> 00:43:00.706
We're so lucky

454
00:43:00.747 --> 00:43:02.875
not everybody can do that.

455
00:43:02.916 --> 00:43:05.669
It'll be big on you.
but I'd like you to wear

456
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:06.962
my father's suit.

457
00:43:07.004 --> 00:43:08.046
What do you think?

458
00:43:10.507 --> 00:43:11.341
I don't care.

459
00:43:11.383 --> 00:43:12.176
I'll wear whatever.

460
00:43:12.217 --> 00:43:15.012
No. you must look smart.

461
00:43:15.053 --> 00:43:16.847
It's an important day for me.

462
00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:19.933
Lots of people are coming.
you must look perfect.

463
00:43:19.975 --> 00:43:22.686
Then just choose
my clothes for me.

464
00:43:22.728 --> 00:43:23.896
I'm not in the mood.

465
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:24.730
Shoes?

466
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.526
The brown ones are nicer. right?

467
00:43:29.568 --> 00:43:32.112
Those ones rub
and give me sores.

468
00:43:32.988 --> 00:43:34.865
I prefer the black ones.

469
00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:35.616
These ones.

470
00:43:35.657 --> 00:43:37.951
They're newer.

471
00:43:37.993 --> 00:43:41.288
They're newer because
I never wear them.

472
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.206
They rub.

473
00:43:42.247 --> 00:43:44.625
Then put some plasters on.

474
00:43:44.666 --> 00:43:47.211
Why ask me which shoes I want
if you're going

475
00:43:47.252 --> 00:43:48.712
to choose them yourself?

476
00:43:48.754 --> 00:43:50.422
Which tie?

477
00:43:50.464 --> 00:43:51.715
I like these two.

478
00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:54.843
I don't like wearing a tie.

479
00:43:54.885 --> 00:43:57.095
I never wear a tie.

480
00:43:57.137 --> 00:43:58.096
It's not my style.

481
00:43:58.805 --> 00:43:59.640
Style!

482
00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:02.184
Style What's your style?

483
00:44:03.352 --> 00:44:04.978
You look like a rustic.

484
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.898
I am a rustic and I like
the way I look. okay?

485
00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:12.027
Shave that beard off.

486
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:14.071
You're not going
with that great beard.

487
00:44:14.112 --> 00:44:16.990
You're not touching
my great beard.

488
00:44:17.032 --> 00:44:19.535
I was practically
born with a beard.

489
00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:21.954
You met me with this beard.

490
00:44:21.995 --> 00:44:25.457
That beard is
going and that's that.

491
00:44:25.499 --> 00:44:28.710
Don't you dare
I mean it. okay?

492
00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:34.758
Darling.

493
00:44:39.388 --> 00:44:40.264
That beard.

494
00:44:41.974 --> 00:44:43.433
That beard it's disgusting.

495
00:44:45.018 --> 00:44:45.936
It doesn't suit you.

496
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:48.188
It never has.

497
00:44:50.274 --> 00:44:52.568
These clothes
that we're choosing

498
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:54.862
you'll be wearing for eternity.

499
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:56.196
We don't have much time

500
00:44:56.238 --> 00:45:00.534
so make an effort and
help me with all of this.

501
00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:03.203
You're the star.

502
00:45:03.245 --> 00:45:04.496
Lots of people are coming

503
00:45:04.538 --> 00:45:07.416
to see you one last
time at your wake.

504
00:45:07.457 --> 00:45:10.919
So I want you to look
handsome and radiant.

505
00:45:10.961 --> 00:45:12.713
They'll think that I've dressed
you badly because

506
00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:14.631
you're a simple villager.

507
00:45:14.673 --> 00:45:18.010
But that's what I am.

508
00:45:18.051 --> 00:45:20.888
That's how I want
people to remember me.

509
00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:22.890
With my shirts

510
00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:24.641
with tracksuit bottoms

511
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.852
and. above all

512
00:45:26.894 --> 00:45:27.811
with my beard.

513
00:45:29.354 --> 00:45:31.023
Don't touch my beard. okay?

514
00:45:32.107 --> 00:45:34.651
I have to get the flowers

515
00:45:34.693 --> 00:45:37.237
the coffin and
call the last guests.

516
00:45:37.279 --> 00:45:39.406
The burial is in three days.

517
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.117
So don't be selfish.

518
00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:43.744
Cooperate a little. please.

519
00:45:43.785 --> 00:45:45.245
Darling

520
00:45:45.287 --> 00:45:48.332
why don't you just wait until
I die and you can do it

521
00:45:48.373 --> 00:45:49.583
as you like.

522
00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:53.921
Darling. I don't like
to remind you but

523
00:45:53.962 --> 00:45:56.298
the doctor said you have
less than 48 hours left.

524
00:45:57.132 --> 00:45:58.258
What if he's wrong?

525
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.470
He won't be wrong.

526
00:46:34.503 --> 00:46:36.213
He looks so smart.

527
00:46:36.255 --> 00:46:38.215
Are the clothes his?

528
00:46:38.257 --> 00:46:40.509
Or are they from the funeral
home?

529
00:46:40.551 --> 00:46:42.928
It's my father's suit.

530
00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.639
We chose it together
for the occasion.

531
00:46:46.431 --> 00:46:49.101
Rest assured. dear.

532
00:46:49.142 --> 00:46:51.937
He's more handsome
dead than he was alive.

533
00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:55.482
A little too much make-up
though. don't you think?

534
00:46:55.524 --> 00:46:58.652
If not he'd be white and
would give us the chills

535
00:46:58.694 --> 00:47:01.697
but I think it's a
complete waste of time.

536
00:47:01.738 --> 00:47:03.824
He'll start to rot
in a few hours.

537
00:47:03.866 --> 00:47:06.034
He looks better without a beard.

538
00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:07.536
He looks younger.

539
00:47:07.578 --> 00:47:09.371
He's unrecognizable
without it.

540
00:47:09.413 --> 00:47:10.706
He looks gay.

541
00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:13.500
I always told him to shave.

542
00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:16.128
Without that beard.
he's so handsome.

543
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.838
He looks like a fairy.

544
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.881
Why did you shave him?

545
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:22.426
It was one of his last requests.

546
00:47:25.846 --> 00:47:29.183
If you don't mind. could
you join the others?

547
00:47:29.224 --> 00:47:30.893
I'd like to be alone with him.

548
00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:00.682
Darling!

549
00:48:05.761 --> 00:48:07.137
What the hell are
you doing alive?

550
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.805
I don't know.

551
00:48:09.515 --> 00:48:11.183
I just woke up.

552
00:48:11.225 --> 00:48:12.726
My God. what a shock.

553
00:48:12.768 --> 00:48:13.936
How can this be?

554
00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:17.022
The doctor confirmed your death
a few hours ago.

555
00:48:17.064 --> 00:48:19.358
He confirmed it badly then.

556
00:48:19.399 --> 00:48:21.026
Because. as you can see.

557
00:48:21.068 --> 00:48:22.277
I'm alive.

558
00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:25.322
I feel absolutely fine.

559
00:48:25.364 --> 00:48:27.032
We're burying you in an hour.

560
00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:31.453
Your friends are here.
it's all ready.

561
00:48:31.495 --> 00:48:33.914
Even people who don't like
you came.

562
00:48:35.624 --> 00:48:38.418
We'll cancel it that's that.

563
00:48:39.711 --> 00:48:43.590
I'll go out right now
and explain it all.

564
00:48:43.632 --> 00:48:44.883
Are you crazy?

565
00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:47.052
It's been a lot of trouble.

566
00:48:47.094 --> 00:48:48.262
There are hundreds of people.

567
00:48:48.303 --> 00:48:50.597
There are high expectations.

568
00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:51.807
That many people came?

569
00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:53.892
It's a success.

570
00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:57.062
I've always been a popular guy.

571
00:48:58.772 --> 00:49:01.692
They'll be happy I'm alive.

572
00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:03.068
Darling

573
00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.778
I'm your wife and I love you

574
00:49:05.737 --> 00:49:07.573
but it's too late now.

575
00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:08.866
We're used to the idea now.

576
00:49:10.158 --> 00:49:11.451
What do you mean?

577
00:49:11.493 --> 00:49:13.787
We can't lose face.

578
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:14.872
We'd look stupid.

579
00:49:14.913 --> 00:49:16.874
I'd be a laughing stock.

580
00:49:19.293 --> 00:49:20.752
There's a lot at stake.

581
00:49:21.837 --> 00:49:22.504
What do you mean?

582
00:49:22.546 --> 00:49:24.631
You have to die.

583
00:49:24.673 --> 00:49:26.842
You can't just
resurrect like this.

584
00:49:26.884 --> 00:49:28.218
Are you serious?

585
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.261
Of course.

586
00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:34.641
Shit You can't do this to me.

587
00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:36.476
Juan. don't talk back to me.

588
00:49:36.518 --> 00:49:38.020
Your mother is here.

589
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:40.480
My parents are on their way.

590
00:49:40.522 --> 00:49:43.150
When they arrive. they
want you dead and buried.

591
00:49:43.192 --> 00:49:44.568
We can't let them down.

592
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.737
I don't want to die yet.

593
00:49:47.187 --> 00:49:49.239
I'm not ready.

594
00:49:50.782 --> 00:49:51.366
Darling.

595
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:53.827
Do you love me?

596
00:49:54.494 --> 00:49:55.454
Yes.

597
00:49:55.495 --> 00:49:57.331
Well. if you really love me

598
00:49:57.372 --> 00:49:58.040
die.

599
00:50:00.709 --> 00:50:02.169
You want me to kill myself?

600
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.718
My little boy.

601
00:50:12.513 --> 00:50:13.889
My little boy's gone.

602
00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:19.186
Faustina. don't fuss over
him you'll crease his suit.

603
00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:22.356
Goodness me.

604
00:50:23.607 --> 00:50:25.692
He's so handsome
without his beard.

605
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.529
You shaved my beard in the end.

606
00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.822
What are you doing alive?

607
00:50:30.864 --> 00:50:32.741
I don't know but
I've woken up.

608
00:50:32.783 --> 00:50:34.409
See?

609
00:50:34.451 --> 00:50:36.036
Fresh as a daisy.

610
00:50:36.078 --> 00:50:37.204
It's a miracle!

611
00:50:37.246 --> 00:50:38.673
Yes.

612
00:50:38.747 --> 00:50:40.999
Of course. I said that to her:

613
00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:44.920
"It's a miracle". but

614
00:50:44.962 --> 00:50:48.507
now I want to go outside and
give everybody the good news.

615
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:50.175
But she won't let me.

616
00:50:50.217 --> 00:50:52.678
She says I have to die.

617
00:50:52.719 --> 00:50:54.346
He wants to cancel the funeral.

618
00:50:54.388 --> 00:50:57.391
He says he doesn't want
to be buried until he's dead.

619
00:50:57.432 --> 00:50:58.809
Cancel the funeral?

620
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.895
Are you crazy?

621
00:51:01.937 --> 00:51:04.273
Do you know the
amount of people here?

622
00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:07.609
It's the funeral of the year.

623
00:51:08.527 --> 00:51:10.070
It cannot be canceled.

624
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.447
But. Mum?

625
00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:14.741
Don't "mum" me.

626
00:51:14.783 --> 00:51:16.410
You'll be buried
today and that's that.

627
00:51:17.828 --> 00:51:20.956
We can't lose face
with everybody.

628
00:51:20.998 --> 00:51:23.959
But I don't want to die. Mum.

629
00:51:24.001 --> 00:51:25.085
Son.

630
00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:26.295
don't be selfish.

631
00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:28.839
You have less than one hour

632
00:51:28.881 --> 00:51:29.882
to die.

633
00:51:30.757 --> 00:51:32.050
What rotten luck.

634
00:51:35.012 --> 00:51:36.388
How am I supposed to do it?

635
00:51:38.056 --> 00:51:40.267
I don't know.

636
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:43.228
I don't know Hold your breath
like when you have the hiccups.

637
00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:45.522
Hiccups?

638
00:52:07.878 --> 00:52:08.712
I can't.

639
00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:09.838
I can't.

640
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.964
I'm suffocating.

641
00:52:11.006 --> 00:52:11.924
Darling. that's the idea.

642
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.092
I don't like it.

643
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:17.721
Think of another way.
I don't like this one.

644
00:52:18.972 --> 00:52:19.806
Don't cry.

645
00:52:19.848 --> 00:52:21.850
Cooperate a little. son!

646
00:52:23.852 --> 00:52:26.522
If you want me to die
then think of something else.

647
00:52:28.106 --> 00:52:29.775
Why don't you cut your veins?

648
00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:47.292
How's it going. darling?

649
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:53.006
I feel a little dizzy

650
00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:55.759
but that's about it.

651
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:58.929
The funeral workers are coming
in 30 minutes.

652
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.764
they can't find him like this!

653
00:53:01.557 --> 00:53:03.559
Marisa. darling?

654
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.186
Go to the kitchen. get
the carving knife and stab me

655
00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:07.604
as many times as it takes.

656
00:53:08.313 --> 00:53:09.106
Me?

657
00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:10.148
Stab you?

658
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.318
How can he be so macabre?

659
00:53:45.184 --> 00:53:45.976
I can't take anymore.

660
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.020
Come on.

661
00:53:49.146 --> 00:53:50.022
Harder.

662
00:53:51.023 --> 00:53:52.024
You won't die.

663
00:53:54.026 --> 00:53:55.485
Don't you feel anything?

664
00:53:55.527 --> 00:53:56.486
My dear

665
00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.574
my stomach hurts. but

666
00:54:00.616 --> 00:54:02.326
I think I'm just nervous.

667
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.077
Damn it. Juanito.

668
00:54:04.119 --> 00:54:04.912
Just die!

669
00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:08.832
How's it going?

670
00:54:08.874 --> 00:54:09.583
Mum!

671
00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:10.876
We're running out of time.

672
00:54:10.918 --> 00:54:12.002
People are impatient.

673
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:17.174
This bastard
doesn't want to die.

674
00:54:17.216 --> 00:54:18.091
I'll help.

675
00:54:18.133 --> 00:54:19.718
I found this in the kitchen.

676
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.928
Mum?

677
00:54:20.969 --> 00:54:22.221
What are you going to do?

678
00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:26.475
You keep stabbing him.

679
00:54:26.517 --> 00:54:29.061
I'm going to whisk his stomach.

680
00:54:35.442 --> 00:54:37.361
It's disgusting!

681
00:54:37.402 --> 00:54:39.279
Life is disgusting

682
00:54:41.657 --> 00:54:42.908
death more so.

683
00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:46.745
What beautiful words. Mum.

684
00:55:05.264 --> 00:55:07.057
Why are you smoking?

685
00:55:07.933 --> 00:55:08.934
Smoking kills.

686
00:55:10.769 --> 00:55:12.563
It'll take hours for
him to bleed out.

687
00:55:14.189 --> 00:55:15.190
It's not working.

688
00:55:17.025 --> 00:55:20.028
But the blood
is perfectly fluffy.

689
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:20.821
Fantastic.

690
00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:27.786
Look at it all.

691
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.710
I didn't want to let anyone
down and now it's a disaster.

692
00:55:39.173 --> 00:55:40.799
I gave my life
preparing this funeral

693
00:55:42.176 --> 00:55:43.945
for nothing.

694
00:55:50.475 --> 00:55:51.894
Who will clean all this blood?

695
00:55:52.153 --> 00:55:54.730
What will we say?

696
00:55:54.771 --> 00:55:55.939
What will they think of us?

697
00:55:56.773 --> 00:55:57.774
Look!

698
00:55:57.816 --> 00:55:59.193
Look at our dresses

699
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:00.777
and what we've
done to your son.

700
00:56:02.487 --> 00:56:04.031
What do we look like?

701
00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:05.407
You look like what you are:

702
00:56:06.825 --> 00:56:07.576
Two fucking psychopaths.

703
00:56:12.539 --> 00:56:13.957
How dare you insult your mother.

704
00:56:15.876 --> 00:56:17.336
Who does he think he is?

705
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.463
Some manners!

706
00:56:23.175 --> 00:56:24.009
He's not moving.

707
00:56:25.385 --> 00:56:25.928
What?

708
00:56:27.179 --> 00:56:28.180
He's not moving

709
00:56:33.727 --> 00:56:34.603
or breathing.

710
00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:37.147
Are you sure?

711
00:56:37.189 --> 00:56:38.148
Yes

712
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:39.316
yes.

713
00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:40.609
I think you killed him.

714
00:56:42.569 --> 00:56:44.446
I killed

715
00:56:44.488 --> 00:56:45.906
my son?

716
00:56:45.948 --> 00:56:47.115
Yes. Faustina.

717
00:56:47.157 --> 00:56:48.116
You killed him!

718
00:56:48.158 --> 00:56:48.742
You killed him!

719
00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:49.368
No.

720
00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:51.662
I can't have done.

721
00:56:51.703 --> 00:56:54.540
Not my son. no.

722
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.542
But Faustina. isn't
this what we wanted?

723
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:00.921
The worst thing that
can happen to a mother

724
00:57:00.963 --> 00:57:02.422
is to lose her child!

725
00:57:08.011 --> 00:57:09.847
But. at least

726
00:57:09.888 --> 00:57:12.224
we don't have to
cancel the ceremony.

727
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:28.073
I think I scared them.

728
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:32.995
They didn't recognize
me without my beard.

729
00:57:33.036 --> 00:57:34.162
What do we do now?

730
00:57:52.472 --> 00:57:53.765
Why can't I die?

731
00:57:54.683 --> 00:57:56.685
Why can't I die?!

732
00:59:24.314 --> 00:59:25.983
Dr Gonzalez.
please go to surgery.

733
00:59:49.056 --> 00:59:52.293
And this low pressure system.
is going to slide in

734
00:59:52.326 --> 00:59:53.994
and bring with it.

735
00:59:58.182 --> 01:00:00.017
Now what? you fucking gringo.

736
01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:01.435
I have my green card!

737
01:00:05.206 --> 01:00:07.208
US Border protection:
How can I help you?

738
01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:09.943
Well yeah.

739
01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:12.029
You can help me.
give me my job back.

740
01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:16.074
What the fuck did you do?

741
01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.117
What the fuck did you do?

742
01:00:17.159 --> 01:00:18.577
You destroyed my car.
fucking gringo!

743
01:00:18.752 --> 01:00:20.221
Thanks for your collaboration.

744
01:00:20.254 --> 01:00:22.790
and remember:
Don't come back again!

745
01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:29.004
And the gringo wants
to charge us for the wall.

746
01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:31.298
Tell him no.
fucking racist gringo!

747
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.424
We won't pay you shit!

748
01:00:34.235 --> 01:00:35.936
Wait a minute please.

749
01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:50.484
Mr. Trump

750
01:00:50.526 --> 01:00:53.153
look. we are
honest people and

751
01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.530
we only want to ask you to...

752
01:01:35.988 --> 01:01:37.698
Who changed my case?

753
01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:39.533
Who did you steal this from?

754
01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:41.827
Well. it was there

755
01:01:45.163 --> 01:01:46.999
Play the guitar!

756
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.459
Sing something. but in
English. or he won't understand.

757
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.392
Come here Mr. diplomat.

758
01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:07.644
It's up to you to demand him

759
01:02:07.686 --> 01:02:08.645
put it on!

760
01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:11.231
If you don't

761
01:02:11.273 --> 01:02:14.610
he'll step over our people
and destroy our culture.

762
01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:20.115
Go. hurry up!

763
01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:27.998
Now. who could save us?

764
01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:38.383
Hey what's that?

765
01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:39.885
It's a miracle!

766
01:02:41.303 --> 01:02:43.096
It's quetzalcoatl.

767
01:02:43.138 --> 01:02:44.723
Is it the hail Mary?

768
01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:48.143
It is the hail Mary!

769
01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:09.706
Hell yeah motherfucker!

770
01:04:34.576 --> 01:04:35.577
Well. believe it or not
we are already halfway

771
01:04:37.177 --> 01:04:38.312
through the show.

772
01:04:39.279 --> 01:04:41.315
Wasn't as bad as you thought.

773
01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:42.650
Well. perhaps it was

774
01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:44.485
but you have to defend
yourself. don't you?

775
01:04:45.653 --> 01:04:47.488
A wise man once said

776
01:04:48.355 --> 01:04:50.391
that our decisions
get us into trouble

777
01:04:51.492 --> 01:04:52.926
but our pride
that keeps us there.

778
01:04:54.696 --> 01:04:57.464
Sometimes we make
decisions to please people

779
01:04:57.498 --> 01:04:58.465
or annoy them.

780
01:04:59.967 --> 01:05:01.301
Like I did with my father

781
01:05:02.369 --> 01:05:04.639
I decided to study
accountancy

782
01:05:04.672 --> 01:05:06.039
just to piss him off.

783
01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:08.442
My dad was a rock singer

784
01:05:08.475 --> 01:05:11.378
but not one of those that
would sell a million records

785
01:05:11.412 --> 01:05:13.447
or that you would see on TV.

786
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.517
He was the type of guy that
would hop from bar to bar

787
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.017
working for tips.

788
01:05:18.252 --> 01:05:19.153
He was happy

789
01:05:19.987 --> 01:05:21.155
a free soul.

790
01:05:22.356 --> 01:05:24.559
But he never gave
my mother or I a dime.

791
01:05:25.693 --> 01:05:27.562
He said money was
the root of all evil.

792
01:05:29.764 --> 01:05:31.733
I was 19 when I enrolled to
study the thing

793
01:05:31.766 --> 01:05:34.067
he would hate the most:
accounting.

794
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:36.470
I would count money

795
01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:38.071
touch money

796
01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:39.239
smell money.

797
01:05:41.442 --> 01:05:43.444
And become the
complete opposite

798
01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:44.546
of what he was:

799
01:05:45.279 --> 01:05:46.246
an artist.

800
01:05:48.616 --> 01:05:51.018
Deep down I hated
my choice too

801
01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:53.588
but the fact that it depressed
and disappointed my father

802
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.690
was reason enough
for it to be worthwhile.

803
01:05:56.624 --> 01:05:59.326
And that's how I ended up
working in a career that I hate

804
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.563
and now my father is dead.

805
01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:04.164
I hadn't accounted on that.

806
01:06:05.199 --> 01:06:09.503
Never do anything for anyone
else for any reason whatsoever!

807
01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:10.404
Never!

808
01:06:12.306 --> 01:06:13.575
You just do you!

809
01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:51.872
When I die. I wanna go
peacefully like my grandad.

810
01:17:52.507 --> 01:17:54.375
Not screaming like
his passengers.

811
01:17:57.311 --> 01:17:59.480
John says to Jack:

812
01:17:59.514 --> 01:18:02.383
You know since yesterday
my uncle rests in peace.

813
01:18:03.284 --> 01:18:04.752
Jack says:

814
01:18:04.785 --> 01:18:06.120
Oh sorry.

815
01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:08.489
I didn't know your uncle died.

816
01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.791
He didn't. it was
my aunt who died.

817
01:18:15.763 --> 01:18:17.398
Two guys meet in heaven

818
01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:19.033
one says to the other:

819
01:18:19.066 --> 01:18:20.734
How did you go?

820
01:18:20.768 --> 01:18:22.369
I froze to death.
said the other

821
01:18:22.403 --> 01:18:23.737
and you?

822
01:18:23.771 --> 01:18:25.039
I died of laughter

823
01:18:25.973 --> 01:18:27.074
Laughter?

824
01:18:27.107 --> 01:18:28.342
What do you mean?

825
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:31.111
Well. I thought my wife
was having an affair

826
01:18:31.145 --> 01:18:32.479
so I left for work

827
01:18:32.514 --> 01:18:35.115
and then returned an
hour later to catch them

828
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:37.519
I searched the whole
house for them

829
01:18:37.552 --> 01:18:39.753
and when I
realized my mistake

830
01:18:39.787 --> 01:18:43.357
I started laughing and
gave myself a heart-attack!

831
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.758
You idiot!

832
01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:46.460
Says the other guy.

833
01:18:46.493 --> 01:18:49.763
If you looked in the freezer
you could have saved us both!

834
01:18:54.235 --> 01:18:54.935
Get it?

835
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:57.972
The lover was
hiding in the freezer!

836
01:18:58.607 --> 01:19:00.508
The other guy was a cuckold!

837
01:19:01.342 --> 01:19:02.943
Just like you!

838
01:19:02.977 --> 01:19:04.144
Why did you say that?

839
01:19:04.178 --> 01:19:06.413
Because you are a cuckold

840
01:19:06.447 --> 01:19:07.848
I'm not a cuckold!

841
01:19:07.881 --> 01:19:10.251
Yes. you're holding
my cock right now.

842
01:19:12.086 --> 01:19:13.454
No I'm not.

843
01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:14.855
Anyway.

844
01:19:14.888 --> 01:19:16.457
I don't know why
I'm arguing with you.

845
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:19.326
I don't know why you've
got your hand up my ass.

846
01:19:21.028 --> 01:19:23.864
Stop it. You know nothing.
You know nothing about Phillipa.

847
01:19:23.897 --> 01:19:24.798
She loves me.

848
01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:26.934
No. you're right.

849
01:19:26.967 --> 01:19:27.935
Of course I don't.

850
01:19:29.136 --> 01:19:31.105
But you remind
me of this guy Dan.

851
01:19:32.239 --> 01:19:34.208
Dan was playing in the casino.

852
01:19:34.241 --> 01:19:36.143
His friend rushes in and says:

853
01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:37.978
Quick. Dan!

854
01:19:38.012 --> 01:19:41.315
Your wife is sleeping with
someone else in the car park.

855
01:19:41.348 --> 01:19:42.883
Dan runs out

856
01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:44.852
comes back ten minutes later.

857
01:19:45.386 --> 01:19:46.820
You idiot!

858
01:19:46.854 --> 01:19:48.255
You scared me!

859
01:19:48.289 --> 01:19:49.890
It wasn't someone else.

860
01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:52.326
It was the same
guy as always.

861
01:19:54.895 --> 01:19:55.896
Cut it out.

862
01:19:55.929 --> 01:19:59.166
Phillipa says: Honey. can
you buy me a cell phone?

863
01:19:59.734 --> 01:20:01.435
What about the other one?

864
01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:03.103
The other one will
get me a tablet.

865
01:20:06.006 --> 01:20:08.309
Hey Brandon.

866
01:20:08.342 --> 01:20:10.377
You know how
Phillipa's nickname

867
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:11.945
is Phil.

868
01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:14.982
Well when she gets a
runny nose from too much sex

869
01:20:15.015 --> 01:20:17.484
the guys all call her Phul!

870
01:20:20.054 --> 01:20:21.288
Hey!

871
01:20:21.322 --> 01:20:23.257
You know what else
they call your wife?

872
01:20:23.290 --> 01:20:25.326
American Flag!

873
01:20:25.359 --> 01:20:27.928
Cause she even gets
planted on the Moon!

874
01:21:48.108 --> 01:21:49.109

Houston. Tranquility Base here.

898
01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:12.606
The Eagle has landed.

899
01:31:39.867 --> 01:31:41.669
Okay. Houston.
we've had a problem here.

900
01:31:42.636 --> 01:31:43.404
This is Houston.

901
01:31:43.437 --> 01:31:44.504
Say again. please.

902
01:31:44.538 --> 01:31:46.207
Uh.

01:31:58.252 --> 01:32:00.187
Needless to say.
they have useful application

904
01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:02.957
in a lot of situations.

905
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:05.059
But when it comes to your skin.

906
01:32:05.092 --> 01:32:07.194
chemicals are
a definitely no-no.

907
01:32:07.228 --> 01:32:09.764
So also bio
food bio beauty products.

908
01:32:09.797 --> 01:32:10.831
Why am I not surprised?

909
01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:15.269
Ok. people listening
to us are probably dying to know more.

910
01:32:15.302 --> 01:32:17.638
So. stop the agony and give me
the cure.

911
01:32:17.671 --> 01:32:21.208
Well.
biological are quiet trendy today.

912
01:32:21.242 --> 01:32:23.878
The beauty and now the help is
we have started to get

913
01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.980
on the bandwagon. saying that

914
01:32:26.013 --> 01:32:29.150
"If people put bio
into their bodies.

915
01:32:29.183 --> 01:32:31.986
Why not put bio
onto their bodies too?"

916
01:32:32.019 --> 01:32:33.687
It's just really stuff.

917
01:32:33.721 --> 01:32:36.090
Yeah.
it's fascinating and also

918
01:32:36.123 --> 01:32:37.758
and now you have authenticity
