00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.375
(were safe and well taken care of throughout the shoot.)

00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.875
He would've used all of his energy even if it killed him.

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.686
So he probably doesn't remember who he is by now.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.819
Zi O. you punk.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.120
He's back.

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:07.929
We're doing our best to bring him in.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.559
Run away.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.025
Don't do it!

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.830
This may be a great opportunity.

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:14.625
You know this is your last chance. don't you?

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.429
Whichever of the two is alive is the murder suspect.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.265
(Previously on "L.U.C.A.: The Beginning")

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.040
We've met. haven't we?

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.139
I remember exactly who you are.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.580
So you'd better remember...

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.809
what happened to my parents.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.179
But he won't die. right?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.080
He can still die if he's in critical condition.

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.015
If he died. bring me his body. In the freshest state possible.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.189
He ran away.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.226
He was dying. but he got up...

00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:47.496
The weak cells probably died. and only the strong cells survived.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.169
I've been waiting for you. What did I do to you?

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.496
I'm the one with questions.

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:28.609
We'll be back. Gu Reum.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.109
Stay home alone for just a little while.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.606
Where are you going?

00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:34.845
We won't take long. It'll take less than an hour.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.705
Let's go eat tonkatsu for lunch.

00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:41.316
Mom.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.955
My baby. let's go eat something more delicious than tonkatsu.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.786
Like what?

00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:51.995
Whatever you want. Your dad will buy it for you.

00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:02.106
We'll see you later.

00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:04.796
Search carefully.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.626
Darn it.

00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:38.865
Guys.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.805
Gu Reum is in trouble.

00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.980
She either got kidnapped or went missing.

00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:46.740
Restrict all the entrances of the adjoining subway stations...

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.279

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.675

00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:27.435
- Move! - Grab one!

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.916
- My gosh! - Hurry!

00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.555
- Let's go! - Move!

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.365
Hurry up!

00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:52.896
Is this really possible?

00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:56.005
No. it's impossible.

00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.570
This is totally insane.

00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:59.106
This is a mixture of everything.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.649
He has the DNA of humans. immortal jellyfish.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.976
electric eels. and even flies.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.315
Do you think this is genome editing?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.115
It's impossible to edit all these genes together at once.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.490
Unless they put all these animals into a blender...

00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:14.089
and combined them all together.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.485
That means they manipulated the germ cells.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.026
Regardless of whether this is possible or not. it's illegal.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.000
What kind of lunatic would do that kind of experiment?

00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:27.935
No one I know of. Except for one person.

00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:30.005
Who?

00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.906
Professor Ryu Jeung Kwon.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.906
"Ryu Jeung Kwon"?

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.976
You mean the guy who lost his one arm?

00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:40.276
- You know him? - Of course.

00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:42.320
He got kicked out of school and arrested...

00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:44.745
because of the genetic modification experiment he did.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.459
Gosh. he's known to be a real psycho in this field.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.825
He's a complete lunatic.

00:07:50.131 --> 00:07:51.526
We went to college together.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.060
He used to be my best friend.

00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:59.296
Oh. I see. I'm sorry.

00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:00.995
You don't need to apologize.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.065
I was the one who told people that he was crazy...

00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.536
and suggested that he should get kicked out of school.

("When Will the Skies Collect Those Who Are Broken Inside?")

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.916
Come on! Hurry!

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.855
Let's get out of here!

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.896
Aren't you hungry?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.725
What? We're all doing this to make a living.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.496
Cut it out. This is serious.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.570
What's more serious than having to eat when you're hungry?

00:09:40.571 --> 00:09:41.705
Hey.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.705
Let's go.

00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:57.886
Everyone makes at least one big mistake in life.

00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.786
For instance. they commit murder. steal. do drugs. or get married.

00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:04.555
But you've already made a big mistake.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.930
You were bound to rot in jail. but I got you out.

00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:08.866
Then you should've made sure not to make another mistake.

00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:10.270
I apologize.

00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:12.670
An apology isn't going to cut it.

00:10:12.671 --> 00:10:13.739
I can find him.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.640
Where? How?

00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:18.065
And don't say you're going to wait until he shows up again.

00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:20.236
He disappeared with...

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.680
the female cop that followed us at the hospital.

00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.709
The cops are probably looking for her.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.646
If we're able to keep track of their investigation records.

00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:28.845
we'll be able to find them before they do.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.020
What if he just left that cop and ran away by himself?

00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.185
If he left her there. she would've gotten hit by the subway.

00:10:37.061 --> 00:10:38.695
But he came and saved her.

00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:41.925
He would've run.

00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:44.225
I've never seen him save someone before.

00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:47.965
I'll get you the investigation records. so find him.

00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:53.675
If you do this right. I'll let you retire.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.805
You can't live here forever.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.675
You should live in a house that has windows and a garden.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.616
You can also get yourself a dog.

00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:05.185
But don't get married.

00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:07.516
It only causes trouble.

00:11:09.191 --> 00:11:12.955
I need to get shots every two weeks anyway.

00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:16.095
I can't leave this place even if I want to.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.595
I'm sure we can find a way.

00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:23.205
If you find Zi O. I'll give you one of his arms.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.605
You know we can transplant his body onto yours.

00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:29.805
Will you really do that for me?

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.175
What would be so difficult about giving you an arm?

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.085
Solving a single problem could lead everything else to fall into place.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.185
Once we take care of this. everything else will be minuscule.

00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:44.085
You'd better catch him this time.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.355
If you fail to catch him again.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.996
it'll make me start questioning your competence.

I tried to stop your bleeding. but I'm not sure if it's healed.

00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:04.605
You hurt your head. Take it easy.

00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:06.876
That's the last thing I'll do with you.

(Handle with care)

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.685
That's enough.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.425
Just tell me what you know about me.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.955
You said you know me.

00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:31.065
If you want to know. you tell me first.

00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:33.296
Tell me what you remember.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.776
Someone collapsed.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.945
I remember saving her.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.756
I think it was you. but I'm not sure.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.090
Thank you for saving my life.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.195
There. You happy?

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.026
What else do you remember?

00:14:01.401 --> 00:14:02.469
I don't remember anything else.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.201
I woke up at the hospital and ran until I got here.

00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:05.335
That's all I remember.

00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:07.296
Who were those guys who chased after you at the subway station?

00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:08.911
- I don't know. - Do you remember...

00:14:08.911 --> 00:14:10.006
falling from the rooftop?

00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:12.406
What about Mr. Kim's death?

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.906
Who's Mr. Kim?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.746
Did you hurt your head?

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.416
Tell me what you know.

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:24.945
Move.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.845
Don't you feel safe enough to tell me now?

(Juan Metropolitan Police Agency)

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.550
I wonder who he was...

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.315
considering they came all the way to the hospital to kill him.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.886
They probably wanted to get rid of the witness of a murder incident.

00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:35.790
But he broke his back.

00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:37.786
How did he suddenly get up and run away?

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.900
Maybe it was someone else's X-ray.

00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:41.430
Maybe he was fine to begin with.

00:15:41.431 --> 00:15:44.095
Sir. aren't you suspicious as well?

00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:47.695
I'm more shocked that people kill their own parents for money.

00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.110
And how could they be cruel enough to kidnap and bury those kids?

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.170
That's what I don't get.

00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:54.006
My gosh. why are you suddenly acting so humane?

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.445
Listen. you punk.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.616
The moment you think it's okay to kill parents and kids.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.945
you lose your right to be human.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.516
I know that.

00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:07.315
But it's weird that you're being like this all of a sudden.

00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:09.256
Are you planning to run for an election?

Shortly after the fire incident was reported.

00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:34.175
a vehicle in the vicinity was reported stolen.

"22G 7801". A silver sedan.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.055
I've put out an APB.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.916
Okay. thanks.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.160
See? It's not like he could've carried Gu Reum on his back.

00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:48.126
He stole a vehicle and managed to escape.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.866
Only seasoned veterans like me can figure out this much.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.736
Well done. Great job.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.736
Now. comb through the CCTV footage and locate that vehicle.

Captain.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.416
Goodness. Can't he get the juniors to do it?

00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:10.390
The police are trying to locate the stolen vehicle now.

00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:11.986

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.955
How can you...

00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:21.055
not remember anything?

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.930
I do remember some things. but I don't know what they are.

00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.640
I don't even know if they're my memories.

00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:26.796
Then...

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.965
how do you remember me?

00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:34.475
I was curious about that too. That's why I saved you.

00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:41.246
Have we met before?

00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:44.885
If there's no one else like you.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.456
then I'm sure it was you.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.069
Hey. turn up the siren...

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.996
if you want to tell the whole world where we're headed.

00:18:23.361 --> 00:18:25.026
When I was 10.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.956
you came to my house.

00:18:29.201 --> 00:18:30.726
Are you sure it was me?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.895
Some kind of blue light beamed out of your eyes.

00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:38.335
What's wrong?

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.976
Don't do that.

00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:42.375
Don't! You're scaring me!

00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.976
Dad! Dad!

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.885
And it attacked me.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.526
Why did I go to your house?

00:19:04.331 --> 00:19:05.895
That's the question I want to ask.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.536
Why you came to my house and where you went after that.

00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:12.276
How could you make me suffer like this...

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.676
my whole life when you only stayed for a day?

00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:31.226
That was the last time I saw you.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.196
And after that.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.095
my parents disappeared.

00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:44.835
I have no recollection of that.

00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:50.105
Not remembering anything doesn't make your past go away.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.176
Do you think I killed them?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.446
You're certainly capable of doing that.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.115
That night.

00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:01.016
I saw an evil monster.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.796
You see. I'm scared of people.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.065
Whenever someone walks up to me. it makes my hair stand on end.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.936
If I were an evil monster. why would I be terrified of people?

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.476
Whether you're evil or not is not up to you to decide.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.610
Hey. let's hurry up.

00:20:24.611 --> 00:20:26.016
Yes. sir.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.855
I'm going to dig through your brain if I have to.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.855
I will do whatever it takes to find out what really happened.

00:20:58.554 --> 00:20:59.750
Someone's here.

00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:02.659
Run. It's him.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.732
Hey. who are you?

00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:26.972
A hitman? A private detective?

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:50.991
Where is he?

00:21:51.827 --> 00:21:54.232
Even if you guys catch him. he'll end up in my hands eventually.

00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:56.232
You cops had better stay out of this.

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:00.932
You little... Who do you think you are?

00:22:16.387 --> 00:22:18.826
- Be careful who you shoot. - Yes. sir.

00:22:18.827 --> 00:22:20.395
- You three. go that way. - Yes. sir.

00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:21.652
We'll go to the second floor.

00:22:21.926 --> 00:22:23.091
Go!

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.902
You'd better stay away from him. He's mine!

00:23:56.857 --> 00:23:58.021
Over here!

00:24:03.966 --> 00:24:05.192
Gu Reum!

00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:10.031
Gu Reum!

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.732
You scumbag!

00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:14.632
Get him!

00:24:20.146 --> 00:24:21.771
Hey! You piece of...

00:24:22.216 --> 00:24:23.712
Go! Get him!

00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:25.851
- Hey. go! - Go!

00:24:27.486 --> 00:24:30.222
Hey. are you all right?

00:24:31.256 --> 00:24:32.495
You're okay. right?

00:24:32.496 --> 00:24:33.922
Stay right here.

00:24:55.117 --> 00:24:57.942
7pm. here.

00:25:18.206 --> 00:25:19.705
He's fast.

00:25:19.706 --> 00:25:21.071
- He's not there? - No.

00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:25.101
Keep looking.

00:25:25.377 --> 00:25:26.511
Yes. sir.

00:25:27.377 --> 00:25:29.241
You go that way.

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:31.541
Hey.

00:25:32.887 --> 00:25:34.182
Are you really okay?

00:25:34.787 --> 00:25:35.882
Yes.

00:25:36.486 --> 00:25:38.482
How did you find me?

00:25:42.696 --> 00:25:43.892
Were you abducted?

00:25:44.327 --> 00:25:46.165
I passed out while fighting on the subway track.

00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:47.766
and this was where I was when I woke up.

00:25:47.767 --> 00:25:48.962
Let's see your arm.

00:25:50.206 --> 00:25:52.061
- What? - Show me your arm.

00:25:59.377 --> 00:26:01.675
- There's no restraint mark. - No.

00:26:01.676 --> 00:26:03.245
How many abducting and kidnapping cases...

00:26:03.246 --> 00:26:05.215
do you think I've worked on over the years?

00:26:05.216 --> 00:26:06.386
Is this a quiz?

00:26:06.387 --> 00:26:09.751
Be it abduction or kidnapping. the victim always says. "Thank you."

00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:12.281
But do you know what the perp says?

00:26:13.797 --> 00:26:16.422
- What? - "How did you find us?"

00:26:17.996 --> 00:26:19.192
And that's what you said.

00:26:22.367 --> 00:26:23.566
Why won't you answer me?

00:26:23.567 --> 00:26:25.301
You majored in talking back.

00:26:26.107 --> 00:26:28.205
- Do you suspect me? - Yes.

00:26:28.206 --> 00:26:30.071
Oh my...

00:26:30.607 --> 00:26:33.172
Are you saying I abducted myself?

00:26:40.017 --> 00:26:41.882
I'm not hiding anything.

00:26:42.857 --> 00:26:44.722
- Are you sure? - Yes.

00:26:44.926 --> 00:26:46.026
Really?

00:26:46.027 --> 00:26:48.791
What about you? Are you hiding something?

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:50.591
- What would I hide? - Well.

00:26:50.827 --> 00:26:52.932
you won't say how you found me.

00:26:54.567 --> 00:26:56.632
Is it a trade secret?

00:27:04.676 --> 00:27:05.975
Something happened. didn't it?

00:27:05.976 --> 00:27:07.642
I don't know. I was unconscious.

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:10.281
Something happened to you. didn't it?

00:27:11.787 --> 00:27:13.251
That's why you keep hiding it.

00:27:15.656 --> 00:27:18.051
I'll get you a female officer to handle it. so tell the truth.

00:27:19.027 --> 00:27:20.321
We'll keep it confidential.

00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:26.132
Seriously. you have one wild imagination.

00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:29.066
- No? - No.

00:27:29.067 --> 00:27:31.662
- I don't think so. - I said no.

00:27:35.537 --> 00:27:36.902
That's a relief then.

00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:42.241
Are you hanging out?

00:27:43.547 --> 00:27:44.682
Are you?

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.712
Did you check every corner?

00:27:47.716 --> 00:27:49.422
We looked everywhere. There's nobody here.

00:27:50.387 --> 00:27:52.482
- No one at all. - Those rats.

00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:57.962
Put out an APB. and let's wrap up.

00:27:58.367 --> 00:27:59.862
- Yes. sir. - Let's go.

00:28:00.236 --> 00:28:01.432
Let's go.

00:28:14.517 --> 00:28:15.912
Are you sure he didn't leave?

00:28:17.746 --> 00:28:19.112
I didn't see him leave.

00:28:25.357 --> 00:28:28.695
Zi O treated that girl?

00:28:28.696 --> 00:28:30.021
It's more than that.

00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:33.162
I felt like he was protecting her.

00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:35.892
If they protect each other.

00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:37.601
they'll definitely meet again.

00:28:40.807 --> 00:28:43.301
Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum. Police Academy grad.

00:28:43.607 --> 00:28:45.645
She was with Major Crimes. but was demoted...

00:28:45.646 --> 00:28:47.546
to Criminal for insubordination.

00:28:47.547 --> 00:28:48.876
(Parents went missing)

00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:51.185
There's nothing unusual except for her parents going missing.

00:28:51.186 --> 00:28:53.751
That's what's unusual. Her father is Ha Young Jae.

00:28:54.617 --> 00:28:55.715
Ha Young Jae?

00:28:55.716 --> 00:28:58.351
The co-founder of this lab and researcher.

00:28:58.587 --> 00:29:00.591
The person who created Z-0.

00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:10.405
If he hadn't taken off with the lab notes and Z-0.

00:29:10.406 --> 00:29:12.402
we wouldn't be in this mess.

00:29:12.607 --> 00:29:14.101
You couldn't catch him back then?

00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:15.831
Is he really missing?

00:29:30.057 --> 00:29:31.751
We have your wife.

00:29:32.656 --> 00:29:34.321
Talk. or she dies.

00:29:36.196 --> 00:29:37.591
Do you want to make your daughter a children's home?

00:29:38.367 --> 00:29:39.632
I wouldn't know.

00:29:40.896 --> 00:29:42.831
He and his wife disappeared.

00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:45.261
Was it Z-0?

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:50.241
It's highly probable.

00:29:52.946 --> 00:29:55.372
I'll take care of the cops.

00:29:56.787 --> 00:29:58.311
so mark the female detective.

00:29:58.686 --> 00:29:59.781
Yes. sir.

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:16.761
(Fire at Subway Station)

00:30:24.762 --> 00:30:29.762
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E03 'L.U.C.A.: The Beginning'</font>

<font color="#ff0080">-â¥ Ruo Xi â¥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

00:30:38.156 --> 00:30:39.622
Can we meet right now?

00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:49.091
Why? Do I look pretty?

00:30:49.337 --> 00:30:50.766
Why do you look so terrible?

00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:52.531
I'm a detective.

00:30:53.277 --> 00:30:54.876
So you should've been more obedient.

00:30:54.877 --> 00:30:56.341
Why are you suffering there?

00:30:56.577 --> 00:30:58.642
It would've been much easier digging into people.

00:30:58.657 --> 00:31:01.025
I wasn't kicked out for being disobedient.

00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:02.162
Then?

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:04.561
I dug into my direct supervisor.

00:31:05.466 --> 00:31:07.366
He was so dirty.

00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:09.202
You kept at it even after you were told to stop. didn't you?

00:31:09.536 --> 00:31:11.831
- Yes. - That's insubordination.

00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:13.841
Did you call me here to scold me?

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:16.442
That too. And to ask for a favor.

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:19.111
A personal favor is fine. but not special treatment.

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.252
Find a person for me.

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:25.455
That sounds like special treatment.

00:31:25.456 --> 00:31:26.782
Remember that guy...

00:31:27.226 --> 00:31:29.551
who was fighting for his life in the hospital. then fled?

00:31:30.796 --> 00:31:33.091
His name was Zi O. I believe?

00:31:34.397 --> 00:31:37.861
I analyzed his DNA. and it was strange.

00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:40.805
In what way?

00:31:40.806 --> 00:31:42.705
I don't know if you'll believe me...

00:31:42.706 --> 00:31:44.301
- I'll believe you. - What?

00:31:45.206 --> 00:31:46.401
Anything.

00:31:48.147 --> 00:31:50.041
It's not very believable.

00:31:50.776 --> 00:31:54.141
but it seems he's human but not human.

00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:55.541
What?

00:31:55.986 --> 00:31:57.212
How do I put it?

00:31:58.357 --> 00:32:00.581
I can't say he's human.

00:32:02.327 --> 00:32:04.955
- A mutant? - No. nothing like that.

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:06.326
Does he have supernatural powers?

00:32:06.327 --> 00:32:09.861
If certain abilities excel. that could be supernatural.

00:32:10.266 --> 00:32:11.891
But we can't tell just from the DNA.

00:32:14.107 --> 00:32:16.131
Then what's weird?

00:32:16.437 --> 00:32:18.371
We need to run tests to figure that out.

00:32:19.647 --> 00:32:21.272
You want me to find Zi O?

00:32:21.607 --> 00:32:24.242
That's your case. so you can handle that.

00:32:24.946 --> 00:32:28.282
Ryu Jeung Kwon. My college friend.

00:32:28.817 --> 00:32:31.116
It should be easy for you to find him.

00:32:31.117 --> 00:32:32.881
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

00:32:33.387 --> 00:32:35.686
- That's why I'm asking you. - Did he go missing?

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:37.295
No one reported him missing.

00:32:37.296 --> 00:32:38.755
He can't be located. is more accurate.

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:40.522
His family didn't report him missing?

00:32:40.867 --> 00:32:43.692
They had cut ties with him.

00:32:44.097 --> 00:32:45.962
so it's understandable.

00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:47.361
What happened?

00:32:47.536 --> 00:32:49.002
During the last association meeting.

00:32:50.306 --> 00:32:52.232
he gave a presentation.

00:32:52.907 --> 00:32:54.472
That caused a bit of a problem.

00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:58.316
Humans realized how unstable they were.

00:32:58.317 --> 00:33:02.512
However. they made the wrong choice in order to overcome that.

00:33:02.817 --> 00:33:05.912
Rather than becoming stronger. they built machines.

00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:09.182
Rather than developing their brains. they built computers.

00:33:09.556 --> 00:33:12.651
Soon. there will come a time when we leave the world to machines.

00:33:13.167 --> 00:33:16.061
and thinking to AI.

00:33:20.006 --> 00:33:23.176
Humans chose technology over evolution.

00:33:23.177 --> 00:33:25.801
The result? Technology is developing.

00:33:26.177 --> 00:33:29.541
but humans are regressing.

00:33:31.117 --> 00:33:34.782
It wasn't the passion of a young scientist. but lunacy.

00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:36.755
He's right though.

00:33:36.756 --> 00:33:38.386
He may be.

00:33:38.387 --> 00:33:40.821
Since some supported him fanatically.

00:33:41.027 --> 00:33:45.792
Humans became the only species to choose to stop evolution.

00:33:45.956 --> 00:33:48.725
Evolution is change. and change is life.

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:50.892
A species that stops evolution becomes extinct.

00:33:51.437 --> 00:33:53.865
In order to prevent the extinction of mankind.

00:33:53.866 --> 00:33:55.836
we must enhance evolution...

00:33:55.837 --> 00:33:57.832
and keep our species alive.

00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:02.042
- He's a psycho. - He has lost his mind.

00:34:02.846 --> 00:34:04.111
He's weird.

00:34:05.976 --> 00:34:07.441
The ethics of research!

00:34:08.487 --> 00:34:12.412
We must realize that we're watching humans regress!

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:16.952
The value of science is not ethics or morals.

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.191
It's taking on new challenges!

00:34:21.766 --> 00:34:23.432
That's nonsense.

00:34:28.806 --> 00:34:30.905
Immediately thereafter.

00:34:30.906 --> 00:34:32.736
the academy asked for my opinion.

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:36.276
I used everything I had to criticize him.

00:34:36.277 --> 00:34:38.475
My report was chosen.

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:41.446
and he was expelled for violating the ethics of research.

00:34:41.447 --> 00:34:42.881
They cut his funding.

00:34:44.056 --> 00:34:47.352
He was arrested a few months later. and then his family left him.

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:49.055
Why was he arrested?

00:34:49.056 --> 00:34:51.626
Embezzling research funds. Trafficking of human eggs...

00:34:51.627 --> 00:34:52.921
and endangered animals.

00:34:53.567 --> 00:34:55.696
He insisted he was innocent.

00:34:55.697 --> 00:34:58.432
but it looked like people wanted him executed.

00:34:58.667 --> 00:35:01.501
Was it that serious?

00:35:03.277 --> 00:35:06.401
For example. what if you merged a human with a dog...

00:35:06.846 --> 00:35:09.401
to create a human with a keen sense of smell?

00:35:10.047 --> 00:35:13.381
What if you mix a human and a bird to create a human that can fly?

00:35:13.516 --> 00:35:14.886
What if you add the fish DNA to a human...

00:35:14.886 --> 00:35:16.711
and a baby with gills is born?

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:19.515
A man who can produce a powerful current like an electric eel...

00:35:19.516 --> 00:35:21.852
or shoots out potent venom like a jellyfish does.

00:35:22.556 --> 00:35:23.651
Can you call that man human?

00:35:24.197 --> 00:35:26.021
What are the boundaries of mankind?

00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:28.461
He didn't stop at just believing in such a possibility.

00:35:30.096 --> 00:35:32.262
Jeung Kwon was actually working on it.

00:35:33.237 --> 00:35:36.202
We kept it from the media because it was so shocking.

00:35:36.306 --> 00:35:39.231
but they seized a chimera when they were searching his lab.

00:35:40.547 --> 00:35:41.972
What is a chimera?

00:35:44.076 --> 00:35:45.972
An organism made up of cells from different animals.

00:35:46.217 --> 00:35:48.012
Human cells could be combined with animal cells.

00:36:01.567 --> 00:36:02.697
That's insane.

00:36:02.697 --> 00:36:03.832
Insane. indeed.

00:36:04.967 --> 00:36:06.932
But he disappeared after he got out of jail.

00:36:07.306 --> 00:36:09.066
Some say he moved abroad. Others say he killed himself.

00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:10.276
There are all these rumors.

00:36:10.277 --> 00:36:12.071
but no one has seen or met him since his release.

00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:16.972
Are you saying Ryu Jeung Kwon created Zi O?

00:36:17.277 --> 00:36:19.885
- It's just my speculation. - But how likely is it?

00:36:19.886 --> 00:36:20.981
Well...

00:36:21.317 --> 00:36:24.555
The recent gene-editing experiment done by China and the US...

00:36:24.556 --> 00:36:26.586
did succeed in producing children who are immune to HIV.

00:36:26.587 --> 00:36:29.486
I'd say it's possible to create any kind of "human".

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:32.026
You can even inject human germ cells into a pig...

00:36:32.027 --> 00:36:34.292
to grow human organs inside it.

00:36:36.226 --> 00:36:38.536
So it's a pig on the outside but a human on the inside?

00:36:38.536 --> 00:36:39.662
Creepy. right?

00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:42.231
They say science has limits. but not its own.

00:36:42.607 --> 00:36:43.705
Then whose limits are they?

00:36:43.706 --> 00:36:45.035
They're imposed by morality.

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:47.901
Scientists aren't allowed to take their experiments further.

00:36:48.377 --> 00:36:49.606
So if they break out of that.

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.776
they can take it further? Is that what you're saying?

00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:55.782
Many scientists want to create new living organisms.

00:36:56.016 --> 00:36:58.782
Let's be honest. Who wouldn't want to be like the Almighty?

00:36:59.087 --> 00:37:00.321
Let's say...

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:02.852
such a creature was born.

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.861
Then can it have the human mind?

00:37:08.197 --> 00:37:09.321
That I don't know.

00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:13.602
But its instincts may supersede its feelings or thoughts...

00:37:13.866 --> 00:37:16.162
because it's partially made up of animal cells.

00:37:18.837 --> 00:37:20.872
Then if such creatures grow in number.

00:37:21.277 --> 00:37:23.776
they'll rule all of us ordinary folks. right?

00:37:23.777 --> 00:37:26.345
This world will not be ruled by the strongest.

00:37:26.346 --> 00:37:29.042
but by those who can quickly adapt to change.

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:31.312
That is why mankind is the ruler of this planet.

00:37:31.417 --> 00:37:34.251
Look at what people are doing. I'm so sick of them.

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:36.481
You find them in every corner of the earth. no matter how remote.

00:37:37.926 --> 00:37:40.021
You can find Jeung Kwon. right?

00:37:42.797 --> 00:37:43.892
I'll do my best.

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:53.845
(Juan Metropolitan Police Agency)

00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:57.345
Kim. who was hit by the cargo train and died on the spot.

00:37:57.346 --> 00:37:59.771
was formerly employed by the military.

00:38:00.246 --> 00:38:02.916
Kim fled while being investigated...

00:38:02.917 --> 00:38:04.981
for military corruption back in 2019.

00:38:05.587 --> 00:38:08.722
Based on his text message which appears to be a suicide note.

00:38:08.826 --> 00:38:10.696
the police are investigating the case.

00:38:10.697 --> 00:38:12.892
weighing the possibility of suicide.

00:38:13.426 --> 00:38:15.896
In the text message. he apologized to...

00:38:15.897 --> 00:38:19.492
Hey. we're the police. Who said this is a suicide case?

00:38:20.036 --> 00:38:22.035
- Since finding this message. - Not me.

00:38:22.036 --> 00:38:24.035
the police have been having a hard time...

00:38:24.036 --> 00:38:25.776
- I didn't say it either. - due to the location...

00:38:25.777 --> 00:38:27.745
Not a single reporter showed up in our office.

00:38:27.746 --> 00:38:29.602
The platform is sealed off at the moment.

00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:33.271
Do they run stories on the news without actually covering them?

00:38:33.987 --> 00:38:37.512
Hold on. We couldn't access Kim's information in the system.

00:38:37.886 --> 00:38:39.912
Who obtained all that info?

00:38:40.257 --> 00:38:42.881
After that. Kim...

00:38:43.257 --> 00:38:46.191
Captain. about the subway station case...

00:38:46.596 --> 00:38:48.361
The reporters somehow know what we didn't even know.

00:38:49.366 --> 00:38:51.396
We can't access the victim's info. We sent in a request.

00:38:51.397 --> 00:38:52.765
but they're ignoring our request.

00:38:52.766 --> 00:38:54.901
Just let it go. The case is being transferred.

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:56.336
What do you mean?

00:38:56.337 --> 00:38:58.801
Zi O's case too. They've been transferred to a different precinct.

00:38:59.277 --> 00:39:00.401
Take your hands off it now.

00:39:01.176 --> 00:39:03.146
What? Murder and kidnapping...

00:39:03.147 --> 00:39:05.341
It's a high-profile case. We can't let them take it from us!

00:39:05.547 --> 00:39:07.312
Who got the case? The Regional Investigation Unit?

00:39:07.547 --> 00:39:08.642
No idea.

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:11.682
I just met with the chief and was told to hand it over.

00:39:11.956 --> 00:39:13.211
Hand over all the reports.

00:39:13.826 --> 00:39:15.151
There's none.

00:39:16.857 --> 00:39:18.452
What report?

00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:20.992
We've just been running around. The investigation hasn't even begun.

00:39:21.797 --> 00:39:23.091
Come in.

00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:27.762
Yes. we're here.

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:29.961
Where's Gu Reum?

00:39:31.437 --> 00:39:33.542
- Is she at the hospital? - I don't know.

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:37.941
She's being treated. She said she'll be here tomorrow.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.211
Eat it.

00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:46.012
I got it for you.

00:41:01.197 --> 00:41:03.591
You said there are some memories engraved in your mind.

00:41:10.607 --> 00:41:11.771
A white room.

00:41:12.237 --> 00:41:13.372
A narrow hallway.

00:41:14.706 --> 00:41:16.242
A kid who looks terrified.

00:41:16.476 --> 00:41:18.771
Curtains on fire. Academy Loan.

00:41:18.947 --> 00:41:20.071
The blue land...

00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:22.042
The wind.

00:41:22.087 --> 00:41:23.711
Lastly. your face and my name.

00:41:25.786 --> 00:41:27.352
Any memories of killing someone?

00:41:38.297 --> 00:41:39.392
I don't know.

00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:43.975
Hey. try to bring back your memories.

00:41:43.976 --> 00:41:45.432
Don't just say that you don't know.

00:41:48.107 --> 00:41:50.216
I do remember waking up after being unconscious for a while.

00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:53.512
Although I don't know whether it's only happened once or more.

00:41:54.116 --> 00:41:56.981
When I wake up. everything's always wiped clean.

00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.555
So when you regain your consciousness.

00:42:00.556 --> 00:42:01.952
you don't remember anything?

00:42:02.487 --> 00:42:03.921
That's right. except for a few things.

00:42:05.826 --> 00:42:07.021
How convenient.

00:42:07.397 --> 00:42:08.966
I wish I could do that too.

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:11.292
Turn my memory on and off.

00:42:11.536 --> 00:42:13.631
Do you know what it's like to start over after everything's wiped out?

00:42:14.437 --> 00:42:15.832
I feel as though...

00:42:17.337 --> 00:42:20.131
I was abandoned without knowing what I used to do and who I am.

00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:23.916
Not knowing what to do because...

00:42:23.917 --> 00:42:26.441
you know nothing about yourself. Do you know what it's like?

00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:30.282
You know what it's like to live in pain all your life?

00:42:31.417 --> 00:42:33.725
My parents. who said we should have tonkatsu for lunch.

00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:35.481
never came back after they left the house with you.

00:42:36.056 --> 00:42:38.251
Are they dead? Are they alive?

00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:39.921
Or...

00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:43.662
did they abandon me?

00:42:43.897 --> 00:42:45.966
Even while praying that they're still alive somewhere.

00:42:45.967 --> 00:42:47.662
I caught myself thinking. "What if they're alive?"

00:42:48.667 --> 00:42:51.631
"If they're alive and well after abandoning me."

00:42:52.806 --> 00:42:53.941
"then what about me?"

00:42:55.947 --> 00:42:58.841
Do you know what it's like to be trapped in that scary thought...

00:42:59.246 --> 00:43:00.341
all your life?

00:43:00.417 --> 00:43:03.142
At least you remember being abandoned. I don't even have that.

00:43:04.587 --> 00:43:06.881
I can't empathize with you because I don't have parents.

00:43:08.386 --> 00:43:10.321
I remember nothing. so I have nothing to tell you.

00:43:12.627 --> 00:43:13.762
I'll get going.

00:43:14.596 --> 00:43:16.091
You grew up in a children's home.

00:43:18.036 --> 00:43:19.231
I'll take you there tomorrow.

00:43:23.136 --> 00:43:24.702
Then we'll find out...

00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:27.501
who abandoned you...

00:43:28.576 --> 00:43:31.542
and whether or not that precedes the day you came to my house.

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.782
I grew up in a children's home?

00:43:38.417 --> 00:43:39.682
Come out when I call you tomorrow.

00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:42.182
Hey.

00:43:45.926 --> 00:43:47.162
Where's the children's home?

00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:48.921
You're curious?

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:50.461
I told you.

00:43:51.697 --> 00:43:53.901
I'll dig through your brain to find out what happened.

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:01.071
What if I refuse to go?

00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:02.671
Then keep living like that.

00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:05.542
Without even knowing who you really are.

00:44:32.406 --> 00:44:33.801
You haven't eaten yet?

00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:39.211
Did you see the news?

00:44:40.587 --> 00:44:42.841
A former soldier accused of corruption died by suicide.

00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:44.881
What a joke.

00:44:46.187 --> 00:44:48.722
You see. even the deceased have a thing called honor.

00:44:50.156 --> 00:44:52.151
To a dead person. that is too much of a luxury.

00:44:52.897 --> 00:44:54.762
What will they say when I die?

00:44:55.527 --> 00:44:57.836
"A former female soldier who made a move on her superior..."

00:44:57.837 --> 00:44:59.292
"to get a promotion dies by suicide."

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:00.861
Something like that?

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:02.631
Just don't die.

00:45:04.107 --> 00:45:05.932
You said we were doing this for our country.

00:45:06.607 --> 00:45:09.341
You roped me into this so I could prove my loyalty to the country.

00:45:09.676 --> 00:45:11.042
Are you sure this is how it's done?

00:45:11.746 --> 00:45:14.441
You see. we're just small fry.

00:45:14.917 --> 00:45:16.941
It's normal that we don't know everything.

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:20.381
Just as ants don't know about space?

00:45:21.226 --> 00:45:23.051
If you don't like it. leave.

00:45:23.226 --> 00:45:24.952
What about this leg?

00:45:25.596 --> 00:45:28.191
It'll rot and fall off without the shots.

00:45:29.366 --> 00:45:32.191
Isn't that why you're obeying with your mouth shut?

00:45:32.467 --> 00:45:33.901
Stop whining.

00:45:34.937 --> 00:45:36.961
Sure. I'm just whining.

00:45:37.007 --> 00:45:39.432
What's the big deal about an arm and a leg?

00:45:39.576 --> 00:45:43.042
But we're doing who-knows-what just to keep them.

00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:49.845
That female cop will get a new cell phone tomorrow.

00:45:49.846 --> 00:45:52.912
They planted a tracker. so keep a close eye on her.

00:46:06.536 --> 00:46:09.001
A half day? Why?

00:46:11.476 --> 00:46:13.135
I got 15 stitches.

00:46:13.136 --> 00:46:17.171
Back in my day. we stapled it and continued working.

00:46:17.676 --> 00:46:19.245
You've got it good.

00:46:19.246 --> 00:46:20.277
That's why people call you...

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:21.385
a "kkondae". condescending older person.

00:46:21.386 --> 00:46:22.546
It's an honor.

00:46:22.547 --> 00:46:25.186
"Kkondae" was added to the British dictionary.

00:46:25.187 --> 00:46:27.352
You mean English dictionary.

00:46:27.687 --> 00:46:28.921
I'm injured.

00:46:30.357 --> 00:46:31.852
What will you do if you leave early?

00:46:32.326 --> 00:46:34.166
- Rest. - Rest and do what?

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:36.066
You used to nag that I didn't rest enough.

00:46:36.067 --> 00:46:37.635
Now. you nag because I want to rest.

00:46:37.636 --> 00:46:38.995
You wouldn't rest even when I told you to.

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.032
So it's suspicious that you suddenly want to.

00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:44.131
Look. I'm injured.

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:46.631
Ouch.

00:46:49.947 --> 00:46:51.142
Who is that?

00:46:52.076 --> 00:46:54.686
- Wait. - Kim Hwang Shik. You recognize him?

00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:56.841
He was in the subway station.

00:46:57.556 --> 00:46:59.381
He committed suicide by jumping in front of a subway.

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:00.722
No way.

00:47:01.357 --> 00:47:02.856
That was an accident.

00:47:02.857 --> 00:47:04.792
If we say it was an accident. we need to explain it.

00:47:05.096 --> 00:47:07.026
Why was he there at that hour?

00:47:07.027 --> 00:47:09.191
Who sent him there? Why?

00:47:09.766 --> 00:47:11.796
But there's no need if we say it was suicide...

00:47:11.797 --> 00:47:13.062
since it's personal.

00:47:13.596 --> 00:47:14.736
Why was it suicide?

00:47:14.737 --> 00:47:16.106
That's what the police announced.

00:47:16.107 --> 00:47:17.606
Which police? This is our case.

00:47:17.607 --> 00:47:19.736
- They did. - "They" who?

00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:22.146
I don't know. We were told to hand it over. and to drop it.

00:47:22.147 --> 00:47:23.946
They didn't say who from which unit was investigating.

00:47:23.947 --> 00:47:25.716
If they took the case. they should tell you...

00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:27.812
who's taking it. where to send what you have...

00:47:34.487 --> 00:47:38.095
This is above lowly cop's paygrade. is that it?

00:47:38.096 --> 00:47:40.251
This punk. Lowly cop?

00:47:40.596 --> 00:47:42.265
We have the right to investigate.

00:47:42.266 --> 00:47:43.865
Then where did this case go?

00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:46.166
I don't know. They said to drop it. so we did.

00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:48.006
- You should as well. - Captain.

00:47:48.007 --> 00:47:49.436
I'm telling you in case you stir up trouble.

00:47:49.437 --> 00:47:52.675
Why are you just taking it without any complaints?

00:47:52.676 --> 00:47:55.345
I did complain. I complained like crazy.

00:47:55.346 --> 00:47:56.446
I mean...

00:47:56.447 --> 00:47:59.071
You were kicked out for insubordination. right?

00:47:59.346 --> 00:48:00.841
For investigating a supervisor.

00:48:01.717 --> 00:48:04.082
You were sent here because you were with Major Crimes.

00:48:04.357 --> 00:48:07.852
Violent Crimes guys like us would've lost our badges.

00:48:08.386 --> 00:48:10.796
So don't stick your nose around after leaving work early.

00:48:10.797 --> 00:48:12.952
Just sit down and rest.

00:48:17.237 --> 00:48:18.961
You have a new phone.

00:48:19.237 --> 00:48:21.631
Submit your old one and go home.

00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:32.341
You found her? Where is she?

00:48:33.147 --> 00:48:34.941
I'll join you guys. so keep me updated.

00:48:55.567 --> 00:48:57.472
Seriously. You rude brat.

00:48:57.976 --> 00:49:00.401
Sit in the front. Do you think you're a chairman?

00:49:15.826 --> 00:49:18.191
Hey. Sit in the back.

00:49:19.197 --> 00:49:21.262
It feels weird sitting side by side.

00:49:28.136 --> 00:49:29.361
Go back.

00:49:30.737 --> 00:49:32.332
Which a children's home?

00:49:33.206 --> 00:49:35.642
You don't remember being in a children's home?

00:49:37.846 --> 00:49:39.472
I've never been to one.

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:45.812
People may lie. but documents never do.

00:49:46.656 --> 00:49:47.921
Sit in the back.

00:49:49.527 --> 00:49:51.492
What does it matter where I sit?

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.392
It's me you hate. not where I sit.

00:49:56.726 --> 00:49:58.032
Want to ride in the trunk?

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:01.562
Let's go.

00:50:46.541 --> 00:50:48.040
How may I help you?

00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:49.676
Well... Just a minute.

00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:55.315
I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum.

00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:57.650
I'm here to see Sister Stella.

00:50:57.651 --> 00:50:59.585
Are you the detective who called?

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.656
She's waiting for you. Please come in.

00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:07.755
I'll ask the questions. You stay quiet.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.476
Sister Stella.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.556
Hello. I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum. I called earlier.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:46.926
I sense very good energy from you.

00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:51.605
Too good for a detective.

00:51:51.941 --> 00:51:55.005
I don't know what brings you here.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:01.076
but since you're here anyway. I'll bless you.

00:52:05.521 --> 00:52:08.585
You seem to be with someone else.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.125
Yes. we came together.

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.826
Bless you.

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.326
Say something.

00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:21.496
Thank you.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.476
She's still at a church.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.906
Is she praying?

00:52:35.651 --> 00:52:37.685
Can I get some sort of a reaction?

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:40.415
Haven't you read her profile?

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.616
She isn't religious.

00:52:46.831 --> 00:52:48.755
I'm looking for someone.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:53.730
It has been a while since we closed the children's home...

00:52:53.731 --> 00:52:56.239
for this and that reason.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.205
So I'm not sure I'll remember.

00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:00.906
For whom are you searching?

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.109
It has been over 20 years.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:08.346
but did you know Jang Jae Woo and Hwang Eun Gyeong?

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.685
I don't know.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.815
(Hwang Eun Gyeong. Missing)

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.355
According to their family. they were a member of his church.

00:53:20.791 --> 00:53:23.900
They left to go to mass that day and went missing.

00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:26.895
I've spent my entire life here.

00:53:27.171 --> 00:53:29.400
If that had happened.

00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:32.366
the police would've come.

00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:37.139
I've never heard of any member of our church going missing.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.210
It was a missing person case. but the police never came?

00:53:40.211 --> 00:53:42.415
Not for that. no.

00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:45.145
Then what for?

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.185
There was...

00:53:50.521 --> 00:53:52.755
a fire in the church.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:56.125
They came for the first time then.

00:53:56.601 --> 00:53:57.696
I see.

00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:04.406
Then do you remember the name Zi O?

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.005
Do you?

00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:12.505
Zi O?

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.346
I remember him.

00:54:17.021 --> 00:54:19.786
How could I forget that name?

00:54:20.791 --> 00:54:22.016
Do you know...

00:54:23.021 --> 00:54:25.786
who dropped him off here?

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.185
No.

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:29.696
He came on his own.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.330
I went out one morning.

00:54:32.331 --> 00:54:34.565
and he was standing by the statue of Virgin Mary.

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:36.996
"Did you come here on your own?"

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:40.266
"Did someone bring you here?"

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:44.335
I kept asking. but he said the same thing.

00:54:44.751 --> 00:54:46.605
Zi O. Zi O.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.746
That became his name.

00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:53.545
Do you remember exactly what date. or what month and year it was?

00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:56.315
I don't remember.

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:58.886
It was so long ago.

00:54:59.231 --> 00:55:03.926
It has been over 20 years.

00:55:05.901 --> 00:55:07.839
Did anyone come to see him...

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.636
or sponsor him at some point?

00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:11.705
Why do you ask?

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.306
What do you want to know?

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.406
I was wondering if there was anyone related to him in some way.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.516
Did he do something wrong?

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.145
No.

00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:29.985
Did someone adopt him?

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:32.926
Yes. there were several.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.996
Was there a man named Ha Young Jae among them?

00:55:39.101 --> 00:55:40.766
Ha Young Jae.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.895
Ha Young Jae.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.306
No.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.806
I've never heard that name before.

00:55:50.441 --> 00:55:52.549
Your memory may be imperfect.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.476
so may I see your documents?

00:55:56.921 --> 00:55:58.116
No.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.185
It's impossible for me not to remember.

00:56:04.691 --> 00:56:07.960
I can't forget a single detail...

00:56:07.961 --> 00:56:10.426
related to that child.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:18.466
Whenever someone took him to adopt him.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.005
they brought him back the day after.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.246
They said they couldn't keep him.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:31.346
They all said that they couldn't raise him for a single day.

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.915
They looked terrified when they brought him.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:37.886
and left as if they were running away.

00:56:39.691 --> 00:56:41.500
So... Sister.

00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:43.156
That's how he was.

00:56:44.731 --> 00:56:46.826
He was too difficult for everyone.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.335
I see.

00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:53.139
- That child... - You don't need to continue.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.266
No.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.176
If you're involved with him. you need to know this.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.375
He set this church on fire.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.045
That's when I hurt my eyes.

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.016
Stay away from him.

00:57:15.561 --> 00:57:19.165
He doesn't remember being here.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.935
He was always like that.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.310
Even after starting the fire.

00:57:29.311 --> 00:57:32.705
he said he didn't remember. and that it wasn't him.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.505
Do you know why?

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.985
- Why? - Inside of him...

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.516
lies a demon.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.230
The demon started the fire.

00:57:45.231 --> 00:57:47.895
and the child didn't remember.

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:49.795
No.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:54.835
That child...

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.935
was a demon.

00:57:59.871 --> 00:58:03.176
He changed faces as needed in the situation.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.976
I didn't start the fire.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.350
I never did that. I've never even been here.

00:58:10.351 --> 00:58:11.886
How could I have started the fire?

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:19.286
Zi O?

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.826
Are you Zi O?

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:27.696
No. It can't be.

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.696
He couldn't come in here.

00:58:35.081 --> 00:58:36.279
No.

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:41.005
If you are that child. you couldn't come in here!

00:58:41.421 --> 00:58:43.576
If I am that child. I'm right here.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:47.645
Your face.

Zi O.

01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:42.235
Is that me?

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.565
Was I that unbearable?

01:00:49.211 --> 01:00:50.435
You're a demon.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:52.906
You are a demon.

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:56.415
You're a demon who should've burned to death before coming here.

01:00:56.751 --> 01:01:00.045
How did you get in here? You're the child of a demon!

It wasn't me.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.806
Do you know how many people you killed?

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.076

I don't know.

01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:09.476
I didn't do it.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.716
I don't know anything.

01:04:17.351 --> 01:04:18.420
I said to stop.

01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:42.605
I knew nothing. but you turned me into a monster.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.446
I was human until you called me a monster.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.645
You're the one who made me a monster.

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:52.645
Go to the fiery pit. you monster.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:55.185

Lead this monster...

01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:01.915

(L.U.C.A.: The Beginning)

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:03.075
I don't want to know more. I'm scared.

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.785
That's the key to finding out who you are.

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:06.890
Can I trust you?

01:07:06.891 --> 01:07:08.455
Please bring Zi O safely.

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:12.186
I can say it for sure not. He isn't human.

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.290
Zi O. right? Zi O?

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:17.029
Someone knows we're together.

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:18.830
It wouldn't be a conspiracy. right?

01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:20.130
Should we run away?

01:07:20.131 --> 01:07:22.670
You were the only person who didn't think I was dangerous.

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:23.766
You were the only one.

01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:26.236
Stop it.

I remember now.
