1
00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:31.285
The year is 2044.

2
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.785
Global population growth
has exploded.

3
00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:57.993
Resources are declining. ???

4
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:03.993
The planet is dying.

5
00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:39.451
So now it's time.

6
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:41.701
Stay there!

7
00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:35.743
Hands up!

8
00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:38.660
- Hands up!
- What in ...

9
00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:42.701
- No. they're not here for you.
- They have no right to be here.

10
00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:47.618
What do you think you ...

11
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.285
Come here.

12
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.243
Come forward with your hands on your head!

13
00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:09.451
Save yourself.

14
00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:14.993
- I'm gonna take you out of here.
- No. just stick.

15
00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:19.201
Please. before ...

16
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.743
Before...

17
00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:26.285
- Stay with me.
- Hands up!

18
00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:21.451
- What in ...
- Good.

19
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.410
You are awake.

20
00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:28.743
- Who the hell are you?
- What do you mean?

21
00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:34.868
- Where am I?
- Do not you remember?

22
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.993
No...

23
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.785
Nothing?

24
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:48.118
Sorry. but I do not know who you are
or how I came here.

25
00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:53.451
I'm Alana.
What is the last thing you remember?

26
00:05:55.618 --> 00:05:59.451
I ... I was in the hospital.

27
00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:01.910
That was a week ago.

28
00:06:03.076 --> 00:06:05.285
- One week?
- Yes.

29
00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:08.493
We took off this morning.

30
00:06:23.326 --> 00:06:25.618
Magnets.

31
00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:39.785
Hello?

32
00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:43.243
There's no one out there.

33
00:06:43.743 --> 00:06:45.910
Hello?

34
00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.785
I told you so.

35
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.118
What is this?

36
00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:56.701
- Do you remember that you were convicted?
- Convicted?

37
00:06:57.118 --> 00:06:59.951
- What are you talking about?
- The trial.

38
00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:03.660
I do not understand anything.

39
00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:19.285
- Checking this door?
- You waffle.

40
00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:21.576
You will not get out of here.

41
00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:31.368
Welcome Isaac Haveloc

42
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:36.201
It was something new.
So there it did not for me.

43
00:07:40.868 --> 00:07:44.868
- What the ...
- Hi. Isaac. My name is Eva.

44
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:48.451
- I'm your emergency assistant.
- Are you a computer?

45
00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:51.118
- Yes.
- Did you say "distress"?

46
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:53.451
And.

47
00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:58.910
- Where are we?
- In your housing capsule ...

48
00:07:58.993 --> 00:08:02.951
about 240 kilometers
above the earth's surface.

49
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.910
- In space?
- Yes.

50
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:27.993
I...

51
00:08:28.618 --> 00:08:33.868
It must be a mistake.
They must have mistaken me for someone else.

52
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:36.535
- Are you not Isaac Havelock?
- Yes. but ...

53
00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:39.951
You were selected as part of the
Samsara program with the goal

54
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.535
to create the earth's first colony 2052.

55
00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:50.951
You leave the Earth's orbit in 11
hours. as soon as the living quarters are docked.

56
00:08:51.035 --> 00:08:53.910
- When do we dock?
- It's already done.

57
00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:56.160
Okay. top ...

58
00:08:56.868 --> 00:09:00.910
- So how can we talk to someone?
- Sorry. but you can not open ...

59
00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:06.285
- the air locks before we docked.
- But you said we just did it!

60
00:09:06.368 --> 00:09:08.618
We are no longer docked.

61
00:09:09.285 --> 00:09:13.660
- Why?
- Sorry. with my systems activated ...

62
00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:18.868
during the emergency release. Therefore. I
can not give you information about the incident.

63
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:22.826
Need? What other need is there
than that we are stuck here ?!

64
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.493
An emergency arose on the ship.
I have no further information.

65
00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:35.160
- So why do I not remember any of this?
- The air pressure in the canister dropped to 15%.

66
00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:40.993
Mild symptoms of hypoxia include
temporary memory loss. motor skills ...

67
00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:43.660
Lack of concentration. poor judgment ...

68
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.618
Do you understand any of this?

69
00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:49.618
I woke up just before you.

70
00:09:51.743 --> 00:09:57.076
So. how can we walk around without ... You know.

71
00:09:57.493 --> 00:10:00.535
- That we do not float around.
- Gravity is regulated ...

72
00:10:00.618 --> 00:10:03.160
using polarized magnets
in the floor and ceiling

73
00:10:03.243 --> 00:10:06.618
and all participants have received
magnetic implants.

74
00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:12.285
- Like I said. magnets.
- Liquids. on the other hand. can flow around freely.

75
00:10:12.368 --> 00:10:17.701
- But the vacuum system causes negatives ...
- Why me?

76
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:22.868
I do not know.

77
00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.451
- What is it?
- Look.

78
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.326
Oh my God...

79
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:58.660
Stop that.

80
00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:13.868
Is that ... or the other ship?

81
00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:17.826
I think that was it.

82
00:11:57.993 --> 00:12:00.160
Breathe.

83
00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:07.326
How can you be so calm?

84
00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:11.535
We're still alive.

85
00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:17.368
- Eva?
- Yes. Isaac?

86
00:12:17.493 --> 00:12:22.035
- Can we communicate with the ship?
- Yes. Isaac. Who would you like to speak to?

87
00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.201
Connect us to ...

88
00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:30.118
- The bridge?
- Yes.

89
00:12:30.826 --> 00:12:33.035
Certainly.

90
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.160
Sorry. the call did not go through.
Do you want to try with the health center?

91
00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:40.868
- Sure.
- The call did not go ahead.

92
00:12:40.951 --> 00:12:44.118
Do you want to ...
- Test everything until someone answers.

93
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.618
Certainly.

94
00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:51.368
Sorry. but all calls failed.

95
00:12:53.993 --> 00:12:57.785
- And on the ground?
- Who do you want to call?

96
00:12:57.868 --> 00:12:59.993
Ground control.

97
00:13:00.076 --> 00:13:02.285
A moment. I'm connecting you now.

98
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.576
- Hello. it's Jane?
- Thank God.

99
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.743
Hi. this is Isaac Havelock.
There has been some kind of ...

100
00:13:10.826 --> 00:13:13.826
- Who do you want to talk to?
- Is it not the ground control?

101
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.243
No. that's the main gear. Should I connect
you to someone on the control team?

102
00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:20.535
- Yes!
- A moment.

103
00:13:20.618 --> 00:13:24.076
- Thanks.
- Sorry. but I can not get hold of anyone.

104
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.493
It's busy down there.
Should I ask someone to come back?

105
00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:33.201
What? No. we need to talk to someone now.
It's about life and death!

106
00:13:33.285 --> 00:13:37.451
Sorry. sir. but it's not possible.
A moment.

107
00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:40.910
- I'm connecting you to someone.
- Hello? Who am I talking to?

108
00:13:40.993 --> 00:13:46.326
Sir. this is Isaac Havelock.
We've gotten away from the mothership.

109
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:52.701
Isaac. There has been an explosion and
we do not know what the status is on Vega 3.

110
00:13:53.743 --> 00:13:56.993
- Hold on. We do everything we can.
- Okay but...

111
00:13:57.076 --> 00:14:01.451
We're not seeing you on the monitor right now.
What do you see outside the window?

112
00:14:42.951 --> 00:14:45.118
Isaac?

113
00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:48.035
Isaac. vakna.

114
00:14:53.243 --> 00:14:55.368
What happened?

115
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.701
Another explosion.

116
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.701
- And the control?
Gone.

117
00:15:06.826 --> 00:15:09.743
You have used
one of your ten calls this month.

118
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.993
Incoming and outgoing calls
are included in the sum.

119
00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:16.243
The calls can be monitored by staff
for violations.

120
00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:19.201
Certainly.
We're lucky if we survive a week.

121
00:15:19.868 --> 00:15:22.076
Collision detection.

122
00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:27.993
- What does it mean?
- That something just hit the ship.

123
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.410
- A pressure drop in the ship has been detected.
- Calm down.

124
00:15:34.035 --> 00:15:38.326
We have to focus.
- Eva. do you know where the leak is?

125
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.785
Unknown.

126
00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:43.576
Liquid flows around in microgravity.

127
00:15:44.785 --> 00:15:48.951
Atmospheric pressure is currently 96 percent
and declining.

128
00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:00.868
- There.
- How do we solve this Eva?

129
00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:04.701
Minor damage to the hull can be repaired
using the emergency repair kit

130
00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:08.410
located under the garden
and the blowtorch located on the wall.

131
00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:34.160
- Eva. how much can it handle?
- Object smaller is 10 mm ...

132
00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:37.410
at a maximum speed of
8.000 meters per second.

133
00:16:40.118 --> 00:16:42.743
That looks bigger than a centimeter.

134
00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:46.618
- Are you okay?
- I met.

135
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:49.993
- A second leak has been discovered.
- It looks much bigger.

136
00:16:53.618 --> 00:16:56.160
Well. at least we did not go down without explaining ourselves first.

137
00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:10.160
Atmospheric pressure stabilized.

138
00:17:29.535 --> 00:17:32.993
- How does it feel?
- It's okay. not too deep.

139
00:17:34.826 --> 00:17:36.993
You were lucky.

140
00:17:37.493 --> 00:17:39.743
Then I want to know what is bad luck.

141
00:17:39.868 --> 00:17:42.285
Incoming calls from the ground control.

142
00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:46.826
- Skill. Haveloc. are you there?
- Hello.

143
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:49.993
- Still there.
- We lost you for a moment.

144
00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:54.160
I have bad news.
The ship is gone.

145
00:17:54.951 --> 00:17:58.576
There may be other survivors.
but we do not know how many right now.

146
00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:01.243
Gone?
- Do you know what happened?

147
00:18:01.368 --> 00:18:04.660
No. we must have slept.

148
00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:07.868
We do not know. How do you get us out of here?

149
00:18:08.326 --> 00:18:11.618
We are working on it. Do not worry.
We'll take you from there.

150
00:18:12.743 --> 00:18:16.410
- Who cares?
- You.

151
00:18:19.368 --> 00:18:23.243
- Hello?
- Your capsule falls out of orbit.

152
00:18:23.326 --> 00:18:26.326
Without an adjustment. you will return
to the Earth's atmosphere.

153
00:18:26.618 --> 00:18:29.535
- That sounds good. doesn't it?
- No. it's not.

154
00:18:29.618 --> 00:18:34.618
We do not know if the capsule will be
able to recover due to the damage.

155
00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:40.410
- Are you still there?
- What do you want us to do?

156
00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:44.076
Wait for instructions.
We are working on it.

157
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.368
- You said that.
- Try to save on air in the meantime.

158
00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:53.618
Do not breathe too deeply or quickly.
Try not to panic.

159
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:57.160
- Call failed.
- Why would we panic?

160
00:18:57.535 --> 00:19:00.826
You have used two
of your ten calls this month.

161
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.076
Both incoming and outgoing calls
are included in the sum.

162
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.035
The calls can be monitored by staff
for violations.

163
00:19:07.118 --> 00:19:10.285
Eva. do me a favor
and do not say it again.

164
00:19:10.368 --> 00:19:12.701
Okej. Isaac.

165
00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:21.535
Why do not you tell?

166
00:19:22.076 --> 00:19:24.410
Excuse?

167
00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:27.826
You're so calm.

168
00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:33.160
Why do I get the feeling
you know something I do not know?

169
00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:38.451
I do not know.
It sounds more like your problem than mine.

170
00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:43.618
Funny.

171
00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:47.076
So what did you do?

172
00:19:51.118 --> 00:19:55.201
Someone did something to me ...
so I did something to him.

173
00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:26.701
- Incomming call.
- Hello. who am I talking to?

174
00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:34.910
- This is Isaac Havelock.
- Hey. Isaac. This is KNL News.

175
00:20:34.993 --> 00:20:41.410
- Are you okay? We heard about an explosion.
- Yes. there is no danger.

176
00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:44.618
- How did you get there?
- We have our sources.

177
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:49.951
So nice to hear. Isaac.
I'm Lucy James. a journalist at KNL.

178
00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:53.785
- Do you want to talk to us live?
- Not directly.

179
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:56.868
- Tops. Isaac. I'll connect you right away.
- But I...

180
00:20:56.951 --> 00:21:00.785
Isaac?
This is Ken Bradley on KNL News.

181
00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:03.243
You are live.

182
00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:08.243
- Hey. Ken.
- Great to hear your voice.

183
00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:12.660
You're the first one we're heard of up there.
Can you tell us what happened?

184
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:16.868
Isaac?

185
00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:19.743
Hello. Isaac?

186
00:21:21.618 --> 00:21:25.826
- Yes. I'm still there.
- Good. Now you're back.

187
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.201
You would tell me what happened.

188
00:21:29.618 --> 00:21:31.951
I was asleep.

189
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.618
And then I woke up
and something had hit the ship.

190
00:21:37.993 --> 00:21:44.285
- And then there was a big explosion.
- It sounds serious.

191
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:49.160
- Do you know how the rest of the crew is doing?
- Unfortunately. I have no idea.

192
00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:55.285
It must be difficult.
Our thoughts are with you right now.

193
00:21:55.451 --> 00:22:03.243
You are incredibly brave. How do you handle
the mental pressure during space travel?

194
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.701
- I can not answer that right now.
- I understand.

195
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.701
And how are you going to solve the problem now?

196
00:22:11.368 --> 00:22:15.368
You know as much as I do. The ground control is
trying to find out the cause ...

197
00:22:15.451 --> 00:22:21.868
- and we hope to hear from them soon.
- Then we leave that. thank you.

198
00:22:22.076 --> 00:22:25.493
- We will hear from you again soon and good luck.
- The call ended.

199
00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:38.660
It was a big mistake.

200
00:22:39.535 --> 00:22:41.868
I remember everything.

201
00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:46.701
Do you?

202
00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:50.201
I had no intention of doing that.

203
00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:56.910
Do what?

204
00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:01.368
I shot one person.

205
00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:05.410
It was not meant to kill him.
but he died.

206
00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:12.285
I've heard it before.

207
00:23:13.951 --> 00:23:16.160
What do you mean?

208
00:23:18.368 --> 00:23:21.243
You do not want to take responsibility
for your actions only.

209
00:23:21.326 --> 00:23:24.160
You are afraid of how others will look at you.

210
00:23:24.743 --> 00:23:27.035
That was really not the point.

211
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:31.910
Does that make you a bad person?

212
00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:35.326
Believe me. I know.

213
00:23:36.035 --> 00:23:38.576
I ... What?

214
00:23:40.035 --> 00:23:42.243
Why do you think I'm here?

215
00:23:43.118 --> 00:23:46.160
We are just criminals in their eyes.

216
00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:54.785
They usually differ between men and women.
so why are we here together?

217
00:24:09.118 --> 00:24:11.201
Is it not obvious?

218
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.243
Well ... It does not happen.

219
00:24:24.285 --> 00:24:26.660
Do you not think I'm attractive?

220
00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:30.660
Yes. I think
you're very attractive.

221
00:24:32.076 --> 00:24:34.326
But I'm already with someone.

222
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.035
Oh really?

223
00:24:42.243 --> 00:24:44.535
Look around. Isaac.

224
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.701
You may change.

225
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.118
Do not worry. I'm just messing with you.

226
00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:23.826
Are you going to tell me what you did?

227
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.618
Maybe later.

228
00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:21.910
So. Chris ...
What's the latest developments?

229
00:26:23.076 --> 00:26:25.326
Not much right now.

230
00:26:25.493 --> 00:26:28.552
All we have is an official statement
that an incident has occurred.

231
00:26:28.576 --> 00:26:31.785
And that they are working on it
and the condition of the crew.

232
00:26:31.868 --> 00:26:39.076
Well ... we stay updated.
If you told me ten years ago

233
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.201
that we would send prisoners into space
. I had said you were crazy.

234
00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:48.285
What do you think about it?
Was that a bad idea?

235
00:26:48.368 --> 00:26:54.785
This has never been said. How we treat
our prisoners reflects our society.

236
00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:58.951
And our prisons are full.
The condition is deplorable ...

237
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:04.785
and by and large.
global population growth has exploded.

238
00:27:04.868 --> 00:27:08.910
The climate is catastrophic
and the earth is in a state of rebellion.

239
00:27:08.993 --> 00:27:12.535
We must colonize other planets
to survive.

240
00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:16.118
so based on this. you do not think
it creates a meaning in the lives of prisoners

241
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:21.618
which would otherwise have been spent in a cramped
cell? It is an important and noble purpose.

242
00:27:21.701 --> 00:27:25.410
- That is why the program is very important.
- But they did not choose it themselves.

243
00:27:25.493 --> 00:27:28.826
And it's incredibly risky
considering what happened.

244
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:34.535
If our handling of prisoners
reflects our compassion ...

245
00:27:34.618 --> 00:27:37.993
- Is not that a negative reflection?
- There are lots of people ...

246
00:27:38.076 --> 00:27:43.076
who would do anything to get into
space. An opportunity worth dying for.

247
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.201
You almost convinced me there.

248
00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:50.743
But let's ask the following question.
Why was it done in secret ...

249
00:27:50.826 --> 00:27:56.910
and why was no consent given
and why do we hear about the accident only now?

250
00:27:56.993 --> 00:28:02.118
The Ministry of Justice said this morning
that they have specifically chosen prisoners

251
00:28:02.201 --> 00:28:07.618
which was quote:
"psychologically suitable" for the mission.

252
00:28:07.701 --> 00:28:11.951
And the legal system was the ideal place
to get hold of many applicants

253
00:28:12.035 --> 00:28:16.993
with the right conditions. I guess that
means they lack ties.

254
00:28:17.076 --> 00:28:19.743
Sure. I hear you.

255
00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:24.618
And now for a news update.
Billionaire and inventor Robert Themis

256
00:28:24.701 --> 00:28:30.868
and his company Hyperion offer help
rescuing the stranded crew.

257
00:28:31.826 --> 00:28:36.868
Mr Themis. in your post you said that
your company wants to help and is ready.

258
00:28:36.951 --> 00:28:41.285
- What exactly did you mean by that?
- We have developed rescue capsules ...

259
00:28:41.368 --> 00:28:46.118
for exactly this situation for NASA
and we have an unmanned capsule ready.

260
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:49.660
We can go up there with a pilot
and take them safely home to earth again.

261
00:28:49.743 --> 00:28:52.368
And you have enough
for all the survivors?

262
00:28:52.451 --> 00:28:56.826
It holds two. but we can only
dock one craft per trip

263
00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.243
so we have to do it in batches. which
can take many days or many at a time.

264
00:29:01.326 --> 00:29:04.743
- How many do you have exactly?
- We have several pieces.

265
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:09.160
Some claim that this is
another PR trick. Mr Themis.

266
00:29:09.243 --> 00:29:13.535
- Is it true?
- No. Thank you for your time.

267
00:29:30.035 --> 00:29:34.410
I'm sorry. but you spent
your 30 minutes of TV time today.

268
00:29:34.493 --> 00:29:37.660
Too much television is bad for your health.

269
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.910
Who cares about the news?
Money. death. the environment. blah blah blah.

270
00:29:43.993 --> 00:29:46.285
Incomming call.

271
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.701
- Skill. Havelock. that's the control.
- Finally.

272
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.743
Havelock. what was that?

273
00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:57.076
- Excuse me?
- I told you so.

274
00:29:57.993 --> 00:30:02.160
Why did you talk to the media?
That was really stupid.

275
00:30:02.243 --> 00:30:04.535
Are you kidding me?

276
00:30:04.618 --> 00:30:09.785
We're about to die in a box and you'll lecture
me on my conversation with the media?

277
00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:13.743
We're trying to find out what happened.
This is an ongoing situation and ...

278
00:30:13.826 --> 00:30:20.160
Who are you really ?! Is it just
a media image? Do you care about us ?!

279
00:30:21.951 --> 00:30:24.660
Do you even listen to me ?!

280
00:30:27.493 --> 00:30:29.910
What a mood.

281
00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:34.701
Isaac. I'm sorry. We are
in a crisis and the stress level is high.

282
00:30:34.785 --> 00:30:39.451
Let's start over. We need to
control what the public gets to know

283
00:30:39.535 --> 00:30:42.285
to protect the
families of the crew members.

284
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.535
- OK. I understand.
- Thank you. Isaac.

285
00:30:54.743 --> 00:30:59.076
- So what do we do now?
- The reason I called ...

286
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.243
is that it is of the utmost importance that
we get you back into orbit.

287
00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:05.035
Not just for you.
but for the people on the ground.

288
00:31:05.118 --> 00:31:07.951
The capsule will probably not break
in the atmosphere.

289
00:31:08.035 --> 00:31:12.201
It is designed to withstand
an emergency and has parachutes.

290
00:31:12.285 --> 00:31:15.951
But we do not know the status of
your heat shields after the explosion

291
00:31:16.035 --> 00:31:19.826
and anyway we have to
check the angle of the return.

292
00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.368
- Okay. so what should we do?
- Listen carefully.

293
00:31:23.451 --> 00:31:27.701
We will explain how to manually
get the canister back into orbit.

294
00:31:28.285 --> 00:31:31.743
- We are listening.
- Good. do you see the control panel?

295
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.451
- Yes.
- Good. Go ahead and start it.

296
00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:39.743
Leta fram "system".

297
00:31:41.493 --> 00:31:43.743
- Yep.
- "Advanced".

298
00:31:44.076 --> 00:31:46.743
- Ja.
- "Drivkraftskontroll".

299
00:31:47.701 --> 00:31:50.618
- "Manual override".
- Okay.

300
00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:57.285
You must enter the following code:
VCYD-1-9.

301
00:31:58.076 --> 00:32:01.201
- Okay. of course.
- Now you open "Propulsion Vector Course" ...

302
00:32:01.285 --> 00:32:05.951
and enter the following commands.
At height. enter "negative 11".

303
00:32:06.035 --> 00:32:10.910
In seconds. "4".
On energy. turn "80%".

304
00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:16.243
- Fixed.
- Okay. wait for the start in 10 seconds.

305
00:32:16.576 --> 00:32:22.785
10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5...

306
00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:26.951
4. 3. 2. 1...

307
00:32:43.368 --> 00:32:45.660
Incomming call.

308
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.076
- Havelock. Skill.
- Ja?

309
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.951
I see that the ignition went well. Nicely
done. Sorry we lost you for a while

310
00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:58.660
but you did a great job
and you're in a good place right now.

311
00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:01.118
- Thanks.
- How is it going?

312
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.035
- Hello. can you hear me?
- Yes. we hear you.

313
00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:10.618
- We do not know what to say only.
- I get it. it must be tough.

314
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:15.368
Do not worry. We do everything we can.
We have full activity here right now.

315
00:33:15.451 --> 00:33:18.785
We have people from the night shift.
so we are twice as many as usual.

316
00:33:18.868 --> 00:33:24.618
Even people from NASA and the military.
The smartest brains in the world.

317
00:33:24.701 --> 00:33:28.993
Exactly what is the problem?
Can't we just use the parachutes

318
00:33:29.076 --> 00:33:31.493
so you pick us up in the sea?

319
00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:35.201
Right now we can not risk anything
until we know everything.

320
00:33:35.285 --> 00:33:40.285
I'm neither a technician nor an engineer.
but a doctor. Your health is my priority.

321
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:46.993
- So you're a doctor? Specialized in what?
- Psychology actually.

322
00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:50.785
But I have a general medical education
that can be applied to space travel.

323
00:33:50.868 --> 00:33:57.368
Let's change the subject. Do any of you have a
partner at home? Girlfriend. boyfriend?

324
00:33:57.826 --> 00:33:59.910
- No.
- No longer.

325
00:33:59.993 --> 00:34:03.493
- Children?
- No.

326
00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:06.201
- Close friends?
- Not directly.

327
00:34:06.285 --> 00:34:08.368
- No.
- Family?

328
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:15.576
- What is this? Is it an evaluation?
- Do you have a girlfriend / boyfriend / family?

329
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.576
Well ... Not right away. No.

330
00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:23.076
- But you have a family.
- Yes.

331
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.285
- Are you reading this from a paper?
- Forgive me.

332
00:34:28.618 --> 00:34:31.285
- I would like to ask you for a favor.
- What?

333
00:34:31.368 --> 00:34:34.368
Can you tell us more
about what happened up there?

334
00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:41.868
No. we have already answered that. We want to
know what you are doing to get us out of here.

335
00:34:41.951 --> 00:34:44.910
It can help us.
Not just answering the same questions.

336
00:34:44.993 --> 00:34:47.743
I know. we are working on it.
So does the entire control room

337
00:34:47.826 --> 00:34:52.576
but this can make things easier.
What happened up there? You must know something.

338
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.118
We were both put to sleep.

339
00:34:55.201 --> 00:34:58.285
- What?
- Who woke up first?

340
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.951
- Isaac.
- No. you woke up first.

341
00:35:03.035 --> 00:35:07.701
And why do you say we were anesthetized?
I thought it was a lack of oxygen.

342
00:35:07.785 --> 00:35:11.035
Everyone is put to sleep at the start
until they reach the mothership.

343
00:35:11.118 --> 00:35:13.493
It keeps stress levels down.

344
00:35:15.785 --> 00:35:21.076
- Hello?
- The capsule passes just behind the earth.

345
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.910
- The top.
- Energy levels are low.

346
00:35:24.993 --> 00:35:29.910
They are recharged by the solar panels.
but you are in the shadow of the earth for 45 minutes.

347
00:35:29.993 --> 00:35:34.618
- Which means?
- That we can lose touch for a while.

348
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:37.576
Sleep a little.

349
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.910
- See ya.
- The call ended.

350
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:10.285
Why did you lie to them?

351
00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:19.826
I did not. You woke up first.

352
00:36:25.451 --> 00:36:27.743
But that's not true.

353
00:36:28.535 --> 00:36:30.910
Yes. it does.

354
00:36:33.076 --> 00:36:37.076
Warning. energy level of 7 percent
and falling.

355
00:36:42.118 --> 00:36:46.701
- What happens if we lose energy?
Light. heat. voice assistance ...

356
00:36:46.785 --> 00:36:49.618
communication
and drive capacity cease.

357
00:36:49.701 --> 00:36:53.701
Gravity and lifesaving systems switch
to reserve energy.

358
00:36:54.618 --> 00:36:58.243
- Is there anything we can do?
- No.

359
00:36:58.326 --> 00:37:00.826
Then I go to bed.

360
00:37:01.993 --> 00:37:05.701
- Eva. turn off the light.
- Sure. Isaac.

361
00:39:12.535 --> 00:39:15.201
Incoming calls from the ground control.

362
00:39:15.285 --> 00:39:17.826
Skill. Havelock. can you hear us?

363
00:39:26.326 --> 00:39:29.160
Hello? We are waiting for an answer.

364
00:39:35.743 --> 00:39:38.785
Alana? Isaac? Can you hear us?

365
00:39:49.743 --> 00:39:52.285
A corner? Are you there?

366
00:39:54.451 --> 00:39:56.743
Corner.

367
00:40:00.326 --> 00:40:03.743
Capsule 471. please wake the passengers.

368
00:40:05.785 --> 00:40:08.410
Isaac? Alana?

369
00:40:09.493 --> 00:40:11.743
Ground control rings.

370
00:40:14.618 --> 00:40:16.993
Can you hear us?

371
00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:22.701
Yep.

372
00:40:22.785 --> 00:40:26.576
- We are probably still there.
- We thought we lost you.

373
00:40:28.368 --> 00:40:32.576
- It is so cold.
- It could be an energy fault on board ...

374
00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.535
for the batteries
should have survived in the dark.

375
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:41.493
They should be charged in the sunlight.
but there will be another in 40 minutes

376
00:40:41.576 --> 00:40:44.451
so we should expect
it to happen again.

377
00:40:44.535 --> 00:40:46.993
I just want to go home.

378
00:40:47.076 --> 00:40:50.910
- Do you have any plans to get us home yet?
- We're working on it. Isaac.

379
00:40:50.993 --> 00:40:54.493
Come on. it's been several hours.
You should have a plan by now.

380
00:40:54.576 --> 00:40:58.910
We're close. Isaac. Only a few details
left. I'll get back to you soon.

381
00:40:58.993 --> 00:41:01.243
The call ended.

382
00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:10.326
Alana?

383
00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:13.951
- What?
- Are you awake?

384
00:41:14.326 --> 00:41:16.535
I never slept.

385
00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:39.868
- Incomming call.
- Isaac. it's KLN News again.

386
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:42.826
- Sorry. but I'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Of course.

387
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:46.535
- And why not. Isaac?
- The control has instructed me ...

388
00:41:46.618 --> 00:41:49.993
to protect the families
of the crew on board.

389
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:54.993
- You were in the army. right. Isaac?
- I do not want to talk about it.

390
00:41:55.076 --> 00:41:58.410
I would not have done that if I
were you. but we know it now.

391
00:41:58.493 --> 00:42:03.701
Do you want to tell our listeners
what you did before you left?

392
00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:07.243
- Not directly. Protects my privacy.
- No sorry.

393
00:42:07.326 --> 00:42:12.701
It is funded by the taxpayers.
Do you deny that you killed a human ...

394
00:42:12.785 --> 00:42:15.076
- after you left the army?
- Who told you that?

395
00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:20.618
Answer the question. Mr Havelock. Did you
kill or did you not kill a human being?

396
00:42:23.951 --> 00:42:28.243
- I shot a person. yes. but ...
- Exactly. good. Now we're going somewhere.

397
00:42:28.993 --> 00:42:32.868
So how can we trust you
when you have committed such a serious crime?

398
00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:35.088
You're not up here.
so you do not have to worry.

399
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.701
You may be rude. Mr Havelock.
but that does not make you more popular.

400
00:42:39.785 --> 00:42:43.576
You killed a human being
and you do not seem very remorseful.

401
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.201
The public wants to know why.
Why should you be saved?

402
00:42:48.285 --> 00:42:52.618
The real question is whether it is right to
send people into space against their will.

403
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:55.451
We abolished the death penalty
several years ago.

404
00:42:55.535 --> 00:43:00.368
No. it's not.
The question is. given that you

405
00:43:00.451 --> 00:43:06.618
are the only survivors we know. and you
had a motive and have killed before ...

406
00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:12.576
Did you have anything to do with the explosion that killed
all these people?

407
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.410
How dare you? We are stuck up here with a
small chance to come alive from here

408
00:43:17.493 --> 00:43:21.136
and you're spreading rumors that
I've murdered all these people!

409
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.701
What kind of sick person are you?

410
00:43:23.785 --> 00:43:27.493
Sorry. Mr Havelock. but that's your
opinion. Good luck anyway.

411
00:43:27.576 --> 00:43:31.035
Time to answer some questions from the listeners.
- Kevin?

412
00:43:31.201 --> 00:43:33.576
The call ended.

413
00:43:36.868 --> 00:43:39.243
What did you expect?

414
00:43:44.868 --> 00:43:47.868
- I actually see it in front of me.
- What ?!

415
00:43:48.868 --> 00:43:50.993
That you're killing someone.

416
00:43:52.535 --> 00:43:54.868
I'm not like you.

417
00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:00.410
Of course you are. We are the same as you and me.
What do you think you're doing here?

418
00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:02.701
Shut up!

419
00:44:05.868 --> 00:44:08.035
Are you going to force me?

420
00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:17.243
- So you're a former soldier?
- Do not talk to me.

421
00:44:24.285 --> 00:44:26.451
I am interested.

422
00:44:29.243 --> 00:44:31.410
You say that?

423
00:44:32.576 --> 00:44:34.826
So what happened?

424
00:44:40.826 --> 00:44:43.285
Clara was a gambling addict.

425
00:44:44.493 --> 00:44:46.743
Is Clara your bride?

426
00:44:51.368 --> 00:44:54.201
She borrowed money from
a guy I used to work with.

427
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.535
A former soldier.

428
00:45:00.076 --> 00:45:02.910
No one wanted to mess with.
he had a reputation.

429
00:45:05.243 --> 00:45:08.910
He threatened her. so I sent
her away until things calmed down.

430
00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:16.118
And I agreed to work for him
to pay off the debt.

431
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:21.410
It suited him to
let me beat different players.

432
00:45:23.201 --> 00:45:26.993
I knew he would never let
us go. so one day I said I was done.

433
00:45:27.076 --> 00:45:29.201
"Fuck off."

434
00:45:30.326 --> 00:45:32.660
And it was quiet for a while ...

435
00:45:35.076 --> 00:45:37.368
but not for very long.

436
00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:08.951
You know why I'm here.
And you know what you have to do.

437
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.576
I can not. I'm paying him.
I promised to pay him.

438
00:46:15.826 --> 00:46:17.910
It's too late now.

439
00:46:20.826 --> 00:46:22.993
Take it up.

440
00:46:30.285 --> 00:46:36.535
We know where you're hiding her.
So you go now or she's dying.

441
00:46:40.451 --> 00:46:42.826
We're there at three.

442
00:47:38.368 --> 00:47:40.451
Do you have them?

443
00:47:50.118 --> 00:47:52.493
You're shaking.

444
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.993
Do you have the money?

445
00:47:57.951 --> 00:48:00.035
Yes I have.

446
00:48:00.743 --> 00:48:03.076
- Have you?
- No.

447
00:48:07.868 --> 00:48:10.160
I can not let you go.

448
00:48:21.493 --> 00:48:23.785
You do it for him.

449
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.076
Not for him.

450
00:48:27.535 --> 00:48:31.410
- They're sending you away for this.
- It's just a flesh wound.

451
00:48:31.493 --> 00:48:35.451
I've seen many.
Put a bandage on it. You'll be alright.

452
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.201
The prisoner gets up.

453
00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:00.410
Isaac Havelock.

454
00:49:00.493 --> 00:49:06.160
You have been convicted
of the murder of Richard Adams.

455
00:49:06.243 --> 00:49:11.826
on April 14. 2044.
a violation of the law.

456
00:49:12.951 --> 00:49:15.868
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
You have stated as mitigating circumstances

457
00:49:15.951 --> 00:49:20.493
that you were forced into this robbery
by a third party.

458
00:49:20.576 --> 00:49:28.826
During the robbery. Mr. Adams did not follow
an instruction and became threatening to you.

459
00:49:29.701 --> 00:49:35.535
You then shot him in self-defense.
Do you stand by this statement?

460
00:49:35.618 --> 00:49:38.868
- Yes. but I did not kill him.
- Well.

461
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:45.410
This court acknowledges that
this was not a planned crime.

462
00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:53.201
And that you have shown remorse. but
do not accept your appeal for self-defense.

463
00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:56.910
then no weapon was found
at Mr Adam's body.

464
00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:59.826
But it was there.
Someone must have moved it.

465
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:03.410
Tig. mr Havelock.

466
00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:15.410
The court is
considering your brilliant military career and has considered it

467
00:50:15.493 --> 00:50:23.285
the mitigating factors. The court
therefore offers you a second chance

468
00:50:23.368 --> 00:50:27.035
and you are judged accordingly.

469
00:50:27.618 --> 00:50:34.118
Isaac Havelock. you are taken from this
court and sent to the colonies.

470
00:50:34.201 --> 00:50:39.868
- There you will have to serve your sentence.
- Please ...

471
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:42.076
Tig!

472
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.368
Take away the prisoner.

473
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:31.035
Do you want sympathy?

474
00:51:32.535 --> 00:51:34.951
No.

475
00:51:35.618 --> 00:51:37.910
Bra.

476
00:52:09.576 --> 00:52:11.660
A personal conversation?

477
00:52:12.493 --> 00:52:14.576
Yes. if it's okay.

478
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.576
Hi. this is Clara. leave a message.

479
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.951
Shit too.

480
00:52:40.326 --> 00:52:42.743
Hi Clara. this is Isaac.

481
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:46.576
I'm sorry we did not talk.

482
00:52:47.618 --> 00:52:49.785
You probably think I just pulled.

483
00:52:50.576 --> 00:52:52.743
But I promise it was not so.

484
00:52:56.785 --> 00:53:01.076
They threatened to hurt you and I did not
want anything terrible to happen to you.

485
00:53:03.035 --> 00:53:06.118
I was arrested
and sentenced to the colony.

486
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:14.076
Something terrible happened.

487
00:53:16.368 --> 00:53:21.368
- I just want to know that you're fine.
- Isaac. I'm here. Everything is fine with me.

488
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:26.660
Hi. How nice to hear your voice.

489
00:53:26.993 --> 00:53:30.285
I've seen everything on the news.
They said you volunteered.

490
00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:37.910
It's not true. No one wonders how
70 volunteers might want to take a single trip?

491
00:53:38.076 --> 00:53:40.743
- Did not they?
- No.

492
00:53:43.618 --> 00:53:45.785
Did you kill that man?

493
00:53:48.035 --> 00:53:51.618
I shot him
for a pissed off portfolio.

494
00:53:52.493 --> 00:53:54.826
But it was not meant to kill him.

495
00:53:55.285 --> 00:53:57.618
I wish you had not done that.

496
00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.993
Me too.

497
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.910
But I would do it again
if I had to.

498
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.826
What was in the portfolio?

499
00:54:08.618 --> 00:54:14.410
- Does it matter?
- No. it does not.

500
00:54:15.701 --> 00:54:21.035
One positive thing if I do not come back
is that no one needs to do it again.

501
00:54:21.535 --> 00:54:26.160
- It's not funny.
- It was money. if it matters.

502
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:30.285
Oh ... To pay the debt?

503
00:54:31.243 --> 00:54:33.618
Did you never wonder?

504
00:54:33.701 --> 00:54:36.076
I...

505
00:54:36.243 --> 00:54:38.993
I understood that
it had to do with you.

506
00:54:43.576 --> 00:54:45.743
I just...

507
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:51.576
I feel so guilty. Tell me what I
can do. and I'll call someone or ...

508
00:54:51.743 --> 00:54:54.285
- I do not know ...
- Do not.

509
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:59.826
- I'm where I should be.
- Please. Isaac.

510
00:55:00.826 --> 00:55:04.576
Hold on while they solve it.

511
00:55:05.493 --> 00:55:07.826
Listen to me.

512
00:55:10.368 --> 00:55:13.618
- I'm so glad I met you.
- The same.

513
00:55:16.493 --> 00:55:19.868
- So we'll hear from you again soon?
- Of course.

514
00:55:20.535 --> 00:55:22.660
I love you.

515
00:55:23.618 --> 00:55:25.910
Bye.

516
00:55:29.493 --> 00:55:31.660
Cute.

517
00:55:32.535 --> 00:55:34.743
So that was your girl?

518
00:55:47.035 --> 00:55:49.326
You know a lot about me ...

519
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:52.118
but I know nothing about you.

520
00:55:54.535 --> 00:55:58.285
- What do you mean?
- You've been lying all along. haven't you?

521
00:55:59.243 --> 00:56:02.868
Have you told anything that is true?
Were you even assaulted?

522
00:56:02.951 --> 00:56:05.951
- Yes.
- Should they have sent you here ...

523
00:56:06.035 --> 00:56:08.368
for self-defense?

524
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.951
Not directly.

525
00:56:12.868 --> 00:56:15.035
If so. what?

526
00:56:15.576 --> 00:56:17.993
Why are you really here?

527
00:56:20.743 --> 00:56:23.451
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

528
00:56:30.993 --> 00:56:33.368
I'm an addict.

529
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.118
Where do addicts end up?

530
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.326
Where do you think you're going?

531
00:56:59.785 --> 00:57:03.035
- Do not kill me.
- Go away.

532
00:57:13.868 --> 00:57:16.076
Hi buddy.

533
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:31.410
Come on.

534
00:57:40.285 --> 00:57:42.660
It was because you blew me away.

535
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:53.660
Damn crap.

536
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.451
So you killed four people
because you did not like their drugs?

537
00:58:05.285 --> 00:58:08.910
- You killed someone for a briefcase.
- I did not kill him.

538
00:58:09.493 --> 00:58:12.660
Shitty. He died. after all.

539
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:17.535
You're a soldier. so you know how it feels.

540
00:58:23.076 --> 00:58:28.785
Killing is my drug. No one will
miss them. they were addicts.

541
00:58:28.951 --> 00:58:31.368
Do you mean that you liked it?

542
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:38.035
- Did not you?
- No.

543
00:58:41.076 --> 00:58:45.118
It is the best drug.
You know it is.

544
00:58:46.618 --> 00:58:48.993
It is most addictive.

545
00:58:52.035 --> 00:58:55.201
You do not want to admit it.
because you're afraid of me.

546
00:58:55.285 --> 00:58:57.618
I am not scared of you.

547
00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:00.993
Of course you are.

548
00:59:04.076 --> 00:59:06.910
You can continue to lie to yourself
if you want to ...

549
00:59:07.993 --> 00:59:11.410
but I know you got a kick out
of killing those people.

550
00:59:12.035 --> 00:59:15.868
You're just afraid you would be like me
if you admitted it to yourself.

551
00:59:16.868 --> 00:59:23.410
The truth is. you're already like me.
We both killed ... and we liked it.

552
00:59:25.618 --> 00:59:27.910
We are the same as you and me.

553
00:59:29.951 --> 00:59:32.118
If you say so.

554
00:59:49.618 --> 00:59:53.701
- Incoming calls from the control.
- Skill. Havelock. are you there?

555
00:59:53.868 --> 00:59:57.785
- Where else would we be?
- We are almost ready for your return trip.

556
00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:00.285
It's just a problem.

557
01:00:00.785 --> 01:00:04.451
We know that one of you boarded
the ship before the explosion.

558
01:00:05.243 --> 01:00:08.493
- Let me go!
- What are you doing?

559
01:00:09.826 --> 01:00:14.868
Please stop! Leave me alone!

560
01:00:15.576 --> 01:00:19.410
- Stay away from each other.
- I'm not even near her.

561
01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:23.618
He did it! He blew up the ship
and now he's trying to kill me ...

562
01:00:23.701 --> 01:00:26.576
- to silence me.
- She's lying. do not listen to her.

563
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.993
- It's true.
- Alana. are you okay?

564
01:00:30.076 --> 01:00:33.035
- Please!
- One more word and I swear ...

565
01:00:33.826 --> 01:00:37.326
Please! Why did you put me in the same cell
as this monster?

566
01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.951
- You're the monster.
- Isaac. if something happens to her ...

567
01:00:40.035 --> 01:00:43.243
we cancel the rescue attempt.
Is that understood?

568
01:00:43.326 --> 01:00:45.785
- Yes.
- The call ended.

569
01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:53.160
- What did you do? You just put me there.
- It was not difficult.

570
01:00:53.243 --> 01:00:55.493
Why?

571
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:59.910
You're my ticket from here.
That's why you're still alive.

572
01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:04.035
- You blew up the ship.
- Surely it was beautiful?

573
01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:08.118
- You murdered all those people.
- I had to.

574
01:01:08.701 --> 01:01:11.951
- You killed us.
- We're not dead yet.

575
01:01:12.493 --> 01:01:17.660
If they think any of us
are responsible. they will never save us.

576
01:01:17.743 --> 01:01:20.826
- Of course they do.
- Why would they?

577
01:01:21.993 --> 01:01:24.868
To help
the helpless woman of course.

578
01:01:25.743 --> 01:01:30.743
Do not you understand? I have saved you
from a life of slavery in the colony.

579
01:01:32.618 --> 01:01:36.826
And destroyed the future of humanity
at the same time!

580
01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:42.160
The future of humanity?
Mankind is already dead

581
01:01:42.243 --> 01:01:45.535
if they think they'll save it
by sending us here.

582
01:01:47.285 --> 01:01:50.451
Do not say you believe that shit.

583
01:01:54.826 --> 01:01:57.243
Who are you calling?

584
01:01:57.868 --> 01:02:01.326
I'm Isaac Havelock's cellmate.
Do you want to know what he did?

585
01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.743
Stop.

586
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.785
You are live on KLM Radio.
What's your name?

587
01:02:13.035 --> 01:02:16.326
- My name is Alana Skill.
- And what do you want to tell us?

588
01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:20.243
My cellmate Isaac just admitted that
he was the one who blew up the ship.

589
01:02:20.326 --> 01:02:24.910
- She's lying!
- Is it Isaac we hear in the background?

590
01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:30.618
He wants the world to know what he
did. He wants to dissolve the program.

591
01:02:30.701 --> 01:02:33.035
Do you speak freely. Alana?

592
01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:37.243
Alana?

593
01:02:37.993 --> 01:02:40.410
Please help me.

594
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:58.701
That was not nice.

595
01:03:25.993 --> 01:03:28.243
So weak.

596
01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:31.951
But it's OK.

597
01:03:32.951 --> 01:03:35.326
How did you do it?

598
01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:38.701
Fire detected in the oxygen garden.

599
01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.576
Eva ... Do something.

600
01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:53.951
Fire-fighting Co2 emptied.

601
01:04:06.035 --> 01:04:12.076
Carbon dioxide levels are dangerously high.
The oxygen level has fallen to 17 percent.

602
01:04:17.618 --> 01:04:22.618
- I'm not feeling well.
- It may be due to lack of acid.

603
01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.993
So this is how we die?

604
01:05:20.243 --> 01:05:24.493
Capsule 471. Do you hear us?

605
01:05:28.951 --> 01:05:34.826
Capsule 471. This is the
Orion escape capsule. Can you hear us?

606
01:05:36.576 --> 01:05:41.035
- I hear you. it's Isaac Havelock.
- Nice to hear your voice. Isaac.

607
01:05:41.118 --> 01:05:46.201
We are almost there. just under 110
kilometers away. We'll be there soon. buddy.

608
01:05:46.618 --> 01:05:50.118
- I love you!
- We need help with the docking ...

609
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:52.701
so be prepared with the control system.

610
01:05:52.785 --> 01:05:55.701
No problem. just tell me what to do.

611
01:05:57.368 --> 01:06:00.576
Wait.
we are 60 kilometers away and approaching.

612
01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:12.701
30 kilometer.

613
01:06:15.035 --> 01:06:17.201
I see them.

614
01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:20.910
Yes. I can not believe that
it really happens.

615
01:06:22.951 --> 01:06:26.493
We start the engines to slow down.
Wait.

616
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:30.160
Okay. combustion successful.

617
01:06:31.868 --> 01:06:34.410
Turn on the button on the control system.

618
01:06:41.326 --> 01:06:45.160
- Automatic docking activated.
- The top. we see the beacon.

619
01:06:45.243 --> 01:06:47.326
The ship leads us in.

620
01:06:47.993 --> 01:06:55.493
10 seconds. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4 ...

621
01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:59.618
3. 2. 1...

622
01:07:04.035 --> 01:07:08.201
- Docking completed.
- Are you unlocking for us. Isaac?

623
01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.618
Okay. I'm fixing this.

624
01:07:13.785 --> 01:07:16.576
Isaac. you have to unlock the door.

625
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:22.910
- Eva. unlock the doors.
- Sorry. but it's not possible ...

626
01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:26.243
- if we are not docked.
- But we are.

627
01:07:26.951 --> 01:07:29.993
No. Isaac. We are not.

628
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:58.285
Shit too!

629
01:07:58.368 --> 01:08:01.118
No no no...

630
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.993
What is it. Isaac? Is everything okay?

631
01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:11.076
They left me here.

632
01:08:11.785 --> 01:08:14.076
Who then?

633
01:08:17.076 --> 01:08:19.618
It was not for real.

634
01:08:21.785 --> 01:08:25.243
Warning. oxygen level 3 percent.

635
01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:40.076
- Please ...
- Isaac. should I call the check?

636
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:44.951
- Clara ...
- Isaac. should I call the check?

637
01:08:45.826 --> 01:08:49.201
Clara ... I can 't breathe.

638
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:53.118
Warning. oxygen level 2 percent.

639
01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:00.743
- Recreate pressure.
- Warning! Automatic reprint ...

640
01:09:00.826 --> 01:09:05.493
has been prevented due to fire.
Do you want to override it?

641
01:09:06.076 --> 01:09:10.368
- Override!
- Okay. confirmed. Repressor.

642
01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:26.951
Skill. can you hear us?

643
01:09:27.993 --> 01:09:30.368
Are you there. Havelock?

644
01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:33.701
What have you done to Alana?

645
01:09:38.326 --> 01:09:40.701
I think she's dead.

646
01:09:46.201 --> 01:09:48.410
I did not destroy the ship.

647
01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:52.118
- We know.
- What do you mean?

648
01:09:52.701 --> 01:09:57.243
We checked the camera in your capsule.
It was Alana who entered the ship.

649
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:23.910
Docking completed.

650
01:10:32.118 --> 01:10:34.326
Eva. turn on the light.

651
01:10:37.035 --> 01:10:39.368
How long does it take for them to wake up?

652
01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.701
About 30 seconds.

653
01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:48.660
Our first customer.

654
01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:53.993
- Hello. Miss Skill.
- Up and jump. Skill.

655
01:10:54.743 --> 01:10:57.076
Get up.

656
01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:10.285
- I thought I would get another chance.
- Did they say that?

657
01:11:10.743 --> 01:11:14.493
No. you're here to work
and do what we tell you.

658
01:11:14.576 --> 01:11:17.326
And you will be our little bitch.

659
01:11:56.826 --> 01:12:01.285
Come on. Up with you.

660
01:12:03.868 --> 01:12:06.243
Up with you.

661
01:12:06.868 --> 01:12:09.160
Up!

662
01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:12.785
Come on!

663
01:12:15.326 --> 01:12:17.535
Up with you!

664
01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:34.576
Fire detection.
Emergency separation started.

665
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:37.826
Good. You are awake.

666
01:13:43.451 --> 01:13:46.618
I do not understand that
she killed all those people.

667
01:13:48.451 --> 01:13:54.535
Listen. Havelock. Your oxygen
level is low due to the repression.

668
01:13:54.993 --> 01:13:58.201
Probably a result of the fire.

669
01:13:58.285 --> 01:14:03.285
Unfortunately. it also appears that the
electronics on the ship were damaged.

670
01:14:03.368 --> 01:14:07.618
I already know all that.
so what do you mean?

671
01:14:07.701 --> 01:14:11.368
- I'm really sorry.
- Why?

672
01:14:13.618 --> 01:14:17.535
We have looked at all the options.
All unforeseen events.

673
01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:20.743
but there are no ships nearby.
Neither NASA. the military ...

674
01:14:20.826 --> 01:14:23.910
- or our own who can reach you.
- Please ...

675
01:14:24.368 --> 01:14:28.368
And your oxygen will
run out before we can save you.

676
01:14:28.451 --> 01:14:30.868
I'm really sorry. Isaac.

677
01:14:33.451 --> 01:14:39.118
- And to return?
- The capsule will probably not work.

678
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.326
I'm sorry. Isaac.
We've done everything we can down here.

679
01:14:50.701 --> 01:14:52.785
You certainly have.

680
01:14:55.118 --> 01:15:03.035
Should we stop pretending? You never save us.
because Alana blew everything up.

681
01:15:03.451 --> 01:15:05.701
No.

682
01:15:08.285 --> 01:15:12.368
Are there a lot of others
in capsules floating around?

683
01:15:13.201 --> 01:15:17.868
49. And no. they are not innocent.
They are criminals.

684
01:15:23.743 --> 01:15:25.910
I'm not a killer.

685
01:15:27.868 --> 01:15:32.618
I'm here because you took people from
a system under the pretext ...

686
01:15:33.493 --> 01:15:35.868
that they did something wrong.

687
01:15:37.285 --> 01:15:41.035
If you filled everything up with serial killers ...

688
01:15:41.118 --> 01:15:44.243
But then you would not have had anyone
who could do the work.

689
01:15:44.326 --> 01:15:48.618
So I guess
you made a mistake with Alana.

690
01:15:51.243 --> 01:15:55.493
There must be
hundreds of victims for your experiment.

691
01:15:55.576 --> 01:15:59.160
Tell.
Are you planning to save any of them?

692
01:16:02.326 --> 01:16:06.285
- We do everything we can.
- So it's a no.

693
01:16:09.618 --> 01:16:13.076
- Goodbye. Isaac.
- The call ended.

694
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.368
Have a good life.

695
01:16:18.201 --> 01:16:21.160
- Isaac?
- What. Eva?

696
01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:25.243
You have used nine of your ten calls
this month.

697
01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:29.118
Incoming and outgoing calls
are included in the sum.

698
01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:32.910
The calls can be monitored by staff
for violations.

699
01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:56.243
- Eva? Do you think we can handle the return trip?
- The chance of survival is 22 percent.

700
01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:01.660
- Should you have taken the chance?
- No.

701
01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:07.743
How long will I survive
if I stay here?

702
01:17:07.826 --> 01:17:12.743
The water runs out in four days.
The food runs out in a day.

703
01:17:12.826 --> 01:17:19.826
The oxygen supply in nine hours.
The stabilizer fuel in 17 hours.

704
01:17:19.993 --> 01:17:23.826
Carbon dioxide levels
become toxic in 18 hours.

705
01:17:25.576 --> 01:17:28.451
- So I have one day left?
- Yes.

706
01:17:32.868 --> 01:17:36.493
- Eva. singla en slant.
- Key.

707
01:17:38.743 --> 01:17:41.618
So if I get a chance. I'll stay.

708
01:17:47.618 --> 01:17:51.576
- Eva. call Clara.
- Of course. Isaac. I'm calling.

709
01:17:55.743 --> 01:17:59.493
Isaac? Are you okay?

710
01:18:00.035 --> 01:18:02.451
Better if I can hear your voice.

711
01:18:03.618 --> 01:18:07.493
The Prime Minister has just said that
everyone who manages to return is pardoned.

712
01:18:07.576 --> 01:18:11.785
- Yes. because he does not think anyone does.
- Do not be so negative.

713
01:18:14.701 --> 01:18:18.618
Listen. There is no
easy way to say this.

714
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.785
I have bad news.

715
01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.576
They will not pick me up.

716
01:18:27.326 --> 01:18:29.535
And my oxygen runs out in a day.

717
01:18:30.868 --> 01:18:33.326
So...

718
01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:38.743
So I think this is goodbye.

719
01:18:42.868 --> 01:18:45.035
Are you there?

720
01:18:45.618 --> 01:18:47.951
And.

721
01:18:50.701 --> 01:18:54.868
I'm sorry for everything.
For everything I did.

722
01:18:55.826 --> 01:18:59.410
- That I can not come back to you.
- You do not have to apologize.

723
01:18:59.743 --> 01:19:01.868
It's not your fault.

724
01:19:06.701 --> 01:19:10.410
- Do not give up.
- Clara. de sa ...

725
01:19:10.576 --> 01:19:13.951
Do not listen to them.
Is there a chance?

726
01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:19.201
- A very small one.
- In that case. take it.

727
01:19:21.076 --> 01:19:25.326
Do you hear it? Please. Isaac.

728
01:19:25.785 --> 01:19:29.868
- People are betting on you ...
- Clara. listen.

729
01:19:29.993 --> 01:19:32.701
Whether you make it back or not.

730
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:38.493
- Listen to me. Clara.
- The odds are one-sided ...

731
01:19:38.618 --> 01:19:41.368
but this means that the
return will be high.

732
01:19:42.368 --> 01:19:46.076
That's how we ended up in this from the
beginning. That's why I'm here.

733
01:19:46.201 --> 01:19:48.493
I have already done that.

734
01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:57.785
Please tell me you did not bet on that
. I will return.

735
01:19:58.201 --> 01:20:00.576
I'll tell you when you'm back.

736
01:20:01.576 --> 01:20:07.035
Do not be mad at me.
Just ... promise me that.

737
01:20:07.701 --> 01:20:11.868
- You have to try.
- I will.

738
01:20:15.326 --> 01:20:17.618
I love you.

739
01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.326
And I you.

740
01:20:21.535 --> 01:20:24.160
The call ended.

741
01:20:30.785 --> 01:20:33.118
Wish me luck.

742
01:20:40.701 --> 01:20:42.993
That woman will be my death.

743
01:20:44.076 --> 01:20:47.035
- Not that woman.
- So you're not dead?

744
01:20:47.118 --> 01:20:51.160
Not yet.
22 percent ... I do not like the odds.

745
01:20:51.576 --> 01:20:54.535
We're going home. We have to try.

746
01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:22.368
Do not do it.

747
01:21:22.826 --> 01:21:26.785
Collaborate with me.
I want to kill those who brought us here.

748
01:21:28.785 --> 01:21:31.160
I just want to meet my family.

749
01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:35.951
In that case. you must kill me.
And then you're as awful as I am.

750
01:21:36.951 --> 01:21:39.368
They see you on the surveillance camera.

751
01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.410
They invent anything
so as not to pardon you.

752
01:21:45.535 --> 01:21:47.743
I want to avoid killing you.

753
01:22:23.826 --> 01:22:26.035
Do not fight back.

754
01:22:53.451 --> 01:22:56.535
Time to atmosphere:

755
01:23:00.451 --> 01:23:02.618
Its time. PIZDEC.GN

756
01:23:02.642 --> 01:23:04.642


757
01:25:01.243 --> 01:25:04.368
