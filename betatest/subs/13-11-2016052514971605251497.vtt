00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.445
Hey. boss. What are you
still doing here. man?

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.323
I thought you were taking off early. Yeah.
well. I'm trying to.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.451
Why hasn't
the concrete pour started yet?

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.412
The first truck blew a hose in
the alley. They're fixing it now.

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:03.374
It's always something.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.543
Why don't you just
take off. man? We got this.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.795
No. no. I know you do.
but I gotta sign the invoice.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:10.464
Just sign it now. I'll hold
on to it until we're finished.

00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:15.469
All right.

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:16.971
Thanks. Bobby.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.639
But you still call me
when it's done. okay?

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:19.849
You got it. boss.
All right.

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:31.026
<i>...stack</i>
<i>of papers here with headlines.</i>
<i>but I can promise you.</i>

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.071
<i>the only thing</i>
<i>people wanna talk about today</i>
<i>is this Clarke.</i>

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.740
<i>this interstellar comet.</i>

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:39.493
<i>You know. they are saying</i>
<i>this'll be the closest</i>
<i>comet flyby in history.</i>

00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:42.538
<i>which means we're gonna</i>
<i>be able to see this thing</i>
<i>even in bright daylight.</i>

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.790
<i>It's amazing.
Yeah.</i>

00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:46.917
<i>They only discovered
this thing a few weeks ago.</i>

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.336
<i>NASA's saying it appeared</i>
<i>out of nowhere</i>
<i>from a different solar system.</i>

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.421
<i>This is just...</i>

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.062
You scared me.
I didn't hear you.
Sorry.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.485
What time is it?
I thought we said 7:00.
Uh... Um...

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.278
I finished work early.

00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:40.698
I can hang downstairs
if you want.
That's okay.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:42.992
I'm done.

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:45.869
How many miles?

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.749
Five.
Five. Good.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.422
Is the party still on
for tomorrow?

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.840
Are you kidding?

00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.300
Nathan's invited
half the block already.

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:05.305
How's he doing?

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.474
He's okay.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.571
How long is this
gonna be awkward for?

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.407
I don't know. John.
It's not like I'm trying
to make it that way.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.701
'Cause if you're just
doing this for Nathan.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.661
-I'm not. I'm not.
-I... I don't...

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.664
I'm not.

00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:32.332
All right.

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:34.877
I'm just... just checking.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.920
It's just gonna take
some time...

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:39.965
and some effort
from the both of us.

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:46.388
We can do this. Ali.

00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.105
All right.
I'm gonna go shower.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.483
I'll call Deb. and I'll
tell him to come home.

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:59.401
-Will you make sure he washes his hands?
-Yeah.

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:00.486
Thanks.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.541
Hey.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.835
Dad!
Hey.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.755
I'm glad you're home.
Me too.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.554
Are you still liking
this drafting table. kiddo?

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.556
Yeah. I can draw
really good on it.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.226
Yeah. I see that. Wow.

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.269
I like this one.
Come here.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.689
God. you're really
a great artist. bud.

00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:38.857
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.860
So. how's school?
Good.

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.780
Yeah? Your teachers
talking about this thing?

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:49.076
Yeah. Mr. Williams said Clarke is
like a big snowball. but made of gas.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.619
Wow.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.330
Asteroids are made of farts.
Okay. I got it.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.584
No. Clarke is a comet.
silly. not an asteroid.

00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:59.795
Oh. a comet. I didn't know
there was a difference.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.297
Comets move faster.
like. way. way faster.

00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:04.883
Did you know that Clarke was
from a different solar system?

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:06.802
Which is why they don't
know much about it.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.221
Ah. Well.
now I know two things.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.597
What?

00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:13.767
That you and comets
are made of farts.

00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.060
No. you are.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.480
No. you are!
Come here.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.820
How's this thing
working out?

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.115
-Is it better than the shots?
-Way better.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.199
Yeah?

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:30.993
Good.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.664
What's the matter. buddy?

00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:41.587
Is Mom gonna
make you leave again?

00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:50.554
Your mom and I. we got
some things to work out.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.932
But no matter what...

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.393
Look at me. son.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.730
I'm always gonna be
your father. all right?

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.440
I'm never gonna leave you.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.984
I love you. kiddo.

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:09.114
<i>Scientists continue
to study Clarke.</i>

00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:12.034
<i>the interstellar comet
discovered only weeks ago.</i>

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.244
<i>Unlike most comets
or even asteroids.</i>

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.830
<i>which move much slower
and are easier to track.</i>

00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:19.124
<i>this particular comet
is not a singular body.</i>

00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:21.460
<i>but made up of hundreds
of pieces of rock and ice</i>

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.795
<i>that have broken up
over millions of years.</i>

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:26.340
<i>In fact. Clarke's
fragment trail is so long.</i>

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.635
<i>the end stretches beyond what
astronomers can actually see.</i>

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.136
<i>In other news.
Wall Street's...</i>

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.263
Nathan. come on.
Homework.

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.724
<i>The Dow Jones closed
down over 2.5% today.</i>

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.142
Can you help me?

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.436
All right.
what do we got?
Fractions.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.897
I thought
you were good at math.
I don't like fractions.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.399
They're hard.

00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:47.361
Well. it's okay for it to
be hard. because fractions
and math are important.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:51.198
You think your dad can
build skyscrapers
without being good at math?

00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:54.493
You wanna
build skyscrapers like me?
Yeah.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.828
Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:02.334
All right. So. which figures
are divided into equal parts?

00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:23.814
Guest room it is.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:50.173
-Cool binos. bud.
-I don't see Clarke.

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:51.800
Maybe he's still sleeping.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.719
Dad.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.724
<i>...developments overnight.</i>

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.268
<i>Some of Clarke's larger</i>
<i>fragments are now expected</i>
<i>to enter our atmosphere.</i>

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.980
<i>According to scientists.</i>
<i>when the largest fragments</i>
<i>get closer to the sun.</i>

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:08.525
<i>they heat up</i>
<i>and they expel jets of gas.</i>
<i>changing their trajectory.</i>

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.945
<i>Yes. but they're also saying</i>
<i>not to worry. that these</i>
<i>things won't hit the ground.</i>

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:14.364
<i>They're gonna burn up</i>
<i>as they pass through</i>
<i>our atmosphere.</i>

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:17.159
<i>But I bet you.</i>
<i>it's gonna make</i>
<i>one heck of a show.</i>

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.494
Hey. John!
Welcome back. amigo!

00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:21.163
Hey. Ed. How you doing?
Good.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.166
-How are things?
-Good.

00:10:28.754 --> 00:10:31.298
-Still coming over later?
-You know
I'd never miss a free meal.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.008
Oh. I know that.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:34.676
See you in a bit.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.347
Hey. We're gonna need
some more beer and wine.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.849
Can you go to the store
for me? People are gonna
be here in an hour.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.894
Now? I'm just about
to start the grill.
Well. I need to get ready.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.479
People are gonna
be here soon.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.193
Okay. Okay.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.986
You need anything else while
I'm there? Just so I know.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.071
No.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.114
All right.

00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:58.784
Actually.
get some more hot-dog buns.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.787
And. um. some mustard.
We only have the spicy kind.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.580
Thanks.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.304
All right. kiddo.

00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:20.889
Can I get a toy?

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.100
If you listen and hurry.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.102
Whoa.

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.650
Where are they going?

00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:35.278
I don't know.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.158
Look! There's Clarke!

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.453
Whoa.

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:46.790
Looks pretty cool. huh?

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.337
All right.
let's hurry up.

00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:01.763
Hey. Nathan. come on.

00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:09.855
All right.
Some Bud Light...

00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:13.608
Can we get juice boxes.
too?

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.403
All right.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.487
Okay.

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:19.698
Juices.

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.367
Which one do you want?

00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.286
I like those ones.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.413
Okay.
So then. those ones.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.835
That's loud. Dad.
What is it?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.671
Must be an AMBER Alert.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.090
"Presidential Alert"?

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.233
Hello?

00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:57.944
<i>This is a Presidential Alert.
It is not a test.</i>

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.323
<i>John Allan Garrity.</i>

<i>This is not a test.</i>

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.854
All right. Nathan. come on.
We gotta go.

00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:35.774
But you said I can get a toy.
We'll get one next time.
Come on.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.153
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>It's a rewarding</i>
<i>experience.</i>

00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:19.150
- There they are.
- About time. man.

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:21.194
Sit over here.

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:22.988
Hi. Hi.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.531
Hey.

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.283
John.
Good to see you again. man.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.118
You too. Kenny.
Hey. Deb.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.538
Hey. buddy.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.582
<i>...as it heads
toward the Atlantic...</i>

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.084
You're just in time.
One of the first chunks is about to hit.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.253
- Clarke is gonna hit?
- Only part of it.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.796
Don't worry.
it's going into the ocean.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.464
Dad. come
and sit with me!

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.758
Yeah. I just gotta go
talk to your mom for a second.

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.427
Hey.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.637
Where's the beer and wine?
In the car.

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.015
Listen. I just got one
of those Presidential Alerts.
Did you get one?

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.309
No. It's probably just a test.
Can you get the stuff?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.061
No. Ali.
I don't think it's a test.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.647
They said our family's
been selected for shelter.

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:01.192
I think something weird
is going on with this comet.

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:04.362
But the news said
the fragment thing is falling
somewhere near Bermuda.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.865
Then why is half
of our military on the move

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.159
with a ton of planes
in the sky?

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.369
Hey. John. here it comes.
You guys. get in here.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:15.957
<i>Now. splashdown off the coast</i>
<i>of Bermuda is expected</i>
<i>in just a few seconds.</i>

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.668
<i>A number of scientists say
the dispersive wave distance.</i>

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.420
<i>it's unlikely
to cause a tsunami...</i>

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.006
Did you take a unit
for the popcorn? Do it.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:27.427
<i>...but it will give us</i>
<i>the largest impact since</i>
<i>the Tunguska event of 1908.</i>

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.304
<i>That's when a meteor
slammed into...</i>

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.848
Look!
There's Clarke!
Looks pretty cool. huh?

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.850
<i>Spectacular first images here.</i>

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.436
Would you look at that?
<i>These are coming to us</i>
<i>live.</i>

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:41.149
<i>This is the fragment actually
entering the lower atmosphere.</i>

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.234
Five. four...
<i>Five. four...</i>

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.236
...three. two...
<i>...three. two...</i>

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.863
...one.
<i>...one.</i>

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.031
<i>And impact.</i>

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.953
Wait.
where's the explosion?

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.456
It's a chunk of rock.
Rocks don't explode.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.124
Tell that
to the dinosaurs.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.502
<i>We are still waiting
for the first images</i>

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.338
<i>of the actual splashdown</i>
<i>that's expected</i>
<i>in the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.800
What was that?
<i>The earlier footage showed...</i>

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.824
Nathan! Come here.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.033
Everybody okay?

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.119
What was that?
You guys okay?

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.995
I think it was
a shock wave or...

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.039
<i>We now are getting word
that the fragment.</i>

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:41.418
<i>it has hit the state
of Florida. central Florida.</i>

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:45.714
<i>with the impact's epicenter
reported just outside Tampa</i>

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.757
<i>stretching to Orlando.</i>

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.801
<i>And that fragment.</i>

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:54.013
<i>which scientists are</i>
<i>estimating was the size</i>
<i>of a football stadium.</i>

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:58.601
<i>has apparently sent</i>
<i>a shock wave felt</i>
<i>as far as 1.500 miles.</i>

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.648
<i>Uh. I have to warn you.</i>
<i>there are no words</i>
<i>for what you are about to see.</i>

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:06.776
<i>These are disturbing.
disturbing images.</i>

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.989
<i>They are coming to us from</i>
<i>a local news helicopter</i>
<i>in Tampa</i>

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:14.367
<i>as well as an
overhead weather satellite.</i>

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:17.662
<i>- Whoa.
- What?</i>

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.039
<i>Mike. Mike. turn back!
Mike. turn...</i>

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:26.588
Oh. my God.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.757
Wait. are some more pieces
gonna hit?

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.259
<i>Bear with us here.</i>
<i>We don't have much more</i>
<i>information than these images.</i>

<i>Unfortunately.</i>
<i>we have lost contact with</i>
<i>our affiliate in that area.</i>

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.059
What is it. John?

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:42.395
It's a Presidential Alert.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:44.814
<i>The estimates of the</i>
<i>trajectory were obviously</i>
<i>way off and we are...</i>

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.859

Maybe we got

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.531
But why did
only John's phone get it?

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:37.826
<i>Present the QR code

Let's go. Let's go. Ellie.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.126
I wanna stay with Nathan.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.629
-Move. Ellie. Go.
-Mommy.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.506

Hot. cold. Both. I guess.

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:08.147
-Where's his insulin supplies?
-Cabinet. top-left corner.

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:09.899
Remember to get the cartridges
from the fridge.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.985
-Is this gonna be enough
for a month?
-A month?

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.737
A month. a year.
We gotta be prepared. Ali!

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.199
Oh. sweetie.
Hey. Hey. look at me.
Everything's fine.

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.785
We're rushing 'cause
we don't wanna miss
that plane. Okay?

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.371
We're all gonna take
this trip. but we're
all gonna be together.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:24.873
All right. kiddo?

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.082
What about Grandpa?

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.961

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.141
Give me the bag
for the insulin.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.059
The bag. the bag. the bag.
Yeah. okay.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.439
Where's Nathan?
I thought he was with you.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.941
<i>The degree of devastation

Nathan.
Come on. Let's go.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.700

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.358

None of them got called.

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.237
Two days.
They got it all wrong.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.114
There's a shit-ton
of fragments on that thing.

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.283
They're saying
that one of them
is a planet killer.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.953
Now they've grounded
all non-military flights.
What do we do?

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.414
I don't know. Ed.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.291

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.251
I don't even know
if this shelter relocation
thing is real.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.045
That's bullshit!
And you know it!

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.051
I'm sorry. okay?
I'm sorry. It's just...

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:03.346
Just please give us a call

when you get there.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.057
Like where we can go
to be safe.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.184
You know I will. Ed.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.314
Good luck. Good luck.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.296

- Please. open the door!
- Ellie!

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.695
I'm sorry. Deb!

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.947
No!

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.866
What if it were Nathan?
What if it were...

But why?
What?

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.425
So we take her
to the air base.

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:25.053
and then leave her
standing there alone
when they turn her away?

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:38.107
He's gonna call.
He's gonna call us.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.901

in the car. Shit!

What now? What do we do?

00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:20.319

Can I get back in?

00:31:00.276 --> 00:31:01.402
Yeah. go ahead. Go.

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:02.486

You know what?
Come here. Come here.

00:31:18.502 --> 00:31:20.337
Hey! Excuse me.

00:31:20.421 --> 00:31:22.423
Look. I know my husband
just talked to you.

00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:24.883
He's going back to the car
to get my son's meds.

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:27.469
Can you make sure
he gets on our plane...
Meds?

00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:30.848
Yeah.
It's just his insulin.

00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:32.516
Sergeant Ruiz?

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.934
What's the problem?

00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:35.227
What's up?

00:31:35.311 --> 00:31:36.895
It's okay.
I just explained to him.

00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:39.356
It's just for his insulin pump.
It's not a big deal.

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.027
You know what?
Forget it. It's fine.
We don't need it.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.987
That's not the issue.
ma'am.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.197
Don't worry about it.
We'll use the shots.
It's not a big deal.

00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:48.782
Line one.
we need an escort.
What?

00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:51.785
Look. we have the bracelets.
We were selected.

00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:53.871
Follow me.
please. ma'am.

00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:55.664
No. no. no. Why?

00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:57.333
Ma'am. I'm not asking.

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.294
Let's go.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:05.924
It's okay.

00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:24.610
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Over here!

00:32:24.693 --> 00:32:27.237
No. Captain.
I don't remember
giving the order on that.

00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:29.657
No. tell me something.
how is there a problem
with that manifest?

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.784
I signed for it myself.

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:35.245
Then I will come down there
and check it.
I'll be down there in five.

00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:39.291
The kid's diabetic.
Don't touch him.

00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:41.669
I'm sorry.
You should've been informed.

00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:44.129
Anyone with
a chronic condition
can't be on the plane.

00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:46.006
It's just diabetes.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.425
His condition
should've been flagged
at screening.

00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:51.303
If I hadn't said anything
to the guard. he'd
have no idea he had a pump.

00:32:51.387 --> 00:32:53.222
There's nothing I can do
about that. ma'am.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.058
You can pretend
that you didn't see it.

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:59.269
-Ma'am. I didn't
write the rule. Sorry.
-Then ignore it!

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:02.648
What if this
was your family?

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.445
My family wasn't selected.
ma'am.

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.409
99% of armed forces
weren't.

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:16.453
We are all volunteers here
just doing our jobs.

00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:18.247
I'm sorry.

00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:21.709
I am.

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.462
But please...

00:33:25.546 --> 00:33:28.841
His father. my husband.
is on one of those planes
right now.

00:33:28.924 --> 00:33:30.551
What am I
supposed to do?

00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:39.810
Hey!

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.376
This is Breen.

00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:06.920
Yeah. I'm looking
for a passenger.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.757
Ma'am. what's his name?

00:34:11.425 --> 00:34:12.885
John Allan Garrity.

00:34:14.094 --> 00:34:15.095
Chalk 33?

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.474
Yeah. his son was flagged.

00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:20.184
Thank you.
They're looking for him.

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:22.644
Thank you. Thank you.

00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:34.031
Allison!

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.074

00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:38.368
Allison!

00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:50.464
Do not run.
Move in an orderly fashion
to your designated aircraft.

00:34:50.547 --> 00:34:53.509
Have you seen a kid?
He's age seven.
He's wearing a gray hoodie.

00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:56.261
And his mom is dark-haired.
She's about 5'7".

00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:58.639
I've seen
a lot of kids. sir.
Please keep moving.

00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.849
I need to know
if they made it on first.

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:03.393
Do they have bracelets?
We all have them. yeah.

00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:05.229
Then they're on
one of these planes.

00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:07.481
Are you sure they're all
going to the same place?

00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:08.899
Yes. Now go.

00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:12.444
Everyone keep moving
in an orderly fashion!

00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:13.654
Allison!

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.281
Do not run!

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:19.576
Okay.
Thank you. Lieutenant.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.122
Ma'am. they're boarding.
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:26.917
No. no. no. Come on. You can
go on one of those planes
and look for him.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.379
There are dozens of planes
with over 2.000 passengers
crammed in.

00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:32.965
I can't hold them up
for this.
Are there phones? Can I call?

00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:35.050
I don't know
if there's any phones.

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.761
-Where are these planes going?
-Shelter destinations
are classified.

00:35:37.845 --> 00:35:40.681
Look. ma'am.
this is an emergency operation
with a lot of moving parts.

00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:43.475
I am just in transport.
I wish I had
more answers for you.

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:45.143
Please.
What am I supposed to do?

00:35:45.227 --> 00:35:47.604
I'm very sorry.
Stop. stop. No. no. no!

00:35:47.688 --> 00:35:50.816
Ma'am. I need you
to step this way.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:08.625
Nathan!

00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:10.711
Allison!

00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:13.005
Everybody sit down!
Let's go. let's go!

00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:14.923
Everyone sit.

Everyone find a seat.

No. honey.
See. there's other planes.

00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:43.381

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.631
My son's
only seven years old!

00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:17.715
Move it. move!

Please. we need a ride.
Please.

00:45:36.818 --> 00:45:38.570
Are you going up north?
Get in the car.

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:40.029
No. no. no!

00:45:40.113 --> 00:45:42.740
No. we just need to get
up near Lexington.

00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:44.409
Get in the car.

00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:45.952
I'll take you
as far as Knoxville.
but that's it.

00:45:46.035 --> 00:45:48.079
Thank you!

Come on.

Okay.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.886
My God.
Could you hear gunfire?
Yes.

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:04.971
I just started running.

00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:07.098
I turn around.
and there was an old woman
who'd been in a wheelchair.

00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:09.684
-They just killed her.
-Oh. Jesus.

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.728
I watched them. I thought
they were gonna shoot me.

00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:13.813
I'm sorry. hon.
All right. there you go.

00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:15.482

- Are you okay back there?
- Yes.

00:46:17.859 --> 00:46:19.611
Thank you so much.

00:46:19.694 --> 00:46:22.739
It's like
there's no chain of command.
Nobody in charge.

00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:24.741
Everybody's running around
with their heads cut off.

00:46:24.824 --> 00:46:26.159
Shit.

00:46:26.242 --> 00:46:27.785
We'll get to Knoxville.

Yeah. if we can get there
before they take off.

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:32.248
And if they let us through.

00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:34.667
I mean. that stupid lottery.

00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:37.629
You know the government
knew about all this.

00:46:37.712 --> 00:46:40.298
and all they did
was pick the rich fat cats.

00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:41.591
Damn.

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:45.178
Hey. is your son.
uh. is he hungry?

00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:47.388
We got a sandwich here.

00:46:47.472 --> 00:46:49.933
You know what? It would be
really good for him
to eat something. Thank you.

00:46:50.016 --> 00:46:52.644
We got a turkey sandwich.
sweetheart.
Does that sound nice?

00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:54.229
Thank you.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:56.564
What do we say?

00:46:56.648 --> 00:46:58.316
What do you say.

00:46:58.399 --> 00:46:59.442

00:46:59.526 --> 00:47:01.569
Well. you are welcome. pal.

00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:04.447
Are you two out here
all by yourselves?

00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:07.116
Uh. no.
My husband. um...

00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:09.661
We got separated.

00:47:09.744 --> 00:47:11.371
He's on a plane.

00:47:11.454 --> 00:47:13.748
A plane?

00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:17.961
Ralph. they're wearing
those bracelets
that we saw on the news.

00:47:18.044 --> 00:47:19.337
Y'all got picked?

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.339
Why aren't you
on that plane with him?

00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:24.551
My son.
he has a medical condition.
so they wouldn't let us on.

00:47:25.718 --> 00:47:27.220
Oh. what a shame.

00:47:30.056 --> 00:47:31.975
That's a damn shame.

00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:34.912
Hey! Hey!

00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:36.581
No. wait! Wait!

John?
<i>Hey. Ali?</i>

00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:20.541
Can you hear me?

00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:22.710
Oh. thank God.
Ali. are you okay?

00:49:22.794 --> 00:49:25.338
<i>John. Did you get my text?</i>

00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:26.798
Hey. Ali.
I can't hear you.

00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:28.508
<i>Hello?</i>
Where are you guys?

00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:30.802
<i>Are you at your dad's?</i>
John. if you can hear me...

00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:33.137
<i>I can't hear you.</i>
...please meet us
at my dad's.

00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.764
That's where we're headed.
<i>Ali...</i>

00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:45.024
Is that Dad?
Yeah. that's him.

00:49:45.108 --> 00:49:47.527
Where is he?
I don't know.
The phone's not working.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.654
I wanna see him.
I know.

00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:53.032
We're gonna meet him
at Grandpa's. It's okay.
He's gonna meet us there.

00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:16.931
Kiss my ass. Clarke!

00:50:21.269 --> 00:50:23.730
Come on. guys.
Everybody in.
We gotta get moving.

00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:26.357
Hey. Hey!

00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:27.442
Excuse me.

00:50:28.568 --> 00:50:30.611
Where are you headed?
North.

00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:32.113
How far?
Canada.

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:34.115
Can you take me
to Lexington. Kentucky?

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:36.242
It's on the way there.

00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:37.702
Okay.

So. what do you do?

00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:25.708
What?

00:51:25.792 --> 00:51:27.168
What do I do?

00:51:30.797 --> 00:51:33.257
They're selecting people
based on their professions.

00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:36.052
Like my mom. she was selected
because she's a doctor.

00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:43.184
I'm a structural engineer.
I build buildings.

00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:46.062
We definitely need those.

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.481
Hey. I'm John.

00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:50.066
Colin.

00:51:50.149 --> 00:51:51.150
Good to meet you.

00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:53.277
You as well.
You as well.

00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.489
So. if your mum got accepted.
why are you not
with your family?

00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:01.202
I haven't spoken
to my family
in seven years.

00:52:03.287 --> 00:52:05.289
I found out about all this
through my sister.

00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:08.751
Yeah. Me and my mom.
we had our issues.

00:52:10.086 --> 00:52:12.004
So much
for holding grudges.
right?

00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:15.883
What about you?

00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.137
I don't like flying.
Thought I'd walk.

00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:26.310
I lost my wife and son
at the military base.

00:52:26.394 --> 00:52:28.396
and I'm trying
to meet up with them now.

00:52:35.403 --> 00:52:36.988
All right. look.

00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.240
So my boy Manny
that's driving.

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.492
he knows some pilots
in Canada.

00:52:41.576 --> 00:52:43.870
That's where
we're all headed.

00:52:43.953 --> 00:52:46.080
They're giving some people
rides to the shelters.

00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:50.960
But the shelters are
classified. How do they even
know where they're going?

00:52:51.043 --> 00:52:53.462
They've been tracking
the military flights
to Greenland.

00:52:53.546 --> 00:52:54.672
Greenland?

00:52:56.215 --> 00:52:57.633
You should come with us.

00:52:57.717 --> 00:52:59.218
Nah. thanks.

00:52:59.302 --> 00:53:02.346
but I gotta find my wife
and family in Kentucky.

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.307
So find 'em
and meet up with us
after.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:06.309
We're taking off
from Osgoode.

00:53:06.392 --> 00:53:08.311
It's a small city
right across the border.

00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:13.232
How do you know
you're even gonna get in?

00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:16.611
Only one way
to find out. right?

00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:03.824
You know. it's gonna be tough
getting that far north.

00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:05.701
all the way up to Lexington.

00:54:08.537 --> 00:54:10.539
I mean.
it's crazy out here.

00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:14.502
Are you sure you don't wanna
just come with us?

00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:18.464
You know. get on a plane?

00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:24.178
I already tried that.
It didn't work. so I just need
to get to my dad's.

00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.846
Oh. okay.

00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:33.688
Ralph. what is it?

00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:39.485
I just... I can't...

00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:41.737
I can't believe
all them soldiers
at the airport.

00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:43.990
that they would
turn that boy away.

00:54:44.073 --> 00:54:45.825
I mean.
with a face like that?

00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:49.996
She already told you
that's what happened.

00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.998
Yeah. well. maybe...

00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:54.625
maybe if he had
some different family
with him...

00:54:59.422 --> 00:55:02.091
What are you doing?

00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:04.010
Wait. What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?

00:55:04.093 --> 00:55:05.219
Ralph!

00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:11.892
Look. your husband.
he abandoned you.
But you don't gotta worry.

00:55:11.976 --> 00:55:13.936
I'm gonna get your son
to safety. I promise you.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.479
I'm gonna get him
on that plane.

00:55:15.563 --> 00:55:17.189
-Ralph. Wait.
-No. You don't have to...

00:55:17.273 --> 00:55:18.733
Where are you going?
Oh. my God!

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.443
Get out of the car.

00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:21.861

00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:25.239
No! No! No!

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.574

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.117
Judy. unlock the door.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.952
Don't unlock the door!

00:55:30.036 --> 00:55:32.580
Unlock the goddamn door!
Don't do it!
Don't unlock...

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:35.166

00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:36.584
No! I'm not coming!

00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:38.627
Get out of the car.
Come here! Get out!

00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:40.796
- Come here.
- I don't wanna hurt you.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.256
Ralph!

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:43.549
-Get out of the car.
Come here!
-Mom!

00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:44.925
Get out of the car!

00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:46.635
No!

00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:48.512
-Kid. stop it! No!
-Don't take him! No!

00:55:48.596 --> 00:55:50.181
Stop!
Don't take him!

00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:51.932
- Mom!
- Stop it!

00:55:52.016 --> 00:55:54.351
- I don't wanna hurt you. okay?
- God. I'm so sorry!

00:55:54.435 --> 00:55:56.479
-No! No! Mom!
-I don't wanna hurt you. okay?

00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:58.397
I'm gonna take care
of your son. I promise.

00:55:58.481 --> 00:56:00.191
Lock the door. Judy.
Don't take him!

00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:03.277

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.822

00:56:21.587 --> 00:56:24.006
Stop! Stop!

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.592
Stop. stop. stop!

00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:34.850
Stop!

00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:40.147
What do I...

00:56:43.984 --> 00:56:45.319
Nathan!

00:57:15.307 --> 00:57:16.517
Hey.

00:57:17.476 --> 00:57:18.477
Where are you from?

00:57:22.606 --> 00:57:24.233
I'm from Atlanta.

00:57:24.692 --> 00:57:25.693
Nope.

00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:29.613
Not what I'm asking.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.076
Where were you born?

00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:38.372
What does it matter?

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.583
What matters is
you don't deserve that band.

00:57:45.504 --> 00:57:46.547
All right. listen.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:47.965
You're gonna give it
to me.

00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:52.219
It wouldn't do you
any good.

00:57:52.303 --> 00:57:53.804
It's got my name on it.

00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.473
It wouldn't work for you.

00:57:56.557 --> 00:57:58.434
You're gonna give me
your license too.

00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:06.317
I don't want any trouble.

00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:09.445
Just...

00:58:09.528 --> 00:58:11.906
Come on. All right. listen.

00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:16.869
Give me the goddamn band.

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.496
I'm not giving you
the band.

00:58:21.248 --> 00:58:22.666
Come on. fellas.

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.668
Guys. he just said
that it's not gonna work.

00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:25.836
Stay out of it!

00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:52.488
What the hell?

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:01.789
Oh. my God.
they're fighting!

00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:11.423
Pull over!
I'm trying.

00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:20.349
Watch out!

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:25.998
Just give us the band!

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.043
Need ride?

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:18.962

This bracelet is broken.
It's not gonna go on.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:38.023
Well. find something.
Find a rubber band
or something.

01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:41.276
Just figure it out.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.282
Don't you worry.
It's gonna be okay.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.872
You're gonna see your mom
again. okay?

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.170
What did you do?

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:01.296
What did I do?

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.883
I gave us a chance.
I gave that boy a chance.

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:07.344
Oh. shit. Okay.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.348

Okay. Hold on.

Now you listen to me.

You wanna see your mama again.

You understand me?

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:38.875
Do you understand me?

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.963
Just do what he says
and it's all gonna be okay.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:46.133

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.093
They said something about
coming here for a flight.

01:08:17.177 --> 01:08:19.095
Ma'am. I can't hear you.

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:22.432
They took my wristband.
You probably scanned it.
Nathan Garrity.

01:08:22.516 --> 01:08:24.267
We've had hundreds of kids
through here.

01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:27.395
Look. maybe try the FEMA camp
across the street.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.751
Move! Move!

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.711
You need to fill out
this consent form.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:54.339
The soldier at the checkpoint
said you might have
my son here.

01:08:54.422 --> 01:08:56.216
You need to wait in line.
Listen to me!

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.759
You need to wait in line!

01:08:57.843 --> 01:08:59.928
I need to find my son.
We're doing our best.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:02.848
He's seven years old!
He was taken from me!
Somebody just listen to me!

01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:04.683
Ma'am. Please.
Come here. Talk to me.

01:09:04.766 --> 01:09:06.685
What's going on?
I'm trying to find my son.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.104
He's seven years old.
He's diabetic.
He was taken from me.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.106
Somebody said
he could be over here.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.525
I'll help you find your son.
but you need to calm down.
Follow me.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.823
Let's check
the pediatric tent.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:24.786
Where? Where?
Right here.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:25.871
This one?
Yes.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.625
- You see him?
- Uh...

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.836
No. he's not in there.
Let's try around here.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.761
You see him?

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:42.888
No. he's not in here.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.310
-How about here?
-No. he's not here either.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.145
It's okay. It's okay.
We'll find him.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.771
Check this one here.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.000
Nathan! Nathan.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.003
Mom!
Oh. honey!
Oh. my God.

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:16.087
Look at me.

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:17.923
Oh. baby.

01:10:18.924 --> 01:10:21.635
I'm so sorry!

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.554
Oh. my God!

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.559
I'm so sorry.

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:34.439
I'll never
let that happen again.
I'm so sorry.

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.610
I'm fine. Mom.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.487
He's a remarkable young man.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:43.949
You're Allison.
Yeah.

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:47.202
He's type one diabetic.
I've gotta check his levels.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.620
He told us.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.497
We checked his levels twice.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.540
Gave him some insulin.
new pump.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.542
If I can get you
to sign this release form.

01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:56.878
I can move you guys
into a family tent.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.801
No. um... we're going
to my father's.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:06.638
I lost my...
I lost my husband.
We're gonna find him.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.264
I'm so sorry.

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:09.724
Where does your father live?

01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:13.520
In Lexington.
Near Lexington.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:17.857
Okay. Maybe I can get you
on a military bus
heading in that direction.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.694
And I also put together
a week's supply
of glucose tabs.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.279
and insulin.
and test strips. so...

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:26.825
I wish
I could give you more.
but it's all we have.

01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:30.620
Thank you.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.044
Hello?

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:03.922
<i>...see on camera</i>
<i>at this moment. but the city</i>
<i>is mostly burning...</i>

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:07.342
<i>Governments continue</i>
<i>to struggle to contain</i>
<i>the social chao...</i>

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:10.428
<i>...again. this livestream
video that's gone viral.</i>

01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:13.515
<i>We have to warn you.
these images are disturbing.</i>

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:16.101
<i>All of downtown
is on fire. man.</i>

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.852
<i>Check it out.
There's another one.</i>

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.690
<i>Wait. Is that coming
towards us? Wait. Holy...</i>

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:23.942
<i>Yo. run!</i>

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.279
<i>Yet another shocking image...</i>

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:30.657
<i>- Sometimes they come down...
- Wow.</i>

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.576
<i>They come out of nowhere. you know?
There's no warning.</i>

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.703
<i>- We're just trying to keep up.
- Yeah.</i>

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.413
<i>And. uh...</i>

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.416
<i>having in the back of our head
that tomorrow we're...</i>

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.503
<i>It's all gonna be for nothing.</i>

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.476
Now it comes.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:50.213
What a load of shit.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.804
Looks like I'm gonna
have to dip into my savings
for this next round.

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:05.103
You're alone.
Where's Allison?

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.438
Where is she?
I was hoping she'd be here.

01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:09.816
Why are my friends stuck here
babysitting me

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.902
while my daughter and grandson
are out there alone.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:15.154
and I'm here
with no way to find them?

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.408
We lost each other at
the airfield. and she left me
a note to meet her here.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.451
Fuck.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.456
Maybe we should go.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.167
She told me you were
moving back in.

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.795
Let me guess.
you had another fight?

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:34.257
We both want the same thing.
okay. for them
to get here safely.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.801
So why don't we try
to work together?

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:40.555
Okay.
Did you try the landline?

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:44.100
Go ahead. I tried
about an hour ago again.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.935
Keeps going
straight to voice mail.

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.438
Or you get that
stupid government message.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.651
God. you would
think technology would
work in emergencies.

01:16:58.573 --> 01:16:59.574
Hey.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:02.952
What happened to you?

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.829
Nothing.
Come on.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:08.791
It's been a long day.

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.795
Just want 'em back.
I just...

01:17:59.759 --> 01:18:02.428
Okay. there's a pay phone there.
Let's try that.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.561
Yes.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.529
Hello? Where? Stay there.
Stay right there.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.031
Where are they?
Down the road. Let's go.

01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:41.676
Hey.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.729
I'm sorry. honey.
I tried. I tried.

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:56.524
I know. It's okay.

01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:58.526
Kiddo.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.236
How you doing?
Good.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.071
Yeah? Here.

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:05.366
Come here.
How you doing? Okay?

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.493
Thanks for looking after
your mom. bud.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.917
Hi. Dad.

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:17.003
Hey. sunflower.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.977
Come on. honey.
Let's get you guys home.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.021
Okay.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.192
Come on.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.698
All right. welcome.
You hungry?
What do you wanna eat?

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.825
Pancakes.
Pancakes. Syrup?

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:48.993
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:50.745
No.
No.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.538
No. I forgot.
We don't have enough insulin
as it is.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.915
Aw!

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:56.250
I have his medication here.
You do?

01:19:56.334 --> 01:19:59.670
Yeah. It was out of
the fridge for a long time.
but it should still be good.

01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:00.755
Thank you.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.593
You remember where this goes?

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:08.387
What do you want?
Some water?
Some water. yeah.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.806
Way to go. All right!

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.059
This good?
Yep! Perfect.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.229
"Perfectomundo."
We should check the news.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.439
What do you think?

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:22.068
<i>At approximately</i>
<i>8:47 a.m. Eastern</i>
<i>Standard Time tomorrow.</i>

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.904

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.448
<i>somewhere between
North Africa and Europe.</i>

01:20:27.532 --> 01:20:30.701
<i>Space agencies tracking
this fragment are predicting</i>

01:20:30.785 --> 01:20:35.206
<i>an extinction-level event

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:44.173
<i>Here again</i>
<i>is the classified footage</i>
<i>discovered earlier today</i>

01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:49.053
<i>showing the sophistication</i>

<i>Air Force Base in Greenland.</i>

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:50.805
<i>They are in Greenland.</i>

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.890
<i>Built during the Cold War
in case of nuclear fallout...</i>

01:20:52.974 --> 01:20:55.142
He was right.
Who was right?

01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:57.311
<i>...the bunkers are</i>
<i>self-sufficient with</i>
<i>underground water tanks...</i>

01:20:57.395 --> 01:20:59.564
Just this
really good guy.

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:02.692
<i>...hydroponic seed farms.</i>
<i>medical supplies</i>
<i>and oxygen generators.</i>

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.403
A lot of good
that'll do us now.
The footage is older than me.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.196
Who knows
what shape it's in?

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.781
At least here
we'll be together.

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.325
What are you doing. John?

01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:14.287
There's another way
for us to get there.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.706
Where?
To Greenland.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.916
There are pilots going
from up in Canada.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.751
They're taking people.
They're not military.

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:23.504
Look. it's just over
12 hours to Osgoode.

01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:25.339
But we can do it in nine.

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.717
And then
it's another six to eight
hours for the flight.

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.553
We can make this.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.638
My bracelet. What if
they don't let us in? They've
already flagged Nathan.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:34.473
Honey. it's our only chance.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:37.351
Now listen. We can either stay
here or we can give it a shot.

01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:40.771
But if we give it a shot.
I swear I will get us
into those bunkers.

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:44.025
But if we're gonna go.

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.651
we gotta go now.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.988
Okay.
Okay.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.948
Okay. Let's do it.
All right.

01:21:51.032 --> 01:21:52.992
Nathan. let's get ready.
We left some clothes
in the guest room.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.619
What about the pancakes?

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:57.163
I'll make 'em. Don't worry.
They're on their way.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.882
Okay. Nathan.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.592
Go ahead.
take your clothes off.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.510
There you go.
All right. step in.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.596
Shampoo's over there.
Grab that.

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.973
Okay. Go ahead.
Wash yourself.

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.018
Good job.

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:21.187
Okay. Hurry up.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.569
Hey.

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:39.455
You need
to pack some clothes. Dale.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.832
We barely have enough time
as it is.

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:44.543
Ah. somebody's gotta stay
and watch Beck.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.088
Mary'd kill me
if I left him.

01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:50.549
Man. she spent hours
in here.

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:55.388
Now I can't separate the smell
from my memory of her anymore.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.889
God.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:58.599
Hay and horse shit.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.019
Dale.

01:23:02.103 --> 01:23:05.022
this isn't some storm
you can ride out.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:08.275
Look...

01:23:09.777 --> 01:23:12.530
I don't fold
when things get rough.

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:18.661
I know you guys' marriage
was on the rocks.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.913
Every marriage
goes through shit.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.666
Every marriage
goes through shit.

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:28.337
That don't mean you get to
jump into another woman's bed.

01:23:31.257 --> 01:23:32.758
You're right. I did.

01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:37.763
And I'm gonna
have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:41.267
I'm not expecting
your forgiveness. Dale.

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:45.396
But if I get one thing right.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:48.816
I'm gonna get my son
and my wife into that bunker.

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:04.540
Please come with us.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.876
No.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.128
Why are you being
so stubborn? Just come.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.838
You know
you'll die here. Dale.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:12.882
Of course I will.

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:16.844
Today. tomorrow.
10 years from now. don't make
no difference to me.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:20.014
My Mary went to heaven
in this place.

01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:24.602
And when the good Lord's ready
for me to join her.

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:28.105
I'm gonna be right here
in this place too...

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.150
bags packed.

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:47.208
Nathan!

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:58.093
Nathan!

01:24:58.177 --> 01:25:00.179
Hey. Kiddo. are you hurt?

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.515
How close
do you think that hit?

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.141
Anything hit you?
That was close.

01:25:04.225 --> 01:25:06.435
All right.
we gotta get out of here now.

01:25:06.519 --> 01:25:08.771
Take my truck.
It's got a full tank of gas.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.612
Hold on. hold on.
Let me get your booster.

01:25:17.488 --> 01:25:19.114
Up you go.

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:23.786
Take care of them.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.621
I will.

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:27.832
I know you will. son.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:33.128
Bye.

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:45.349
When will I ever see you
again. Grandpa?

01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:48.394
Grandpa...

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:50.396
Yeah. pretty soon.

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:54.108
All this blows over.
I'll come up. visit you
and the polar bears.

01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:56.652
Polar bears?

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:59.822
Well. yeah. You're going
to the North Pole. right?

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:02.700
Say hi to Santa for me.

01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:05.703
Tell him
I'm still mad about the coal.

01:26:19.717 --> 01:26:22.845
I-I love you. sunflower.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:25.973
I love you too. Dad.

01:26:36.317 --> 01:26:37.985
Mom would have been proud.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:40.362
Of what?

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:42.990
You finished the house.

01:26:48.913 --> 01:26:49.914
Bye.

01:27:13.771 --> 01:27:15.147
Bye. Grandpa.

01:28:03.696 --> 01:28:05.739
My friend Teddy says

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:08.701
your life flashes in front
of your eyes when you die.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:16.125
I think it would be better if
it did that while you lived.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:19.378
That way. you could see
all the good memories
and be happy.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.549
I like that idea a lot.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.633
Me too.

01:28:25.426 --> 01:28:27.428
How'd you get to be so smart?

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:43.527
<i>World leaders scramble

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:57.958
Jesus.

01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:01.545
Finally.

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:03.589
At least they're going down
with the band still playing.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.382
That's true.

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:14.099
What?

01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:17.186
Do you remember
the first time you met my mom?

01:29:18.771 --> 01:29:20.230
She was wearing a kilt!

01:29:20.314 --> 01:29:22.441
Kilt.
How could I forget?

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:24.234
She wanted you
to feel at home.

01:29:24.318 --> 01:29:26.070
She did make me feel at home.
that's for sure.

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:28.655
Remember she had me try
to do the Highland fling?

01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:31.075
Like I know how to do
the Highland fling.

01:29:33.619 --> 01:29:36.121
Ah. she was a good woman.
your mum.

01:29:45.089 --> 01:29:47.508
I heard you talking
to my dad in the barn.

01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:51.178
John.

01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:57.226
I'm just as much to blame
about us.

01:29:57.935 --> 01:30:00.145
No. No. Ali.

01:30:00.813 --> 01:30:01.814
No.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:04.483
No matter how bad it got...

01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:07.111
I crossed a line.

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:10.197
and you didn't.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:14.618
Listen.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:18.330
I'm right
where I wanna be...

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:22.960
with you...

01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:25.629
and Nathan.

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:30.843
Okay.

01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:44.189
Ah. great.

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:47.860
This is...
This is the only highway north
within 50 miles.

<i>We're working as fast as

01:31:15.012 --> 01:31:18.307
Is the road blocked?
Yeah. It's a crash.

01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:21.268
What is it?
What's going on?

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:25.314
A train derailed
across the highway.

01:31:26.565 --> 01:31:28.609

We're getting out of here.

01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:46.001
Oh. my God! John. go!

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:47.336
Come on.

Get in the back!
Cover Nathan!

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:20.244

Get down!
Get down. come on!

01:32:54.528 --> 01:32:55.612
Stay down!

There's a bridge. Hang on.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:10.252
We've gotta go quick!

01:33:12.796 --> 01:33:14.715
Come on. Quick. quick. quick.

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:51.793
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:33:51.877 --> 01:33:54.421
Hey. Come on. man! Wake up!

You okay?
Yeah.

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:33.668
Let's go.

Where the hell is
this airport?

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:10.450
What is that?
Is that it right there?

01:37:14.079 --> 01:37:15.330
They're taking off!

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:17.165
No. there has to be more.
Let's go.

01:37:17.249 --> 01:37:18.500

Shit.

Hang on! Hang on!

01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:55.161
-He's turning around! John!
-It's okay.

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:57.247
He's coming right at us!
I know what I'm doing.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.543
Stop. Stop.

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:05.088
Come on. now.
Come on. now.

01:38:07.549 --> 01:38:09.634
Told you.

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:18.602
He looks pissed.

01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:20.562
Wouldn't you be?

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:29.738
Hey.

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.740
What the hell
are you doing. man?

Listen. my... my wife
and my kid. we're trying
to get to Greenland.

01:38:35.619 --> 01:38:37.454
You're going there.
We were selected.

01:38:37.537 --> 01:38:39.956
We're already at capacity.
There'll be more planes
tomorrow.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.000
Or there won't be
a tomorrow! Come on!

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:44.711
I put everyone in danger
if I take you!

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:48.340
Then take
my wife and son.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:50.008
I can't risk it.

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:51.926
Then we're not moving.
all right?

01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:54.929
We're staying there.
and you're not going
anywhere!

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:02.145
Okay. I can take the kid.
maybe your wife.

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:05.273
No! We all go!
You're gonna take all of us!

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:09.319
How much do you weigh?

01:39:10.195 --> 01:39:11.529
Uh. 180. 185.

205. maybe 210.

01:39:15.742 --> 01:39:18.953
I'll be driving to Greenland
at this point.

01:39:19.037 --> 01:39:21.915
But get in. No luggage!
And move the goddamn truck!

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:23.833
I will.
Thank you!

01:39:23.917 --> 01:39:25.627
Go. guys. I'll go.

Okay.

01:39:30.215 --> 01:39:31.508
Sorry.

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.593
Sorry. everybody. I am.

01:39:33.677 --> 01:39:37.597
Here. We can put the kids
on our laps. Make some room
for you guys.

01:39:37.681 --> 01:39:39.808
Thank you so much.
No problem.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:42.644
Thank you. guys.
Thank you so much.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.104
Hang on. Okay.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.610
You should re-dress that.
Looks bad.

01:39:50.694 --> 01:39:55.031
There's some burn butter
in there. Gauze. Peroxide.
A few painkillers too.

01:39:56.116 --> 01:39:57.117
Appreciate it.

01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:25.371
What do you see?

01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:28.208
Dad!

01:41:28.291 --> 01:41:30.460
Whoa. buddy. He's still
a little bit hurt.

01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:32.754
Sorry.
It's okay.
