(All characters. locations. organizations. religions. )

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:49.028
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.767
(We made sure the child actors who appear in this episode...)

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:55.407
(were safe and well taken care of throughout the shoot.)

00:00:56.508 --> 00:00:59.977
(Episode 5)

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:30.087
(Juan Central District Court. Criminal Department 1. Verdict)

00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:32.397

(3. Fraud)

00:04:27.277 --> 00:04:28.647
Hello?

00:04:30.587 --> 00:04:31.657
Hello?

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:42.967
Is this Zi O?

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.429
It's you. isn't it?

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.030
Where are you?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.800
I'll be right there. Wait for me.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.999
I don't know.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.829
I don't know where I am.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.400
Okay. You're calling from a payphone. right?

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.809
I'll track this number and find where you are. so just stay there.

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:59.939
Okay?

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.379
Answer me.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.079
Don't yell at me.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.619
Just wait there.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.129
You must do everything you can to find him.

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.129
If he goes out of control.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.960
many people could die.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.100
And if he gets married and has a kid.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.629
who knows what will be born?

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:29.199
It'll be hard to say...

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.439
whether it's human or not.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.610
He may seem human now. but that can easily change.

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.150
Depending on which animal awakens inside him.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.720
he could turn into a completely different species.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.179
He'll do whatever he can to stay alive.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.290
Wouldn't humans do the same?

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.759
This isn't about ontology.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.819
This is about biology.

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.030
Do you understand? You must catch him.

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:57.360
Okay?

00:05:58.699 --> 00:05:59.730
Okay.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.139
Good.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.170
I'm going to go inside and send this over to the academy for review.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.879
Gu Reum. shoot him if you need to.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.889
He shouldn't exist in this world.

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:26.329
But what if he also has feelings?

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.300
If he shares even the slightest bit of human emotions.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:31.800
that would mean he isn't a monster.

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:32.869
He's a monster.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.139
He's a terrible mixed breed.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.670
He will completely destroy the ecosystem.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.639
If you can't catch him. it's better to just kill him.

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:10.660
Why do people hate me so much?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.270
Did you get into a fight?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.199
I was always alone.

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.670
But now there's literally no one by my side.

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:23.239
It never bothered me until now.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.579
But I guess this is how it feels.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.309
Did you also feel this way?

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:18.260
How did you endure it all when you still remember everything?

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:23.770
Shoot him if you need to.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.640
He shouldn't exist in this world.

00:10:18.729 --> 00:10:19.760
Come on in.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.339
I'm going to work.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.699
Don't do anything.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.609
and don't go anywhere. Just stay here.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.010
If you're hungry. you can fix yourself something to eat.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.439
And make sure you clean up.

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:48.719
Don't look at me like that.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.359
I'm not going to pity you or try to understand you.

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:55.829
To me. you're either a suspect in a murder case...

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.630
or a witness in a missing persons case.

00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:02.040
The bathroom is over there. And my room...

00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:04.670
I'll kill you if you go in there.

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:07.370
I'll see you after work.

00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:23.689
Take a seat.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.010
Did you get into a fight?

00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:46.510
Did you get beaten up?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.620
Was it those guys again?

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.990
Yes.

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:57.990
But you have a special gift.

00:11:58.589 --> 00:11:59.630
Can't you...

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.689
just use that?

00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:05.300
I'm sure humans are no match for you.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.400
With the power you have.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.400
couldn't you simply destroy the ecosystem built by humans?

00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:12.040
I'm also human. Why would I destroy that?

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.040
Just admit it already.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.510
You're not a normal human being.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.209
I want to be.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.819
And what I have isn't a gift. It's a curse.

00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:26.920
I'm sorry. I guess you're right.

00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:28.689
Because of that power of yours.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.719
you probably never had the chance to love anyone.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.000
You've never loved anyone. have you?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.870
Did I guess correctly?

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.199
I guess I did.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:50.709
Clean up after you eat.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.670
(Breaking news)

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.270
Bank networks that crashed...

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.140
due to last night's large scale cyber terror attack...

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:22.609
have yet to be restored.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.479
It looks like it will cause many people inconvenience.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.020
The networks that were attacked were not only banks...

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.750
but also online shopping malls. email service providers.

00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:33.650
and many more that add up to a total of 13 online networks.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.959
And one of them also turned out to be the National Forensic Service.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.829
Thus. the cybercrime team has begun investigating right away.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.800
The police think an organization of hackers was involved...

00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:46.929
and did not deny the possibility...

00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:48.530
that North Korea could be behind the attack.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.170
- What happened to the files? - Sir. did you see the news?

00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:53.439
It's really bad. The entire system is down.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.939
Let me see.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.790
Did you guys also lose all your files?

00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:10.089
Don't even get me started.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
The entire server is gone.

00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:15.089
I'm not sure if we can save any of our research materials or papers.

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:16.630
What about the files I sent you?

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800
The same thing happened to those too.

00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:19.829
Professor. you have everything backed up. right?

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.770
All our computers are down as well.

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:23.870
So you can't access any of the information right now?

00:14:23.939 --> 00:14:26.209
Do you think someone who was after the info deliberately did this?

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.540
Gosh. no way.

00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:30.240
All those banks and online shopping malls were also attacked.

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:32.140
I heard it was caused by North Korea's cyberattack.

00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:35.449
Professor. do you really not have the original documents?

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.290
I'll call you later.

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:05.010
You finally retrieved Z-0.

00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:06.150
Well done.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.750
We've destroyed all the reports and documents.

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:11.880
and the police will close the case as North Korea's cyberattack.

00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:14.319
Good job.

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:16.559
A new world will begin now.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.400
When a spacecraft is launched.

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:32.770
this is the part that does the actual work.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.540
Just to send this to space.

00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.949
all this energy is spent and discarded.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.719
The way humans use energy is very inefficient.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.089
They waste too much of it.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.920
I heard he can...

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.359
generate a considerable amount of electricity.

00:15:56.229 --> 00:15:57.959
Our speculation...

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.099
is that he keeps on evolving.

00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:03.740
Think about other kids like him being born into this world.

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:08.469
They can charge their phones by just holding them...

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.839
and move electric cars just by holding onto the steering wheels.

00:16:13.109 --> 00:16:17.020
We'll retrieve Z-0 and produce 101 clones.

00:16:18.219 --> 00:16:20.089
Then we'll take a leap.

00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:22.819
But why 101 clones?

00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:27.059
101 clones. It's quite ambiguous. isn't it?

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.929
It'll pique people's curiosity.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.429
And we'll produce their clones.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.969
The moment 1.01 million angels are born.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.800
this world will fundamentally change.

00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:37.339
And we'll obtain all the wealth and honor anyone can ever have.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.469
A new era will begin.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.010
A glorious era.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.479
The children who trust and obey us will rule the world.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.050
That was...

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.390
Z-0's fate.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.420
Our first successful experiment that was...

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:59.760
supposed to be destroyed after giving his cells to the others.

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:01.660
LUCA.

00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:05.300
But he's lived for way too long.

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:09.040
Now that we've retrieved him. we'll burn him to ashes...

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.800
as soon as we clone his cells.

00:17:10.969 --> 00:17:12.040
Yes. we should.

00:17:12.969 --> 00:17:14.209
We're really almost there now.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:18.410
but you'll have a lot to do until we reach our final goals.

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:20.479
Soon. you'll be appointed...

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.920
as the Director of the National Intelligence Service.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.620
Please stay focused.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.319
Thank you.

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:30.620
I'll always have your back.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.869
Excuse me. It's the lab.

00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:44.169
Hey. what's up?

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.710
What?

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:01.849
Wake up. Get up!

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.520
You piece of...

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:06.659
The car blew up on our way back here after retrieving him.

00:18:07.389 --> 00:18:09.200
- Let go. - We gave him sedatives.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.559
but he still woke up. so there wasn't anything we could do.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:13.099
You little...

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.339
Don't you dare glare at me like that!

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.809
I'm sorry.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.980
Wake him up.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.710
Wake him up!

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.649
He needs absolute rest right now.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.250
Give him stimulants. Do whatever it takes to wake him up!

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:31.849
Yes. sir.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.319
Bring 25mL.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.159
You shouldn't be walking around now. I told you to lie down.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.319
I have a favor to ask.

00:19:11.389 --> 00:19:12.889
Okay. let's go back to the treatment room.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960
You shouldn't be moving around now.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.300
Make me stronger.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.800
What are you talking about?

00:19:19.899 --> 00:19:21.430
The injection I got right here.

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:24.139
I can get it elsewhere. right?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.169
You can inject it all over my body.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:30.240
Why are you being like this? Did something happen?

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:31.309
Please just do it for me.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.609
No. it's dangerous.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.220
If there are adverse effects. we'll have to cut them off.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.180
You should've just cut it off back then.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.020
Instead of making me become like this.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.290
you should've just cut it all off back then.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.159
What is this?

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:50.800
I'm neither a human nor a monster.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.230
Make me become at least one of the two.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.240
So? Which one do you want to become?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.169
What do you really want to become?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.409
Do you know how many times we injected sedatives into Z-0?

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.980
It was enough to kill him. but he woke up and did this to me.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.619
What should I become...

00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:14.690
to be able to catch him?

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.220
You have to make me that strong if you want me to get him.

Stop talking nonsense.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.859

00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:33.309
Hey. get him out of here.

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:34.609
Do it for him.

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:36.280
And for me too.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.980
I want to put an end to this.

00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:43.550
whether that means I'll stay human...

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.319

- Hey. come on. - Shall I request a warrant?

00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:25.489

You know what the adverse effects are.

00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:38.689
It stimulates the cells to a great degree.

00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:41.229
which strengthens your muscles and helps you recover faster.

00:22:41.699 --> 00:22:45.028
But it also means that your cells can age and die faster as well.

00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:47.399
Stuff like that. right?

00:22:47.538 --> 00:22:49.239
It may also cause infertility.

Yes.

00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:58.529
Gu Reum.

00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.868
What now?

00:36:10.939 --> 00:36:12.808
What will you yell at me about this time?

00:36:13.368 --> 00:36:15.339
I'm working hard.

00:36:24.488 --> 00:36:27.888
I really didn't put your phone inside the microwave.

00:36:28.118 --> 00:36:30.118
- Did you hear the news? - What news?

00:36:30.189 --> 00:36:31.189
So you haven't heard?

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.959
What's going on? Did something happen?

00:36:37.368 --> 00:36:39.468
Let's go. I'll tell you on the way.

00:36:58.118 --> 00:36:59.288
Hey. Gu Reum!

00:37:00.258 --> 00:37:02.218
Goodness. Yes. go.

00:37:03.189 --> 00:37:04.258
Gu Reum!

00:37:13.328 --> 00:37:14.399
Gu Reum!

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:16.169
Wait! Just a second!

00:37:20.879 --> 00:37:22.979
Gu Reum. calm down.

00:37:23.038 --> 00:37:24.908
- They need to do an autopsy now. - Hold on.

00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:27.218
- Wait until the autopsy is done. - Just a second!

00:38:36.019 --> 00:38:38.589
I heard Gu Reum and Professor Oh were very close.

00:38:40.658 --> 00:38:41.658
Yes.

00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:44.788
And he was very fond of her.

00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:46.529
Yes. he was.

00:41:42.638 --> 00:41:43.638
Hands off.

00:41:52.479 --> 00:41:53.549
Let go.

00:42:03.288 --> 00:42:05.488
"I wish he was my father."

00:42:05.488 --> 00:42:07.229
Has anyone ever made you feel that way?

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:13.368
I went to his funeral today.

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.439
I've been on my own for a long time.

00:42:18.908 --> 00:42:20.538
And now. I'm really alone.

00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:23.578
I have no one.

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:26.879
I'm truly alone now.

00:42:29.618 --> 00:42:30.988
It's easier that way.

00:42:31.618 --> 00:42:34.788
You looked all devastated because you felt so alone.

00:42:36.819 --> 00:42:38.428
Life is no big deal.

00:42:39.388 --> 00:42:42.359
You just watch other people die while you're alive.

00:42:42.629 --> 00:42:44.368
but you don't need to worry about that if you're alone.

00:42:47.738 --> 00:42:50.868
Good for you that you're such a loner.

00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:17.058
Don't run away.

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:21.658
Don't go until I tell you to.

00:44:23.729 --> 00:44:26.229
Don't go. Ever.

00:45:11.078 --> 00:45:12.209
I won't go.

00:45:13.049 --> 00:45:14.118
Ever.

00:45:22.618 --> 00:45:23.658
No.

00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:25.428
Why not?

00:45:25.488 --> 00:45:27.658
It's a closed case. Why would we request an investigation?

00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:29.999
You know as well as I do that Professor Oh doesn't drink.

00:45:30.058 --> 00:45:32.499
He got into an accident because someone who doesn't drink drank.

00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:35.169
Why did he drink that much alcohol in his car?

00:45:35.698 --> 00:45:37.939
It wasn't a simple DUI.

00:45:39.968 --> 00:45:41.379
There's no evidence of foul play.

00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:42.709
Look at the circumstances.

00:45:42.738 --> 00:45:43.738
Evidence. not circumstances.

00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:45.848
There something called circumstantial evidence.

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:51.919
Didn't you see the autopsy report? There was nothing in the lungs.

00:45:52.019 --> 00:45:53.919
No one forced the liquor down his throat.

00:45:54.488 --> 00:45:55.718
He drank it voluntarily.

00:45:57.859 --> 00:45:59.488
He was on the phone with me.

00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:02.729
He said he'd call me right back. and then that happened.

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:06.029
If it were an accident. his dashcam wouldn't have been off.

00:46:06.098 --> 00:46:07.129
Did I turn it off?

00:46:10.339 --> 00:46:13.169
I'll just check his call records and email.

00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:15.678
The prosecutor already closed the case.

00:46:15.738 --> 00:46:17.279
They said to close it!

00:46:18.448 --> 00:46:20.308
Will they reopen the case because we say so?

00:46:20.979 --> 00:46:24.589
I was taught that a cop must suspect and confirm their suspicions.

00:46:25.288 --> 00:46:26.948
How can a cop drop it when it's suspicious...

00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:28.419
just because it's closed?

00:46:28.488 --> 00:46:29.519
Yes. we can.

00:46:36.359 --> 00:46:37.569
Aren't you ashamed?

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:40.399
Even if I am. that's the rule.

00:46:41.399 --> 00:46:44.638
What if I find evidence?

00:46:45.238 --> 00:46:48.178
Will you bury it then too. saying it's a closed case?

00:46:48.279 --> 00:46:49.339
Do you have evidence?

00:46:49.538 --> 00:46:50.609
Not yet.

00:46:50.678 --> 00:46:51.879
Come to me once you do.

00:46:53.348 --> 00:46:56.578
Exactly. Request a warrant so that I can find evidence.

00:46:58.019 --> 00:47:01.859
Okay. Fine. I'll do it. Wait a second.

00:47:03.988 --> 00:47:04.988
Where is it?

00:47:08.598 --> 00:47:10.399
Here. Shoot me.

00:47:11.098 --> 00:47:12.968
- Captain. - Shoot me.

00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:14.698
and do everything you want!

00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:21.738
- It's empty. - Want bullets?

00:47:22.078 --> 00:47:23.439
- Yes. - You'll shoot me?

00:47:23.508 --> 00:47:24.578
You said to.

00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:28.379
Must you do this?

00:47:29.979 --> 00:47:31.249
I will investigate this.

00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:34.019
Okay. do it. Do it!

00:47:34.888 --> 00:47:36.189
Investigate! Go ahead!

00:47:36.258 --> 00:47:38.729
But you're not a part of our family anymore.

00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:42.098
You make the team look bad and do as you please.

00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:45.129
What about your senior detectives here?

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:49.069
You think they're all useless. right?

00:47:52.638 --> 00:47:55.109
If that's how you plan to work. go back to Major Crimes.

00:47:55.178 --> 00:47:56.578
I'll send you if you want.

00:48:01.749 --> 00:48:02.749
Go.

00:48:12.629 --> 00:48:15.029
He has such a temper.

00:48:18.868 --> 00:48:19.999
Are you all right?

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:23.098
I'm sorry.

00:48:23.799 --> 00:48:25.939
It's not like they'll give us a warrant if we ask.

00:48:27.169 --> 00:48:28.839
Put together a convincing scenario...

00:48:29.408 --> 00:48:31.078
and shove it in their faces so that they can't complain.

00:48:32.178 --> 00:48:33.249
I'll do it.

00:48:34.919 --> 00:48:36.379
It'll be hard to get a warrant.

00:48:36.979 --> 00:48:39.089
so question people in Professor Oh's life.

00:48:39.448 --> 00:48:40.848
You're an expert on digging into people's lives.

00:48:44.019 --> 00:48:45.229
Sorry I can't help you.

00:49:03.738 --> 00:49:05.578
The female detective is heading to NFS.

00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:07.479
We'll get her on her way back.

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.749
so get set up on the road.

00:49:09.819 --> 00:49:11.919
No. there was nothing strange.

00:49:12.618 --> 00:49:13.718
Nothing?

00:49:13.788 --> 00:49:16.819
Like... Did he get a call from someone?

00:49:17.189 --> 00:49:18.229
No. nobody.

00:49:19.129 --> 00:49:21.328
Everyone was frantic that day.

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.468
All of the computers were down because we were hacked.

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:27.769
The phones were ringing off the hook.

00:49:28.038 --> 00:49:30.738
IT people were coming in and out nonstop.

00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:35.178
That's right.

00:49:35.738 --> 00:49:39.908
Professor Oh had sent the academy some material.

00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:42.118
He was on the phone for a while about it.

00:49:43.319 --> 00:49:45.118
Do you know who at the academy?

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.718
I'm not sure.

00:49:48.718 --> 00:49:49.919
But it'll be useless.

00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:52.089
The academy's system was hacked too.

00:49:52.158 --> 00:49:55.158
I heard that they lost all of their files too.

00:49:57.629 --> 00:50:00.069
Maybe that was why he drank.

00:50:04.238 --> 00:50:05.269
Have you...

00:50:07.008 --> 00:50:09.279
ever drunk with Professor Oh?

00:50:09.408 --> 00:50:10.408
No.

00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:12.779
Not even once.

00:50:13.879 --> 00:50:16.218
He turns red after just one drink.

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:18.049
so he hated going to drinking events.

00:50:18.488 --> 00:50:19.549
Right.

00:50:20.218 --> 00:50:21.558
Is that for the professor?

00:50:22.788 --> 00:50:23.819
Yes.

00:50:24.258 --> 00:50:25.359
Let's go.

00:50:30.499 --> 00:50:32.299
(Central Hall)

00:51:07.029 --> 00:51:08.339
Just leave it.

00:51:09.368 --> 00:51:12.008
General Affairs will do it in a few days.

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:14.269
I'll clean a little before I go.

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.058
We're nearing the spot.

00:52:37.558 --> 00:52:38.589
Turn off the engine.

00:52:39.888 --> 00:52:40.928
Turning off the engine.

00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:07.589
Step on the brake and turn on the engine.

00:53:30.879 --> 00:53:31.879
Darn it.

00:53:42.082 --> 00:53:43.082
Darn it.

00:53:47.841 --> 00:53:48.881
Breaking news.

00:53:48.942 --> 00:53:51.951
We just received word that around 1pm this afternoon.

00:53:52.011 --> 00:53:54.752
a Violent Crimes detective was abducted...

00:53:54.752 --> 00:53:58.051
by unidentified perpetrators on Route 13 in Juan.

00:53:58.551 --> 00:54:01.491
This is the first time an active detective...

00:54:01.562 --> 00:54:02.991
was abducted in broad daylight.

00:54:03.392 --> 00:54:06.091
The detective who was abducted is Lieutenant Ha.

00:54:06.161 --> 00:54:08.232
a female detective who had solved...

00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:10.402
numerous violent crime cases.

00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:12.201
According to the police.

00:54:12.272 --> 00:54:15.201
she was returning to the station from NFS.

00:54:15.272 --> 00:54:16.341
The car disappeared.

00:54:16.402 --> 00:54:18.841
and all that remained at the scene was a knife handle.

00:54:20.712 --> 00:54:23.511
Given how this occurred on an isolated road.

00:54:23.582 --> 00:54:26.812
the perpetrators seem to have known what route she'd take...

00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:28.852
and ambushed her.

00:54:29.152 --> 00:54:30.922
Considering the meticulous plan...

00:54:30.982 --> 00:54:33.792
and the circumstances surrounding the incident...

00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:36.221
Zi O.

00:54:38.462 --> 00:54:39.591
Are you alone?

00:54:40.991 --> 00:54:42.732
Why? So you can sell me out again?

00:54:43.002 --> 00:54:45.631
Hey. That's... That's a misunderstanding.

00:54:45.902 --> 00:54:48.542
I didn't sell you out. I gave you to them for free.

00:54:48.602 --> 00:54:49.902
I didn't receive anything.

00:54:49.971 --> 00:54:51.812
Look what they did to this place.

00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:53.841
But I didn't even get money to replace the window.

00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:57.642
- Where's the phone? - Zi O.

00:55:04.752 --> 00:55:05.792
Call them.

00:55:07.152 --> 00:55:09.192
- Stop that. - Call. Now.

00:55:09.261 --> 00:55:10.422
What do you mean?

00:55:11.221 --> 00:55:13.261
- Sell me out. - That's not it.

00:55:13.332 --> 00:55:16.161
- Sell me out. - What are you talking about?

00:55:16.232 --> 00:55:18.402
I didn't get a dime from them.

00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:20.902
Why are you doing this to me?

00:55:21.272 --> 00:55:22.701
I won't run anymore.

00:55:24.071 --> 00:55:25.212
Call them.

00:55:41.022 --> 00:55:42.091
Talk.

00:55:42.161 --> 00:55:46.031
Hello. So... I'm with him now.

00:55:47.732 --> 00:55:49.332
He says to sell him out to you.

00:55:50.232 --> 00:55:51.301
Was it you?

00:55:52.931 --> 00:55:54.701
- It's you. - Why did you do it?

00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:56.971
This is the beginning.

00:55:57.402 --> 00:56:00.111
If you still don't show up. I'll kill everyone you know.

00:56:00.172 --> 00:56:03.212
I'll find everyone who ever talked to you. and kill them.

00:56:03.642 --> 00:56:05.681
- Where's the woman? - Right here.

00:56:06.582 --> 00:56:08.152
I'll give you the address. Come.

00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:10.221
- No. - Even if she dies?

00:56:11.352 --> 00:56:12.991
If you want me. you come and get me.

00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:14.591
LC Plaza in two hours.

00:56:14.652 --> 00:56:16.462
If you don't listen. she dies.

00:56:18.192 --> 00:56:20.361
Kill her after you kill me. Bring her.

00:56:27.602 --> 00:56:30.442
He must like you. He's freaking out.

00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:36.812
You killed him.

00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:39.381
- Who? - I've killed quite a few people.

00:56:39.451 --> 00:56:42.381
Professor Oh. You people did it!

00:56:43.582 --> 00:56:45.491
You gave him Z-0's biological information.

00:56:45.551 --> 00:56:46.792
He died because of you.

00:56:46.852 --> 00:56:48.591
He'd be alive if you had stayed still.

00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:52.531
Untie me. you dirtbag! I'm going to kill you all!

00:56:52.861 --> 00:56:53.991
You'll die soon too.

00:56:54.462 --> 00:56:55.562
Don't waste your energy.

00:56:58.402 --> 00:56:59.602
I'm borrowing your phone.

00:56:59.672 --> 00:57:03.172
No. I still have a year left in the contract.

00:57:03.241 --> 00:57:06.071
I didn't get insurance. If you take it...

00:57:06.872 --> 00:57:07.911
Fine.

00:57:09.241 --> 00:57:10.911
Go on. Go.

00:57:12.381 --> 00:57:16.181
Hey. I don't care where and how you live.

00:57:16.252 --> 00:57:19.192
but please cut ties with me. okay?

00:57:19.792 --> 00:57:21.922
Don't come to me ever again.

00:57:21.991 --> 00:57:24.022
Even if we cross paths. just keep walking.

00:57:24.892 --> 00:57:27.232
Don't look at me like that.

00:57:29.002 --> 00:57:30.131
Even still...

00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:33.772
I was always on your side.

00:57:34.672 --> 00:57:36.241
Even when you set fire to the church.

00:57:36.301 --> 00:57:38.442
I lied that it wasn't you.

00:57:39.172 --> 00:57:43.042
Yes. No matter how scared I was. I always opened the door for you.

00:57:45.082 --> 00:57:46.852
I did that because we were friends.

00:57:49.582 --> 00:57:52.122
- Are we even friends? - That's right. we're friends.

00:57:52.652 --> 00:57:54.152
Are we true friends?

00:57:57.522 --> 00:57:59.361
Neither of us has friends anyway.

00:58:00.062 --> 00:58:02.602
We have no friends. so we're friendly to each other.

00:58:04.462 --> 00:58:06.201
I'll be back if I need to.

00:58:10.542 --> 00:58:12.172
I said don't come back.

00:58:12.241 --> 00:58:13.372
As you already know.

00:58:15.142 --> 00:58:17.082
I hardly remember anything.

00:58:17.312 --> 00:58:19.451
I'll remember only good things about you from now on.

00:58:19.951 --> 00:58:21.181
What the...

00:58:21.852 --> 00:58:23.381
Are we starting a relationship or something?

00:58:23.451 --> 00:58:24.451
Thanks.

00:58:28.252 --> 00:58:30.721
- I'm taking your car. - Hey. Hey.

00:58:30.792 --> 00:58:32.261
No. No.

00:58:32.332 --> 00:58:34.991
Hey. I still have payments left on that!

00:58:35.062 --> 00:58:36.562
Hey! Hey...

00:58:40.372 --> 00:58:41.502
Darn it!

00:59:57.712 --> 00:59:59.111
- Are you here? - Where's the woman?

00:59:59.451 --> 01:00:00.652
Come and see for yourself.

01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:03.522
After I've confirmed her face. Call me.

01:00:25.772 --> 01:00:27.542
- I can't see her face. - Confirm.

01:00:28.372 --> 01:00:29.781
Say goodbye.

01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:42.221
We should meet.

01:00:42.991 --> 01:00:45.591
Come to the first floor. Elevator number three.

01:00:45.661 --> 01:00:47.531
Try anything stupid. and this woman dies.

01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:52.172
First floor. Elevator number three.

01:00:53.471 --> 01:00:55.102
Kill her if anything happens.

01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:40.281
That rat.

01:03:15.381 --> 01:03:16.381
Are you okay?

01:03:16.982 --> 01:03:18.312
We have to get those scumbags.

01:03:18.911 --> 01:03:20.511
They killed Professor Oh.

01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.181
Gu Reum.

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.422
Who said you could say my name?

01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:27.622
Listen.

01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:31.562
If I don't die.

01:03:32.732 --> 01:03:33.761
I'll go to you.

01:03:35.962 --> 01:03:37.031
What are you talking about?

01:03:37.361 --> 01:03:38.772
I'll stay alive and find you.

01:03:39.602 --> 01:03:41.832
Even if I don't remember you. I'll still find you.

01:03:42.002 --> 01:03:43.471
So run away.

01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:45.341
- What? - I'm going to fight.

01:03:45.411 --> 01:03:46.442
No.

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:49.442
- I'll fight. You... - Later.

01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:51.281
You need to stay alive to figure out...

01:03:51.341 --> 01:03:53.082
whether or not I killed your parents.

01:03:53.352 --> 01:03:54.611
What if I'm the killer?

01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:56.381
You have to be alive to kill me.

01:03:56.982 --> 01:03:58.122
So live.

01:03:58.721 --> 01:03:59.991
You can't do it alone.

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:02.491
It's too dangerous.

01:04:11.531 --> 01:04:12.571
Bye.

01:04:23.982 --> 01:04:25.482
Don't you smell burning flesh?

01:04:26.252 --> 01:04:27.312
I don't see Tae Oh.

01:04:45.332 --> 01:04:46.672
Track Tae Oh's phone.

01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:50.471
I got a signal.

01:05:12.462 --> 01:05:13.491
His phone just turned off.

01:05:13.562 --> 01:05:15.531
- Do you have its location? - Of course.

01:05:31.082 --> 01:05:32.111
Who are you guys?

01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:38.652
Do you know...

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:41.392
what the toughest training I've ever received was?

01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:43.462
Hostage situation.

01:05:44.422 --> 01:05:46.892
What I must do if the enemy...

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:48.462
takes me hostage.

01:05:49.102 --> 01:05:52.602
Some of my peers died during that training.

01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:55.571
I'll ask one last time. Who are you people?

01:06:01.772 --> 01:06:04.042
You can't get me to say anything.

01:06:04.482 --> 01:06:06.082
All you can do...

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.781
is beat me up.

01:06:11.652 --> 01:06:13.392
You'll get more nervous the more you hit me.

01:06:17.292 --> 01:06:18.292
Why?

01:06:19.832 --> 01:06:21.631
Because I won't say a word.

01:06:27.571 --> 01:06:29.142
Darn it!

01:06:38.812 --> 01:06:40.712
You'll either kill me...

01:06:42.451 --> 01:06:44.252
or run away in fear.

01:06:52.492 --> 01:06:54.032
Get started!

01:08:26.492 --> 01:08:27.522
Captain!

01:08:38.131 --> 01:08:39.171
Captain!

01:08:40.402 --> 01:08:41.671
He's alive. but...

01:08:42.572 --> 01:08:43.602
his arm...

01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:31.352
Yes. Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum is on our team.

01:09:32.852 --> 01:09:33.852
I understand.

01:09:36.062 --> 01:09:37.362
I said I got it.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.331
It means. I'll look into it.

01:09:40.692 --> 01:09:42.402
I'll look into it and call you back.

01:09:45.331 --> 01:09:46.931
I'm busy dealing with the situation.

01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:48.171
How can I be quick?

01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:49.642
Didn't you see the news?

01:09:50.742 --> 01:09:52.541
She's the detective who was abducted.

01:10:00.181 --> 01:10:01.251
Gu Reum!

01:10:04.652 --> 01:10:07.392
Gu Reum! What happened?

01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:08.591
Are you okay?

01:10:08.591 --> 01:10:10.162
Are you hurt?

01:10:10.221 --> 01:10:11.822
How did you escape?

01:10:12.022 --> 01:10:13.032
First...

01:10:13.492 --> 01:10:15.032
She needs a doctor.

01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:16.162
Quiet.

01:10:16.562 --> 01:10:18.001
She needs to be treated first...

01:10:18.062 --> 01:10:19.072
I said. quiet!

01:10:29.112 --> 01:10:30.142
Were you really abducted?

01:10:30.511 --> 01:10:32.282
I escaped from the trunk of their car.

01:10:33.612 --> 01:10:36.352
Remember the plates I asked to run a few days ago?

01:10:37.322 --> 01:10:38.822
I think it was them.

01:10:39.591 --> 01:10:40.621
Really?

01:10:44.761 --> 01:10:46.961
Come with me. You too.

01:10:48.091 --> 01:10:49.102
What?

01:10:53.202 --> 01:10:54.272
Captain.

01:12:35.072 --> 01:12:37.902
You used your brain. but not well enough.

01:12:39.171 --> 01:12:42.541
We're experts on luring and tailing.

01:12:52.721 --> 01:12:56.221
You came all this way. We should put an end to each other.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:58.761
If you take me down.

01:13:03.162 --> 01:13:04.501
you can enter here.

01:13:16.841 --> 01:13:19.782
Everything about you is in here.

01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:51.181
(L.U.C.A.: The Beginning)

01:13:51.912 --> 01:13:53.751
Where's Zi O? Where are you hiding him?

01:13:53.812 --> 01:13:57.081
Secretly make a few copies of the somatic cells.

01:13:57.152 --> 01:13:59.022
Kill all the other researchers too.

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:01.322
We can't let word get out that a scientist invented it.

01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:02.492
What is all this?

01:14:02.662 --> 01:14:05.362
I don't think she should've come to our team.

01:14:06.362 --> 01:14:07.631
Who are you?

01:14:07.761 --> 01:14:11.032
It seems professional. like it's an organization.

01:14:12.131 --> 01:14:13.431
I'll kill him myself.

01:14:15.471 --> 01:14:17.242
Where are you?

01:14:17.902 --> 01:14:18.902
Zi O.
