to the best pupil driver
for BP in London.

868
00:38:39.325 --> 00:38:40.453
You'll have to make a speech.

869

DAVID: The whole Brabham
Formula One program

872
00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:53.724
was formalized
when Dan Gurney joined in 1963.

873
00:38:54.914 --> 00:38:57.410
ANNOUNCER: Still out in front.
Dan "The Man" Gurney.

874
00:38:58.562 --> 00:39:00.843
NARRATOR: Early
into the 1963 program.

875
00:39:00.943 --> 00:39:02.647
Jack's hopes of
another championship

876
00:39:02.656 --> 00:39:04.337
were already looking unlikely.

ANNOUNCER: Behind. number six.
Jack Brabham.

and the engine would fail.

PRESENTER: ...with fuel trouble
five laps from the end.

880
00:39:11.426 --> 00:39:13.345
Very bad luck.

881
00:39:13.921 --> 00:39:15.548
NARRATOR: The days of being
single-mindedly focused

882
00:39:15.558 --> 00:39:17.162
on the track

883
00:39:17.262 --> 00:39:19.758
must have seemed like
a luxury now to Jack.

884
00:39:20.065 --> 00:39:22.331
He had cars to build
and payroll to meet.

885
00:39:22.715 --> 00:39:25.149
He was racing against. you know.
the Jimmy Clarks.

but. you know. unlike them.

888
00:39:28.705 --> 00:39:31.677
he had other business ventures
going on as well.

889
00:39:31.777 --> 00:39:34.288
NARRATOR: He was also being
outclassed in the field

890
00:39:34.388 --> 00:39:35.324
by Dan Gurney.

891
00:39:35.424 --> 00:39:37.628
ANNOUNCER: Dan Gurney. driving
a Brabham-Climax. number 9.

892

until engine trouble.

893
00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:41.890
NARRATOR: By the end of 1963.

894
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.196
Dan was starting to sense

895
00:39:43.296 --> 00:39:46.114
that Jack didn't want to spend
the money needed to compete

896
00:39:46.214 --> 00:39:48.111

and Ferrari.

897

They'd work long hours.

902
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.700
MAN: Here. Jack has gathered
a team of experts

903
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.989
to bring a car first over
the finishing line.

904
00:40:07.333 --> 00:40:09.230
NARRATOR: Finally.
it all came together

905
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.881
at the French Grand Prix.

906
00:40:10.981 --> 00:40:12.916
ANNOUNCER: Jim Clark and
Dan Gurney in hot pursuit.

907
00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:15.642
NARRATOR: Gurney had bagged
a win for Brabham Racing.

908
00:40:15.742 --> 00:40:18.023

in a Brabham. of course.

914
00:40:28.606 --> 00:40:31.616
NARRATOR: It had been four years
since he had won an F1 race

915
00:40:31.716 --> 00:40:34.112
and the aura around him
as a champion

916
00:40:34.212 --> 00:40:35.801
was quickly fading.

917
00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:38.374
PRESENTER: In the third lap.
Dan Gurney was in real trouble.

918
00:40:38.474 --> 00:40:40.332
NARRATOR: Gurney's patience
was wearing thin

919
00:40:40.432 --> 00:40:42.367
with Jack's reluctance
to spend money.

920
00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:43.788
PRESENTER: He'd just broken
the lap record

921
00:40:43.888 --> 00:40:45.170
when he had to drive into
the pitch

922
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.190
with his transistor ignition
on fire.

923
00:40:47.498 --> 00:40:50.277
NARRATOR: Things with Ron were
also starting to fall apart.

924
00:40:50.377 --> 00:40:53.080
All the journalists
believed that he was responsible

925
00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.446
for the design
and build of the cars.

NARRATOR: Gurney won again
at the season-ending

Mexico Grand Prix.

929
00:41:02.434 --> 00:41:04.369

NARRATOR: Dan was now
the only one winning anything.

932
00:41:08.847 --> 00:41:11.611
But no one seemed to be
celebrating his achievements.

They didn't celebrate at all.

934

They really were
like a bunch of Trappist monks.

935
00:41:16.949 --> 00:41:19.713
I never saw Jack really
let his hair down at any time.

936
00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:22.340
He wasn't really that
sort of bloke.

937
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.373
He probably just went away
quietly and counted his money.

938

for a couple of hours.

for a race car

that many revs available.

okay. what am I gonna do
in ten years' time?

1548
01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:34.037

about doing something

that my dad did

01:11:56.639 --> 01:11:59.687
was that he lost control
of the name.

That's our name.

To come out the other side
as a success

1704

part of the drive for this

that David does know
