2
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.364
Once upon a time.

3
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.336
humans lived with
many other creatures.

4
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.673
including...

5
00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.106
monsters.

6
00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.039
But humans wanted to
monopolize the world.

7
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.513
and so they
declared war on monsters.

8
00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.915
The monsters lost...

9
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.526
and were expelled
to remote mountains.

10
00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.712
They were not allowed to cross
the border ever since.

11
00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:45.890
Now.

12
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.361
there is a civil war
in the monster world.

13
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.951
The old Monster King was killed-.

14
00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:54.130
To totally cut off the old king's power.

15
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:58.260
the new Monster King massacred
the loyal former ministers.

16
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.822
The old Queen is now pregnant.

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.453
Escaping from the killers sent by
the new Monster King.

18
00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.761
she is forced to flee
to the human world...

19
00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:26.926
under the protection of...

20
00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.397
surviving supporters.

21
00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:33.627
Legend says that...

22
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:35.565
this expected baby king...

23
00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.769
will change both the human
and monster worlds.

24
00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.394
(MONSTER LANGUAGE) This way!

25
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.700
(MONSTER LANGUAGE) Hands off my kid!

26
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.381
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
Your Majesty. we're here to save you!

27
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.443
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
Watch out. Your Highness!

28
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.530
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
I can't walk anymore.

29
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.885
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
What are you staring at? She's my wife!

30
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.442
"Yongning Village."

31
00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:26.802
Mayor.

32
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:28.241
Hurry up!

33
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.109
Be careful.

34
00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.580
I saw it first.

35
00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:31.445
Nonsense.

36
00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:32.779
- I picked it first.
- Give it to me.

37
00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.647
- It's perfect for me.
- You're too fat.

38
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.914
- I'm not fat!
- Our mayor is coming.

39
00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:38.454
Stop fighting.

40
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.784
Here's the mayor.

41
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.194
Mama Li. Auntie Mo.

42
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.453
we all live in (he same village...

43
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.521
Shut up!

44
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:49.281
It's a mayor's job to...

45
00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.198
Quiet!

46
00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.498
- I'm the mayor and...
- Have you sewn the clothes?

47
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:53.866
Have you cleaned the toilet?

48
00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:55.302
Not yet.

49
00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:57.304
Don't go!

50
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.306
He's our mayor!

51
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.310
You ladies shouldn't treat him like that.

52
00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:09.549
Mayor.

53
00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:11.347
your leg brace.

54
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.056
Xiaowu.

55
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:15.725
sorry.

56
00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.194
Go and fix our clothes-.

57
00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:24.964
Xiaowu.

58
00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:25.999
thanks.

59
00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.561
No problem at all.

60
00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:28.998
I'll go deliver now.

61
00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.704
Grandma?

62
00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:36.978
Grandma?

63
00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:00.534
Grand...

64
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.170
Who are you?

65
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.071
Tianyin.

66
00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.109
Who is Tianyin?

67
00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.377
Your grandson.

68
00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.945
Who's grandson?

69
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.544
Your son's son.

70
00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:15.777
My son is first-tier palace
swordsman Song Daitian.

71
00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:16.680
Let me tell you.

72
00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.416
This is our Song family heritage...

73
00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.115
monster killing sword!

74
00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:22.224
It's actually more like a toy.

75
00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:24.451
I won't play with you.

76
00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:25.688
You're so dumb.

77
00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:28.062
You don't understand a thing.

78
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.890
Hanging around with nothing to do.

79
00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.401
you really don't act like a man.

80
00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.236
I'm busy every day.

81
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.796
sewing and cooking.

82
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.976
Did you practice our Song
family special moves today?

83
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:38.735
No.

84
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.281
You are such a loser.

85
00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.879
Grandma will leave home for a few days...

86
00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:47.951
to look for your dad.

87
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:48.951
Grandma.

88
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.150
you've been searching for
that guy for years-.

89
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:52.383
Shouldn't you give up?

90
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.219
Your dad is the hero of the
Monster Hunt Bureau.

91
00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:58.123
What kind of hero dumps his wife and son?

92
00:06:58.285 --> 00:06:59.127
Coward!

93
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.458
Your dad is...

94
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.964
a first-tier palace swordsman.

95
00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:04.001
He left the whole village to you.

96
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.398
so protecting the villagers is....

97
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.402
my duty.

98
00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.961
Then you shouldn't fall
short of your dad's...

99
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:08.971
expectations.

100
00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:10.905
See you.

101
00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.990
Monsters are not accepted
in the human world.

102
00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:37.633
If any of them crossed the border.

103
00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:41.836
we used to have the Monster Hunt Bureau
take care of them.

104
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.172
And they did such a good job that

105
00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:46.144
people nowadays don't
know monsters even exist.

106
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.113
Since the last dynasty.

107
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.645
almost all monsters crossing the border...

108
00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.654
were caught.

109
00:07:57.544 --> 00:07:58.887
The Monster Hunt Bureau...

110
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.287
became useless and closed.

111
00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:02.188
Great monster hunters like you
turned into normal people...

112
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.795
and served small businessmen like me.

113
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.020
You were totally wronged.

114
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:07.961
Now.

115
00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.833
your time has come!

116
00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.976
If one of you....

117
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.745
can grab that expected baby monster king.

118
00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:31.818
the monster world will be in chaos...

119
00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:34.188
and monsters will flee all over-.

120
00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:35.688
Then.

121
00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:39.026
the emperor must rely on you all
to suppress them.

122
00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:42.065
The Monster Hunt Bureau
will be strong again.

123
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.162
Come on.

124
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.506
Let's toast to our great fortune.

125
00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:51.372
Cheers!

126
00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.611
I was so awesome.

127
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.354
I hit his belly with my head-.

128
00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.426
You didn't see how...

129
00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:12.123
Hi.

130
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.253
how are you?

131
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.966
Smells delicious!

132
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.414
We can have something to eat.

133
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.312
Right.

134
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.044
My restaurant is that way.

135
00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.188
We have our signature
dish. duck blood pudding.

136
00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.586
Why do you keep walking around me?

137
00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:41.057
Stop chatting with this limp.

138
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.089
We're in a hurry!

139
00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:43.559
Ignore him!

140
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.757
He's jealous...

141
00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.059
when I pay attention to others.

142
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.565
Because I'm his...

143
00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:52.963
first love-.

144
00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.774
Why do you tell that to everyone you meet?

145
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.900
I won't tell you anything anymore!

146
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.404
He's blushing!

147
00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.172
See.

148
00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.974
he looks so cute when he blushes!

149
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:04.104
You're mean and crazy!

150
00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:05.612
Let's go!

151
00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.140
He's not going.

152
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.318
But I will.

153
00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:10.617
Fine. fine. fine! I'll go.

154
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.367
Our Yongning Village...

155
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.256
hasn't had visitors for ages.

156
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.870
Can you tell me...

157
00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.191
about your adventures?

158
00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.490
Sure.

159
00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:21.825
I'll...

160
00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:23.296
tell you...

161
00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:25.161
while I eat you...

162
00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:29.668
This way.

163
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.600
Here we are.

164
00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:38.045
We've arrived.

165
00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:39.714
Please take a seat.

166
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.346
Let me...

167
00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:50.487
I will get you some water.

168
00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:51.559
Thanks.

169
00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:54.488
Can't wait to eat.

170
00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:18.419
What would you...

171
00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.985
like to order?

172
00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.921
- We...
- Is there any human meat...

173
00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:24.319
or human liver?

174
00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:33.669
It's only me here.

175
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.932
How about eating me first?

176
00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.889
I'll bring you the duck blood pudding.

177
00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:46.542
No one is allowed to leave.

178
00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:47.277
Right.

179
00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:48.383
No one-.

180
00:11:56.783 --> 00:11:57.523
Lady.

181
00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:58.619
What's your problem?

182
00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:00.597
Tell me your names!

183
00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:01.597
Song... Song Tianyin.

184
00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:02.723
Not you-.

185
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.698
I'm the gorgeous. elegant and

186
00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.738
coolest Lily.

187
00:12:07.794 --> 00:12:08.834
When did you make that up?

188
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:09.767
Just now.

189
00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:11.382
I like your original name Ying better.

190
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.931
How dare you hit my wife?

191
00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.948
Your skills are medio... cre...

192
00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:01.590
Still mediocre?

193
00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.328
If I wasn't injured earlier.

194
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.532
just a level two monster hunter like you...

195
00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.032
I'll be promoted to level three
after I've captured you both.

196
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.536
Little monster. what's your name?

197
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.106
I am...

198
00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:28.986
Gao.

199
00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:42.191
Hiding in such a skinny shell...

200
00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:43.733
is killing me!

201
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.832
See. we have serious business.

202
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:45.665
and all you can think about...

203
00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:46.726
is eating!

204
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.870
But that limp smells delicious.

205
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:49.735
You never learn.

206
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.430
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
Ma ta ta ku la fa fa.

207
00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.539
Foul language?

208
00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.874
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
You say that again and...

209
00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.848
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
I'll kick your ass very hard.

210
00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:00.473
Oh. baby. You're right.

211
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.017
It's all my fault.

212
00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:08.255
Oh no. Her Majesty fell out!

213
00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.091
Save the queen!

214
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:29.373
Freeze!

215
00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:31.176
I won't look.
I won't look. I won't look.

216
00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.541
Freeze!

217
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.379
Ying. I'll save you.

218
00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.467
Salilongchong Freeze.

219
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:05.580
Perfect!

220
00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.916
An ma hong.

221
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.388
Luogang!

222
00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:17.121
They are mine.

223
00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:18.553
How can you say...

224
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:19.959
they're yours?

225
00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:21.323
Whoever has the monsters...

226
00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:22.432
gets the money.

227
00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:29.432
Your Highness! Run!

228
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:37.508
Luogang!

229
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.513
This is not fair.

230
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:39.476
To me.

231
00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:41.144
this is totally fair.

232
00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:44.677
Thief!

233
00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.596
I'm the mayor in this village.

234
00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:54.925
You've just killed people.

235
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.324
What people did I kill?

236
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.594
They're all monsters!

237
00:15:58.791 --> 00:15:59.633
Monsters?

238
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.438
Of course-.

239
00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:05.273
They're monsters
covered with human skin.

240
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.143
Ignorant.

241
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.303
Monsters are the
most cunning creatures...

242
00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.871
in the world.

243
00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:13.477
They hide in human skin.

244
00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:14.540
dress as humans...

245
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.675
and speak human language!

246
00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.015
Then how can I tell...

247
00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.518
if you're human or monster?

248
00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:40.336
So may I ask you something?

249
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.473
Did you win or lose the fight just now?

250
00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:46.478
I lost?

251
00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.412
If I lost. you'd have been eaten by them.

252
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.820
Idiot!

253
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.218
Make dinner!

254
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.651
I'm hungry!

255
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.089
I want something spicy!

256
00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:09.396
Question me?

257
00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.235
How could someone like me lose?

258
00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.705
Can't stop talking.

259
00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:21.213
but can cook quite well.

260
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.015
Even though I'm a bit crippled.

261
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.449
I do have great goals-.

262
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:25.852
You know what?

263
00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:27.721
Cooking is my third ideal job-.

264
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.421
How about the second?

265
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:30.289
Sewing.

266
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.127
Want to guess what's the first?

267
00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:34.924
How about the first?

268
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.533
The first is cooking plus sewing.

269
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:37.891
I'm a genius. right?

270
00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.641
Why would you catch monsters?

271
00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:52.279
To make money.

272
00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:54.046
Then why are you alone?

273
00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:57.652
Want to know?

274
00:17:57.777 --> 00:17:58.414
Yes.

275
00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:00.787
People who know too much about <i>me...

276
00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.153
I'll have their tongue cut off.

277
00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:16.500
Where're you going?

278
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.507
I'll sleep in my Grandma's room.

279
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.745
Sheep with me.

280
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.615
I stay here...

281
00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.278
so that I can sleep with you.

282
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:32.981
You?

283
00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.150
Hmm.

284
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:36.787
I'll go to prepare.

285
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:55.771
You like it this way?

286
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:12.727
Will it hurt?

287
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:13.819
What?

288
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.324
What do you expect?

289
00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:16.731
I'll gouge out your eyes!

290
00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:30.737
That monster spat on you...

291
00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.008
to leave a mark.

292
00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:33.818
which means she will find you again-.

293
00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:34.676
When she comes back.

294
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.084
she won't be able to escape my trap.

295
00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.588
Mi go oh.

296
00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:22.798
Nu gu oh ta gu oh.

297
00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:26.902
Tu gu oh ka gu oh.

298
00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:31.767
Yi ya gu oh.

299
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.709
Mi go oh.

300
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:39.647
Nu gu oh ta gu oh.

301
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:43.546
Tu gu oh. let me go!

302
00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:49.824
Yi ya gu oh.

303
00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:56.228
It can be sweet. sour. bitter. and spicy

304
00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:59.096
while you struggle for life.

305
00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:04.968
Living is an ongoing argument with

306
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.177
many complex appearances...

307
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.941
and cunning souls.

308
00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:16.653
So-called living is just
a battle of slaughtering.

309
00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:19.653
Who can ask for living in affluence?

310
00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:22.487
Don't be greedy while you
have enough to survive.

311
00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:26.025
Today you have power.

312
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.462
But tomorrow you may be at the bottom.

313
00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:31.600
You can be rich and healthy now.

314
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.296
Yet you can become poor and sick suddenly.

315
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:42.660
So be prepared and ready
to face any changes.

316
00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:45.371
Not too good.

317
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.376
My life is not too good.

318
00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:51.549
Hard living...

319
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.815
keeps trampling on us.

320
00:21:56.015 --> 00:21:57.688
Terrible.

321
00:21:58.017 --> 00:22:00.691
I'm not young anymore.

322
00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:03.729
Like a wretch. Cinders.

323
00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:07.629
setting sun.

324
00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:10.537
Although acting strong
and tough to be in charge.

325
00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:13.542
my opponents are even tougher.

326
00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:16.806
Play any extra roles just to get by.

327
00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:19.247
But nothing can be done right.

328
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:22.315
If you can give me a steamed chicken bun.

329
00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:25.321
I will do anything for you.

330
00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:28.881
To live is not easy at all.

331
00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:31.518
It can be messy and hard.

332
00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:34.428
Sweet. sour. bitter. spicy.

333
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.330
Too complicated in the human world.

334
00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:40.336
It is also not easy in the monster world.

335
00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:43.396
No matter how hard the obstacles are

336
00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.907
you can get through them if you try harder.

337
00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:48.342
Please help us and give
us some rice to eat.

338
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.850
Life is tough but we do have each other.

339
00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:57.953
We have to look for Her Majesty.

340
00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.723
She should've gone back to find that limp.

341
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:07.647
What do you want?

342
00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:19.869
(MONSTER LANGUAGE) I'm dying.

343
00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:23.302
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
I beg you. please save my baby.

344
00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.670
Can you speak... human language?

345
00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:28.777
(MONSTER LANGUAGE) I'm dying.

346
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:33.883
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
I beg you. please save my baby.

347
00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:14.722
Gulugulu Bang!

348
00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:18.223
Giant monster. I'll capture you.

349
00:25:25.324 --> 00:25:26.098
Freeze.

350
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:28.066
Freeze.

351
00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:11.414
(MONSTER LANGUAGE)
Please. Protect my baby.

352
00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:23.790
I some help you-.

353
00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:28.963
Run!

354
00:26:29.388 --> 00:26:30.924
I can't defeat it.

355
00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:33.735
Run!

356
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.138
Idiot!

357
00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:19.540
Almost time for dinner.

358
00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:23.114
Xiaowu. someone's entering the village.

359
00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.953
I've never seen them.

360
00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:41.371
What is going on?

361
00:27:45.197 --> 00:27:46.835
Still alive.

362
00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:49.002
Surely costly.

363
00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:50.673
Come. come. come.

364
00:27:50.903 --> 00:27:52.075
Sit. sit. sit-.

365
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.251
Two solutions.

366
00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:58.152
First.

367
00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.315
be pregnant for nine months.

368
00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:01.920
You'll give birth...

369
00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:03.353
sooner or later.

370
00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:04.659
Impossible!

371
00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:06.087
A man gives birth?

372
00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:07.255
Just let me die.

373
00:28:08.487 --> 00:28:10.194
- Are you sure?
- I'm a man!

374
00:28:10.322 --> 00:28:11.562
I'd rather die than give birth!

375
00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:12.601
What a man!

376
00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.200
Bite this.

377
00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:21.841
Why?

378
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.036
Simply make a cut here...

379
00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:25.613
and take it out.

380
00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.276
This is the second solution.

381
00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:28.442
If you out it this way.

382
00:28:28.607 --> 00:28:29.745
will it be painful?

383
00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.602
I'll cut fast with my sword-.

384
00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:32.246
Painless.

385
00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:33.049
No pain...

386
00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:34.883
but will I die?

387
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.124
Hard to tell.

388
00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:38.261
I'll be gentle.

389
00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:41.924
Forget it.

390
00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.524
I'd better keep it.

391
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.691
Aren't you a man?

392
00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.097
I'll be one after giving birth.

393
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.134
Awesome.

394
00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:55.572
Trade in a monster inside a human.

395
00:28:55.701 --> 00:28:56.805
Good business.

396
00:28:57.436 --> 00:28:59.211
Then don't complain anymore.

397
00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:15.727
Cripple.

398
00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:16.891
put me down.

399
00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:20.227
You're trapped.

400
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:23.471
I'll go to find help.

401
00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:24.836
Just wait for me here.

402
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.568
Don't let me get you.

403
00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.812
or I'll kill you for sure.

404
00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:31.909
Gouge out your eyes.

405
00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.610
cut off your tongue!

406
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.089
Why so quiet?

407
00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:42.618
Xiaowu.

408
00:29:42.681 --> 00:29:43.489
Who is it?

409
00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:44.492
It's Tianyin.

410
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.626
Open the door.

411
00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.453
Lots of strangers came today.

412
00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.488
They caught all the villagers.

413
00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:51.189
Only you and me...

414
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.798
are left.

415
00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.992
Don't worry.

416
00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.194
Let me come in first.

417
00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:01.876
Mayor.

418
00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:03.839
Who are you?

419
00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:04.709
It's me.

420
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:05.713
Xiaowu.

421
00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:07.544
I look different...

422
00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.118
but I'm really Xiaowu.

423
00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:09.979
Mayor.

424
00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:11.177
you must save us.

425
00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:12.721
Your dad promised to protect us.

426
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:15.018
You said... I am your best friend.

427
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:16.148
Why am I...

428
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.988
different?

429
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.051
Are there any others hiding here?

430
00:30:34.733 --> 00:30:35.473
Tell me.

431
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.253
Weng ba zha hu lu hu lu.

432
00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.916
This is ridiculous.

433
00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:22.091
The whole village is full of monsters.

434
00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:26.693
It seems that.

435
00:31:26.785 --> 00:31:27.957
Song Daitian...

436
00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:30.290
tried to secretly protect you.

437
00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:32.227
We did nothing wrong.

438
00:31:32.424 --> 00:31:33.459
We didn't hurt people.

439
00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.070
We're all vegetarian.

440
00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.106
It proves that Mr Song is right.

441
00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:39.539
Humans and monsters can live together!

442
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.543
As a former first-tier palace guard
from the Monster Hunter Bureau.

443
00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.798
Song Daitian complied in public
but opposed in private.

444
00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:50.951
which is a capital treason offense.

445
00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:55.381
We are not the problems.

446
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.590
We just want to live peacefully.

447
00:31:57.649 --> 00:32:00.630
We're not planning to disturb anyone.

448
00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:02.558
Why can't you...

449
00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:04.123
give us a chance?

450
00:32:04.556 --> 00:32:05.899
I won't argue with you-.

451
00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:10.731
What I want is...

452
00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:11.899
the monster queen...

453
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.641
and the baby she carries.

454
00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:17.945
Who wants to tell me...

455
00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:19.275
in exchange for freedom?

456
00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:20.509
Stop asking!

457
00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:23.016
None ol us will be a traitor!

458
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:24.151
Hold on.

459
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.651
Do you mean it?

460
00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:28.986
Mo.

461
00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:30.191
what are you doing?

462
00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:32.019
None of your business!

463
00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:33.595
Master.

464
00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:35.028
I know where they are!

465
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.860
Traitor!

466
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.302
Say it.

467
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.698
You should behave now.

468
00:33:16.962 --> 00:33:19.067
Otherwise the fire beetle may need to

469
00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:22.169
crack another skull.

470
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:27.641
Get them all.

471
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.704
Grandma left

472
00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:59.073
all the villagers to me...

473
00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:01.678
Just one evening.

474
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.714
Everything is gone.

475
00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:07.889
Be optimistic.

476
00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.717
You skill have an egg inside.

477
00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.625
Follow me to Shuntian City and sell it.

478
00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:13.384
I can give you 20 percent of the reward.

479
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.421
Money means

480
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.521
nothing to me right now-.

481
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.258
That's great.

482
00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:19.367
I admire you-.

483
00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:22.202
Then I'll give you 10 percent.

484
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.534
No more bargaining.

485
00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:24.403
Let's go.

486
00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:14.122
Don't eat any more-.

487
00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:15.954
Otherwise I'll suffer a loss-.

488
00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:19.028
Just deduct it from my reward.

489
00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:22.457
Your noodles.

490
00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.489
I want...

491
00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:26.029
two more bowls of noodles.

492
00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:27.132
Add sour sauce.

493
00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:28.262
The crazy-sour type.

494
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.196
This is already crazy sour!

495
00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:32.638
I want the super super super
super super crazy-sour.

496
00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:34.343
You're super crazy!

497
00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:38.846
Wait.

498
00:35:41.106 --> 00:35:41.982
Stop eating.

499
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:43.762
If Luogang catches you.

500
00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:44.513
he'll slice open your belly

501
00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:45.449
and take the monster.

502
00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:46.351
Run.

503
00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.481
You run...

504
00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.075
and wait for me at the back door-.

505
00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:08.842
How have you been...

506
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.470
after rubbing me?

507
00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.616
Where are the two monsters?

508
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:12.878
Ran away.

509
00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:14.075
Ran away?

510
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:15.379
Pay me back!

511
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:16.985
Lower your voice.

512
00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:23.089
Remember the monster who fled that day?

513
00:36:23.815 --> 00:36:25.192
The egg inside her...

514
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.490
is very special.

515
00:36:27.719 --> 00:36:28.857
I think that monster sooner or later...

516
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.901
will go back to the Village
to look for that guy.

517
00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.591
Let's work together...

518
00:36:34.092 --> 00:36:36.163
to catch her.

519
00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:37.571
How much is it worth?

520
00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:38.700
20 taels.

521
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.868
Very special is only worth 20 taels?

522
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.608
You really know the market.

523
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.376
If you find it.

524
00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.209
5...

525
00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:49.747
100 taels.

526
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.521
Wait till you pay me back the money first.

527
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.283
Are we still working together?

528
00:37:02.187 --> 00:37:03.860
He's got a big belly.

529
00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:14.635
Eating again?

530
00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:15.943
Do you have money?

531
00:37:16.735 --> 00:37:17.645
No.

532
00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:19.143
That's why I keep eating...

533
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.078
and wait for you to pay-.

534
00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:21.376
Five dollars in total.

535
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:25.282
Preserved ginger. dried salty plum.
lemon. hawthorn.

536
00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:27.054
Are you crazy?

537
00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:31.625
Go!

538
00:37:32.784 --> 00:37:33.558
Go!

539
00:37:42.127 --> 00:37:42.764
Go!

540
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:05.350
This monster egg...

541
00:38:06.518 --> 00:38:08.088
Is... mine!

542
00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:08.994
Luogang.

543
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.121
You're robbing me again.

544
00:38:10.188 --> 00:38:11.258
How can we work together?

545
00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:12.528
You lied to me.

546
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.862
Cheater.

547
00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:15.701
Behind you!

548
00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:27.480
There's a monster behind you.

549
00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:28.517
I'm not lying.

550
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.012
There's a monster behind you.

551
00:38:30.108 --> 00:38:31.109
I'm not lying.

552
00:38:59.003 --> 00:38:59.811
Stupid Luogang...

553
00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:00.975
If he dies.

554
00:39:01.306 --> 00:39:02.216
no one gets any money.

555
00:39:02.307 --> 00:39:03.308
Come help!

556
00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:13.259
I grab it.

557
00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:14.189
you capture it!

558
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.395
Thank you very much.

559
00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:22.698
Let's go!

560
00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.742
Shouldn't we stay... and help him?

561
00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:30.711
He's a level four monster hunter.

562
00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.369
He should be able to handle it.
Let's go!

563
00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:41.123
Huo Xiaolan!

564
00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:43.350
We would like to have a room.

565
00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.478
Only an expensive room is left.

566
00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:46.583
Do you want it?

567
00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.018
Yes.

568
00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:55.959
I don't feel like eating-.

569
00:40:56.421 --> 00:40:57.491
You go.

570
00:40:59.524 --> 00:41:00.696
Human and monster.

571
00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.132
Would their baby...

572
00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:04.166
be...

573
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.102
a mutant baby?

574
00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:09.869
Crazy!

575
00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:11.106
Are you coming?

576
00:41:11.703 --> 00:41:14.183
Just don't search for
food in garbage at night.

577
00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:19.985
At least we should give the baby a name.

578
00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.189
One bowl of plain noodles.

579
00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:32.866
How old is he?

580
00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.026
Almost three years old.

581
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.038
Look at him. So adorable.

582
00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:40.509
It'd be great if I could
have one of my own.

583
00:41:40.565 --> 00:41:41.475
Isn't he yours?

584
00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:43.406
He's this hotel owner's son-.

585
00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:45.241
Take him to his parents.

586
00:41:47.038 --> 00:41:48.745
May I have your name?

587
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:50.383
Huo Xiaolan.

588
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.481
We're going to Shuntian City...

589
00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.216
for a very fancy banquet
at Heaven Restaurant.

590
00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:56.588
But the main reason is for my husband...

591
00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:57.989
to boost his health.

592
00:41:58.049 --> 00:41:59.653
So that I can have a baby-.

593
00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.263
Do you understand?

594
00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.260
Yingying.

595
00:42:06.057 --> 00:42:06.762
Yingying.

596
00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:08.837
Why are you here?

597
00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:12.273
This is my husband Zhengtao.

598
00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:14.336
This is Miss Huo.

599
00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.003
Nice to meet you. Miss Huo.

600
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.379
Let me tell you.

601
00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.209
We should hire a bodyguard...

602
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.908
like them-.

603
00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:21.910
They said...

604
00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:22.916
if hiring a bodyguard.

605
00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:25.127
we should look for those with
coins hanging on them...

606
00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:27.417
fur prestige!

607
00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.091
Okay.

608
00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:32.854
you two keep chatting.

609
00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.692
I'll go back to my other conversation.

610
00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:56.781
Hurry. hurry.

611
00:42:58.376 --> 00:42:59.116
Be careful.

612
00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:00.446
Freeze!

613
00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:01.285
What's happening?

614
00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:02.756
- Freeze!
- Oops!

615
00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:12.327
Wake up. wake up!

616
00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.583
Many monster hunters outside.

617
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.296
Super dangerous.

618
00:43:14.392 --> 00:43:15.097
Let's leave.

619
00:43:23.768 --> 00:43:24.439
What's wrong?

620
00:43:25.136 --> 00:43:25.978
In labor?

621
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.743
Probably. probably.

622
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:30.751
Be quiet.

623
00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:31.985
Not good.

624
00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.956
- Why are you in labor now?
- What do you think?

625
00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:36.689
You think... this is my choice?

626
00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.789
What can we do? What to do?

627
00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.127
Go find a doctor.

628
00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.165
Right. right-.

629
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:49.965
Are you crazy?

630
00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:51.264
Who'd help you?

631
00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:52.330
Go find someone!

632
00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:02.950
How do people give birth? How to...

633
00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.349
Scissors. hot water. towels.

634
00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:09.519
I know what we should do.

635
00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:16.198
Don't be nervous. Relax. relax!

636
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:17.442
Follow my instructions.

637
00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.695
Breathe out.

638
00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:22.061
Breathe in.

639
00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.296
Out.

640
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:25.238
In.

641
00:44:25.463 --> 00:44:26.635
Out.

642
00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:27.334
In.

643
00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.001
Out.

644
00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:28.736
In.

645
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:29.811
Out.

646
00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:31.346
In.

647
00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:32.142
Out.

648
00:44:32.203 --> 00:44:33.011
In.

649
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:38.180
You're an animal!

650
00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.029
What are you doing?

651
00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:49.830
Helping!

652
00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:51.567
How can you give birth with your pants on?

653
00:44:53.224 --> 00:44:54.066
Then why are you holding the scissors?

654
00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.193
To cut.

655
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.370
How can you cut with your eyes shut?

656
00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.026
You'd better watch out.

657
00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.211
Don't cut it wrong!

658
00:45:12.677 --> 00:45:13.280
Should I cut it now...

659
00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.583
or after you give birth?

660
00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:16.520
Of course after!

661
00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:17.787
What's there to out now?

662
00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:24.127
Something is already there!

663
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.098
I've grabbed it!

664
00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:27.425
Should I out it?

665
00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:28.765
You're holding me down here!

666
00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.236
Put down your scissors!

667
00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:37.778
Relax. Push!

668
00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:38.608
The harder I push.

669
00:45:38.703 --> 00:45:39.875
the further it comes up!

670
00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:41.314
No. push it down!

671
00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:43.949
I feel like my belly is-.-
going to explode...

672
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:44.883
No. no!

673
00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:47.416
I give up.

674
00:45:47.545 --> 00:45:49.081
I give up!

675
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.452
Push. push!

676
00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:51.589
Push harder!

677
00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:52.888
Do it!

678
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:55.996
Is it Miss Hun?

679
00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:57.291
Are you okay?

680
00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.566
I'm fine. Thanks.

681
00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:01.565
Someone is outside.

682
00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:02.502
Let it out now!

683
00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.264
Quick!

684
00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:04.305
Somethings wrong.

685
00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:07.439
Push.

686
00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:08.636
You do it right now!

687
00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.071
Someone's having a baby!

688
00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:13.145
Stay outside.

689
00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:16.907
Who is she?

690
00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.119
My grandmother.

691
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:22.313
Your grandmother could still
give birth at her age?

692
00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:24.190
So lucky.

693
00:46:24.749 --> 00:46:26.126
Where's your grandfather?

694
00:46:27.318 --> 00:46:28.160
He...

695
00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:29.264
died.

696
00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.196
Then your grandmother is really something.

697
00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:32.763
But don't worry.

698
00:46:32.857 --> 00:46:34.029
Childbirth is my area of expertise-.

699
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:36.002
No. Although I've never given birth.

700
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.434
I've read many books...

701
00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:38.667
and heard so much about it.

702
00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:39.707
I've been preparing all along...

703
00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:41.333
lam qualified to give birth and
help others give birth anytime.

704
00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:42.636
Excuse me.

705
00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:44.007
I must help.

706
00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:16.909
You gave birth to a white radish!

707
00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:18.212
Let me see!

708
00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:22.349
Be careful.

709
00:47:22.473 --> 00:47:24.544
A monster is a monster.

710
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.818
Does it look like me?

711
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.820
Absolutely.

712
00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:36.759
Exactly the same.

713
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.209
Do you need any help?

714
00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:53.438
Wake up. wake up.

715
00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:55.045
Good.

716
00:47:55.673 --> 00:47:56.674
this is better. darling.

717
00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.253
I saw...

718
00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:01.955
Nightmare?

719
00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:03.755
Right?

720
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.755
Excuse us.

721
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:07.852
We meant to help you.

722
00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.625
- But...
- Good that Madam is fine now.

723
00:48:09.754 --> 00:48:10.596
How's the baby?

724
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:13.432
The baby is great.

725
00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:14.694
How is your grandmother?

726
00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:18.741
I'm fine.

727
00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:21.207
Thank you.

728
00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:24.411
I've never seen someone stand up

729
00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:26.639
right after giving birth.

730
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.417
Where's the baby's father?

731
00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:33.444
He died.

732
00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:36.952
I'm fine too.

733
00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:39.125
Thank you very much.

734
00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.729
The baby is so quiet.

735
00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:46.268
No Crying-

736
00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.438
Where's Niuniu?

737
00:48:54.732 --> 00:48:55.506
Niuniu?

738
00:48:57.435 --> 00:48:58.311
Niuniu

739
00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.279
may have gone to see the baby.

740
00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:03.075
Does any of you inside see Niuniu?

741
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:13.094
Don't hit him.

742
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:38.551
What's that?

743
00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:49.329
Is everything okay?

744
00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:52.900
All good.

745
00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:11.352
Niuniu. you should come out.

746
00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:13.715
Wait.

747
00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:22.891
Oops. Madam faints again.

748
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:25.257
What's wrong with you today?

749
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.406
Excuse me.

750
00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.788
Wow. really?

751
00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:32.626
They are monsters?

752
00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:33.631
Definitely.

753
00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:34.898
If you want.

754
00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:35.767
I can capture them for you.

755
00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:37.499
Capture? Go capture yourself!

756
00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:40.667
Have you two villagers...

757
00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:42.673
seen my son Daitian?

758
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.655
Anybody?

759
00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:18.946
So hot.

760
00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.104
It's having a fever!

761
00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:21.046
Go get a towel.

762
00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:29.554
Get some water.

763
00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:40.369
Still very hot.
Change water. change water!

764
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:43.731
Change again.

765
00:52:59.043 --> 00:52:59.748
Okay. Okay.

766
00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:03.810
The fever is gone...

767
00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:05.710
but it's still weak.

768
00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:06.884
Oh.

769
00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:08.952
it hasn't had any milk...

770
00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:10.590
since it was born-.

771
00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:13.986
No cows or goats around here.

772
00:54:14.218 --> 00:54:15.288
What can we do?

773
00:54:19.223 --> 00:54:20.497
Why are you looking at me?

774
00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:21.796
You're its mom!

775
00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:24.431
I don't have milk.

776
00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:26.406
I...

777
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.842
It'll be sold in two days anyway.

778
00:54:31.135 --> 00:54:33.479
Then...

779
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:35.343
why saved it...

780
00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:36.978
when it was ill?

781
00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:42.681
Because it can't be sold at
a good price if it's dead.

782
00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.416
Then what is different now?

783
00:54:45.749 --> 00:54:46.819
Not died ol illness...

784
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.420
but is starved to death.

785
00:54:58.195 --> 00:54:59.503
Tum around.

786
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:08.514
And you all!

787
00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:20.893
Done.

788
00:55:26.023 --> 00:55:28.299
You do like blood.

789
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:29.729
I knew it-.

790
00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:30.805
What should we do?

791
00:55:31.562 --> 00:55:32.563
What should we do?

792
00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.407
You're the mother!

793
00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:48.714
I saw a baby coming out...

794
00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:51.755
from her mouth.

795
00:55:52.316 --> 00:55:54.990
A baby can be born from below...

796
00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:58.062
and also from above.

797
00:55:58.155 --> 00:55:59.691
Isn't that right. dear?

798
00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:06.032
What happened. honey?
What happened?

799
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.911
What is going on?

800
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.207
Do you have... some...?

801
00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:40.774
I told you before.

802
00:56:41.198 --> 00:56:42.575
A monster is a monster.

803
00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:56.056
Don't drink blood anymore.

804
00:57:05.489 --> 00:57:06.763
You must learn.

805
00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:08.269
Otherwise....

806
00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:10.961
people will say I didn't teach you well.

807
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:12.270
Understand?

808
00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.271
Your daddy.

809
00:57:15.499 --> 00:57:17.809
He didn't learn well.

810
00:57:17.968 --> 00:57:19.242
That's why he's so dumb...

811
00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:20.941
and knows nothing!

812
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:26.310
Your mommy.

813
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.787
she didn't have a good education.

814
00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:30.617
That's why no one wants to marry her.

815
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:31.953
What did you say?

816
00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:36.357
From now on.

817
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.955
you eat fruits and vegetables instead.

818
00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:39.532
Then everyone will love you.

819
00:57:50.367 --> 00:57:52.313
Fortunately those horses are still alive.

820
00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:54.279
Otherwise you would have become a killer.

821
00:58:52.596 --> 00:58:53.836
You carry this all the time.

822
00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:56.075
From your lover?

823
00:58:58.769 --> 00:58:59.809
My father gave it to me...

824
00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:01.076
when I was twelve.

825
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:02.709
He said whenever I'm scared.

826
00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:03.877
if I play it.

827
00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:05.245
he'll be there.

828
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:07.254
Did you try?

829
00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:12.192
My father never taught me how to play it.

830
00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:14.418
That was the last time I saw him.

831
00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:17.458
So...

832
00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.464
have you ever looked for him?

833
00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:21.297
My father was a monster hunter.

834
00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:22.734
But he was killed...

835
00:59:22.793 --> 00:59:24.033
by a monster.

836
00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.102
When I was a child.

837
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:32.308
my mother suddenly disappeared.

838
00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.941
Dad took me to Yongning Village...

839
00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:36.916
and left me there.

840
00:59:37.808 --> 00:59:39.048
He went away by himself.

841
00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.143
I don't want you-.

842
00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:41.755
Go away.

843
00:59:42.112 --> 00:59:43.489
Go.

844
00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:47.922
So the villagers of Yongning Village...

845
00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.129
are like my family.

846
00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:52.892
Your father... He...

847
00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:55.197
Whoever leaves his son alone...

848
00:59:55.759 --> 00:59:56.999
isn't qualified to be a father.

849
01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:03.770
See.

850
01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:05.279
all monsters are bad.

851
01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.536
Even this little one will grow up
to be an evil monster.

852
01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:09.749
Let me teach you.

853
01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:30.528
Somehow we are put together
and we become a circle.

854
01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:36.134
This circle has the magic to make
everything look pretty.

855
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:41.513
Even when time flies and changes happen.

856
01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:46.177
hope the magic will never die.

857
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:52.453
How can I describe this feeling?

858
01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:57.823
It's almost like we can
complete each other.

859
01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:02.232
But time can be sneaky.

860
01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:08.867
It can tear us apart slowly
without us knowing it.

861
01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:23.350
How can we avoid being attacked by time?

862
01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:29.220
Or can we ask time to help us instead?

863
01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:34.266
There is a long and
unpredictable road ahead.

864
01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:38.897
Can we still keep up with each other?

865
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:45.378
How to preserve this bonding forever...

866
01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:50.542
and not let it get rotten?

867
01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:54.919
I hope you cherish and put in your heart...

868
01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.685
all the special moments we have together.

869
01:01:57.781 --> 01:02:01.854
I will also keep them fresh in my mind...

870
01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:10.686
so they can stay beautiful
even in tomorrow.

871
01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:20.937
“Shuntian City...

872
01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:03.252
Do you like it?

873
01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:04.621
See how much daddy loves you.

874
01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.085
Be good...

875
01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:07.462
and I'll buy you one more later.

876
01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:19.363
Look!

877
01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.169
Isn't she very pretty today?

878
01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.038
Absolutely!

879
01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:24.844
You must be having a good game.

880
01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:27.879
I'm invincible!

881
01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.006
- Hold on. Pong!
- Pong!

882
01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.209
- Wait!
- Faster!

883
01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.146
- I got it.
- Pong!

884
01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:35.185
- Pong!
- Pong!

885
01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:35.847
Pong!

886
01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.020
Your turn. Hurry up!

887
01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:39.491
- Pong!
- Pong!

888
01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.055
- Pong!
- Pong!

889
01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.562
Fat Choi!

890
01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.003
- Win!
- What?

891
01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.738
How come you guys win again?

892
01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.702
Five tiles of Fat Choi instead of four?

893
01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:08.822
Show all your hands!

894
01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.092
Sell them?

895
01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:14.924
Hm!

896
01:04:15.752 --> 01:04:16.423
Get out!

897
01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:19.329
Use them to make meat loafs.

898
01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.736
You want to do...

899
01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:25.533
some business?

900
01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.335
No.

901
01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.179
You do look like a radish.

902
01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:54.892
50 taels.

903
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.216
Let's go!
Let's go somewhere else.

904
01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.278
Just name a price.

905
01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.807
I know what it's worth.

906
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.710
At least 100 taels.

907
01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.119
Put ii in the cage.

908
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.423
And wait here.

909
01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:30.901
Come on.

910
01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:33.169
You're rude.

911
01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:34.803
Lei me.

912
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:42.814
We haven't named you yet.

913
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.120
Should we not sell it?

914
01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.288
Hurry up-

915
01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:52.490
Tum around.

916
01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:03.937
Let's play hide and seek.

917
01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:05.197
I'll count to three.

918
01:06:05.862 --> 01:06:06.863
I'll hide over there...

919
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.336
and you hide in the cage.

920
01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:09.779
Then she will look for us-.

921
01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:10.606
Understand?

922
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.876
Let's start. One. two. three!

923
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.954
No.

924
01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:26.915
you should hide in the cage...

925
01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.226
like what I do.

926
01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.476
No.

927
01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:50.140
when I count one. two. three...

928
01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:55.916
Why are you so rude?

929
01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.518
You want to keep it?

930
01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:01.703
Yes. Even few more days would be good.

931
01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.425
Few more days?

932
01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.673
The result is still the same
after few more days.

933
01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:12.336
Look. look.

934
01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:13.430
it cries.

935
01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:23.749
Nonsense.

936
01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.083
It's a monster.

937
01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.295
What emotions could it have?

938
01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.416
It keeps following us.

939
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.615
Isn't that emotion?

940
01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.221
You cut your fingers to feed it blood-.

941
01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:34.421
Of course it'll follow you-.

942
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.757
You feed grass to cows and goats.

943
01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:36.732
They'd follow you too.

944
01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:37.356
What kind of emotion...

945
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.558
do you call that?

946
01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.995
Who says cows and goats have nu emotions?

947
01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.278
Why do you think only humans have emotions?

948
01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:45.938
Even if it doesn't have emotions.

949
01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.071
I have.

950
01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:53.445
Stop now.

951
01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:55.314
Humans and monsters aren't meant
to be together.

952
01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.645
That's why you should sell it!

953
01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:02.449
What is it?

954
01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:16.997
Go!

955
01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:30.478
When I first started.

956
01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.847
I was like you too.

957
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.319
Do more trading... and
you'll get used to it.

958
01:08:34.811 --> 01:08:35.789
Go. Go.

959
01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:23.693
Let's eat.

960
01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:28.651
You're such a good boy.

961
01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:32.074
I know.

962
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:33.739
We should name it Wuba.

963
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.552
Can you play mahjong?

964
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.763
Come on. come take a look!

965
01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:27.897
Monkey brains are good.

966
01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.027
Healthy and...

967
01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.569
tasty.

968
01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:31.897
no cooking needed.

969
01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:13.809
Let's go!

970
01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.344
Where's our little monster?

971
01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.581
Kill me if you can!

972
01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:19.752
You will beg for...

973
01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.447
our mercy!

974
01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.115
Pong!

975
01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:25.649
Pong!

976
01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:28.095
I'll tell you if you win.

977
01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.293
Your turn!

978
01:11:30.186 --> 01:11:30.823
Eight circles.

979
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:31.689
Pong!

980
01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:32.962
Wait! Can you slow down?

981
01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.262
I'm not ready yet.

982
01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.702
Hurry up-

983
01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:46.173
I've got everything.

984
01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:47.304
What should I do?

985
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.471
Thirteen orphans?

986
01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:49.872
Win!

987
01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:50.776
Win?

988
01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:52.383
Fooling me?

989
01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.290
Where's the little monster?

990
01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:55.780
Heaven Restaurant.

991
01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:56.983
It may be getting ready to be butchered.

992
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.485
Let's go!

993
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.688
Play another round with me.

994
01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.558
I still haven't told you the password.

995
01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.392
How can you get in?

996
01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:11.696
"Heaven Restaurant."

997
01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:31.321
Little guy.

998
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.415
Where are you from?

999
01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.653
How come you're not...

1000
01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.024
wearing any skin?

1001
01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.324
No wonder you were caught!

1002
01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:37.828
Wanna get one. huh?

1003
01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:39.059
Look at my skin.

1004
01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.690
so real and smooth!

1005
01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:41.427
Look at mine.

1006
01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:42.730
so elastic!

1007
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.531
See.

1008
01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:46.263
it's seamless.

1009
01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:47.030
Do this.

1010
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.068
puff your cheeks!

1011
01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:50.107
Money back guarantee.

1012
01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:51.507
Wanna buy one?

1013
01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.910
You two are selling skins again?

1014
01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:00.612
Didn't I tell you to take yours off?

1015
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.279
No!

1016
01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.254
We won't take it off!

1017
01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:04.916
Go!

1018
01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:13.532
Head Chef!

1019
01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.966
What the... You guys are too much.

1020
01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.127
Scared the hell oui of me!

1021
01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.229
Pay attention.

1022
01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.205
The monsters we have today...

1023
01:13:21.264 --> 01:13:22.470
are so awesome...

1024
01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.569
and delicious.

1025
01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:28.581
What's happening?

1026
01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:30.812
What's the problem?

1027
01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:33.249
Head Chef.

1028
01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:34.583
We can't open this monster.

1029
01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:36.317
Why won't you cooperate?

1030
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.413
No way!

1031
01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:39.150
Listen.

1032
01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.391
Every monster dies.

1033
01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:42.718
Sooner or later.

1034
01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:44.090
it's just a matter of time.

1035
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.490
Be brave. okay?

1036
01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.165
No way.

1037
01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:48.428
You stubborn monster.

1038
01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:49.292
You've asked for it.

1039
01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.515
Don't cut my buttocks!

1040
01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:06.113
Marvelous.

1041
01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:10.351
Monster sashimi.

1042
01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:11.287
All ready.

1043
01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.289
No wonder she's our Head Chef.

1044
01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:16.125
Stand still!

1045
01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:18.325
What's with these two monsters?

1046
01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.854
They refuse to take off their skin.

1047
01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:23.201
Hey gorgeous. you look stunning today.

1048
01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:24.870
Your inner beauty is shining as well.

1049
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.463
Please let us be at your service.

1050
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.371
My goodness.

1051
01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.876
This kid has a sweet mouth.

1052
01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.009
Your meat must be tender.

1053
01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.374
juicy...

1054
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.642
and yummy'-

1055
01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:36.759
I should cut you first.

1056
01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.376
Head Chef.

1057
01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.476
could you cook me

1058
01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:41.954
instead of serving me raw?

1059
01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:44.622
Oh. you're so cute-.

1060
01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:45.988
As you wish!

1061
01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:47.056
Then we should...

1062
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.220
soak you in sauces before baking.

1063
01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.126
Okay?

1064
01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.994
- Take them away!
- Yes.

1065
01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:52.857
Move!

1066
01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:54.658
Head Chef.

1067
01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.670
make sure you don't undercook.

1068
01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:57.830
Don't worry.

1069
01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.405
Write down your last words.

1070
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.406
I'll send them to your families.

1071
01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.477
I have such a good heart.

1072
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:05.907
- Head Chef.
- Oh. my goodness.

1073
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:10.007
The little monster king
everyone's talking about!

1074
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.185
I have something special for you.

1075
01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:13.547
Deep fry!

1076
01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:14.313
Yes.

1077
01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.240
We sure look rich and glamorous.

1078
01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:38.069
Sir Zou and Lady Zou.

1079
01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:39.074
please come this way.

1080
01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:06.741
Why do you have to be so skinny?

1081
01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.531
Didn't I tell you to eat more?

1082
01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:09.803
Not even big enough to

1083
01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:11.438
block my small face.

1084
01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:15.911
Madam.

1085
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.646
are you here for curing illness...

1086
01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:19.811
or boosting your health?

1087
01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:20.546
I...

1088
01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.280
You go away.

1089
01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:22.958
I'll use the restroom.

1090
01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.285
Let me show you something.

1091
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.722
Luogang.

1092
01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:27.292
bring my baby boy...

1093
01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:28.327
to show Madam.

1094
01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.756
I'm afraid of dogs.

1095
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.295
He's my baby boy.

1096
01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:36.131
Not a dog.

1097
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.166
I prefer cats.

1098
01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:40.637
He's my baby boy.

1099
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:41.605
Not a cat.

1100
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.100
There's a cat over there.

1101
01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.075
Go that way. that way.

1102
01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:47.773
Go. go. go!

1103
01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:50.842
He doesn't recognize us.

1104
01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.747
He didn't see us in human form.

1105
01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.015
Right!

1106
01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:04.296
Where did they go?

1107
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.506
Password.

1108
01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:21.141
- One. two. three?
- Wrong!

1109
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.107
Five. two. one?

1110
01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:22.808
Wrong!

1111
01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:24.711
Password!

1112
01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.181
Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me.

1113
01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:38.028
"Four. “"

1114
01:17:38.521 --> 01:17:39.295
"three."

1115
01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.359
"eight."

1116
01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.626
Our two honorable guests.

1117
01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.327
this way please.

1118
01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:16.529
Why are you...

1119
01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:17.866
so heavy?

1120
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.368
Hold you to lose weight.

1121
01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:25.042
But you keep getting bigger and bigger.

1122
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.546
The first appetizer...

1123
01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.775
is monster ears in oil.

1124
01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.709
First hang the monsters...

1125
01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:35.255
on the right and upside down
for three days and nights.

1126
01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.525
so that all the blood can
gather in one point.

1127
01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:39.951
Slice not too much. not too little.

1128
01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.127
just that corner of the right ears-.

1129
01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:45.924
Why don't you two eat?

1130
01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.230
I have to go to the restroom.

1131
01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:53.198
Restroom. restroom.

1132
01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:55.942
I thought...

1133
01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.100
we will have the little monster king...

1134
01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.359
since we paid 300 taels more?

1135
01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:00.811
Today. you all are lucky!

1136
01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.610
Little monster king is a newly added dish.

1137
01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:05.867
We've been preparing it in the kitchen.

1138
01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.316
Fantastic!

1139
01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:10.753
That's great.

1140
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.617
I also need to go to the restroom...

1141
01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:15.091
before...

1142
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.891
we try the special dish.

1143
01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:17.993
Excuse me.

1144
01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.156
Put it in the steamer.

1145
01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:46.688
Yes. Chef!

1146
01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.130
We are such a team.

1147
01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:09.645
Open it-.

1148
01:20:09.705 --> 01:20:10.308
Yes!

1149
01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:26.227
Still alive?

1150
01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.905
I'm doing this for your own good.

1151
01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:41.263
It's not fair. I already tried my best.

1152
01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.839
Serve it raw-.

1153
01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:47.516
We're leaving.

1154
01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:57.991
Am I too cruel?

1155
01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:58.756
Not at all.

1156
01:20:58.854 --> 01:20:59.889
It deserves it.

1157
01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.225
What's with my face?

1158
01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.358
Having a mask is...

1159
01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:03.562
good for your skin.

1160
01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.762
Great for moisturizing.

1161
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.195
Let's go!

1162
01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:38.404
Xiaowu.

1163
01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:40.364
I'm sorry.

1164
01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.064
Xiaowu is in the kitchen!

1165
01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.966
Silly.

1166
01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.118
Xiaowu.

1167
01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.213
I know.

1168
01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:00.424
you will come!

1169
01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.157
Mayor.

1170
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.127
watch out!

1171
01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:21.346
Gulugulu Bang!

1172
01:22:30.012 --> 01:22:31.685
Run!

1173
01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:34.096
I abandoned my friend once.

1174
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.526
I'll never do it again!

1175
01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:37.795
I can't beat that guy!

1176
01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:40.529
See you.

1177
01:22:40.756 --> 01:22:42.133
You will get killed.

1178
01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:18.853
You're a monster hunter.

1179
01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:20.532
How come you help an outsider instead?

1180
01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:22.068
He's not an outsider.

1181
01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.304
He's my husband!

1182
01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:26.904
What?

1183
01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:44.822
Are you serious about...

1184
01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.223
what you just said?

1185
01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:49.034
My dad said.

1186
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:50.001
A man and a woman should keep a distance.

1187
01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.560
If they kiss. they must marry.

1188
01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:53.031
Can we...

1189
01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:54.165
Cannot. cannot.

1190
01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:56.534
- But...
- No buts!

1191
01:23:56.832 --> 01:23:58.834
I am the only one left...
in the Huo family.

1192
01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:00.005
The responsibility to expand my family...

1193
01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.012
and have children and grandchildren...

1194
01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.742
is now all yours.

1195
01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:04.375
Will it be too...

1196
01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:05.383
No. it won't.

1197
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.521
We are running out of lime.

1198
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.846
I know.

1199
01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:09.183
I am under a lot of pressure too.

1200
01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.780
We will try our best.

1201
01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:12.355
Let's try.

1202
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:16.224
Leave me alone.

1203
01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:18.593
We can't open this cage.

1204
01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:19.958
You two should leave.

1205
01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:21.030
Take care.

1206
01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:22.733
and don't die.

1207
01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:24.565
I'm not done arguing with you yet.

1208
01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:25.871
Leave!

1209
01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.037
Mogadi!

1210
01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:40.715
Run!

1211
01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:42.582
This way!

1212
01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:05.742
Why does it keep chasing me?

1213
01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:28.361
Auntie Mo.

1214
01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:29.697
Here are the keys and...

1215
01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.701
please set the other villagers free.

1216
01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:31.664
Sure.

1217
01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:35.534
Take care!

1218
01:25:36.665 --> 01:25:38.440
Be careful. mayor!

1219
01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.388
It's our little king!

1220
01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.008
Gao. what happened?

1221
01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:53.446
Oh mama!

1222
01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:00.123
So glad to see you again.

1223
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:00.852
Master.

1224
01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:01.894
we have something important to do!

1225
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:02.894
Please let us go.

1226
01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:03.895
Do I look stupid?

1227
01:27:59.241 --> 01:27:59.981
He...

1228
01:28:00.142 --> 01:28:01.086
We should save him.

1229
01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.848
Another monster hunter helps monsters.

1230
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.702
Is this food?

1231
01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:03.172
This is the main dish of the banquet:

1232
01:29:04.406 --> 01:29:06.477
Raw baby monster king's brain.

1233
01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:09.014
- This is worth waiting for-
- This dish brings long life

1234
01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.489
and stops you from ageing.

1235
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.052
It moves.

1236
01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:14.183
Is it alive?

1237
01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:17.254
Eating it alive offers the must benefits.

1238
01:29:17.419 --> 01:29:20.059
We feed it with wine and
make it half-drunk.

1239
01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:21.698
then open a hole...

1240
01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:23.268
on the top of its head.

1241
01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.435
The best way to enjoy this dish is to...

1242
01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:28.533
simply eat its brain while it's fresh.

1243
01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:45.422
Why are you here?

1244
01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:46.890
You know her?

1245
01:29:48.183 --> 01:29:49.059
Is this a human...

1246
01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.118
or a monster?

1247
01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:51.199
Want to find out?

1248
01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:52.190
Sure.

1249
01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.194
Grandma.

1250
01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:54.767
she just helped pulling you out.

1251
01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.057
Grandma?

1252
01:29:56.925 --> 01:29:57.903
Why are you here?

1253
01:29:58.026 --> 01:29:58.800
Two villagers...

1254
01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:00.534
brought me here so I can look for my son.

1255
01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:02.564
Who are you?

1256
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:03.869
Tianyin.

1257
01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:05.709
Who is she?

1258
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:09.977
I'm your... granddaughter-in-law.

1259
01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:10.981
Grandma.

1260
01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.042
Come this way.

1261
01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.815
Tianyin.

1262
01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.486
Your dad...

1263
01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.424
left this sword for you.

1264
01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:23.227
It has enormous power!

1265
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:24.123
Let me tell you.

1266
01:30:24.219 --> 01:30:25.630
It's best for chopping vegetables-.

1267
01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:26.323
You see...

1268
01:30:29.124 --> 01:30:29.932
It doesn't matter.

1269
01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.297
After some sharpening.

1270
01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:33.304
it can chop monsters easily.

1271
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:36.165
Grandma. how do you sharpen it?

1272
01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:38.319
You use some kind of blood but...

1273
01:30:39.234 --> 01:30:40.235
anyway-

1274
01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.242
You see.

1275
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.448
that guy...

1276
01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:44.779
over there...

1277
01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:45.475
Fine. Fine.

1278
01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:46.574
Grandma. you stay put.

1279
01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:47.449
Wait for me here!

1280
01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:49.164
See you later. Grandma!

1281
01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:52.956
This fire beetle.

1282
01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:55.326
is an expert in opening
the skulls of monsters.

1283
01:30:55.617 --> 01:30:56.652
After you finish enjoying
the raw monster brain.

1284
01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.191
remember to drink its blood as well.

1285
01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.260
You know.

1286
01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:00.329
the blood ol this little monster...

1287
01:31:00.422 --> 01:31:02.800
will bring amazing results.

1288
01:31:26.348 --> 01:31:27.554
Miss Huo!

1289
01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.790
Who dares to make trouble here?

1290
01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:55.169
Darling. let's go-.

1291
01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:00.682
You two leave first.

1292
01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:01.555
I can't...

1293
01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:02.525
Leave.

1294
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:03.822
You can't help me here.

1295
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.363
Darling.

1296
01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:28.084
I thought you're someone more powerful.

1297
01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:30.750
But you're just a mediocre level
two monster hunter.

1298
01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.686
Hold on!

1299
01:32:36.451 --> 01:32:37.896
Another one?

1300
01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.527
Level ten!

1301
01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:43.759
What does that mean?

1302
01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:46.699
Level ten is the top level
of monster hunters.

1303
01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:47.762
All these years.

1304
01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:50.069
Only three persons have reached that level.

1305
01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.576
Excuse me. may I have your name?

1306
01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:57.276
My husband...

1307
01:32:57.539 --> 01:33:02.318
is the Head of former
Monster Hunt Bureau Song Zhenjiang.

1308
01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:04.049
My son...

1309
01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:07.726
is palace swordsman Song Daitian.

1310
01:33:07.816 --> 01:33:10.592
My grandson Tianyin is...

1311
01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.926
nobody.

1312
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:17.893
You let my granddaughter-in-law down first.

1313
01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.905
Didn't you say you're a level ten?

1314
01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.934
Why don't you save her yourself?

1315
01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:23.473
Fine!

1316
01:33:38.113 --> 01:33:39.490
Yumula!

1317
01:33:43.251 --> 01:33:44.992
The coins are not yours!

1318
01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:46.757
Who says they aren't mine?

1319
01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.323
My husband had six.

1320
01:33:48.423 --> 01:33:49.663
my son had five.

1321
01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.464
All together I have ten.

1322
01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.430
Six plus five is eleven!

1323
01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:54.766
It's ten!

1324
01:33:56.431 --> 01:33:57.535
Song Tianyin.

1325
01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.477
if you hand in the little monster.

1326
01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.539
I'll release them -.

1327
01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.284
If you don't show up.

1328
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.885
I'll kill your grandma first...

1329
01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.458
- and then your wife.
- Can you...

1330
01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:13.686
can you switch the order?

1331
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:14.885
Wife first...

1332
01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.188
and then grandma?

1333
01:34:17.719 --> 01:34:18.663
Good idea.

1334
01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:21.694
Five.

1335
01:34:22.557 --> 01:34:23.729
four.

1336
01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:26.733
three.

1337
01:34:27.529 --> 01:34:28.735
two.

1338
01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.009
one.

1339
01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.338
Hold on!

1340
01:34:35.203 --> 01:34:36.682
It's too late.

1341
01:34:39.474 --> 01:34:40.680
Grandma or wife.

1342
01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.420
either one must die.

1343
01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:44.685
You choose.

1344
01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:54.195
I've chosen!

1345
01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.281
No more tricks?

1346
01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:25.822
Lord Ge is... a monster?

1347
01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:28.148
He has so many layers of skin.

1348
01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:29.862
No wonder we couldn't tell he's a monster!

1349
01:36:31.586 --> 01:36:32.929
He's so ugly.

1350
01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:39.200
I put on the skin to disguise as human...

1351
01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:41.787
in order to get rid of the
surviving supporters...

1352
01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:44.106
of the old Monster King in the human world.

1353
01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.844
Now you've forced me to reveal myself.

1354
01:36:51.506 --> 01:36:53.110
You all have to die!

1355
01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:17.368
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

1356
01:37:17.465 --> 01:37:18.341
Be careful!

1357
01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:20.303
Granddaughter-in-law.

1358
01:38:21.129 --> 01:38:22.107
your father-in-law...

1359
01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:24.274
left you this sword!

1360
01:38:24.799 --> 01:38:26.142
Best for chopping vegetables.

1361
01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.233
Tianyin!

1362
01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:12.148
Tianyin.

1363
01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:15.352
stop fooling around.

1364
01:39:16.484 --> 01:39:17.690
Song Tianyin.

1365
01:39:18.586 --> 01:39:19.826
wake up!

1366
01:39:22.457 --> 01:39:24.198
My dad has left me already.

1367
01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:26.135
Please don't leave me alone.

1368
01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:28.868
I order you to wake up now.

1369
01:39:29.363 --> 01:39:30.774
Otherwise I'll gouge out your eyes.

1370
01:39:30.932 --> 01:39:31.967
cut off your tongue.

1371
01:39:32.033 --> 01:39:32.773
pull out your tendons...

1372
01:39:32.934 --> 01:39:34.106
and tear off your skin.

1373
01:39:35.203 --> 01:39:36.773
I was so used to being alone.

1374
01:39:36.838 --> 01:39:38.317
If you can't be with me.

1375
01:39:38.506 --> 01:39:40.386
why did you let me feel good
to have you around?

1376
01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:44.217
I need you to be around.

1377
01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:11.269
Huo Xiaolan!

1378
01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:20.784
Tianyin.

1379
01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:22.445
use the Song family special moves.

1380
01:42:06.187 --> 01:42:07.359
Monsters...

1381
01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:11.130
will soon conquer the human world.

1382
01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.128
Thank you.

1383
01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:56.580
Tianyin.

1384
01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.317
You truly met your dad's expectations-.

1385
01:43:04.412 --> 01:43:05.482
He?

1386
01:43:07.715 --> 01:43:08.693
Tianyin.

1387
01:43:09.717 --> 01:43:11.060
This first coin...

1388
01:43:11.419 --> 01:43:13.160
was left to you by your dad.

1389
01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:14.429
Others...

1390
01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:16.559
you will have to earn on your own.

1391
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.032
Six plus five...

1392
01:43:21.362 --> 01:43:22.363
equals ten!

1393
01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:24.073
The extra one...

1394
01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:25.107
is for me-.

1395
01:43:27.001 --> 01:43:28.036
Are you sure?

1396
01:43:28.269 --> 01:43:29.339
Once you take this coin.

1397
01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:30.609
you are a monster hunter.

1398
01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:33.844
Yes!

1399
01:43:34.075 --> 01:43:34.883
Good!

1400
01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:39.217
Don't go!

1401
01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:42.357
Grandma.

1402
01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.431
Come back!

1403
01:43:47.755 --> 01:43:49.393
Come back!

1404
01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:03.904
They ate our baby king already?

1405
01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:05.245
We are too late.

1406
01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.262
Follow them to a remote place...

1407
01:44:29.163 --> 01:44:30.642
to rebuild a Yongning Village.

1408
01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:32.600
You'll only be safe...

1409
01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.135
with them.

1410
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:44.946
I really want you to be with me.

1411
01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:47.125
But that would only hurt you.

1412
01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:52.630
Even if I dress you up as a human.

1413
01:44:54.922 --> 01:44:55.923
sooner or later.

1414
01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:58.831
people will find out.

1415
01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.007
And that would be very dangerous for you-.

1416
01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:06.274
Humans still can't accept you.

1417
01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:08.975
Understand?

1418
01:45:25.452 --> 01:45:27.227
Don't let others call you a radish anymore.

1419
01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:30.362
Even though you do look like one.

1420
01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:33.534
Remember.

1421
01:45:34.495 --> 01:45:35.735
you've got your own name.

1422
01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:38.203
It's Wuba.

1423
01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:46.680
Go.

1424
01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:53.820
Leave.

1425
01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:57.559
Go away!

1426
01:46:03.324 --> 01:46:04.564
I don't want you!

1427
01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:13.241
Go!

1428
01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.343
I don't want you!

1429
01:46:20.441 --> 01:46:21.715
Just go.

1430
01:46:22.276 --> 01:46:23.414
Don't follow me!

1431
01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:53.216
You let a monster go.

1432
01:46:53.307 --> 01:46:55.048
How can you be a monster hunter?

1433
01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:57.082
There are good monsters and bad monsters.

1434
01:46:57.478 --> 01:46:58.786
I only catch the bad ones-.

1435
01:47:00.214 --> 01:47:01.386
Come to think of it.

1436
01:47:01.615 --> 01:47:03.219
you're my man now.

1437
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:05.259
From now on just do... what I tell you.

1438
01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.826
Where are we going?

1439
01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.566
I want to look for my dad.

1440
01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:15.163
I would like to know more about him-.

1441
01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:18.169
Let's go.

1442
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.135
Let me carry it.

1443
01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:23.445
I'll carry.

1444
01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:33.656
I'm starving.

1445
01:47:34.515 --> 01:47:35.789
Waiter.

1446
01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:39.420
do you have any human meat or human liver?

1447
01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.263
It's just me here-.

1448
01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:42.760
How about...

1449
01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:44.191
eating me first?

1450
01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:51.768
Where do you think...

1451
01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.368
Wuba would live?

1452
01:47:54.835 --> 01:47:55.870
I don't know.

1453
01:47:56.003 --> 01:47:57.448
Then how can we go to visit him?

1454
01:47:57.538 --> 01:47:59.017
I've marked on our calendar
when to visit him.

1455
01:47:59.106 --> 01:48:00.449
His one month old party. his birthday.

1456
01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:02.282
Mid-autumn festival.

1457
01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:04.546
new year and many.

1458
01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:05.623
many other festivals...

1459
01:48:07.848 --> 01:48:12.194
Keep walking and don't stop.

1460
01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.401
Although it is unpredictable
and mysterious.

1461
01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:21.797
Have faith and don't be afraid of...

1462
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:26.874
the hard and tough times that may some.

1463
01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:35.211
Be ready for all kind of challenges.

1464
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:40.918
Don't hide in the dark and worry.

1465
01:48:42.216 --> 01:48:44.662
You will keep on learning...

1466
01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:49.527
while you see many new things.

1467
01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:54.838
Be strong and move forward...

1468
01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:58.171
even when you are in the middle of a storm.

1469
01:48:58.332 --> 01:49:01.176
Be brave and I will be with you.

1470
01:49:01.402 --> 01:49:06.374
If somehow you make a mistake.

1471
01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:09.421
you should also learn from it.

1472
01:49:09.576 --> 01:49:13.422
Then you will grow to find your way.

1473
01:49:53.654 --> 01:49:57.101
Mi go ha. we feel wonderful.

1474
01:49:57.391 --> 01:50:00.736
Nu go ha. we are delightful.

1475
01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:04.572
Don't be shy and let's rock together.

1476
01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:08.269
We will spread our spirit to everyone.

1477
01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:10.612
Not afraid of the heat.

1478
01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.478
Not afraid of anything tough.

1479
01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:16.144
We want to be loud and we don't care.

1480
01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:18.151
Not afraid of anything.

1481
01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.086
Whatever happens happens.

1482
01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:22.750
Let's not waste time on arguing...

1483
01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:23.760
at all.

1484
01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:27.487
Whether you are tall Or short.

1485
01:50:27.788 --> 01:50:31.326
Whether you are elegant or down to earth.

1486
01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:32.964
It doesn't matter...

1487
01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:35.097
cause somehow someone will like you...

1488
01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:38.538
just the way you are.

1489
01:50:46.807 --> 01:50:48.787
Not afraid of the heat.

1490
01:50:48.876 --> 01:50:50.549
Not afraid of anything tough.

1491
01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:54.486
We want to be loud and we don't care.

1492
01:50:54.648 --> 01:50:56.525
Not afraid of anything.

1493
01:50:56.617 --> 01:50:58.290
Whatever happens happens.

1494
01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:00.797
Let's not waste time on arguing...

1495
01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:01.955
at all.

1496
01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:05.659
Mi go ba. would love to have
something sweet...

1497
01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:09.501
Ka ka go ba. would love to keep moving.

We feel good...

1499
01:51:11.198 --> 01:51:13.178
and we want to have fun.

1500
01:51:13.367 --> 01:51:15.506
Don't worry about what others think.

1501
01:51:15.569 --> 01:51:17.412
Come on. let's dance.
