00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.877
I am Dr. David Olson. the chair

70
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.629
of the Supportive
Care Department.

71
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.800
- Good morning. I'm Alex.

72
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.885
- And I'm Anna. I'm
the neurologist.

73
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.555
- [Michael] I'm Michael.

74
00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.557
And it is definitely
not a good morning.

75
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.894
But I'm still a Nurse
Practitioner of the group.

76
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.063
(groaning)

77
00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:55.981
I was up late.

78
00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.235
- So my name's Valerie

79
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.487
and I'm the social
worker for the team.

80
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:08.451
And also the babysitter
for this guy.

81
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.662
- And for that we are
eternally grateful.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.497

83
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.623

85
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.085
and welcome to both of you.

86
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.336
- Good morning. I'm Astrid.

87
00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.505
I'm the Psychiatrist

88
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:21.339
- Wait a minute.

89
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:26.678
Did you say Little and Styfan?

90
00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.472
(laughing) How cool is that?

91
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.434
You should be urologists.

92
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.937
Get it? (chuckling)

93
00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.356
Right. okay.

94
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.275
- On that note. good morning.

95
00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.776
It's time to get started.

96
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.696
The meeting today will be
run by Dr. Astrid Adams.

97
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.282
- Thank you.

98
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:50.869
Welcome everyone to a new day.

99
00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:56.291
I'd like to begin with
a little meditation.

100
00:06:56.291 --> 00:07:00.211
taking a moment to clear
our heads and recharge.

101
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.214
I'd like to invite you
to close your eyes.

102
00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.467
Don't talk.

103
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:11.056
And just let go of work
for the next three minutes.

104
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.144
(dinging)

105
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.482
(kooky music)

106
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.438
(beeping)

107
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.733
Okay.

108
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.361
(bowl dinging)

109
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:10.699
- Mhmm.

110
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.744
- All right. we will get started

111
00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.622
with some general announcements.

112
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.208
We still need volunteers
to help with the survivor

113
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.626
celebration that's coming up.

114
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.882
And sadly. last night we lost

115
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.635
dear Mrs. Debra Urland.

116
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:35.432
Next on the list is
Danny Sorensen. age five.

117
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.936
- Danny's cancer is
rapidly progressing.

118
00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.231
And he is experiencing
difficulty

119
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:46.067
breathing. severe headaches.

120
00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.570
I'm worried about a seizure
or sudden head bleed

121
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.613
that can't be stopped.

122
00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:55.577
Sadly I think we only
have hours to days left.

123
00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.496
- Danny came to us originally to

124
00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.416
be part of a phase
one clinical trial.

125
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.128
And he wasn't eligible.

126
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:08.590
So it was decided that he
would go home in hospice.

127
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:13.595
But his condition. it started
to deteriorate pretty quickly.

128
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.973
It wasn't safe to
transport him home

129
00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:22.645
so we've decided to do
hospice here at the hospital

130
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.356
and let him spend the
remainder of his time

131
00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.984
here under our care
with his mother.

132
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.781
- April has requested
that we make Danny's time

133
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.491
as special as possible.

134
00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.286
So we've decided to
throw him a pajama party.

135
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.704
- All right.
- Nice.

136
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.332
- Yeah.

137
00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:45.627
- Understandably. April
is grieving right now.

138
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.838
The best thing that we
can do for her as a team

139
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.466
is to be there with our
presence and our compassion.

140
00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:55.553
- And please. always remember.

141
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.640
- [Everyone] The
door is always open.

142
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.808
- Thank you very much.

143
00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:01.476
Michael.

144
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.852
- Yeah?

145
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.062
- Would you take the
responsibility of introducing

146
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.064
our urol. excuse me.

147
00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.649
Josh and Adam to meet Danny.

148
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.401
- Yes sir.

149
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.153

150
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.322

you need any help. okay?

151
00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.365
- Okay.

152
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.658
I gotta run.

153
00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.660
I have a new consult
in the clinic.

154
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.911
- Let's meet up.

155
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.162

156
00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.413
There's two patients up

157
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.915
- Gentlemen.

158
00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:27.001
- Alex. maybe you can go over
the comfort care medication.

159
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.211
- Sure. I can do that.

160
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.170
I'm just sorry I'm
not important enough

161
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.255
for everybody to stay.

162
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.008
- Aw. poor Alex.

163
00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.010

180
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.727
- Hi. I'm Kelly Davis.

181
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.312
This is my father-in-law Oscar.

182
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.480
- Oscar.
- Pleased to meet you.

183
00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.069
(kooky music)

184
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.332
- What the hell are you doing?

185
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.583
- He's alive!

186
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.257
I'm sorry that you're in pain.

187
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.637
And you have every
right to be angry.

188
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.180
- What would you know about it?

189
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.102
- You're right.

190
00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.108
I could never
really know what you

191
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.653
and your family
are going through.

192
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.282
But I know that everything
in your life has changed.

193
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.283
And you're in pain.

194
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.954
I wanna help get your
pain under control.

195
00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.999
The problem is. pain
can be pretty complex.

196
00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.962
Controlling pain. it's more
than just about giving drugs.

197
00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.215
It's about me
getting to know you

198
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.384
and learning what's
important to you.

199
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.510
what your goals are.

200
00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.391
And if you can beat me
in a wheelchair race.

201
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.062
How about we start over.

202
00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.404
Hi. I'm Michael.

203
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.492
Are you gonna shake my hand

204
00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.035
or should I just wave?

205
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.331
- I'm Cooper.

206
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:12.917
And I can already tell

207
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.335
you're gonna be
a pain in my ass.

208
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.421
- Don't worry. I
can fix that too.

209
00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.262
- I'm so sorry this is
happening to you and Danny.

210
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.432
(sniffling)

211
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.850
But you know what?

212
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.395
You're showing an amazing
amount of courage.

213
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.525
- He's being so brave.

214
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.029
I just don't want
him to see me upset.

215
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.538
I'm just not ready to lose him.

216
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:51.956
I don't know what else to do.

217
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.543
- You're doing everything
you're supposed

218
00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:56.878
to be doing as a mother.

219
00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:02.216
And now. we're gonna focus
on celebrating his life.

220
00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.554
Let me get things ready
for the pajama party.

221
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.145
- Cooper's pain is
in his lower back

222
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.897
and it's pretty severe.

223
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.649
He can barely walk
and he can't sleep.

224
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.070
We are really
hoping you can help.

225
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.157
- Listen. I wish
that I could just

226
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.326
make this nightmare go
away for all of you.

227
00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:32.997
Here's the plan.

228
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.585
I get you out of
pain. and we race.

229
00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:39.670
Deal?

230
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.174
- You got a deal.

231
00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:52.016
- [Announcer] All
those participating
in the pajama party

232
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.476
for young Danny Sorensen.

233
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.852
the party starts as 11 a.m.

234
00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.776
(light music)

235
00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:07.615
(chattering)

236
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.999
- (laughing) I
love these pajamas.

237
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:17.959
Monkey ones. huh?

238
00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.294
My girls would love these.

239
00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.174
You look so alert today.

240
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.802
Does he know what
we're planning?

241
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.054
- Yeah. he knows.

242
00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.806
I had to tell him earlier.

243
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.474
He was in so much pain.

244
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.561
I felt he needed a distraction.

245
00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:38.396
- Okay.

246
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.318
- Let's show Valerie
your new look. okay?

247
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.493
- Oh my god. let me see you.

248
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.495
Look at you. you
cool little dude.

249
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.580
give me a high five!

250
00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.166
Yay!

251
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.834
Let me go change. all right?

252
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.085
I'll be right back.

253
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.670
I've gotta go find
Michael too. okay?

254
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.838
- Okay.
- Okay.

255
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.677
(uplifting music)

256
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:21.355
(keyboard clacking)

257
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.712
- [Announcer] Dr. Frederick
Martin. Dr. Frederick Martin.

258
00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:46.297
you have a visitor at reception.

259
00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.716
- You guys look so awesome.

260
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.134
(cheering)

261
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.887
Thank you so much
for doing this.

262
00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.640
Let me go get changed.

263
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.227
(cheering)

264
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.622
(sighing)

265
00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:27.129
(somber music)

266
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:47.275
(water splashing)

267
00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:38.409
Okay. I've got the
whole floor in pajamas.

268
00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:41.037
Everyone should be
here in just a sec.

269
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.246
- Huh. see?

270
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.998
This is what our
job is all about.

271
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:48.169
- [April] Danny.
Danny. what's wrong?

272
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.338
Oh no. someone please!
- What's wrong. April?

273
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:51.756
Come over here.

274
00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.341
Let's let the doctor check him.

275
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.011
It's all right.

276
00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:58.262
Come on. take a seat.

277
00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.847
- [April] And he was
doing so well today.

278
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.349
- [Valerie] It's
okay. we've been here.

279
00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:04.101
- [Michael] Should I
order a Dilaudid IV push?

280
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.436
- No. hold off on that.

281
00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:09.607
- [Valerie] Take a breath.

282
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:15.112
I know he was doing
well. but remember.

283
00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.114
- He's declining very fast.

284
00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.366
He doesn't have much left.

285
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.288
- [Valerie] I'm holding
on. I'm right here.

286
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.457
Right here is comfortable.

287
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:30.711
Right here.

288
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:33.255
- April.

289
00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.051
Would you like to hold
Danny one more time?

290
00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.804
- [Valerie] You
said you wanted to.

291
00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:40.638
It's time.

292
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.810
Now it's up to you. okay?

293
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.480
Take a breath.

294
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.417
(sobbing)

295
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:20.094
(somber music)

296
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:27.017
April.

297
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.774
Your sweet little
Danny has died.

298
00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.861
(sobbing)

299
00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.197
I'm so sorry.

300
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:56.505
(somber music)

301
00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.071
- [April] I can't stand
the thought of him

302
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:22.573
being carried out on a gurney.

303
00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:27.244
Can I please just
carry him myself?

304
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.245
- [Valerie] Absolutely.

305
00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.580
I will arrange that.

306
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:28.556
(melancholy music)

307
00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:36.480
(sobbing)

308
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.816
- I know this is tough. guys.

309
00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:42.653
Everyone did the
best they could.

310
00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:44.572
Danny's cancer was
just too aggressive.

311
00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:48.492
We need to focus on
the difference you made

312
00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:49.910
for Danny and his mom

313
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.914
during his last few days.
(nurses laughing)

314
00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:59.336
- Michael. you'd be a
little more convincing

315
00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:01.005
if you weren't
wearing that sleeper.

316
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.181
(zipping)

317
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:12.016
(gasping)
- Ooh.

(hooting)

319
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.855
- Don't be ridiculous.

320
00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:20.441
I do have clothes
on underneath this.

321
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:21.817

00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:01.523

Oh.

Davis on his way in

359
00:25:19.143 --> 00:25:20.728
with pain out of control and

360
00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:22.271
I was wondering if
you could see him

361
00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:25.149
on counsel for me please?

362
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:26.900
- You sound really desperate.

363
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.652
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

364
00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:30.738
Sure. I'll take a look at him.

365
00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:31.780
- Thank you.

366
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.656
- You're welcome.

367
00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:35.993
But it's gonna cost you.

368
00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:37.828
(kooky music)

369
00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:38.662
- Okay.

370
00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:40.914
- Mhmm.
- All right.

371
00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:44.168
There will be a
steak dinner in it

372
00:25:44.168 --> 00:25:45.169
and a show.

373
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.755
Your choice.

374
00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:49.798
Oh and some cold beer.

375
00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:51.008
- Ooh. yes.

376
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:52.760
- And me. I'll be there.

377
00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.012
What do you say?

378
00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.347
- So are the red footie
sleepers optional?

379
00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:01.518
- Okay. thank you.

380
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:04.021
Obviously she heard
about the pajama party.

381
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:06.440
- Obviously. and I
think it's really sweet.

382
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.192
It's all these nurses
can talk about.

383
00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:12.154
- Yeah well. I mean enough
about my jammy prowess.

384
00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:14.323
- I'm on call. so I
can take a look at him

385
00:26:14.323 --> 00:26:16.033
and I'll update you
tomorrow morning.

386
00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:16.867
- Perfect.

387
00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:19.787
One more thing.

388
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:23.624
You better be careful.

389
00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:24.833
This could get serious.

390
00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:34.176
- [Doctor] Do you
want me to call HR?

391
00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:52.903
(chattering)

392
00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:57.491
- Marshmallow treats for all.

393
00:26:58.367 --> 00:26:59.326
Help yourselves.

394
00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:02.037
- What?

395
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:03.205
- [Nicole] Oh my god.

396
00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:04.331
- [Alex] What's this mess?

397
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.250
I thought it was
supposed to be homemade.

398
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.251
- Okay everyone.

399
00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:11.088
It's time to start our
pre-meeting meditation.

400
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:13.423
If everyone could sit
down and settle in.

401
00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:16.760
Research shows
that three minutes

402
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.720
is the minimum amount
of time it takes

403
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.682
to reset your minds

404
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:27.521
which allows us to be
holistically present

405
00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:30.524
for our patients
and their families

406
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:31.525
and one another.

407
00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:38.949
So. with that.
welcome to a new day.

408
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.743
I invite you to close your eyes.

409
00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:44.204
No talking.

410
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:47.457
Let yourself be free from work

411
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:49.293
and any other stresses.

412
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:54.298
(package rustling)
(kooky music)

413
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:58.135
(crunching)

414
00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:04.766
(bowl dinging)

415
00:28:37.341 --> 00:28:39.509
(dinging)

416
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:48.352
Thank you.

417
00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:49.770
- [David] Thank you. Astrid.

418
00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:52.773
- Okay.

419
00:28:52.773 --> 00:28:54.149
So the next case
(cellphone ringing)

420
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:56.026
on our agenda here

421
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:57.110
is--
- It's Cooper.

422
00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:03.033
Oh. darn. I have to go.

423
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.702
Hey. I did not plan this.

424
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:06.828
- [Alex] Okay.
that's fine. great.

425
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:08.038
- If anyone is wounded.

426
00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:09.373
Alex.
- No Micheal. that's fine.

427
00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:10.457
- I have more marshmallow
treats in my car

428
00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:11.875
and I'm not afraid to use them.

429
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.126
- [Alex] Don't worry
about us. Michael.

430
00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:14.836
We'll take care of
things here as always.

431
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:17.297
- Hey. Adam.

432
00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:19.883
You wanna go with me?

433
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.845
- [Adam] Excuse me. guys.

434
00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:30.811
- (whistling) This way. hotshot.

435
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:37.401
Look. I know this
program can be rough

436
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:38.485
but I wanna show you
how we can really

437
00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:39.736
compliment each other.

438
00:29:39.736 --> 00:29:40.570
Oh. hey.

439
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:44.366
Psst. Thomas!

440
00:29:44.366 --> 00:29:45.993
- Oh. son of a!

441
00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:48.245
Jeez. dammit. sorry Michael.

442
00:29:48.245 --> 00:29:50.247
This damn thing
just won't stay put.

443
00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.250
- I don't think you should
swear while holding Mary.

444
00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:55.836
Let's go.

445
00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:58.046
We're still broom
buddies. for now.

446
00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:08.765
This is Dr. Styfan.
a urol. oncologist

447
00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:10.017
working with me today.

448
00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:12.936
- Does that mean I'm so
bad I need two of you?

449
00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:15.105
- No. actually we're
combining forces.

450
00:30:17.274 --> 00:30:19.401
- Hey. what's going on?

451
00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.780
- The pain in my right
groin is horrible.

452
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.452
I can't stand it!

453
00:30:33.874 --> 00:30:34.708
(beeping)

454
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:35.959
- Hi. this is Michael.

455
00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:38.128
I just entered a now
order for Dilaudid IV

456
00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:40.422
to be given to Cooper
Davis in room six.

457
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.923
Will you please meet me in here?

458
00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:46.219
Would you call Dr. Dracos
and fill him in on Cooper?

459
00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:47.054
Thanks.

460
00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.808
We're gonna move
over to the bed.

461
00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:59.983
Could you hold that.
- My god.

462
00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:01.151
- There we go.

463
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:01.985
Big hug.

464
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.406
(groaning)

465
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:08.325
There we go. I got you.

466
00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:16.249
(somber music)

467
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:38.522
(groaning)

468
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.695
- That should do.

469
00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:03.880
- I just love the effect
I have on my patients.

470
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.634
- [Kelly] It just breaks
my heart to see him

471
00:32:07.634 --> 00:32:09.469
go through so much pain.

472
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:13.557
I hate this.

473
00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:17.185
- I know.

474
00:32:17.185 --> 00:32:20.313
Well listen. Cooper. he's
comfortable now. okay?

475
00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:22.149
I'm gonna ask the nurse
to keep an eye on you two

476
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.483
while I go speak with Anna.

477
00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:24.484
- Thank you.

478
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.072
- Sweet dreams.

479
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:32.576
(light music)

480
00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:41.418
(machinery beeping)

481
00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:53.263
(phone ringing)

482
00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:54.764
This is Michael.

483
00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:56.516
- [Anna] Hey Michael. I have
the MRI results for Cooper

484
00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:58.518
and they are not good.

485
00:32:59.895 --> 00:33:01.855
He has multiple compression
fractures of his spine

486
00:33:01.855 --> 00:33:03.523
and a mass that looks
like it has gotten

487
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.775
into his spinal cord fluid.

488
00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:07.736
Cooper needs surgery right away.

489
00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.448
We confirm this in surgery.

490
00:33:11.448 --> 00:33:14.784
his life expectancy is going
to be about three months.

491
00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:17.454
In the meantime he
could have a stroke.

492
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:19.873
develop seizures and have
even more excruciating pain.

493
00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:26.630
- Okay. Dr. Dracos
needs to know.

494
00:33:29.132 --> 00:33:31.927
Could you call him and then
meet me in Cooper's room?

495
00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:33.386
- [Anna] I've already
got a page in for him

496
00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:35.263
and for the
neurosurgeon on call.

497
00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:36.890
See you in a few minutes.

498
00:33:40.894 --> 00:33:41.978
- Change of plans.

499
00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:03.625
(light music)

500
00:34:23.436 --> 00:34:24.437
Hi. Kelly.

501
00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:28.608
I'm here with the
neurologist. Dr. Crawford

502
00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:30.527
and Dr. Styfan who
you've already met.

503
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.114
We wanted to talk with
you about Cooper's MRI.

504
00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:39.286
Cooper needs surgery as
soon as we can arrange it.

505
00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:43.790
His cancer has caused some
bones in his spine to break

506
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.042
and push down on
his spinal cord.

507
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:47.460
And we also think
that there's a tumor

508
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.379
growing in his spine
that needs to be removed.

509
00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:52.173
Now these two problems are
what's causing Cooper's pain.

510
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.468
So Dr. Sun. the neurosurgeon
wants to operate

511
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:58.888
as soon as possible to
prevent any permanent damage.

512
00:34:58.888 --> 00:34:59.723
Okay?

513
00:35:02.183 --> 00:35:05.145
- I'm so sorry this has to
happen so quickly. Kelly.

514
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:11.401
Here I have. it's just
a surgical release
and consent form

515
00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:13.820
for you so you can sign.

516
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.530
Dr. Sun will be
doing the surgery.

517
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.073
- Cooper. I know
you're listening

518
00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:19.242
because you stopped snoring.

519
00:35:19.242 --> 00:35:21.369
- And she will place
and implant a pain pump

520
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:23.830
if necessary or possible. so.

521
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.373
- Do you wanna talk about this?

522
00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:33.673
- I will do anything to stop
the pain from coming back.

523
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:34.758
- That's it.

524
00:35:34.758 --> 00:35:36.426
Where do I sign?

525
00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:37.886
- Okay.

526
00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:40.430
So generally the logistics
is just talking about

527
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.432
before and how properly it
should be taken care of.

528
00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:44.184
constantly we need
to be monitoring.

529
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.019
- I just realized something.

530
00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:51.024
I was just thinking

531
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:56.529
how much you remind me
of my father right now.

532
00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:00.617
- What the hell?

533
00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:02.202
- Now hear me out.

534
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.291
With a bald head and
the blotchy skin.

535
00:36:09.793 --> 00:36:10.627
Yeah.

536
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:12.962
You look just like my old man.

537
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:17.926
I mean I know you're
not old enough yet.

538
00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:22.222
But wow. you could be twins.

539
00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:26.059
- Are you for real?

540
00:36:29.229 --> 00:36:30.271
- Could you just say.

541
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:34.776
"shut the hell up. you
dumb shit!" for me?

542
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:39.072
Come on. say it.

543
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:41.324
Come on. come on.

544
00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:43.410
Say it.

545
00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:49.124
- Shut the hell
up. you dumb shit!

546
00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:52.168
Oh god. oh!

547
00:36:54.421 --> 00:36:56.423
- Brings back so many memories.

548
00:36:56.423 --> 00:36:57.465
- [Cooper] Great.

549
00:36:57.465 --> 00:36:58.967
- Why are you being so rude?

550
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:02.429
- Oh he told me so. (laughing)

551
00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:03.930
- [Michael] He's out on an IV.

552
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.682
All right. room 220. got it.

553
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.142
I'll go take a look at him.

554
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.435
Thanks. Doctor.

555
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.155
(somber music)

556
00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:31.624
- My cardiologist told me

557
00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:33.460
I just had another heart attack.

558
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:36.546
He doesn't wanna do
any more procedures

559
00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:38.381
because my heart is too weak

560
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:40.717
so I guess this is it.

561
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:44.137
- I'm so sorry that you're going

562
00:37:44.137 --> 00:37:45.472
through this. Mr. Brownrigg.

563
00:37:45.472 --> 00:37:47.056
- Thank you.

564
00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:49.142
You guys can call me Thomas.

565
00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:50.560
We bonded.

566
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.146
The three of us. we
survived the near disaster

567
00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:55.190
with my Mary statue.

568
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.524
- How long have you
been working here

569
00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:58.026
at St. Mary's?

570
00:37:58.026 --> 00:38:00.653
- Oh I've been in housekeeping

571
00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.906
doing floorwork for
about two years.

572
00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:05.700
I do it just to feel useful.

573
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:09.746
See. after my wife died.

574
00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:13.500
I didn't want to just
wait around for my turn.

575
00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:17.712
We were married for 35 years.

576
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:22.592
- So do you have
a designated will.

577
00:38:22.592 --> 00:38:25.345
do you got someone to take
care of you if you can't?

578
00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:27.722
- (clearing throat)
I'm sorry. Thomas.

579
00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:30.683
What Dr. Styfan means is
do you have any family

580
00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:32.018
in the area that
can be here for you?

581
00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:35.772
- Oh. I have a good friend.

582
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:37.065
His name is Louis.

583
00:38:38.358 --> 00:38:40.235
He lives in town here.

584
00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:42.612
I don't really have
anyone I'm close to

585
00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:46.533
except for that Mary
statue. (chuckling)

586
00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:49.619
I guess I didn't let anyone
get too close. you know?

587
00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:51.871
I mean my work filled the gaps.

588
00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:55.124
Coworkers. the
wonderful staff here.

589
00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:56.125
And the recent--

590
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.460
- Thomas. I'm sorry.

591
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.963
I need to go check on something.

592
00:38:59.963 --> 00:39:02.423
Dr. Styfan will continue
with a few more questions

593
00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:03.424
if you're up for it.

594
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:14.477
- Thomas. I wanna make
sure that you understand

595
00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:16.062
what is happening to your heart.

596
00:39:17.897 --> 00:39:20.441
(somber music)

597
00:39:24.153 --> 00:39:25.071
(sighing)

598
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:26.447
- I'm dying.

599
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:31.661
My heart has had enough.

600
00:39:34.831 --> 00:39:36.833
- Unfortunately you are right.

601
00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:40.336
Thomas. your heart
is very tired.

602
00:39:40.336 --> 00:39:44.090
And this latest attack
has got your heart

603
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.633
working even harder.

604
00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:47.969
And we don't know how long
it will continue beating.

605
00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:53.474
Now if it stops. we can
get it started again.

606
00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:55.685
You know. with electrical
shocks. pushing on your chest.

607
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:57.186
and or medicine.

608
00:39:57.186 --> 00:40:00.148
But it won't change the
fact how sick your heart is.

609
00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:03.776
- Well if it's so sick.

610
00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:05.945
why would you even bother?

611
00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.864
- Well some people
just need more time.

612
00:40:09.032 --> 00:40:12.452
But ultimately.
you need to tell us

613
00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:14.037
what is important to you.

614
00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:24.213
(sighing)

615
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:31.638
(kids chattering)

616
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:32.639
(fireworks popping)

617
00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:37.477
(siren sounding)
(car honking)

618
00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:39.687
(woman laughing)

619
00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:42.482
(plane whooshing)

620
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:47.737
(car honking)

621
00:40:47.737 --> 00:40:51.699
(whooshing)
(kids chattering)

622
00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:53.242
- [Announcer] Please
call reception.

623
00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:56.204
Dr. Crawford. call
reception please.

624
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:01.918
- Well being kept
alive on machines

625
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:04.379
is not my idea of living.

626
00:41:04.379 --> 00:41:07.548
- Honestly. I would
like to see you take

627
00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:09.175
what energy you have left

628
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.261
and spend it enjoying your life.

629
00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:17.433
(somber piano music)

630
00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:21.270
- Coming through.
watch out. heads up.

631
00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:26.109
Ooh. this statue is heavy.

632
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:28.236
How in the world were
you able to catch it?

633
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.780
One. two. three.

634
00:41:35.702 --> 00:41:37.203
Oh.

635
00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:39.372
I think you need
Mary to be with you.

636
00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:41.290
I'm sure she would
miss your attention.

637
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:44.043
Thomas. do you
need anything else?

638
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:48.381
- Dr. Styfan and
I had a good talk.

639
00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.427
I would like to be
kept comfortable.

640
00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:55.138
I don't want any machines.

641
00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.308
You know I just wish there
was someway I could go home.

642
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.730
- Listen. I'm glad that
you were able to talk.

643
00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.775
Now tell you what. I'll
notify your cardiologist.

644
00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:09.277
I'll ring in some orders

645
00:42:09.277 --> 00:42:12.155
and I'll see what I can do
about getting you out of here.

646
00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:12.989
Okay?

647
00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:15.116
In the meantime.

648
00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:18.327
I'm going to ask the
nurses to medicate you

649
00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.413
if you have any
pain or discomfort.

650
00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:22.999
And I'd like to stop
all blood draws.

651
00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:24.500
I'm also going to ask the nurses

652
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.129
to reposition you
only if you request.

653
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:30.757
And to let you eat
anything you want.

654
00:42:30.757 --> 00:42:33.926
And the statue of
Mary is to be left

655
00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:36.471
at Thomas Brownrigg's bedside.

656
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:39.182
Anyone wishing to
remove the statue

657
00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:44.187
must contact Dr. Adam Styfan
for permission. (laughing)

658
00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:53.112
- So we can meet with
Barbara Shelley at three?

659
00:42:53.112 --> 00:42:54.864
- Yeah. three to four.

660
00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:58.701
(door creaking)

661
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:00.620
- You asshole.

662
00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:05.041
- Dad?

663
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:10.129
Oh. why Dr. Styfan.

664
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.131
Whatever could be the problem?

665
00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:15.551
- The problem is you.

666
00:43:18.387 --> 00:43:21.140
I got 12 phone calls
from nursing supervisors

667
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.185
and security personnel
insisting that I

668
00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:25.895
bring back the statue of Mary?

669
00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:29.816
They weren't buying
that a statue

670
00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:33.069
was providing comfort
to a dying man.

671
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:35.196
I tried to convince
them that the statue

672
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:37.406
looked like Thomas' dead wife.

673
00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:38.991
Then I went with he was lonely.

674
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:41.661
I even tried to
say that the statue

675
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:44.747
was a part of Thomas'
legacy where nothing worked.

676
00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:49.001
I had to come back in. sleep
next to the statue of Mary

677
00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:52.046
while reassuring
Thomas that no one

678
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:53.172
was going to touch her.

679
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:57.760
(clearing throat)

680
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.012
I don't think the nurses
like me very much.

681
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:04.851
- I wanna thank
you Adam. for a job

682
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:06.269
very excellently done.

683
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:09.772
Why don't you go home
now and get some sleep?

684
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.859
I'll take care of
things from here.

685
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:20.283
(somber music)

686
00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:21.367
- [Michael] Hey. Adam.

687
00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:23.786
Wait up.

688
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.291
- Okay.

689
00:44:30.793 --> 00:44:32.086
- You finally got this.

690
00:44:33.129 --> 00:44:34.130
You finally got it.

691
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:45.975
He's a keeper.

692
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:50.146
(light music)

693
00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:54.901
Mr. Thomas Brownrigg
is a 68 year old male

694
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.485
with end stage cardiac disease.

695
00:44:56.485 --> 00:44:58.154
He's a widow of two years.

696
00:44:58.154 --> 00:45:00.406
Thomas works at St.
Mary's in housekeeping.

697
00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:02.658
He is comfort measures only.

698
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:05.745
Thomas is very weak and
unable to care for himself.

699
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:15.254
- What do you think
of my cool commode?

700
00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:17.423
- It is not a commode.
it's a wheelchair

701
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:19.175
so don't pee in
it. but I like it.

702
00:45:19.175 --> 00:45:21.469
- Eh. wheelchair.
commode. same thing.

703
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:22.678
Ooh. ooh.

704
00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:23.846
- What?

705
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:25.765
Ooh. yes. very intimidating.

706
00:45:25.765 --> 00:45:27.683
Mhmm. very scary.

707
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:31.604
(tense music)

708
00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.620
- Something tells
me I've been set up.

709
00:45:51.624 --> 00:45:52.625
- Yeah. hey!

710
00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:59.840
Oh. Michael. that's a nice ride.

711
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:03.177
You really went all out.

712
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:04.720
Nice balloons.

713
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.514
- These are supposed
to be gears.

714
00:46:06.514 --> 00:46:08.015
- Look like balloons to me.

715
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:09.475
- These are my brakes.

716
00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:10.643
(laughing)

717
00:46:10.643 --> 00:46:14.146
- You know. I'm actually
a little nervous.

718
00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:16.482
I think there's a good chance
you could beat my time.

719
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:17.692
- Okay.

720
00:46:17.692 --> 00:46:19.902
- If I give you a
two hour head start!

721
00:46:19.902 --> 00:46:23.072
(rock music)

722
00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:23.906
- Okay!

723
00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:27.493
Where are you going?

724
00:46:28.828 --> 00:46:31.914
- [Cooper] You're in
trouble now. Michael.

725
00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:33.416
Catch me if you can!

726
00:46:33.416 --> 00:46:35.167
- [Michael] Coop. wait up!

727
00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:37.753
Get over here. you gotta
let me see this thing.

728
00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:40.381
- It's been a long time since
I've seen him be this happy.

729
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:42.842
- [Cooper] You better get up.

730
00:46:44.176 --> 00:46:46.595
(rock music)

731
00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:56.772
You better get
Michael some oxygen.

732
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.191
Great teamwork. Dad.

733
00:47:00.693 --> 00:47:02.194
I do believe that's mine.

734
00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:03.404
- I surrender. sir.

735
00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:06.365
- Yes!

736
00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:09.118
Victory is mine!

737
00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:12.788
- Hey. I gotta get
back to the meeting.

738
00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:15.374
So. why don't you
stay. hang out.

739
00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:17.126
take a ride on the chair
and I'll cover for you?

740
00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:17.960
- Yeah?

741
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.794
- Yeah.

742
00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:19.879
- You're the best.

743
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:20.880
I'll be there in a few minutes.

744
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.797
- Okay. yeah.

745
00:47:21.797 --> 00:47:22.798
I'll see you. behave yourself.

746
00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:23.466
bye bye.
- Cooper!

747
00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:24.425
I can stay!

748
00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:28.888
(rock music)

749
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:56.332
(kooky music)

750
00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:22.108
(bowl dinging)

751
00:48:29.365 --> 00:48:30.783
- Thank you for taking the time

752
00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:32.451
to join us. Michael.

753
00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:35.037
- I have a good
excuse for being late.

754
00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:38.541
I was actually busy getting
humiliated by Cooper.

755
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:40.459
I mean. you should have seen it.

756
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:41.877
It was amazing how
the race challenge

757
00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:44.046
actually helped Cooper's morale.

758
00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:46.715
He was just so
glowing with pride

759
00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:49.301
when he showed this outrageous
machine to me. just.

760
00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:52.888
(sighing)

761
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:56.142
I wasn't actually crazy
about my humiliation part.

762
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:59.311
- We all need to make
sacrifices. Michael.

763
00:48:59.311 --> 00:49:01.480
I'm glad to hear Cooper
has recovered enough

764
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.899
from his surgery
to be more active.

765
00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:06.402
I take it the pain
pump is working well.

766
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.821
I just hope we can
keep him out of pain

767
00:49:08.821 --> 00:49:10.573
for a while longer.

768
00:49:10.573 --> 00:49:13.367
Now is a good time to
have a goals of care

769
00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:15.327
conversation with
him and his family.

770
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:18.664
- Yes. Michael I hate to
say this right now but

771
00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:21.167
we have to be realistic
about where Cooper is.

772
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.712
- [Valerie] Michael.
she's right.

773
00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:26.380
We can't wait too long.

774
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.381
It's time.

775
00:49:34.597 --> 00:49:37.016
- All right. I'll help
set up the family meeting.

776
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.185
- Okay.

777
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.104
- Thank you. sir.

778
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:45.941
- Thank you. Michael.

779
00:49:50.613 --> 00:49:53.115
(light music)

780
00:50:26.607 --> 00:50:29.485
(board chattering)

781
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.576
- Thank you everyone.
for coming today.

782
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.496
I think we all know each other.

783
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:43.666
so I'm gonna dispense
with introductions.

784
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:49.129
We're here today to talk
about how to support Cooper

785
00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:51.006
and his family.

786
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:54.260
And we wanna establish
a good understanding

787
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.097
of what your values and
your wishes are. okay?

788
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.143
- First I wanna thank
all of you for having us.

789
00:51:05.354 --> 00:51:07.606
I know it's unusual
to have the patient

790
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:08.691
come to one of these.

791
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.277
So I appreciate the opportunity.

792
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:18.701
So I'm dying.

793
00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:23.038
(somber music)

794
00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:26.333
You see. I know I'm dying.

795
00:51:28.294 --> 00:51:29.795
I know my time is limited.

796
00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:34.800
The cancer has gotten
into my spinal cord fluid.

797
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:38.554
- As your body becomes weaker.

798
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:39.805
we need to know. Cooper.

799
00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:41.890
how aggressive
you want us to be.

800
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:45.561
- I don't wanna be kept
alive artificially.

801
00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:50.649
I don't want machines. I
don't want feeding tubes.

802
00:51:55.029 --> 00:51:58.240
I just want to spend what
time I have with my family.

803
00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:00.993
and to have help
controlling the pain.

804
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:04.246
- What if the only way we
have of controlling your pain

805
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:06.165
is to keep you
sedated all the time?

806
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.502
You wouldn't be able to
interact with your family.

807
00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:15.215
- I can't interact with them now

808
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:18.510
if I'm screaming and
writhing in pain.

809
00:52:21.013 --> 00:52:22.514
So if it comes to that point.

810
00:52:25.017 --> 00:52:28.520
then yes. I wanna be medicated.

811
00:52:31.231 --> 00:52:33.942
- What we've described is
called palliative sedation.

812
00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:35.361
We're not gonna
deeply sedate you

813
00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:38.280
until all other pain medication
options are ineffective.

814
00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:41.700
Cooper. once we do
deeply sedate you.

815
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.786
you won't be able to
eat or drink anymore.

816
00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:49.124
- Cooper. this is true for all
patients who become this ill.

817
00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:52.586
But this can be
especially hard on family.

818
00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:54.421
So it's really important
that we help you

819
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:56.715
understand this process.

820
00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:59.551
And that we know that
you're really making

821
00:52:59.551 --> 00:53:00.969
the choice that you want here.

822
00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:04.306
This is not the
route we wanna go

823
00:53:04.306 --> 00:53:06.725
but we wanna make sure
that you're all informed.

824
00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:12.898
- Actually. my greatest desire

825
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.568
is to have another
wheelchair race with Michael

826
00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:18.487
so I can kick his ass again.

827
00:53:18.487 --> 00:53:20.072
(everyone laughing)

828
00:53:20.072 --> 00:53:22.241
- I'd pay 20 bucks
to watch that.

829
00:53:22.241 --> 00:53:24.576
(chuckling)

830
00:53:27.079 --> 00:53:28.288
- All I really
want is to go home

831
00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:29.998
and be with my family.

832
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:34.586
(somber music)

833
00:53:53.856 --> 00:53:55.691
- [Announcer] Dr.
Melvin. please report

834
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:57.151
to the Trauma Center.

835
00:53:57.151 --> 00:54:00.612
Dr. Melvin. you're requested
in the Trauma Center.

836
00:54:00.612 --> 00:54:03.824
(gentle pensive music)

837
00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:32.352
- Come on now!

838
00:54:32.352 --> 00:54:34.563
Kablooey! (cackling)

839
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:39.568
Dead man wheeling
here! (laughing)

840
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.362
- Hey. thank you Coop.

841
00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:43.197
I needed that.

842
00:54:43.197 --> 00:54:44.031
Let's go.

843
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.076
(kooky upbeat music)

844
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:58.670
- [Cooper] (laughing) Look out!

845
00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.683
(dinging)

846
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:16.939
(dinging)

847
00:55:26.448 --> 00:55:28.909
- [Announcer] Would a
valet operator please meet

848
00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:31.036
a patient at the front entrance.

849
00:55:31.036 --> 00:55:33.580
A valet operator to the
front entrance please.

850
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.750
(birds chirping)

851
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.793
- [Michael] I think
Cooper's cancer

852
00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:39.795
is just progressing too rapidly.

853
00:55:39.795 --> 00:55:41.880
Now it's starting to
get a little rough.

854
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.216
- [Valerie] Michael. I
know this is tough for you

855
00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:46.385
but I know you're gonna
do the right thing.

856
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.899
- Hey guys.

857
00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:01.733
So what's up?

858
00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.654
- Dr. Roberts and I want
to check your pain pump.

859
00:56:05.654 --> 00:56:07.656
And Valerie's here
to keep an eye on us.

860
00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:14.329
This programmer has a
scanner attached to a cord

861
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:15.831
that is placed over
your pump reservoir

862
00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:17.249
implanted under your skin.

863
00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:20.335
The scanner can access
data from the pump.

864
00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:22.087
print it out on the
programmer screen

865
00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:24.631
and allow me to change
settings if I need to.

866
00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:29.636
Now. pull up your gown.

867
00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:32.514
- Aw. aren't you gonna at
least buy me dinner first?

868
00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:34.808
(laughing)

869
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:44.818
You're doing one
hell of a job. Doc.

870
00:56:44.818 --> 00:56:46.278
But could you speed it up a bit?

871
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.487
I'm kinda naked here.

872
00:56:48.697 --> 00:56:49.865
- This is great.

873
00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:52.951
Someone's finally giving
Michael a hard time.

874
00:56:54.369 --> 00:56:56.872
- Let's pump up the
Dilaudid to five.

875
00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:58.457
Everything else is maxed out.

876
00:57:05.714 --> 00:57:07.633
- Just fix this here for you.

877
00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:11.553
(laughing)

878
00:57:11.553 --> 00:57:13.639
- Oh. that's real professional.

879
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.557
They teach you that
in nursing school?

880
00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:18.352
Oh please. allow me to fix it.

881
00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:21.063
I don't mind being abused.

882
00:57:21.063 --> 00:57:22.397
I'm only dying here!

883
00:57:22.397 --> 00:57:25.067
(pager buzzing)

884
00:57:26.234 --> 00:57:27.903
- Sorry I'm gonna miss
the rest of the show

885
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:30.322
but I have to get this.

886
00:57:35.243 --> 00:57:36.078
- Sorry. Coop.

887
00:57:37.496 --> 00:57:39.873
I know. I'm not acting
like my usual self lately.

888
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:47.923
(somber music)

889
00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:50.926
Is there anything else
that you wanna talk about?

890
00:57:52.386 --> 00:57:55.013
- Just try to keep me out
of pain as much as possible.

891
00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:58.183
I don't want my family
to be any more upset

892
00:57:58.183 --> 00:57:59.267
than they already are.

893
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:03.355
- We're hoping that the pain
pump will continue to work.

894
00:58:04.773 --> 00:58:06.108
And you know if it doesn't.

895
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.862
unfortunately we're looking
at the deeper sedation

896
00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.614
that we talked about.

897
00:58:14.032 --> 00:58:15.283
- I know.

898
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:16.785
Just help them get through it.

899
00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:18.745
- I will.

900
00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:22.749
- Just help me get through
it with minimal pain

901
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:24.543
and support my family.

902
00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:25.627
That's all I'm asking.

903
00:58:27.713 --> 00:58:30.382
Well. maybe not all.

904
00:58:33.468 --> 00:58:36.596
Actually. there
is one more thing.

905
00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:38.473
- Anything. Coop.

906
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:41.560
You know I'll help
any way I can.

907
00:58:52.738 --> 00:58:54.573
- I need you to
promise me. Michael.

908
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.288
I need you to promise that
when this thing happens.

909
00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:05.292
you'll do something for me.

910
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:06.251
- Consider it done.

911
00:59:12.591 --> 00:59:14.676
- I want you to sing to me!

912
00:59:15.927 --> 00:59:18.513
(laughing)

913
00:59:18.513 --> 00:59:21.016
(kooky music)

914
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:25.020
- [Michael] Oh man. I
walked right into that.

915
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.313
- Yes you did. buddy.

916
00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:32.652
- A little birdy told me

917
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:35.197
that you used to sing in a band.

918
00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:36.698
Heard you were pretty good too.

919
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.867
And I hope you know the
words to the theme song

920
00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:40.118
from The Flinstones.

921
00:59:40.118 --> 00:59:41.453
'Cause that's my favorite.

922
00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:45.707
Yabba dabba do! (laughing)

923
00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:51.880
- Oh is that a picture of
the whole family there?

924
00:59:52.964 --> 00:59:54.299
- Hey!

925
00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:55.467
Patient abuse!

926
00:59:56.468 --> 00:59:57.302
Come on!

927
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:02.182
(crickets chirping)

928
01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:16.488
(humming)

929
01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:17.489
Hey Doctor Dumbshit.

930
01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:23.161
You working all night
again? (laughing)

931
01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.330
- It's just starting
to roll off your tongue

932
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.665
a little too easy.

933
01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:29.501
Actually. no. I'm
just on my way home.

934
01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:33.088
Why. do you need me
to come tuck you in

935
01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.256
and sing to you?

936
01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:35.382
- Let me have a slice.

937
01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.927
- I don't have--
- Come on. one slice.

938
01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:40.887
And I promise to
keep my lips sealed

939
01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:43.390
about you having the
hots for Dr. Crawford.

940
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:45.100
- What?

941
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.019
That's ridiculous.

942
01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.522
I don't. where
did you hear that?

943
01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.858
- Look. I may be sick
but I'm not blind.

944
01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.570
Don't worry. I'll put
in a good word for ya.

945
01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:58.280
Come on.

946
01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:04.786
(tense music)

947
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.459
(laughing)

948
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:12.627
- The things I do.

949
01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:22.429
- Mmm. mmm. mmm. (laughing)

950
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.474
Listen. Romeo.

951
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.770
Life's a lot shorter
than you think.

952
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.147
Trust me. I know.

953
01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:38.904
You spend all your time
here at the hospital

954
01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.572
mainly just bothering me.

955
01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:47.454
You need to make time
for something else.

956
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.248
Take it from me.

957
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.920
If you're lucky enough to
find that special someone

958
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.422
who supports you and loves you.

959
01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.799
don't hold back.

960
01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:03.595
Make the most of every
minute you have together.

961
01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.100
Be a man!

962
01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:12.646
Don't be afraid to
open up your heart

963
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.939
even if you think
there's a chance

964
01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:14.981
it might get broken.

965
01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:18.860
There's worse things
in this world.

966
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.779
- You getting all
sensitive on me now?

967
01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:23.490
Okay.

968
01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:25.533
I think it's time for me to go

969
01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.534
before all my pizza's gone.

970
01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.539
- Michael. look at me!

971
01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:38.463
Go find that beautiful
girlfriend of yours

972
01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:41.549
and hold on tight
and live your life

973
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.634
to the fullest.

974
01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:45.887
Because if you don't.

975
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.893
then you really are a dumb shit.

976
01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:04.239
- See?

977
01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:07.492
Now you really do
remind me of my Dad.

978
01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:11.079
(somber music)

979
01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:14.749
- I love you too. buddy.

980
01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:17.877
Now give me another slice

981
01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.045
and get the hell outta here.

982
01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:27.387
- All right.

983
01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:52.287
(crickets chirping)

984
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:57.459
(light whimsical music)

985
01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:24.944
(clearing throat)

986
01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:26.237
This is Michael Lafata. NP

987
01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:31.076
dictating a note to
chart on Cooper Davis.

988
01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:33.244
Medical record number 34458.

989
01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:37.999
Patient is a 52 year old
male with renal cancer.

990
01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:41.753
Status post nephrectomy
and T5 tumor biopsy.

991
01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:44.506
(dramatic music)

992
01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:49.761
Confirmation of
leptomenangiomethasthesis.

993
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.263
on comfort measures only
with implanted pain pump.

994
01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:58.103
Discharged home per patient's
request one month ago.

995
01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:01.189
now at progressively
increasing right groin pain

996
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.942
unresponsive to
aggressive titration

997
01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:06.027
of intrathecal pain pump.

998
01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:15.954
Patient's wife was
advised to bring patient

999
01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:18.873
into the ER for
further evaluation.

1000
01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:23.711
(dramatic music)

1001
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.190
(pager ringing)

1002
01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:15.680
(light music)

1003
01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:32.030
- So we're here today to
talk about what's going on.

1004
01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:37.619
- So as you both know.
your father is very sick

1005
01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.746
and in a lot of pain.

1006
01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.290
And the only way that we can
manage that pain right now

1007
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.209
is just by putting
him deeply asleep.

1008
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:46.628
almost like someone who's
about to have surgery.

1009
01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:49.380
It's the only way that we
can keep him comfortable.

1010
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.882
- We know this is bad.

1011
01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.759
Dad warned us this could happen.

1012
01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.554
- I still feel like
everyone's giving up.

1013
01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.141
Isn't there anything
else you guys can do?

1014
01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.603
- No. there is nothing more
that we can medically do

1015
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:05.480
in order to stop the
cancer that's spreading

1016
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.398
from his spinal fluid
up into his brain.

1017
01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:10.568
It's causing him horrible pain.

1018
01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:13.947
And now we just wanna focus
on managing that pain.

1019
01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.449
- We're not giving
up on your father.

1020
01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:20.245
We know you care about
him deeply and love him.

1021
01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.789
And we care about
him deeply too.

1022
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.332
- Then help him.

1023
01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.917
Don't just let him die!

1024
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:30.421
- Your father has
fought so hard.

1025
01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.340
His body is tired.

1026
01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.843
This type of cancer
does not have a cure.

1027
01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.765
It will only progress and
his pain will get worse.

1028
01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.976
Right now we need to do
what is best for him.

1029
01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:47.021
(weeping)

1030
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.356
- So what are you gonna do?

1031
01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.318
- We're going to keep
his pain pump settings

1032
01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.861
right where they are

1033
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:56.197
and add an additionally IV
medication called Ativan.

1034
01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.785
The problem is. your father
will be in a deep sleep.

1035
01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:04.706
And he won't be able to
talk to you. eat or drink.

1036
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:10.461
- And we want to make sure
everybody is comfortable

1037
01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:11.629
with this plan.

1038
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:14.132
- So you're just
gonna kill him?!

1039
01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:14.966
- No. no.

1040
01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:18.970
Tiffany. unfortunately.
it is the cancer

1041
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.346
that is killing your father.

1042
01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:22.807
This is the only thing we can do

1043
01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.684
to keep him from dying in pain.

1044
01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:29.981
A body cannot digest food

1045
01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.400
when someone as sick
as your father--

1046
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.402
- Tiff!
- Tiffany!

1047
01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:35.320
- Tiffany.
- Tiffany!

1048
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.487
- I got this.

1049
01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:37.989
- [Oscar] Tiffany.

1050
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.580
- I wish there
was an easier way.

1051
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:50.668
(Cooper screaming)

1052
01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.341
- We should get him
on the Ativan drip.

1053
01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.593
Can you order one and get the
drip hung as soon as possible?

1054
01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:03.431
- We can't find Tiffany.
what's going on?

1055
01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:04.932
- [Anna] I'm not sure. he
just started writhing in pain.

1056
01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.601
- This is Michael. I need
another two milligrams

1057
01:09:06.601 --> 01:09:08.436
of Ativan. stat.

1058
01:09:08.436 --> 01:09:09.854
And please. call the pharmacy.

1059
01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:11.856
tell them I need the
Ativan drip right now!

1060
01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:16.110
(tense music)

1061
01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:30.208
(tense percussive music)

1062
01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:35.797
- [Kelly] What's wrong?

1063
01:09:35.797 --> 01:09:36.964
What happened?

1064
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.384
- [Michael] We don't know yet.

1065
01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:50.812
- I believe Cooper has
had a massive stroke.

1066
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.576
I don't know how much
time he has left.

1067
01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.496
- We gotta find Tiffany.

1068
01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:23.302
(siren blaring in distance)

1069
01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.620
(sighing)

1070
01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.666
- I can't believe this
is finally happening.

1071
01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:58.838
I mean I knew it would.

1072
01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.508
I just hoped.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:09.534
(somber music)

1082
01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:11.202
I hope you're happy
in there. bud.

1083
01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.960
(sobbing)

1084
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.794
- Hey.

1085
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:33.307
(somber music)

1086
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:02.253
- You see officer. they
are killing my father.

1087
01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.754
- What's up. Michael. Valerie?

1088
01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:07.592
This young lady just caused
quite a scene out front.

1089
01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.343
She says you're
killing her father.

1090
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.931
I thought the least I could
do is bring her back here.

1091
01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:14.765
- Thanks. Gary.

1092
01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:16.851
We'll take it from here.

1093
01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.353
- You two know each other?

1094
01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.105
Officer. I insist
you arrest them.

1095
01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:25.151
- It must be exhausting
to stay so angry.

1096
01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:28.821
You have so many people who
can help you through this

1097
01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.449
but you insist on
pushing them away.

1098
01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:34.368
All because you
need to stay angry.

1099
01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:36.621
- Whoah. I'm out of here.

1100
01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:37.663
She's all yours.

1101
01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.373
Give me a call if you need to.

1102
01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.042
- Thanks Gary.

1103
01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.710
Tell Mom I said hi.

1104
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.296
- Great. you're all
related. perfect.

1105
01:13:56.807 --> 01:13:59.393
(somber music)

1106
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.565
(sniffling)

1107
01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.026
- I'm sorry I left.

1108
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.740
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1109
01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:04.041
- (sighing) It's okay.

1110
01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.549
(sighing)

1111
01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.896
- Oh my god.

1112
01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:30.401
Even when Valerie's not
here. she's still bugging me.

1113
01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:32.737
- Go on. read it.

1114
01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:34.488
- Yeah.

1115
01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:36.991
Okay.

1116
01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.455
Don't believe the
pedestal you placed upon.

1117
01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:48.419
Well. that's dumb 'cause
I deserve my pedestal.

1118
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.297
Of course now there's
a statue of Mary

1119
01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:54.091
bolted onto it. (chuckling)

1120
01:15:57.928 --> 01:15:59.513
A power greater than you

1121
01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.640
will determine your
patient's fate.

1122
01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.770
Yeah. usually
that's the surgeon.

1123
01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:18.199
Find comfort in knowing
you did your very best.

1124
01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.622
Review actions and
explore feelings daily.

1125
01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:29.835
I am.

1126
01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:34.298
I promise to stay in the present

1127
01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:39.720
and separate my personal issues
from what actually happened.

1128
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.852
I haven't been
very good at that.

1129
01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:54.985
I promise not to fear

1130
01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.988
feelings of sadness or grief.

1131
01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.745
For it is when the
heart is broken

1132
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.081
that it is most open
to growth and change.

1133
01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:14.421
What?

1134
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:17.716
Who writes this
stuff? (chuckling)

1135
01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.763
Well you know it's a good
thing I'm not suicidal.

1136
01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.016
(sighing)

1137
01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:28.394
'Cause that would have
been over with. (sighing)

1138
01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.265
(pager ringing)

1139
01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:13.480
Michael. where are you?

1140
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.899
Cooper just died.

1141
01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.319
Okay.

1142
01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:23.324
Yeah. okay. all right. okay.

1143
01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.244
- It's okay.

1144
01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:42.426
Hey.
- Yeah.

1145
01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.930
- How can I love you
best. what can I do?

1146
01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.808
- You're doing it.

1147
01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:59.026
And you can give me some
pizza and some cold beer.

1148
01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:01.779
That's all I want.

1149
01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:04.782
- Sounds good.
- Right on.

1150
01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.326
I just wanna go home.

1151
01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:10.329
- [Anna] I know.

1152
01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:20.965
(typewriter clacking)

1153
01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:25.803
- I'd like to order a
pizza to be delivered.

1154
01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:27.054
Yeah. my usual.

1155
01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:28.889
Thanks.

1156
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.398
Wow.

1157
01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:39.316
- [Valerie] Hi Michael.
how are you doing?

1158
01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:40.526
I hope you're better.

1159
01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.152
We're here for you. buddy.

1160
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.154
Give me a call when
you feel up to it.

1161
01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:45.322
We love you.

1162
01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:47.032
(beeping)

1163
01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.826
You know I'm really glad
you're taking some time off.

1164
01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:49.994
Good for you.

1165
01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.370
I think it was a good idea.

1166
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.831
You've dealt with
so much lately.

1167
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:54.665
Call me.

1168
01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.710
(beeping)

1169
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.212
- [Man] Hi. I'm calling
about that frisbee set

1170
01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.755
you had for sale.

1171
01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.258
Would you take 18
dollars instead of 20?

1172
01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:05.509
Or like I could go to 19.

1173
01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:07.428
All right let me know.

1174
01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:10.014
- [Valerie] Michael!

1175
01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.765
You jerk. pick up the phone

1176
01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:12.933
or I'm coming over there

1177
01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.393
and I'm gonna shove
it up your ass!

1178
01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:19.773
- Delivery for Michael Lafa--
- Lafata.

1179
01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:25.612
(kooky music)

1180
01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:27.865
(shutting)

1181
01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.542
Yup. delete. delete.

1182
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.210
Delete.

1183
01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.798
(sighing)

1184
01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:47.384
If only my life were that easy.

1185
01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.554
Hey. you're nasty. delete.

1186
01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:52.264
Hey. you're stupid. delete.

1187
01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:01.315
(knocking)

1188
01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:14.495
- Just don't yell at him. babe.

1189
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.916
- Where the hell are you?

1190
01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:26.131
(sighing)

1191
01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:33.305
You're not the only one
going through grief.

1192
01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:37.851
I could have been there for you.

1193
01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.853
I could have helped you.

1194
01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:43.857
But no. you just go off and hide

1195
01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:45.442
as if nobody cares.

1196
01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:46.193
- Okay.

1197
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:49.113
I suck at this.

1198
01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:54.118
I had too many days
with too little sleep.

1199
01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:57.788
- Look. Michael.

1200
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:02.376
When Danny died.

1201
01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:06.713
I told myself I was done.

1202
01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:11.218
I was ready to walk
away from this job.

1203
01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.721
I was done.

1204
01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.224
I was thinking about
my girls too much.

1205
01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:22.980
And then I had to refocus

1206
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:26.316
and shift and remain present

1207
01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:28.485
for Danny and his mom.

1208
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.157
Do you think that
hurt any less for me?

1209
01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:38.328
You've gotta find something
that distracts you.

1210
01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.249
You gotta get lost in something.

1211
01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:45.252
You gotta find something
that gives you meaning

1212
01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:47.921
and purpose outside
of this kind of work.

1213
01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:53.093
You gotta fall in
love with something.

1214
01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:57.681
- Yeah. I--
- Like maybe art.

1215
01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:00.184
Or like journaling.

1216
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:04.104
Or like music or
biking or something.

1217
01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.028
- What's with all the
doorbells and the knocking?

1218
01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:12.863
It smells like pizza in here.

1219
01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:16.742
- You dog.

1220
01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.243
Here we've been
trying to cheer you up

1221
01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:21.246
and you've got your own
special therapy going on.

1222
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:24.541
I was gonna suggest getting
the band back together

1223
01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:27.044
but I see you already
found your joy.

1224
01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:29.379
- Anna's been so amazing
through all this.

1225
01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:30.547
- Thank you.

1226
01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.049
Actually I think that's
a really good idea.

1227
01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:33.133
I think you guys should
get the band back together.

1228
01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:34.760
- See. we should do it.

1229
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.553
We should get the band
back together. man.

1230
01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:37.971
Rock and roll!

1231
01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:39.640
- You know what. it's
time for us to go.

1232
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.974
- We could run a
couple on Saturday.

1233
01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:41.892
- [Anna] No guys. you
do not need to leave.

1234
01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:42.809
You should stay.

1235
01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:44.061
- I gotta rescue my mom.

1236
01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.896
She's got my kids and you know.

1237
01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:46.939
sounds like you guys
are in good hands.

1238
01:23:46.939 --> 01:23:48.815
- Yeah he is.

1239
01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:50.150
- Come on. come on. let's go.

1240
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.069
- No. but really.
this is really great.

1241
01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:54.238
And you have permission
to be in the band.

1242
01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.239
- What?

1243
01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:56.156
- Thanks?
- Way to go.

1244
01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:57.491
- Permission?

1245
01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:59.159
What do you mean
permission. that's so rude.

1246
01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.744
Who says that?

1247
01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:01.912
Come on.

1248
01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:02.829
Here we go.

1249
01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:06.124
- (chuckling) They're crazy.

1250
01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:07.417
- Let's never get married.

1251
01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:12.631
(kooky music)

1252
01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.425
Mmm. thank you.

1253
01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:16.760
- Ah. you're welcome.

1254
01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:20.681
- I should have
seen that coming.

1255
01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:21.848
- Here you go.

1256
01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:24.101
(laughing)

1257
01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.270
- [David] Why hello.

1258
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.647
This is Dr. David Olson.

1259
01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:32.025
After the tone. please
leave a message.

1260
01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:33.277
(beeping)

1261
01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:35.112
- Hi. Dr. Olson. it's Michael.

1262
01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:39.324
Thank you for letting me
take some time off work.

1263
01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.159
Listen. I was wondering
if I could get involved

1264
01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:44.371
with the hospital Survivor
Celebration this year?

1265
01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:46.206
That's it. thank you again

1266
01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.125
and I will for sure
be back on Monday.

1267
01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.006
So if you take a
look at the program

1268
01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.549
you'll see we have some fun
things lined up for today.

1269
01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:56.633
This is yours if you'd like

1270
01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:59.136
and help yourself. find a seat.

1271
01:24:59.136 --> 01:24:59.970
- All right. thank you.

1272
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.179
- You're welcome.

1273
01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:09.813
Hey.

1274
01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:10.897
- [Anna] Hey.

1275
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.654
- Thank you for helping
me with all of this.

1276
01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:19.740
- [Anna] Yeah.

1277
01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.241
- You've been great.

1278
01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:27.331
Yeah I really just.

1279
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:32.753
I think I lost sight of
patients that actually do well

1280
01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:33.587
and get better.

1281
01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:39.593
I don't see many of the
successes in my practice.

1282
01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:41.511
Or maybe it's just
I'm too focused on

1283
01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.514
the ones with complications
to even notice.

1284
01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:49.603
- I would like to call
upon everyone today.

1285
01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:51.772
- I'm really.
really. really happy

1286
01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:53.357
that you decided to participate.

1287
01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:56.568
- Yeah.

1288
01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:59.279
(crowd clapping)

1289
01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.531
- Okay. I gotta go.

1290
01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:03.950
But. I will see you.

1291
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:04.785
- Okay.

1292
01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:05.619
- Okay.

1293
01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:08.246
- I need one more.

1294
01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:12.918
Okay.
- Okay.

1295
01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:17.130
All right. now I
really gotta go.

1296
01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:19.549
(sighing)

1297
01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:22.219
- May we all remember
to celebrate the journey

1298
01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:26.556
and honor the
special individuals

1299
01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:30.060
who have touched our
lives in so many ways.

1300
01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.062
Tonight we take time to reflect.

1301
01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.649
- You know. he's right.

1302
01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:37.943
It is all about the journey.

1303
01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.823
Remember when I got
diagnosed two years ago.

1304
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:47.661
I had to remind myself
to focus on the journey

1305
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:50.247
and that was what was gonna
help me get through it.

1306
01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:55.252
We all need to feel
loved and valued

1307
01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:57.087
'cause we're not
just our disease.

1308
01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.592
And the journey makes
the whole difference.

1309
01:27:03.927 --> 01:27:05.679
- Here to please take the time

1310
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:11.935
to recognize what you are
personally grateful for.

1311
01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:16.189
- Your courage and your
fight that you have.

1312
01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:21.194
your kids. your survival.

1313
01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.531
That's my inspiration.

1314
01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:30.954
- It's my pleasure to
introduce the melodic stylings.

1315
01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:32.831
- Melodic stylings.

1316
01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.167
- Our very own Michael Lafata.

1317
01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:40.046
(crowd applauding and cheering)

1318
01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:45.343
- Thank you. Dr. Olson.

1319
01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.722
I would like to thank everyone

1320
01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:50.223
for giving me the opportunity

1321
01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.058
to be a part of
today's celebration.

1322
01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.687
Now I'd like to perform a song

1323
01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.397
that I had the pleasure to write

1324
01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.649
with this very
special young lady.

1325
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.319
Tiffany is the
daughter of the patient

1326
01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:05.197
that we just sang to.
my dear friend Cooper.

1327
01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:08.408
And Coop. if you're listening.

1328
01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:09.659
I'm proud to say
that Tiffany and I

1329
01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:12.078
have become really good friends.

1330
01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:14.581
Even though she refers
to me as Dr. Dumbshit.

1331
01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:17.334
(crowd laughing)

1332
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.504
(clears throat)

1333
01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:21.755
I just wanna let
you guys all know

1334
01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:24.883
that our song is about
the compassionate work

1335
01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:27.844
and the involvement that a
supportive care team can provide

1336
01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:30.764
and the amazing people
that come into our lives.

1337
01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.516
It's called You'll
Never Be Alone.

1338
01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:36.853

1339
01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:41.858
