When I take a

63
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.560
these two green dots will show
up on the side of the shark.

64
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.400
We can then actually calculate
the length of that shark.

65
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.440
just from the
photograph itself.

66
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.680
Then we can go in and identify
each individual shark based on

67
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.120
its unique spot patterns.

68
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.200

Alright. looks good.

about these animals.

105
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.240

<i>Some of the females do</i>
<i>have scars from mating.</i>

106
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.080

<i>NARRATOR: Tanya tries</i>
<i>to make sense of this</i>
<i>incredible spectacle.</i>

114
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.040
TANYA: So what we're
seeing is a big gang of

115
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.040
sand tiger sharks.
um. mostly females.

116
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.400
We have so many
unanswered questions.

117
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.640
but what we’re thinking is
that maybe these females are

118
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.160
aggregating
together during pregnancy.

119
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.880
so that the males don’t
try to mate with them again.

120
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.280
TANYA (off-screen): It could
be possible that the females
are kind of banding together.

121
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.400
as kind of a support network.

122
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.520
They are choosing to
group together like this.

123
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.560
And so not all sharks
are just solo predators.

124
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.080
sharks could have a
social life just like humans.

<i>NARRATOR: Tanya’s observation</i>
<i>that female sand tiger sharks</i>

CHESSIE: Lemon Sharks
are called lemon sharks.

336
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.120
because they have this
yellowish coloration.

337
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.760
They’re quite small
when they’re juveniles.

338

and they are actually able

Lemon sharks are absolutely
perfect for research.

351

because they hang out in
such big groups normally.

352
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.840
I’m interested in
whether or not sharks
are always social or not.

more social than others.

FÉLICIE: They’re

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.640
Sharks are social and we’ve
found them to stick together

have favorite buddies.
at least at this age.

Hi. what’s up my man.

392
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.840
During my research
I’ve seen lemon sharks
be social in captivity.

393
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.640
but it’s really cool to see
that happening in the wild.

394

CHESSIE: It’s
honestly amazing.

395
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.080
FÉLICIE: I think when most
people think about sharks they

396
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.440
are thinking about
a mindless killer.

397
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.960
but those sharks
have personalities and

398
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.120
even have a social structure
that’s quite complex.

MATT (off-screen): Great
hammerheads can cover
thousands of miles each year

409
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.680
and we're right
along one of their
known migration routes.

410

actually observe some of
the different behaviors.

tube of bait in the water.

422
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.080
That will start
attracting some hammerheads.

423

There's already quite a
few nurse sharks here.

424

MATT: Obviously. when we
have bait in the water.

425
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.640
it's not just hammerheads
that might show up.

426

At this dive
site we have a lot of
nurse sharks. bull sharks.

classify as an apex predator.

441
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.080
They're designed
to hunt down prey.

powerful and can potentially
weigh close to a 1.000 pounds.

FÉLICIE: Oh. I
thought that was
really. really fascinating.

529
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.520
There is obviously a
hierarchy between the
different groups of sharks.

And the difference between
those great hammerheads

531

is really stunning.

538
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.240
there might be a hierarchy.

<i>that social hierarchy</i>

543
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.920

the biggest hammerhead that
we've had in Bimini to date.

544
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.800
But even though she's massive.
she's actually a bit timid.

545
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.520
She's not just
throwing her weight around.

546
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.960
She's coming in
trying to figure out

547
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.400
her positioning in this group.

548
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.520
It really makes you
understand that it's not

549
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.000
always the size
of the shark in the fight.

550
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.120
but really a lot
of times the size of
the fight in that shark.

551

they're driven to want to be

564
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.440

lot of predators.

including sharks. but the main
species you’re probably going

566

to see are some
of the black tips.

567
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.000
<i>NARRATOR: Black tips are</i>
<i>extremely agile sharks.</i>

568

574
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.640
up to 10.000 along
the beaches here.

575
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.960
They are mostly eating fish.
but they are probably

576
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.840

of accidental bites on humans.

coming down the beach.

584
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.280
the big predators are
pushing them closer and

585
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.600
closer to the beach.

586
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.920
And you get these people that
have no idea and they swim out

587
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.720
and there’s sharks
just crashing everywhere.

588
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.000
And there’s people out there.

589
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.720
literally in the middle of
a monster feeding frenzy.

590
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.480
YANNIS: So. they’re
hunting right next to shore?

591
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.520
GREG: Oh. yeah.
There’s a whole series of reef
that runs along the beach here

592
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.520
and kind of bottle
necks all the bait.

593
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.360
YANNIS: So. the mullet
can’t get any deeper.

594
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.360

595
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.280

in whether these animals are

actually hunting together.

601
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.920
True cooperation is where
everybody has a specific job

602
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.440
and works together.

603
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.160
Orcas for example will
create a barrel wave

604
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.160
to knock seals off the ice.

605
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.040
It’s much more
cryptic with sharks.

606
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.680
It could just be that you
have this big lump of food and

607
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.680
everybody just turns up.

608
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.840

they’re hunting together.

615

The fish don’t
really have the option
of going to deeper water.

616

it could be a black tip.

You can see that halo around
the sharks as they move along.

621

sometimes people assume that
they are hunting in a pack.

681
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.680
I personally think each

683
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.440

a food source for them.

associating fish carcasses

806
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.120
two-year-old’s.
three-year-old’s.
four-year-old’s.

807
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.640
probably up to six years old
all hanging out here.

808
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.880
We have really young ones
here with more mature ones.

809
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.400
who are learning the ropes.

810
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.360
And it’s very possible that
they are watching other sharks

811
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.360
successfully dig out
and locate sting rays and

812
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.360
then are mimicking
that behavior.

813
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.960
<i>NARRATOR: So. could this</i>
<i>be the major breakthrough?</i>

814
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.840
<i>Are these gangs of</i>
<i>great whites learning</i>
<i>to hunt from each other?</i>

815
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.120
CHRIS: What we know
is certain individuals
will hang out together

816
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.240
and tend mimic each other.

817
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.640
And that’s the first
indication that we have that

818
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.640
there’s a communication.

819
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.280
It is very possible
that these sharks are
hanging out together

820
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.000
and creating
some sort of bond.

821
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.160
We’re finding that
they are far more social
than we’ve ever thought.

822
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.400
<i>NARRATOR: If sharks</i>
<i>are communicating.</i>

823
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:40.160
<i>learning from one another.</i>
<i>maybe even hunting together.</i>

824
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.160
<i>Then perhaps the ocean’s</i>
<i>most feared predators.</i>

825
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:55.120
<i>could be combining forces.</i>
<i>in a bid to rule the deep.</i>
