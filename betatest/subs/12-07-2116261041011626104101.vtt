3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.140
Where's the cat?

4
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.220
Where is it?

5
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.220
Baby...

6
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.540
I waved to him!

7
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.780
It's red!

8
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.940
I fucking could have made it through there.
What the fuck?

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.340
That's stupid!

10
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.980
No. because... look. Chris...

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.020
There is people in the middle.
you will put great traffic...

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.860
I would have been on right there.

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.860
What's the problem with you?
The law is the law.

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.500
That's a judgment call. it wasn't red.

15
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340
You missed a piece...

16
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.780
{\an8} What's up. man?

17
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.780
{\an8} I'm selling the box : 30 €.

18
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.740
{\an8} Yeah. but I play electric guitar.
I don't play acoustic.

19
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.340
{\an8} I'd put drugs in that thing.
I'd put drugs in there.

20
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.300
{\an8} "Chris Holmes on Radio Beat!"

21
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.180
We've been talking about him during the last hour.

22
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.740
finally. guitarist Chris Holmes is in our studio
for the first time ever!

23
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.540
Chris. for many people.
you are an american rock star who leads a wild life.

24
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.700
What do you think of the way people see you?

25
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.700
I don't really care.

26
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.100
They’re not the ones paying my bills.

27
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.140
A rock star is somebody like Gene Simmons.

28
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.940
who wants to be...

29
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.700
They walk in the room and:
"I'm a rock star."

30
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.060
Me. it's a way of life or whatever.

31
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.340
It's a personality. you know.

32
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.260
I don't even have any memorabilia from W.A.S.P.

33
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.980
Nothing.
- Nothing left?

34
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.420
The biggest part of the sound was Chris' guitar.

35
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.100
and just his attitude.
the way he played. man.

36
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.740
He was like angry:
"Motherfucker...!"

37
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.580
He was angry and that was all
part of the fuckin' attitude. man.

38
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.020
Chris is a huge part of the W.A.S.P. sound for sure.

39
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.820
His guitar tone and his parts are huge part of it.

40
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.940
The most metal guy in that band. for sure.

41
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.380
That guy was not messing around.
he was living it.

42
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.260
I recognize him as an icon in music.

43
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.340
When I first got into heavy-metal.

44
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.420
{\an8} W.A.S.P. and especially Chris Holmes.
was one of the first inspirational figureheads.

45
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.180
There was Ozzy.
this was beyond KISS.

46
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.780
I remember watching those pictures in the magazines.

47
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.220
looking at Chris Holmes with the black eyeliner
and the big blond hair...

48
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.900
"That's a cool guy. I wanna be him."

49
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.020
Chris was like the US version of Lemmy.
back in the early 80s.

50
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.980
He was Lemmy.
but just more crazy. psycho.

51
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.980
uncontrollable...

52
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.540
That was rock n' roll.

53
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.180
That's what the L.A. scene really needed.

54
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.140
to take it out of that glam-rock stigma
that was going on in L.A.

55
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.420
The first two W.A.S.P. records
are still two of my favorite records.

56
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.340
{\an8} I remember listening to that. going:
"I gotta move to L.A..

57
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.380
'cause that's where that's happening."

58
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.500
Those really inspired me to get my ass out there.

59
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.340
My wife and I moved from L.A. to Europe.

60
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.460
so we came to visit her parents.
they live in Cannes.

61
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.700
"No. baby. I see you..."

62
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.020
People think that W.A.S.P. was successful or whatever...

63
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.220
Yeah. we sold a lot of records
and we were successful.

64
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.380
but I didn't understand how the money worked and all that stuff.

65
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.140
so all the contracts. I guess I signed away...

66
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.380
I didn't even sign away my publishing.
I never got any out of it.

67
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.780
Freddie !

68
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.620
Don't kiss me or I'll fuckin' punch you.

69
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.900
{\an8} My name is Frédéric Bujoli.
I've been a lawyer for 15 years.

70
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.820
{\an8} I'm a huge heavy-metal and hard-rock fan.

71
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.820
{\an8} W.A.S.P. was of course
one of the big 80s bands we listened to.

72
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.100
{\an8} Chris is now a singer
and looking towards the future.

73
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.260
{\an8} but we need to restore his rights from his past.

74
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.420
{\an8} Many things have not been settled since 1984.

75
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.540
"Come over here.
come here Ug."

76
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.780
Here in France.
a lot of people get mad that I don't speak French.

77
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.020
but I don't sing in French.

78
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.780
I'd learn English language first. before I learn French.
but I still don't even know that.

79
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.700
It's probably better that I don't understand what they say anyway.

80
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.940
It's probably better that I don't understand it.

81
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.460
Other than talking.
there are other languages like this.

82
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.540
That.

83
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.140
Yo!

84
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.060
This guy saw me play in L.A. in 1991.

85
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.740
1991.

86
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.180
A long time ago.

87
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.340
I saw this fuckin' guy on stage.

88
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.340
You can't break it.

89
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.380
Hair dryer... I get my hair dry.

90
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.540
Most of the people
I've surrounded myself with in Hollywood.

91
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.820
they just care about themselves:
"What can you do for me?"

92
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.940
Most of all other girls in my life.
they really didn't give a crap about my career.

93
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.500
or me playing music. or anything like that.

94
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.540
Sarah kinda cared about what I did musically.

95
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.140
{\an8} We spent a whole evening talking.

96
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.980
{\an8} He told me about his life.
I told him about mine.

97
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.820
{\an8} It was natural and we never left each other.

98
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.980
{\an8} Baby. there are people around.
you can't do that now.

99
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.300
{\an8} This was my previous wife. before.

100
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.180
{\an8} She gives me a hug in the front.

101
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.580
We've got ten minutes before
my first gig I ever sang in my life.

102
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.380
It's kind of a new chapter for me.

103
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.540
It's great now because
I don't have to put up with the L.S.D.

104
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.260
It's called Lead Singer Disease.

105
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.820
I've put up with that all my life.

106
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.220
I'm not saying that all lead singers are assholes.

107
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.540
A lot of them are.

108
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.300
The lead singer I worked with
for years was really hard to work with.

109
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.260
That makes the other guys really nice.

110
00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.380
even if they're not. right?

111
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.660
I like the part that makes people happy.

112
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.140
makes me put some smile on their face.

113
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.300
People bring their own records and want them signed.
You've gotta do that.

114
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.980
They get to take a picture with somebody
they probably never thought they would be able to.

115
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.980
You see a lot of people smile and say thanks.

116
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.900
I like that.

117
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.860
I don't like making people sad.

118
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.860
- Good night!
- Thank you!

119
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.500
I am the one and only Blackie Lawless.

120
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.580
and this is Chris Holmes:
speak for them. Chris!

121
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.660
Sometimes he has to... stop!

122
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.700
W.A.S.P. were likes of new wave of shock band.

123
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.900
They were really good as well.

124
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.540
They took "God of Thunder" by KISS
and they built on that.

125
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.580
How could you not love the theatrics?

126
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.460
First time I heard the song "Fuck Like a Beast".
I was just on the floor laughing.

127
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.380
{\an8} I was reading the only magazine for popular music in Sweden.
growing up.

128
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.860
{\an8} and W.A.S.P. had just come out
with their first album.

129
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.620
it was like an uproar in Sweden.
everybody was outraged about this new music.

130
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.660
When you paid for your ticket to go watch W.A.S.P..

131
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.140
your shirt was worn-out
when you walked out there.

132
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.820
'cause you just got entertained for an hour and a half. in a big way.

133
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.780
The first show they did was like on a Tuesday night.

134
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.700
At that time. there was no Internet.
no cellphones or big clunky things.

135
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.540
They had a couple hundred people
from word of mouth.

136
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.140
That's when they tortured the girl on the rack.

137
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.340
The story goes that the next Saturday.
they kicked the headliner off.

138
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.780
they put W.A.S.P. on it
and 3.000 people came down.

139
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.860
The fire marshalls wanted to shut them down.

140
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.660
Blackie's idea was costumes that have weaponry.

141
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.940
He had sawblades. bolts. lag bolts.

142
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.660
and that stupid saw between his legs.
I knew that was gonna be trouble.

143
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.700
I heard later he blew himself up one time.

144
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.580
It was scary because who the hell is eating raw meat on stage.

145
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.260
and then throwing it at the crowd.
and the crowd loving it?

146
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.420
It was insane.
I never wanted to be in the front row.

147
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.540
I'd stay in the back because I didn't want to get hit by some raw meat.

148
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.340
{\an8} It was very scary.

149
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.220
{\an8} to see these huge men come out on stage.
fire everywhere. smoke going off...

150
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.420
Blackie actually came up
with the idea for the fire sign.

151
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.460
but he wanted to do it round.
with the name in the middle.

152
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.900
I said "no. just frame the name".

153
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.220
Frame the name in big letters.

154
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.460
we'll get fire resistant paint.

155
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.940
'cause the letters were just wood.

156
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.980
double-coat so nothing will burn.
put bolts in it.

157
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.460
scratch'em up a lot. make them look nasty.

158
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.540
and then blow this flame up around

159
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.140
with two 5-gallon tanks of propane.
that's one of them right back there.

160
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.180
One of the original propane tanks.

161
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.420
And just doing crazy shit...

162
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.860
Chris was wild.

163
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.420
He is a showman.

164
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:50.420
He could be just tired.
not in a good mood or bummed out.

165
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.780
soon as the lights hit. he was an animal.

166
00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:03.020
I always relied on. first of all the music
that comes out of my hands.

167
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.380
through the guitar.
trough the speaker cabinets.

168
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.940
off the stage.
That's what people are gonna get.

169
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.260
The theatrics... I don't know...

170
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:19.940
I look at like like people that have to do it.
they're not good enough to be themselves.

171
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.500
They're not good enough to be on stage
and people buying a ticket to watch it.

172
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.460
Myself is.
I am.

173
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.220
He could do without the costumes.

174
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.540
which is why he cut the butt off of his original costume.

175
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.940
He said "If I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna do it my way."

176
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.940
I saw the film Jimi Hendrix and...

177
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.740
That's my dog.
He's Ug.

178
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.260
I saw the film Jimi Hendrix and...

179
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.660
The way he played. jumping around...

180
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.140
I dug it man. that's all I wanted to do.

181
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.180
I never thought of myself:

182
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.460
"Wow. ok. I'll create this guy. Chris Holmes."

183
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.340
Gotta be always filming!

184
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.620
You gotta hang that thing around your neck.

185
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.540
That's it. right?

186
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.500
Move that piece of shit!

187
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.660
- Chris!
- What?

188
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:07.460
The sound is ok.
but when you play. it's too loud.

189
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.980
It's heavy metal. you can't ask Chris Holmes
to play down like he plays disco!

190
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.060
Hey. who fucked up on the soundcheck?

191
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.020
These guys are waiting for us.

192
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.020
Why do you look at me when you do that?

193
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.220
Sarah. I'm not saying you did.

194
00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.820
We play at 10?

195
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.940
{\an8} My amp's fucked!

196
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.700
How you doin'?

197
00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.820
What's up?

198
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.180
I have to thank for one thing my wife Sarah.

199
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.780
if it wasn't for her. I wouldn't be here at all.

200
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.700
I'll be at home in my closet. drinking.

201
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.140
smoking dope. doing nothing...

202
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.860
Thank you very much!

203
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.180
First time that I listen to Mean Man.

204
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.700
Really good music for me.

205
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.220
Nice to meet you.

206
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.860
Czech Republic. Prague!

207
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.740
You deserve a kiss!

208
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.660
Oh thank you!

209
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.820
My husband thinks
that he's the best guitar player ever.

210
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.820
Rock n' roll!

211
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.220
God. I wished my fuckin' amp worked. man.

212
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.860
We're going to change that when we go back. baby.

213
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.940
That was a bummer.

214
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.940
You all made a great show.

215
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.180
Baby. stop. stop. stop!

216
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.940
Chris. people are sleeping!

217
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.060
I know. that's why I do it.

218
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.980
Do you like more to record or playing live?

219
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.100
I like playing live.

220
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.580
If I had a choice it would be playing live.

221
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.500
How does it feel
when your own wife is managing you?

222
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.860
I don't trust anybody else.

223
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.740
I never got a penny out of W.A.S.P.

224
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.580
I've been "famous" but...

225
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:16.740
All my publishing money
goes right into somebody's pocket.

226
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.460
I trusted somebody who I shouldn't have trusted.

227
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.380
My name's on the record as a songwriter.

228
00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.020
but I don't get the money for it.

229
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.100
I saw some fans last night
singing the songs that I wrote.

230
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.620
That made me happy.

231
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.860
How do you rest after concerts?

232
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.740
Rest?

233
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.820
Usually I lay parallel...

234
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.660
I'd like to play on top of Mount Everest.

235
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.060
You think you can do it?

236
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.940
I don't know.
I always had a dream to walk there.

237
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.060
take acoustic guitar.

238
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.060
play "Yankee Doodle Dandy" or something...

239
00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.100
"Kumbaya"...

240
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.020
Getting there and play "Fuck Like a Beast"...

241
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.580
That's my beard.

242
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.700
This is what happens when you don't shave.

243
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.540
I miss the part of when I traveled on the bus.

244
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.180
and I didn't have to worry about my instruments.
or guitars. or anything.

245
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.780
I'd walk in the soundcheck. play a few notes.

246
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.340
give the roadies the guitar. then come out and play.
Just had to take care of myself.

247
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.500
Since I'm starting out again.
I've got to worry about my stuff.

248
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.300
It's a little harder.
but I like to play. you know.

249
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.060
Is that everything?

250
00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.740
A lot of people from the 80s
are not playing anymore.

251
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:15.460
One good think. I can still walk.
I'm kind of in good health. I guess.

252
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.460
Can I just look at the engine?

253
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.940
I wanna see the engine.
I'm from America.

254
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.540
I'm from America.
I'm just kind of curious.

255
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.620
- What's this?
- The air...

256
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.980
Hot and cold.

257
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.980
It's got a turbocharger on it.

258
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.780
- What kind of car is that?
- Germany car.

259
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:55.140
- What year?
- Trabant 1968.

260
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.260
It's cool. Thanks for showing me that.

261
00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.580
Big motorcycle.

262
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.540
Thanks for showing me that. I appreciate it.

263
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.860
I'd never seen a car like that in my life.

264
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.660
Man. a two-stroke!

265
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.340
Chris Holmes was a character.

266
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:35.380
{\an8} Everybody in L.A. that was into hard-rock and metal
knew of Chris Holmes.

267
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.140
He was really an icon
in the L.A. hard-rock and metal scene.

268
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.340
I remember actually the photo shoot.

269
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.420
when Chris was sitting on that chopper frame.

270
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.500
He had a barrel. a beer and a cigar.
We were wasted that day.

271
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.060
That was at Neil Zlozower's studio in Hollywood.

272
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.940
Me and Chris were outside
with the homeless street people. drinking and shit.

273
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.980
Blackie was pissed off inside
because we were out there getting drunk

274
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.660
outside in Hollywood...
That's a true story.

275
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.380
Get the fuck out.

276
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.620
Excuse me man. these guys make me crazy.

277
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.180
We got a record deal within a year.

278
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.900
We got one within nine months.

279
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.340
With Rod Smallwood at Capitol Records.
that's how we hit the big time.

280
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.940
I was just happy making money on playing music.

281
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.660
I started off with 125$ a week.

282
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.940
that was great.

283
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.900
Before that. I wasn't making nothing.

284
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:47.780
If I would have understood
how the publishing and all that shit worked then.

285
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.620
Blackie and I would have went head to head
and I wouldn't have been in the band that long.

286
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.260
He would have fired me real quick.

287
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.820
Sure. everybody wants to be successful.

288
00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.300
I wanted to play hard-rock.
Do what Jimi Hendrix did.

289
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:07.420
To get to that level.
there's a lot of business crap you've got to take care of.

290
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:13.180
Everyday photo sessions. this and that...
just for the business...

291
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.580
We signed with Rod Smallwood.

292
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.900
they were like a bank.
so at that point we had all the money we needed

293
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.140
to get the band off the road. you know.

294
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.660
In the beginning.
it was all for one. one for all.

295
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.940
Everybody puttin' in what they did.

296
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:36.340
After the first record.
Blackie wanted it just to be him.

297
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.540
He didn't want the other guys in the band.

298
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.860
Look at the records:
should I say anymore?

299
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.140
Who's on the cover of the second one?
Who's on the cover of the third one?

300
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.740
He didn't want it to be a band after the first album.

301
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.220
he just wanted it to be
the Blackie Lawless project.

302
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.300
After that I really didn't give a shit about it.

303
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.140
- When you were a little kid. did you want to be a rock star?
- Yes I did.

304
00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.780
Definitely.

305
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.940
But she wouldn't let me...

306
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.860
Hello mom. can I take a rock guitar?
She says. well...

307
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:13.740
No you can't.
'cause you'll turn into those drug infested rockstars.

308
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.780
- Do you consider yourself...
- A piece of crap.

309
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.660
Why ?

310
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.900
Well. because I work the job...
and I'm a piece of crap.

311
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.860
What do you think
you're gonna be doing ten years from now?

312
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.140
I'll probably be dead.
You'll come and see me in my graveyard.

313
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:41.180
Do you think this kind of rock n' roll lifestyle is hard on you
and maybe that's why you drink?

314
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.380
I'm a full-blown alcoholic.

315
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.860
and I drink because...
look...

316
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.260
He's gonna be remembered for that
for the rest of his life. at some point.

317
00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.380
Somebody will bring it up again.

318
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.300
But that's rock n' roll...!

319
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.860
I think I had the same reaction as everybody.
I mean. it was sad.

320
00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.940
I always wondered how much of it was real.

321
00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.260
Over the years.
I've had that conversation with him several times:

322
00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.020
depending on what his mood is.
he gives me a different answer.

323
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.860
That was vodka. that was real.

324
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.580
That thing about me and Chris. we never...

325
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.900
These guys. they put ice-tea and people think
they're drinking Jack Daniel's on stage...

326
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.380
It was water. for Christ's sake!

327
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.260
Chris is not gonna pour
a whole bottle of vodka over his head.

328
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.780
That's a waste of vodka.

329
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.420
When I did "The Decline".
Blackie was flaming pissed.

330
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.340
He flipped out.

331
00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.300
But I had already done it behind his back.
I didn't really care at that point.

332
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.580
Penelope called him and wanted him to do it.

333
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.580
But he wanted budget to do this and that...

334
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.540
She didn't have the budget for it.
so she asked me to do an interview.

335
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.620
To me. it was just a stupid interview...

336
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:15.900
Chris is a natural rolled out of bed rock star.

337
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.940
Blackie Lawless is Steven Duren

338
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.060
that turns into Blackie Lawless
and then turns back into Steven Duren.

339
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.660
Chris Holmes is Chris Holmes the whole fuckin' time.

340
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.180
The only way I can explain it is:

341
00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.820
here is the bus. it goes down the highway.

342
00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.660
the bus stops at the show.

343
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.540
Steven Duren gets off the bus.

344
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.340
goes in. puts on Blackie Lawless.

345
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.180
does the Blackie Lawless show.

346
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.180
gets off-stage. takes off Blackie Lawless.

347
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.300
walks out the dressing room:
Steven Duren. then he gets on the bus.

348
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.180
Blackie doesn't love interacting with people.

349
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.780
that's why he doesn't do the fan thing that much.

350
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.020
Holmes loves people.

351
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.780
There's this whole line of kids.

352
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.060
Chris comes up to the bus.

353
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.780
The kids go "Hey. can we get your autograph?"
He's like "Absolutely!"

354
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.500
He goes on the bus
and Blackie Lawless rips him one. dude...

355
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.020
"Don't ever do that.
Don't ever go for the kids and do that.

356
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.060
You're wasting our time..."

357
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.900
He's like:
"What? They're all fans."

358
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.980
He used to hold Chris back.

359
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.460
On stage you can't hold Chris back.
He's gonna be Chris on stage.

360
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.060
That means jumping. that means spinning.

361
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.940
skipping. everything...!

362
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.060
But in the studio. Blackie would hold him back:

363
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:40.660
would keep his level down.
wouldn't let him play some of the leads he wanted to play...

364
00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.460
He was always telling him what to do.

365
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.620
My feeling was always like:

366
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.380
"You hired this guy to play in your band
because of a certain sound.

367
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.780
and you don't want him to have that certain sound?"
That's ridiculous.

368
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.100
Here we are in beautiful Paris.

369
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.940
As you see. this is a house of worship up here.

370
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.260
It's called Pierre-Versailles. whatever...

371
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.940
And if you look over here.

372
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.380
there's the most famous icon in the world. right here.

373
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.340
Some guy named Eiffel built it.

374
00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:18.660
I don't know if that's his first name or his last name.
but it's a big famous icon.

375
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.180
You can't touch. baby.

376
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.820
Superman!

377
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.540
An angel...

378
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.060
That painting ain't shit.

379
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.860
Cupcake!

380
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.940
Cupcake!

381
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.620
I love you!

382
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.540
We're gonna get high!

383
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.660
Wow. that's a view.

384
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.540
{\an8} Nice to meet you.

385
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.260
- My lady...
- Thank you.

386
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.340
- My name is Pierre.
- What's up Pierre?

387
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.540
I"m very impressed.

388
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.420
What do you feed the cat with?

389
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.580
It's my cat.
His name is Miu.

390
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.420
The cat's huge.
It's the biggest cat I've ever seen!

391
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.740
And these are all the people I have photographed.

392
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.660
Famous French actors...

393
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.940
You know the light?
It's a movie light.

394
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.380
Like the light in the movies in 1930.

395
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:06.980
You have one. two. three. four. five lights for you.

396
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.340
{\an8} Get ready...
Great!

397
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.340
- This is the gold light...
- That's a reflector light.

398
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.420
Look!

399
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.620
You are the Lord of the Rings.

400
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.540
{\an8} Up! Up!

401
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:30.180
{\an8} Beautiful.
One. two. three...

402
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.380
{\an8} Very nice. my dear.
Wait!

403
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.900
Yes. yes.

404
00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.580
{\an8} Got it!

405
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.060
{\an8} I'm very impressed.
He has a unique presence.

406
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.780
{\an8} He doesn't confide easily.

407
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.340
{\an8} He has a great future ahead.

408
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:55.260
{\an8} He has a real presence.
it only takes four shots.

409
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.140
I remember meeting each other at the NAMM show.

410
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.500
{\an8} Chris Holmes comes walking.

411
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.660
{\an8} Doesn't matter the size of the room.
the room got really small.

412
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.860
When Chris is in the room.
there's no space left.

413
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:56.020
One thing about Chris is he got along
with all others musicians and bands.

414
00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.460
There was only one one musician and one band.
and that was Blackie Lawless.

415
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.500
that he didn't get along with very well.
Otherwise he gets along with everybody.

416
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.660
{\an8} We all loved Chris
and he was just great to have around.

417
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.060
{\an8} I think he actually hung out with us
a lot more than he hung out with his own band.

418
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.940
In 1985-86. I was doing security for Black Sabbath.

419
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:19.180
Chris kept showing up at Tony Iommi's door
at 3 or 4 in the morning.

420
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:23.220
"Come on Tony. let's go party!"
I had to go out. because Tony was my guy.

421
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:28.060
I finally told Chris: "You have to stop
coming in the room at 3 or 4 in the morning.

422
00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.020
You're killing me.
I need to sleep at some point."

423
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.700
"Fuck off! I don't care!"

424
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.300
That's the sound Chris was always after.

425
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.780
He wanted to get Tony Iommi's sound.

426
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.660
Funny thing is. he met Tony Iommi on a tour.

427
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.860
Tony Iommi said "I've been trying to get your sound
for the last ten years."

428
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:51.060
Basically one of his guitar gods.
to say "I love your sound".

429
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.900
that's pretty unusual.

430
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.420
He's my idol. he's great.

431
00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.140
I did lots of chemicals with him.
and drank...

432
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.860
It was great touring with him.
that was 30 years ago...

433
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.500
We were touring with Maiden.

434
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.580
we climbed up in the truss. above the stage.
Maiden was on stage.

435
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:15.140
We were above Nicko yelling down:
"Fuck you! Nicko you suck. man!"

436
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.900
He's looking up and he's going like this.

437
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.660
Anyway. they were between songs.

438
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.540
and Bruce was in front of the stage
talking to the audience.

439
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.500
Chris took this apple and let it go.

440
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.660
and it hit Nicko in his face.

441
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.140
It's just a funny story.
nobody know what goes on.

442
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.060
He hit him in face.
"I'll kill you motherfucker!"

443
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.540
When it's time to turn on the Chris Holmes button.

444
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.820
then he turns it on and it's overdrive.
it's way over the top.

445
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.380
We were playing in Lisbon in Portugal
and we had a day off.

446
00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.180
Everyone knew that W.A.S.P. was in town.

447
00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.820
Every bar that me and Chris went to.
we had free drinks. free food...

448
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.540
We wound back at the hotel.
I remember crawling on the grass...

449
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:30.180
When I first met Chris. he was kind of a shy
surfer-looking guy with long blond hair.

450
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.260
committed to playing guitar.
that's all he cared about.

451
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.860
As you get out into the world
and discover alcohol.

452
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.700
and other things that everybody seemed to be doing
back at that time period.

453
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.460
it's easy to fall into that trap.

454
00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:50.020
I'd just go out to the clubs.
get drunk and piss people off.

455
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.540
I'd play rock star or whatever...

456
00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.460
I always thought he'd never make it past 30.

457
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.620
I met Lita Ford at the Cathouse.

458
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:11.180
She was doing the album
"Close My Eyes Forever".

459
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.780
She was kind of big. I was big at the same time.
we hooked up...

460
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.020
She tried to get me to stop drinking.
but I wouldn't stop drinking.

461
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.500
I wasn't surprised or impressed.
I was happy for him.

462
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.500
I think it was an important part of his life
as far as him maturing as a guitar player.

463
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.220
That was a big time in his life.

464
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.460
That was the first
that he bought a house that he could call his.

465
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.620
I used to see them together:
they got along well. they both drank...

466
00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.340
They both had a great time.

467
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.860
{\an8} She was too music. and he was music.

468
00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:49.740
{\an8} You can't deal with one going on tour.
the other one's home. the other goes on tour...

469
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.500
You just can't have a couple.

470
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.460
{\an8} From North America.
with their spectacular heavy sound.

471
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.500
{\an8} here is W.A.S.P.!

472
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:28.020
It's sad to change band members
so many times in W.A.S.P.

473
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.020
People don't like seeing that.

474
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.420
What made the band eventually killed it.

475
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.540
An ego.

476
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.580
You've ever seen me in a guitar magazine?

477
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.340
I've never been on a guitar magazine in my life.
not one.

478
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.860
Blackie decides who's gonna do interviews:
he would never let me do them.

479
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.460
because I'd get more press.

480
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:53.580
My personality kept me from doing
most of the interviews.

481
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.500
I knew Chris was angry.

482
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.060
Chris holds it in
and pretty soon Chris is gonna explode.

483
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.500
That's the way he is.

484
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.700
Blackie. I knew.
was gonna do more and more to put him down.

485
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.180
He wanted it to be the Blackie Lawless show.

486
00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.300
He kept Chris in the background as much as he could.

487
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.260
with interviews.

488
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:40.300
with how much he'd allow him to turn up in the studio.
different little things...

489
00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.740
He didn't like to share the spotlight.

490
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:49.540
I left W.A.S.P. in 1991.

491
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:55.780
I just couldn't take Blackie's bullshit
of just him. him. him and the band.

492
00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.860
Some things were lied to me about.

493
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:06.460
I just didn't want to take it. it got to the point
where I wanted nothing to do with W.A.S.P.

494
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.340
I go with he quit.

495
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.380
He got dragged through the mud for too many years.
He finally went: "I'm done".

496
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:20.780
When Lita kicked him out. she dropped him off
on my porch with a couple of suitcases.

497
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.620
I opened the door and said
"Here's your spot to sleep".

498
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.580
and we were digging our chains together.

499
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.380
None of us could work. he was an all about no jobs.

500
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.500
We all had to quit our jobs: "How we're gonna live?"
And we did...

501
00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.660
I ran into the singer Johnny Severe
through a friend who knew him.

502
00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.580
He came up and we decided to do a band.

503
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.340
We found Chris Olson.

504
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:07.260
and Mike Kortz played bass.

505
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.460
He wanted all the members
to be born and raised in Southern California.

506
00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.740
Don't know why.

507
00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.940
I guess he thought we all fought the same.

508
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.020
Psycho Squad was an interesting band.

509
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:24.660
I think the band was founded on the promise
of how much can you drink and still play.

510
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.940
They used to get pretty well lit-up.

511
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:44.620
It was enjoyable doing music that I wrote.

512
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.740
I could write the whole thing
and not have to worry about somebody

513
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.180
saying "no that's not good".

514
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:55.380
Somebody else taking all the credits
for what you're doing...

515
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.580
When we put Psycho Squad together.
we got endorsed by everybody.

516
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.060
We got us endorsed by Art to the Bone.

517
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:06.860
And pretty soon Chris is getting tattooed...

518
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.660
I think he's got flames and skulls on his fingers.

519
00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:16.660
a big skeleton in his back
with a knife shoved in his back:

520
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.060
"Go ahead. everybody else has".

521
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.340
I think I do know what the meaning of that was.

522
00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.980
I think it was Blackie. you know.

523
00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.300
Johnny was a good guy.

524
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.660
He drank a lot.

525
00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.140
He was a great lyricist.

526
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.340
He's the one who opened my eyes...

527
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.780
Before him I never listened to lyrics that much.

528
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:41.220
even in W.A.S.P. I never really cared
what Blackie talked about.

529
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.860
Psycho Squad. we didn't do no theatrics.

530
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.380
We just went in and kicked you in the teeth.

531
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.460
Our opening song: "Thrash the Place".
'cause that's how we felt.

532
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:54.860
That time. grunge had just happened.

533
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.700
Nirvana hit it real big.

534
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.940
Nirvana killed the hair bands.

535
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.660
Psycho Squad broke up.

536
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:08.540
I was just tired. I thought
"You know what. this is bullshit. I'm outta here".

537
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.060
For us to get a record deal was almost obsolete.

538
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.100
We still tried but couldn't.

539
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.740
I think we played together for about a year and a half.

540
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.780
Chris Olson just called me about a month ago.

541
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:36.140
he said that they found Johnny.
the singer. dead in his house.

542
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:42.340
His front door was opened.
he was laying in the living-room. frozen...

543
00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.420
Like Bon Scott.

544
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.140
He liked to drink.
so he's probably gotten too drunk and passed out.

545
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.860
He left his door opened and froze...

546
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.380
{\an8} One. two. test.

547
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.820
{\an8} Zabou. can you hear me?

548
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.180
Here. you should put it on.

549
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.980
Hey. Sarah!

550
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.260
Sarah. take a picture.

551
00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.060
He's gonna play a song with us.

552
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.740
Good.

553
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.180
You can turn your amp on 10!

554
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.580
He built his first guitar
with a friend of his named Gary Presley.

555
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.740
They did it in woodshop class.

556
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.260
built the body.
they did the neck and everything themselves...

557
00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.980
The wiring. the electronics.

558
00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.300
wiring coils up with more wire.

559
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.140
so you get a higher magnetic field.
you get more distortion.

560
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:40.620
Chris discovered a lot of things about what you can
do to a guitar to make it sound different.

561
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:44.540
A Fender Jazzmaster.
that was my first real guitar.

562
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.300
I got it for 80 bucks from a guy down the street.

563
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.780
How did I find it?
Selling drugs...

564
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.180
I was going to school in Pasadena.

565
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.940
my friend John was going to school
in La Cañada with Chris.

566
00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.100
Chris had put a band together.

567
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.740
He was looking to get a singer.

568
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.340
and I was ready to say
"I'll be a rockstar. no problem".

569
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.220
I didn't know how to sing.

570
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.660
That was a band called Slave.

571
00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.260
I think I was 17 there.

572
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.260
1976 or 1977.

573
00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.140
That's a long time ago...

574
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.980
Look how skinny I was.

575
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.980
I was like a toothpick.

576
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.980
The first time I saw him play
was actually at Crescenta Valley High School.

577
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.260
They had something called a quad.
it was an outdoor sort of amphitheatre.

578
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.060
I couldn't take my eyes off of him.

579
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.980
I was thinking:
"This guy's a really good guitar player.

580
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.620
He's got stage presence and he has energy".

581
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.380
{\an8} We were all playing high-schools.
american legion halls.

582
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.580
{\an8} backyard parties. kegger parties...

583
00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:01.820
This was the era when people
started getting one or two kegs of beer.

584
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.060
charging a dollar at the gate.

585
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:07.420
and getting 300/400 kids
in the backyard with a band.

586
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.660
We'd make our own light system:

587
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.300
we'd make a big box
and throw some colored lights in there.

588
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.740
set them on the amps.
and that's how we'd get our light show.

589
00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.500
Here's a great shot of Chris with his Destroyer.

590
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.620
That must have been his first tattoo.

591
00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.820
That's Sister. when I met Blackie.

592
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.060
I met the drummer first. then I met Blackie.

593
00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.780
I was 20 so it had to be 1977.

594
00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.860
I thought: "Oh my gosh. this team of Blackie and Chris
is a really really good one.

595
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.500
These two will probably be a really good duo.

596
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.820
With their height. their craziness.

597
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.260
their wildness. their musicianship.
everything.

598
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.020
There was just someting there.

599
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:50.940
Blackie was just a slave driver.
I didn't like the way he was.

600
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:54.140
I couldn't wait to get out of the situation.

601
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.540
when it was ok for me to leave. I left.

602
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:02.340
After that.
I played with a band called Buster Savage.

603
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.940
I'll never forget:
I saw Buster Savage at the Starwood.

604
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.540
{\an8} Chris Holmes came out.
with a baseball cap on. wearing aviators.

605
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.500
he's got like a dust mask on.

606
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.780
They're playing the first song and he's totally grooving.

607
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.660
Comes up to the solo section.

608
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.500
and then he just whips off the hat.

609
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:26.140
and all this long-ass hair one length comes out!

610
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.180
He starts rippin' on this solo.

611
00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:34.420
I'm like 15...
"What the fuck is this!"

612
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.300
I got in trouble drinking and driving
and I had to go to jail at Cerwin Vega.

613
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.940
they laid me out so I could collect unemployment jail.

614
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:47.180
The day I got out. my sister goes:
"This guy named Blackie called.

615
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.940
Here's his number."

616
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.380
I didn't talk to Blackie for years.

617
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:58.140
I called him. he said he needed to talk to me.
He had the idea of W.A.S.P.

618
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.260
That was about 1981.

619
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.540
I kind of didn't want to play with the guy then.

620
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.620
but he promised a record deal.

621
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.060
I said "Yeah I'll play with him for a year".

622
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.100
and we got a deal.

623
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.420
Here we are in Stockholm.

624
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.980
That's me.

625
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.740
Sweden!

626
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:59.940
French guy. right?
French coffee...

627
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.060
Chris. American.
American cup.

628
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.980
Welcome back to Headbangers' Ball.
it's our Valentine's Day Massacre.

629
00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.860
it's actually gonna turn
into a bloody Valentine right now.

630
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.300
'cause I gotta say to you: "Kill Fuck Die".

631
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.380
I'm not being rude:
that is the title of the new W.A.S.P. album.

632
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.380
out on the 24th March.

633
00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.540
As you can see. Blackie and Chris are joining me
here at Rock City in Nottingham.

634
00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.580
May I say that you look absolutely fantastic.
it's great to have you back on the show.

635
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:09.420
So welcome. just to start off.
you've been playing some shows in Europe.

636
00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.820
How have things been going?

637
00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.740
We're doing a seven show pep rally.
effectively. it's what it boils down to.

638
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.660
Because as you mention.
the album's out on March 24.

639
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:24.460
and Chris and I have not played together
in public for 7 years.

640
00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.020
We decided to come and give everybody a teaser

641
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.060
before we do the real tour in the next couple of months.

642
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.220
You're certainly creating a buzz.

643
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.260
everybody is talking about the W.A.S.P. show
which I guess is exactly what you want.

644
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.900
I've created a buzz all the time.

645
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.020
I've lived in Hollywood.

646
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:48.260
got stuck in the Hollywood drug-grunge scene
just living there...

647
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.620
Then I had a chance to go to Wyoming for a while.

648
00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.060
My sister's ranch. I went up there.

649
00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:00.940
Russell Wallace called me and said'
"Hey Chris. Blackie wants to talk to you."

650
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:05.300
That's the last thing I'd ever thought I was gonna hear about.

651
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.540
He gave me his number. I called him up.

652
00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.300
I go: "Yeah. what's the deal?"

653
00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.380
He goes:
"I want to know if you wanna go on tour again."

654
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.060
I go: "That was the last thing on my mind.

655
00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.940
If you wanna know an answer right now.
it's no.

656
00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.700
- Is there a chance ?
- Yeah. let me think about it.

657
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.940
He goes: "Well I give you 'til a week."

658
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.420
I rejoined in 1995.

659
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.100
Blackie needed that.
'cause Blackie kept trying different things.

660
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.740
but when Chris came back.
it kind of breathed new life into it.

661
00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.980
He kinda covered that up from me for a while.

662
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.780
He'd be playing with them about a year before I saw him again.

663
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.420
"You're not gonna believe it.
but I joined W.A.S.P. again..."

664
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.220
I'm like: "Chris. when are you gonna learn?"

665
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.340
{\an8} We destroyed our female following with K.F.D.

666
00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.380
The cross. the nun.

667
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.580
fucking the nun. pulling out the foetus.

668
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.140
stabbing it on the knife-codpiece
and holding it up as if in victory...

669
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:16.460
It was too dark.
Women couldn't relate to it.

670
00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.220
The only reason I came back to play music
is because I wanted to travel again.

671
00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.700
to see Europe and stuff...

672
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.180
If not. I'd have probably never left L.A.

673
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:42.460
I went back and got my ass kicked a second time.

674
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.540
To get a good ass kicking.

675
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.860
'cause I hadn't get kicked good enough the first time.

676
00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.260
Then when he rejoined the band.

677
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.340
Blackie made it specific:

678
00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:56.380
he spent money to get him sober.

679
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.260
It was the best thing for Chris. and if we loved him.

680
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.260
and we wanted to be in the band.
then we needed to support his sobriety.

681
00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.260
I got a D.U.I.

682
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.100
I was out messing around in the clubs.
having fun.

683
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.340
doing the Chris thing
and got in trouble drunk again.

684
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.980
It kind of made me quit drinking.

685
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:17.300
I know they have their differences and all that.

686
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.860
but Blackie very much cared about Chris
and spent time and money to help him get sober.

687
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.620
Probably the best thing that ever happened to me

688
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.540
was getting a sixth D.U.I.

689
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.300
If I didn't get that 502.
I'd probably be dead now from drinking.

690
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.180
I'd probably drank myself to death.

691
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.020
I didn't play a note on "Unholy Terror".

692
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.700
Listen to the record.

693
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.780
Why do you think he'd put my name on it?
So it would sell.

694
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.580
If it didn't have my name on it
it wouldn't look like we did songs together.

695
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.020
"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting":
I didn't play on that.

696
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.740
and he put my name on it. I got pissed off.

697
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.140
I got mad.

698
00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:17.500
- I thought you'd want your name on it.
- I don't want my name on that shitty ass guitar playing.

699
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.380
If I didn't play on it.
I don't like lying on things like that.

700
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.660
There was a blow-out.

701
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.980
it happened at my studio.

702
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.740
It was in 2002.
Blackie came in with a piece of paper.

703
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.980
and I read it and it was a fan who said:

704
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.980
"I saw W.A.S.P. at Harpo's.
which is in Detroit.

705
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.740
I got everyone's autograph. except Blackie's.

706
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.940
Blackie went on the bus.
I asked Chris for Blackie's autograph.

707
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:48.380
Chris said no. he couldn't get it.

708
00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:54.260
I asked why". And the next caption was:
"He's a fucking asshole."

709
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.620
Blackie asked me if I said that.

710
00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.660
I gave him back the paper and I go:
"Yeah. I did say that."

711
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.860
He goes: "I thought we had a better
understanding about each other"

712
00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.620
I go: "Well. let me explain to you
why I said this."

713
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.980
And I explained it to him.

714
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:15.660
He got up. walked out of the room
and said he was jealous.

715
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.780
It was the last time I ever saw him.

716
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.980
We have to go back from the same way.

717
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.340
I just want to sleep.

718
00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.740
She's the guest of the place.

719
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.580
but the keys are not working. guys.

720
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.620
{\an8} Can you come and get us.
we don't know where we are...?

721
00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:51.940
{\an8} Holy shit!

722
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:55.980
{\an8} So we drive this way.
we turn left at the crossroads. then right?

723
00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.260
{\an8} Sorry.

724
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.780
Let's pray!

725
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.380
Did you pray for your breakfast?

726
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:49.020
Both my uncles are mormon.

727
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.900
Their kids are all mormon.

728
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.980
They make you a priest when you're sixteen.

729
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.500
I told them.
and they decided not to make me a priest.

730
00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.740
My folks were mormon.

731
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:05.460
so he went to church and everything
until he got about 16 or 17.

732
00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:09.660
I hated the mormon 'cause I had to go to church.

733
00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:13.580
Every Sunday: get up at 7 o'clock.

734
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.660
brush my teeth. comb my hair.
put on my tie...

735
00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.580
go to church all day. I hated it...

736
00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.140
I blame the mormons for all my drug use.

737
00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.980
The mormon troop had a Boy Scout troop.

738
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:31.820
From 12 to 16. we'd go down the Grand Canyon.

739
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:36.180
we'd do lots of drugs.
extremely lot of drugs...

740
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:42.820
Extreme amounts of drugs:
usually cocaine and alcohol.

741
00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.460
and LSD.

742
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:47.580
Then he decided he didn't wanna go to church anymore.

743
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.580
If he didn't wanna go.
don't push him. I don't care.

744
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.300
It's his life. you know...

745
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:59.140
Believing in religion is stupid.

746
00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.140
I can't believe it. it's stupid.

747
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.180
This is a rock.
if it hits my head. blood comes out.

748
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.180
Well. make blood come out. God.

749
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.500
How you doin'?

750
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.380
My friend had a picture of his wife
and they divorced.

751
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.220
so he had a shotgun next to her head
blowing her head off.

752
01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.420
{\an8} Fuckin' camera.

753
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.620
{\an8} One time. I was going up to Arizona to visit my mom.

754
01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:41.380
{\an8} I stopped at the gas station.
it's got the fake tattoos.

755
01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.060
{\an8} and it's got the one you put around your wrist.

756
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.620
{\an8} So I buy it
and I get to the house about 4 in the morning.

757
01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:54.100
{\an8} I go in the bathroom and I put it in water.
and I put it on my forehead.

758
01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.900
{\an8} It dried.

759
01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:03.260
{\an8} In the morning. she wakes me up at 10.

760
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.100
{\an8} "What the fuck did you do?"

761
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.700
{\an8} I'd forgotten and said "What's up?"

762
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.620
{\an8} "That tattoo on your head!"

763
01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.220
{\an8} "Oh. you like it mom?"

764
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.220
{\an8} "You fuckin' idiot!"

765
01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.020
Now we're talking.
That's a man tattoo.

766
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.540
What Mean Man?

767
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.860
I was a huge W.A.S.P. fan when I was a kid.

768
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.140
I still am. so this is huge.
definitely.

769
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.580
I snivelled and cried and beat him up
and everything else

770
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.980
when he first started getting the tattoos.

771
01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.020
Finally. what can you do?
You're not with him 24 hours.

772
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.500
I said "Just don't get'em above your neck.

773
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.860
so when you come to my funeral.
you can wear a shirt buttoned-up."

774
01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:48.500
My mom had an Hells Angels' jacket made.

775
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.820
I truly believe. if she did not have children.
she would have joined the Hells Angels.

776
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.380
Why do you think?

777
01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.420
'cause I'm crazy I suppose...

778
01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.940
Alright!

779
01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.780
My name is Thomas.

780
01:02:55.780 --> 01:03:00.540
I've been a fan since '88. I think.

781
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.860
and I started collecting in '89.

782
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:08.420
I've got somewhere
between 300/400 different records.

783
01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.540
CDs and a couple gold records...

784
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.940
I spent a lot of money on W.A.S.P.

785
01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.020
I've been a fan now for 25 years.

786
01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.940
but it's the first time I get to see Chris Holmes.

787
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:39.020
Norway!

788
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.500
Enjoy yourself while you can and you're 20!

789
01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.740
Thanks for comin'. alright!

790
01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.100
I just lived in L.A.. surviving...

791
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.180
I tried to find groups to play in
but nobody would play with me.

792
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.140
I started managing him for a brief period of time.

793
01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:00.540
He was down and out. depressed.

794
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.380
living in a house behind a house.

795
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:06.380
He did call me and stuff.
and never really asked for money or anything.

796
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.060
Just say "How you doin'?"

797
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:11.940
He'd come over. have a beer.
we have a good dinner and stuff.

798
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.140
then he'd be on his way.

799
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.700
He wouldn't ask for help.
that's not what he did.

800
01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.340
He would get by with the bare minimum.

801
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.980
He wouldn't be happy.
but he could survive like that.

802
01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:29.460
He worked doing construction.
roofing and concrete work.

803
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.980
I worked shitty jobs in L.A.

804
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.500
I used to work for Hustler.
doing the lights for pornos.

805
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.380
It's a job most guys would die for.
but it's really boring.

806
01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.820
Chris Holmes everybody!

807
01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.940
I put together one of the first
Hollywood celebrity all-star bands

808
01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.580
called the Big Ball Stars.
that's some great players in it.

809
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.540
At the time. Chris was hiding out.

810
01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:07.220
{\an8} So I said "Why don't you come
and play a song with my all-star band?"

811
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.540
"No. no one likes to play with me.
I don't get along with anyone..."

812
01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.820
He'd been pretty banged up
and around the business for a while.

813
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.460
Nobody had seen him play in years:

814
01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.780
he played guitar flawlessly

815
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.780
and he jumped around on that stage
like a fucking maniac.

816
01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:28.780
But didn't miss a beat.
and he just totally dominated the stage.

817
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.340
People were just blown away. it was like:
"Holy shit. Chris Holmes is back!"

818
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:44.980
When he met Sarah.
he was at a pretty low point in his life.

819
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.220
I don't think he knew where to go
or which directions to take.

820
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:53.260
She came in
and really started to manage his life for him.

821
01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.020
which he needed at the time.
He needed that support.

822
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.860
I'm a huge Motörhead fan.

823
01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:02.260
One day. Chris told me about
the recordings that he had with Philthy.

824
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.780
He had mentioned to me:
"I've been working with this guy for a few years.

825
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.660
I think we're ready to mix it.
would you be interested?"

826
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.700
I said: "Hell yeah!"

827
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.820
Chris and Philthy!

828
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:21.260
Out of anybody I've ever met in the music business.
and I've met a lot of people.

829
01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:26.700
he's probably the coolest guy I've ever met
as being a human being towards other people.

830
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:30.340
If it wasn't for him.
I probably wouldn't have even done the first abum.

831
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.860
'cause it was all done on his computers and stuff.

832
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.900
He actually died. it's sad.

833
01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.660
He was ill for a long time.

834
01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.380
His liver shut down.

835
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.940
and the last thing I said was...

836
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:49.460
They came to pick me up in a car.
I put my hand on his head and I just said

837
01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.980
"Phil. it's probably the last time
we'll ever see each other."

838
01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.580
He shook his head and said "Yeah. I know".

839
01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.980
then he died a few days later.

840
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.580
It was very hard to record the first album.
we had no money.

841
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.260
{\an8} Everyone thought we were not able to do it.

842
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:35.300
{\an8} Chris said "We need to go to Europe.
it's the only place where I can still make it."

843
01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.460
I'd had that conversation with Chris.

844
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:42.260
We talked about L.A.. U.S...
It's nothing.

845
01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:45.740
Over there. you're a rockstar.
over here. you're a has-been.

846
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.940
The opportunities aren't here for you.
why don't you go to Europe?

847
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.860
I got rid of everything I had:
my car. my dog...

848
01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.860
It was everything I'd ever known.
I lived there my whole life. you know.

849
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:11.140
{\an8} Tell the camera who won pool!

850
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.180
That was a good mess!

851
01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.500
I love you. man!

852
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.580
- Is your mom still alive?
- Oh yeah!

853
01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.020
I love your mom!

854
01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.540
She's still going.

855
01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.940
Drinking vodka with your mom and filming...

856
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.500
That was thirty years ago.

857
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:33.140
I'm so glad I don't drink anymore!

858
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.900
I quit drinking twenty years ago.

859
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.740
- Welcome to Halifax!
- Is this Halifax?

860
01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.260
Hi. I'm Paul. I'm from Halifax.

861
01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:49.980
I sell fancy dress for Halloween.
carnival. that sort of things.

862
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:54.460
Chris kindly agreed to a personal meet & greet

863
01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:58.460
and jam session with my band.

864
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.340
I grew up listening to W.A.S.P.

865
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.500
from 1985...

866
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.380
Chris inspired me to pick up a guitar
and learn to play.

867
01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.580
Finally. I have the chance
to invite Chris and the band here.

868
01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:17.620
so it's kind of a privilege to be able to do that.

869
01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.900
It's Chris Holmes. it's not W.A.S.P.

870
01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.020
Chris Holmes was part of that band.

871
01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.540
He's singing. he's got his style.

872
01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.540
and he sounds great: he's rock n' roll.

873
01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.860
Chris. give me a hug. man.

874
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.580
We're going to see him again.

875
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.100
He was the same guy. 27 years ago:

876
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.420
polite. a gentleman.
true to his fans.

877
01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.180
and he just enjoys playing the guitar.

878
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.380
Oh. Mean Man!

879
01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.940
- You're gonna play "Fuck Like a Beast" tonight?
- Hell yeah!

880
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.060
Blackie won't play it anymore.

881
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.740
{\an8} My first time listening to W.A.S.P.
was about when the first L.P. came out.

882
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.820
{\an8} In 1984. I saw them at the Lyceum in London.

883
01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.060
{\an8} it was their first gig there.

884
01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.940
{\an8} It's my favorite band of all time.

885
01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.460
All of my life.

886
01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.940
especially when I was young.

887
01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:07.700
I couldn't understand
where they all come from.

888
01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.020
I spend the last few months in here.

889
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:19.460
Going to rehearsal with the drums.
and bass and everything.

890
01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:22.780
putting up with three other guys.
which takes time and money...

891
01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.140
It's easier just doing it all here in pre-production.

892
01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:30.580
And I can figure out
if I can sing on a song or not.

893
01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:35.020
Ug sits over here.
He's my little dog. Ug.

894
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.740
His name's Ug 'cause he's ugly.

895
01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:48.260
I'm lucky I can play guitar.

896
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.140
I can program the drums.

897
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.220
and I can sing and do it all myself.

898
01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.460
I don't need anybody sit here and help me do it.

899
01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.020
I'm very lucky I've learned all those things.

900
01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:02.860
It's funny!

901
01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:04.980
Chris can live in any place:

902
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.460
live in France. live in America.
but he needs to come visit at least.

903
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.580
If he wants to live in France. great.
but come visit America.

904
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.060
'cause I know he misses it.

905
01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:16.020
- Do we think he's gonna come back?
- We hope he comes back someday.

906
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:19.060
Hopefully. he'll come through with his band.

907
01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:24.060
My big dream is that he's gonna call me and say
"Jim. I'm going to be playing in L.A..

908
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.980
I need you for this day and this day".
and I'm gonna say "I'm there".

909
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.180
He told me he'd never come back.
I think he's homesick.

910
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.380
I'm pretty sure he's homesick.
He wants In-N-Out Burger or something...

911
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.820
He's a wild man.

912
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.660
but inside that guy.
you've got a heart of gold.

913
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:41.980
someone that couldn't be more genuine.

914
01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:45.620
He's a sweet person. got a heart of gold.
but he's got the anger and the rebellion.

915
01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.100
and he's got the balls. like I do.
to say what he thinks and play what he feels.

916
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.860
That's why I love it. man.
'cause he'll tell right to your face: "fuck you!"

917
01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.060
He'll tell you right to your face:
fuck you!

918
01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:19.380
We're in Cannes.
we're in the recording studio.

919
01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:22.100
recording the songs for my E.P.

920
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.940
That means we've got eight tracks of guitar. right?

921
01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.060
That's alright.

922
01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.780
Barely enough...

923
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.300
I'd put fuckin' 52 if I could.

924
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.420
As you see. we're doing it in a proper studio.

925
01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:47.180
other than the way I've recorded
the last previous projects.

926
01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.260
Yeah. it should sound good.

927
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.860
Thank you for comin' here!

928
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.860
Everyone. get up for Mr. Chris Holmes!!

929
01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.660
I've been doin' it a long time.

930
01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.060
Fuck. I'm 61 next month!

931
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.460
Once the energy is gone.
I wouldn't play. I'd quit.

932
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:47.380
That's what I play:
it's energy that comes out of the way I play guitar.

933
01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:51.060
If that wasn't there.
I'd totally quit playing and do something else.

934
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.700
I'd give it up. but it's still there when I play.

935
01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.580
I had a problem with my hand last year.

936
01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.860
Something has happened to my elbow.

937
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.580
and my hand's still numb.

938
01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:06.020
I just learned to play with my fingers a different way.
it's ok.

939
01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.700
That's just the way it is.

940
01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.500
My sister. she goes:

941
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.860
"I didn't expect him to live past 30."

942
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:17.060
Well now I'm 60.
and I'm still going.

943
01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.260
I'll do my band. my thing.
start this and...

944
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.340
if it fails. it fails.
and if it doesn't. it doesn't...

945
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.180
I'll make sure it's gonna kick ass on stage.

946
01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.300
That's my main thing.
that's what I do.

947
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.260
Thank you very much. I love you!

948
01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.740
I would say good night. but it's not night:

949
01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.540
good day!

950
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.175
That's my last word.
