00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:46.639
<i>Since the age of five.</i>

3
00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:51.310
<i>Ben Gibbon had been in 723 scrapes.
scuffles and brawls.</i>

4
00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:54.855
<i>An approximate 32.86 per year.</i>

5
00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.151
<i>And he lost every single one.</i>

6
00:01:00.152 --> 00:01:01.487
<i>With a record like that.</i>

7
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.741
<i>his therapist determined
that he was actually trying to lose.</i>

8
00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.037
<i>and in truth. for Ben.
winning was never the point.</i>

9
00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:14.041
<i>It was more like a nagging sensation</i>

10
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.836
<i>that he was floating
around inside his own brain.</i>

11
00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:20.756
<i>watching his life like it was a movie
where nothing happened.</i>

12
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.593
<i>He could see it. but he couldn't feel it.</i>

13
00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:29.390
<i>So he was left with a violent need
to feel something.</i>

14
00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:30.891
- Hey!
- <i>Anything.</i>

15
00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:32.727
<i>Detached from reality</i>

16
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.895
<i>and a captive audience
of his own movie.</i>

17
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.481
<i>Ben searched out
increasingly disruptive ways</i>

18
00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.775
<i>of at least making it a crowd-pleaser.</i>

19
00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.238
<i>It was an aimless search.
rife with conflict and self-abasement.</i>

20
00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:47.408
<i>Until. without ever really knowing
what he was looking for.</i>

21
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.785
<i>he found love.</i>

22
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.579
Holy shit.

23
00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:55.958
<i>All at once. Ben's world came alive</i>

24
00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.338
<i>and he felt his life with an immediacy
he never thought possible.</i>

25
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:08.012
<i>But then. just as suddenly
as it had appeared.</i>

26
00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:09.889
<i>it was gone.</i>

27
00:02:27.698 --> 00:02:30.034
<i>And just like that.</i>

28
00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:33.120
<i>Ben found himself
right back where he started.</i>

29
00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:49.887
Stay down. bitch.

30
00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.647
One moment.

31
00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.197
Mm.

32
00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.284
Oh. fuck. fellas.

33
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:19.291
Still beating.

34
00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.376
Son of a...

35
00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:56.120
Why are we going to this. again?

36
00:03:57.121 --> 00:03:58.372
It's gonna be fun.

37
00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.375
It will not be fun.

38
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.130
You sure it's not
because you heard she's back?

39
00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:07.590
I doubt she'll be there.

40
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.012
It's her house.

41
00:04:26.108 --> 00:04:28.486
We're not even invited
to this thing. are we?

42
00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.528
Nope.

43
00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.239
<i>Mukul's concern was justified.</i>

44
00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:35.826
<i>as Ben had a reputation
for terrorizing high society events.</i>

45
00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:41.499
<i>In fact. after a recent string
of flagrant infractions.</i>

46
00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.710
<i>a newly minted restraining order
made the point loud and clear.</i>

47
00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:49.673
<i>Ben Gibbon was very much not welcome.</i>

48
00:05:05.856 --> 00:05:07.691
- Uh. Mom's coming.
- Benjamin.

49
00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:10.027
- Oh. my God. What are you doing here?
- Hey. Mom.

50
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.404
Free booze. Thank you. perfect timing.

51
00:05:12.488 --> 00:05:14.406
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

52
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.784
You do realize that you
were banned from these events.

53
00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.494
Ma. it's water under the bridge.

54
00:05:18.577 --> 00:05:20.120
You punched the president
of the Exeter Club.

55
00:05:20.204 --> 00:05:22.915
- urinated on the carpet.
- Yeah. yeah. We get it. we get it.

56
00:05:22.998 --> 00:05:25.417
Why can't you keep him
under control. Mukul?

57
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:27.795
Your son's an anarchist. Mrs. Gibbon.

58
00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:30.130
- He's a Democrat.
- What's that?

59
00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:32.466
Uh. Mom. they're bruises.
they don't come off.

60
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.884
Have you two been smoking dope?

61
00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:34.885
- Yeah.
- No.

62
00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.303
- Son.
- There's your father.

63
00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:38.055
- Batman.
- That's the man.

64
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.725
What? It's really good.

65
00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.688
Mm-hmm. If William
and Beatrice see him here.

66
00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:48.023
it's gonna make an already
uncomfortable situation...

67
00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:50.150
My eyes must be deceiving me.

68
00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.281
Not much for appearances. are we?

69
00:05:55.364 --> 00:05:57.491
Just a little scuffle.
you know how boys are.

70
00:05:57.575 --> 00:05:59.410
That's not the point.

71
00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.704
Your son is trespassing.

72
00:06:01.787 --> 00:06:06.083
I'll keep a close eye on him and he's
going to behave himself. Right. Benjamin?

73
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.127
Hmm?

74
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.507
Thank you.

75
00:06:13.632 --> 00:06:15.467
Do I need
to call the authorities?

76
00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.934
Can you try to not look so miserable?

77
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.398
The city's most eligible bachelors
are here tonight

78
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:31.483
and you're sitting in the corner.

79
00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:33.819
Humor me. Make an effort.

80
00:06:33.902 --> 00:06:37.573
I don't want everyone talking about how
my daughter looked miserable all night.

81
00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:45.122
<i>Mary Rathcart first upset
her parents' lofty expectations</i>

82
00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:47.625
<i>when. at the age of 12.</i>

83
00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:51.378
<i>she was expelled from the city's
most prestigious private school.</i>

84
00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:54.256
<i>By the time she was 16.</i>

85
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:58.010
<i>she had been kicked out
of every private school in town.</i>

86
00:06:58.093 --> 00:07:00.971
<i>But she finally went too far</i>

87
00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:03.307
<i>when she fell for Benjamin Gibbon.</i>

88
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.102
<i>the notorious son
of her father's bitter rival.</i>

89
00:07:07.186 --> 00:07:10.189
<i>When the news broke.
it was an instant scandal</i>

90
00:07:10.272 --> 00:07:14.860
<i>and she was strictly forbidden
from seeing the Gibbon boy ever again.</i>

91
00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:18.989
<i>which. as far as Mary was concerned.
simply wasn't an option.</i>

92
00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:23.410
<i>So she made a secret plan
to abscond with Ben to Mexico.</i>

93
00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:26.288
<i>But their plan was soon thwarted</i>

94
00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:30.125
<i>and Mary was abruptly shipped off
to boarding school in Paris.</i>

95
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.381
<i>where her talents would be cultivated
in a more regimented environment.</i>

96
00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:37.758
<i>Mary wrote Ben many times.</i>

97
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:40.427
<i>first to say...</i>

98
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:43.013
- <i>I miss you.</i>
- <i>Then to ask...</i>

99
00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:45.766
<i>Did you forget me?</i>

100
00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:47.559
- <i>Then simply...</i>
- Fuck you!

101
00:07:47.643 --> 00:07:50.270
<i>But for reasons
Mary couldn't fathom.</i>

102
00:07:50.354 --> 00:07:52.439
<i>Ben never wrote back.</i>

103
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:55.025
<i>And so she never wrote again.</i>

104
00:07:55.109 --> 00:08:00.030
<i>She did her best to forget about Ben
and forget the world she left behind.</i>

105
00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:04.201
<i>She remained in Paris
to study at the Sorbonne</i>

106
00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:07.204
<i>and committed herself
to a brand new life.</i>

107
00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:10.708
<i>but her heart remained fraught.</i>

108
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:16.004
<i>plagued by a chronic loneliness
she simply couldn't shake.</i>

109
00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:18.173
<i>And yet her overbearing father</i>

110
00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:21.051
<i>made sure she was
always closely watched.</i>

111
00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.096
<i>so she was never
quite as alone as she felt.</i>

112
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:30.060
<i>In the end. time doused
what fire was left in her</i>

113
00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:33.897
<i>and like a domesticated bird
seeking the comfort of the cage.</i>

114
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:38.068
<i>she returned home. weary and humbled.</i>

115
00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:41.321
<i>right back where she started.</i>

116
00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.699
I said. "See him out."

117
00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:46.034
Benjamin was already leaving. William.

118
00:08:47.077 --> 00:08:49.955
What? Do you have something to say?

119
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.292
Just wanted to show face.

120
00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:57.463
Why don't you throw a steak on that eye?
You look like a goddamn criminal.

121
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.425
<i>For generations. the Gibbon
and Rathcart families</i>

122
00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:04.178
<i>had stood in staunch
opposition of one another.</i>

123
00:09:04.303 --> 00:09:07.514
<i>One might even go as far
as to call it a "blood feud."</i>

124
00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:11.059
<i>and like all blood feuds.</i>

125
00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:13.020
<i>it began with a bit of blood.</i>

126
00:09:13.103 --> 00:09:15.606
<i>The year was 1864.</i>

127
00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:17.733
<i>Tarleton Rathcart
and Theodore Gibbon.</i>

128
00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:21.862
<i>both powerful figures in New York City's
burgeoning news industry.</i>

129
00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:25.073
<i>met as gentlemen duelers
after an unflattering story</i>

130
00:09:25.157 --> 00:09:29.369
<i>was run in Theodore's paper
in regards to Tarleton's shoes.</i>

131
00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:31.455
<i>Theodore fell to Tarleton's bullet.</i>

132
00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:33.540
<i>uttering the dying words...</i>

133
00:09:33.665 --> 00:09:38.712
Tell that cheating bastard Rathcart
I'll see him in hell.

134
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.341
<i>Over the years.
both families' publications</i>

135
00:09:42.424 --> 00:09:45.552
<i>grew steadily into opposing media
conglomerates</i>

136
00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:49.139
<i>known today as
Gibbon Telecommunications</i>

137
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:51.058
<i>and the Rathcart Corporation.</i>

138
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:53.811
<i>and the dueling continued.</i>

139
00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:57.564
<i>One could easily call it the most
combative media rivalry in history.</i>

140
00:09:57.648 --> 00:10:00.359
<i>but for Henry Gibbon
and William Rathcart.</i>

141
00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:04.571
<i>it was never about business...

142
00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:12.412
Excuse us. Come. son.

143
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.170
You're a grown man.

144
00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:21.839
It's time you act like it.

145
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:25.092
Get out.

146
00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:31.181
What was that all about?

147
00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:33.433
William was a little harsh. wasn't he?

148
00:10:33.517 --> 00:10:35.102
Mary's back.

149
00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:47.781
Bro. the coats.

150
00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:54.204
Hmm.

151
00:10:55.205 --> 00:10:57.916
Okay.

152
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.460
Security!

153
00:11:00.544 --> 00:11:02.212
- Oh. my God!
- Hey. you got it?

154
00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.797
Go. go. go. go. go!

155
00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:06.592
He stole the coats again.

156
00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:09.303
Walter.
that's my coat! Stop him!

157
00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:11.889
Gibbon!

158
00:11:18.437 --> 00:11:22.316
<i>Mary's exile to Paris
was conducted swiftly and without warning.</i>

159
00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:27.738
<i>He called and texted.

160
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:30.741
<i>He emailed.
but received no response.</i>

161

<i>Mary's whereabouts and her silence
remained a haunting mystery</i>

162

<i>until Ben happened across a gossip story
detailing her exploits in Paris.</i>

163
00:11:43.253 --> 00:11:48.258
<i>Heartbroken. Ben used the one-way ticket
he had hoped to use with Mary</i>

164
00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:51.637
<i>and disappeared
to Mexico unannounced.</i>

165

<i>with no intention of returning.</i>

<i>His only attempt to communicate

<i>He returned seven months later

172
00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:27.024
You know. I just can't stomach this.

173
00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:30.861
After all these years. you'd think even
that kid would find a way to grow up.

174
00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:32.779
Henry's gonna have
to write a check this time.

175
00:13:32.863 --> 00:13:34.781
It's best to not get embroiled. darling.

176
00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:36.450
He does this kind of thing often?

177
00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:39.202
Whenever he decides to show his face.

178
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:41.496
Oh. I know that look. Mary.

179
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.875
- Shall I pull out the scrapbook?
- No. please. don't.

180
00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.962
You know. most parents keep
a record of their kids' achievements.

181
00:13:49.046 --> 00:13:50.672
not their failures. It's weird.

182
00:13:50.756 --> 00:13:53.884
My mother always said. "There's no greater
teacher than shame."

183
00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:57.137
Don't be dramatic. It's funny.

184
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.722
I wouldn't wish him on my worst enemy.

185
00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:02.726
Third grade report card.
Flabbergasting precociousness.

186
00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.686
The boy is
properly sick in the head.

187
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.313
Turned down the family fortune.

188
00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:08.315
- He did?
- Oh. I love this one.

189
00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:09.900
You remember Felix Graham?

190
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.027
He had a few sessions
with him some years back.

191
00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:13.862
Pathological contrariness.

192
00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:15.447
Said he had a screw loose.

193
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.449
- Oh. this is classic.
- Point taken.

194
00:14:17.532 --> 00:14:20.827
He said he had some kind
of death wish taking all those beatings.

195
00:14:20.911 --> 00:14:23.622
Imagine a kid
getting a diagnosis like that.

196
00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:25.373
- A death wish?
- Enough!

197
00:14:25.457 --> 00:14:27.250
Ben Gibbon is in the past.

198
00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:29.377
just like all of these
other regrettable decisions.

199
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:32.756
And you being home doesn't change
anything. Am I understood?

200
00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:34.674
<i>Mary knew that a prerequisite</i>

201
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.094
<i>for being back home
under her parents' roof</i>

202
00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:40.180
<i>was maintaining
a quietly obedient exterior.</i>

203
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.851
Fuck!

204
00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:49.481
Mary.

205
00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:52.234
Something to say?

206
00:14:54.569 --> 00:14:55.570
No.

207
00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:13.463
<i>The young male gibbon</i>

208
00:15:13.547 --> 00:15:16.633
<i>will now challenge the dominant male
for control of the family.</i>

209
00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:19.886
<i>If the adolescent continues his challenge.</i>

210
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.722
<i>the dominant male will respond
with a violent attack...</i>

211
00:15:25.142 --> 00:15:28.145
<i>forcing the young gibbon to strike off
on its own in search of a mate.</i>

212
00:15:46.454 --> 00:15:47.289
Hmm.

213
00:16:13.023 --> 00:16:14.941
- Hey. strangers!
- Cheers.

214
00:16:16.568 --> 00:16:18.153
- Oh. my God!
- Lily.

215
00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:19.905
- Finally.
- You're back. wow!

216
00:16:19.988 --> 00:16:22.324
- Oh my God. shots!
- She's here.

217
00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.992
- Cheers.
- Oh.

218
00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.203
- We'll keep 'em going.
- What's going on?

219
00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:27.787
I have to dance.

220
00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:31.374
What are we forgetting?

221
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:34.836
Oh. God. Everything.

222
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:04.866
Oh!

223
00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:09.412
- Terrence.
- Peekaboo.

224
00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.499
What are you doing here?

225
00:17:13.792 --> 00:17:15.669
I missed you.

226
00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:18.755
- How did you know I was here?
- Come with me.

227
00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:22.175
I got us a private room. so we can talk
away from these animals.

228
00:17:22.259 --> 00:17:23.843
Terrence.

229
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.149
You followed me here. didn't you?

230
00:17:38.233 --> 00:17:39.943
It would appear that way.

231
00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:43.697
Well. that's not your job anymore.
SO you need to stop doing it.

232
00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:54.833
Mary.

233
00:17:58.753 --> 00:18:01.840
I recall the good times
we shared together.

234
00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:04.134
The romantic nights.

235
00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:10.890
Look at this little lost soul. doll.

236
00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:18.982
I think he's cute.

237
00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:20.317
Oh.

238
00:18:21.318 --> 00:18:23.069
My wife thinks you're cute.

239
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.363
Like a rabbit.

240
00:18:31.536 --> 00:18:34.831
Why don't you go over there and play
with the new pet rabbit. huh?

241
00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:36.416
Go on. have fun.

242
00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:50.805
Hey. Rabbit. you know what I've always
thought would be a cool way to die?

243
00:18:51.806 --> 00:18:53.475
Shark attack.

244
00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:55.143
A big fish

245
00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:59.522
with big. bloody
razor-sharp teeth eating you.

246
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:03.610
There he is.

247
00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:06.613
Oh. here he comes.

248
00:19:12.494 --> 00:19:16.623
Yeah. see. the point is. mate.
we're all running round. right?

249
00:19:16.706 --> 00:19:18.917
Like we're too special to get eaten
by a bloody shark.

250
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.460
But we're not. right?

251
00:19:20.543 --> 00:19:23.338
We're just monkeys. Monkeys in suits.

252
00:19:23.421 --> 00:19:25.382
We are just little bloody mascots

253
00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:28.593
for the great.
big organ grinder in the sky.

254
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.644
So. Rabbit. how do you wanna die?

255
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.113
I wanna die in a gunfight.

256
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.451
Die in a gunfight? You hear that. doll?

257
00:19:53.535 --> 00:19:56.996
Here we was. just thinking
you were a scared little baby rabbit.

258
00:19:58.748 --> 00:19:59.791
Jesus. mate.

259
00:20:00.792 --> 00:20:02.877
Look what you've gone and done.

260
00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:04.504
It's true what they say. I guess.

261
00:20:04.629 --> 00:20:06.506
Every bird likes a bad boy.

262
00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:09.008
How old are you.
you rascally little wabbit?

263
00:20:09.134 --> 00:20:10.093
I'm 27.

264
00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:12.220
Bullshit. mate. I don't believe you.

265
00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:15.932
- I wanna see some identification. please.
- Guys.

266
00:20:16.015 --> 00:20:18.268
Where are you bloody going. mate?
Sit. sit. sit. sit.

267
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:22.063
Come on. hand it over.
Come on. You're not under arrest yet.

268
00:20:25.233 --> 00:20:26.985
Checks out. Have a look at that. doll.

269
00:20:27.068 --> 00:20:29.070
It's a lot of fun.
but I have to get going.

270
00:20:29.154 --> 00:20:31.322
- Oh. no.
- Rabbit!

271
00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:34.409
We're just getting started here. mate.

272
00:20:34.492 --> 00:20:38.288
After everything
that we've been through together.

273
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.707
I wouldn't have thought
that you'd be ashamed of me.

274
00:20:40.832 --> 00:20:42.542
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

275
00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:45.336
Good.

276
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.048
Because I think the feelings...

277
00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:53.511
our feelings. are still there.

278
00:20:53.595 --> 00:20:55.221
There were never any feelings.

279
00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:57.223
Mm.

280
00:20:58.224 --> 00:20:59.559
Terrence.

281
00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:01.853
I...

282
00:21:05.315 --> 00:21:06.691
That was then.

283
00:21:06.774 --> 00:21:08.401
This is fucking now.

284
00:21:08.485 --> 00:21:10.904
- What are you doing?
- Mary. I love you.

285
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:13.656
- Terrence. please. I don't love you.
- Mary...

286
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.992
Okay. just... Terrence.

287
00:21:16.993 --> 00:21:19.996
- What is that?
- Our logical conclusion.

288
00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:22.957
Are you insane?

289
00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.918
Terrence. just go.

290
00:21:31.007 --> 00:21:32.217
Terrence. just go.

291
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.761
Mary. come on.

292
00:21:36.346 --> 00:21:38.473
Terrence. please. just go away.

293
00:21:39.724 --> 00:21:41.935
Hey. Barb. you wanna dance with Rabbit?

294
00:21:42.018 --> 00:21:44.187
She's a really good dancer.

295
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.606
No. Like I said.
I have to get going.

296
00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:50.443
I said dance.

297
00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:52.946
What's up. doc?

298
00:21:54.364 --> 00:21:56.241
Whoo!

299
00:21:56.324 --> 00:21:58.284
She is my shining angel.

300
00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:01.871
And if my shining angel wants to dance.

301
00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:04.207
then she's gonna
bloody well dance. mate.

302
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.458
Isn't that right. hon?

303
00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:07.961
Sure is. sugar pie.

304
00:22:08.044 --> 00:22:09.712
Look at this. mate.

305
00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:14.801
Two halves make a whole.

306
00:22:15.802 --> 00:22:17.220
- I love you. baby.
- I love you.

307
00:22:21.057 --> 00:22:24.477
You wouldn't wanna hurt my angel's
feelings now. would you. Wabbit?

308
00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:26.688
No. but like I said. I have to get going.

309
00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:30.483
Here I am.
thinking that you're a big grown rabbit.

310
00:22:31.484 --> 00:22:32.569
Maybe I'm wrong.

311
00:22:33.653 --> 00:22:35.572
Maybe you're just a pussy.

312
00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:38.116
Oh. come on now. grizzly. be nice.

313
00:22:38.199 --> 00:22:41.160
Oh. well. I didn't wear these dancing
shoes for nothing. hon.

314
00:22:44.664 --> 00:22:47.333
So what's it gonna be mate. hmm?

315
00:22:47.417 --> 00:22:49.502
You a rabbit?

316
00:22:50.503 --> 00:22:52.463
Or a pussy?

317
00:22:53.464 --> 00:22:55.341
All right. enough.

318
00:22:55.425 --> 00:22:56.342
Oh.

319
00:22:56.426 --> 00:22:59.470
You're either gonna let me out.
or I'm gonna make you let me.

320
00:22:59.554 --> 00:23:02.181
Look at this. doll. huh?

321
00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:06.352
Looks like me and Rabbit
are gonna dance.

322
00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:08.229
What. we gonna do the waltz?

323
00:23:08.313 --> 00:23:10.898
We're gonna have a little bloody melee.

324
00:23:13.443 --> 00:23:14.902
Give it everything you got. mate.

325
00:24:45.368 --> 00:24:46.202
Hi.

326
00:24:50.164 --> 00:24:50.998
Hi.

327
00:24:55.378 --> 00:24:56.879
So this is your place?

328
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.841
I own it. yeah.

329
00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:04.303
You bought this apartment?

330
00:25:04.387 --> 00:25:05.888
Yeah. I did.

331
00:25:07.473 --> 00:25:09.267
And the entire building around it.

332
00:25:10.935 --> 00:25:12.520
How?

333
00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:15.481
Word on the street
is you're poor on purpose.

334
00:25:15.565 --> 00:25:17.233
It's kind of a long story.

335
00:25:18.234 --> 00:25:19.819
Okay.

336
00:25:32.749 --> 00:25:34.375
Care to elaborate?

337
00:25:35.877 --> 00:25:37.837
Mukul and I took an oath of secrecy.

338
00:25:44.427 --> 00:25:45.845
Why didn't you write?

339
00:25:51.058 --> 00:25:52.518
Why did you leave?

340
00:25:54.896 --> 00:25:56.939
You should wash this blood off.

341
00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:08.034
<i>Pamela Corbett-Ragsdale.</i>

342
00:26:08.117 --> 00:26:11.287
<i>a former research and development

<i>to sign a non-disclosure agreement</i>

349

350

<i>Up next. murder mystery.
That story. coming up next.</i>

352
00:26:39.273 --> 00:26:42.026
<i>When a desperate
William Rathcart came to Terrence Uberahl</i>

353
00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:46.072
<i>asking him to handle his potentially
devastating whistleblower problem.</i>

354
00:26:46.155 --> 00:26:49.659
<i>Terrence was elated.
certain that a job well done</i>

355
00:26:49.742 --> 00:26:53.246
<i>was his ticket to securing
Mary's hand in marriage.</i>

356
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:57.208
<i>So he made arrangements with the best
contract killer in the business.</i>

357
00:26:57.291 --> 00:26:59.085
What's the status
on Corbett-Ragsdale?

358
00:26:59.168 --> 00:27:01.254
She checked into the Plaza
this morning. sir.

359
00:27:01.337 --> 00:27:03.339
- And?
- And you have nothing to worry about.

360
00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:07.927
I'm loyal to you. William.
and to the corporation.

361
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.306
I feel very much like part of the family.

362
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.852
Well. your father and I
were like brothers. You're like a son.

363
00:27:15.935 --> 00:27:18.271
My sentiments exactly.

364
00:27:18.396 --> 00:27:22.567
What if I could be...
more than like a son?

365
00:27:24.735 --> 00:27:26.821
Mary and I became very close

366
00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:30.283
while I was keeping an eye on her
for you in Paris.

367
00:27:30.366 --> 00:27:34.537
I recall you blew your cover.
put yourself at her mercy.

368
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:38.291
I took my job of protecting her
very seriously

369
00:27:38.374 --> 00:27:39.959
and I'd like to continue protecting her.

370
00:27:40.042 --> 00:27:42.753
Yeah? In what capacity?

371
00:27:42.837 --> 00:27:44.380
As her husband.

372
00:27:49.093 --> 00:27:51.304
I proposed last night. sir.

373
00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:55.474
If you approve. of course.

374
00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:00.897
I'll make you a deal.

375
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.650
You take care of my problem.
I'll grant you my daughter's hand.

376
00:28:06.485 --> 00:28:08.154
Just one thing.

377
00:28:08.237 --> 00:28:10.364
Not with Ragsdale. sir. with Mary.

378
00:28:11.449 --> 00:28:13.492
I put a few of my men on her
just to be safe

379
00:28:13.576 --> 00:28:15.828
and they informed me that
she spent the night last night

380
00:28:15.912 --> 00:28:18.748
with... Benjamin Gibbon.

381
00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.959
- I thought you said you proposed to her.
- I did.

382
00:28:22.043 --> 00:28:24.837
She just hasn't said "yes" yet.
hence the problem.

383
00:28:24.962 --> 00:28:26.505
How would you like me to proceed?

384
00:28:26.631 --> 00:28:30.343
How about you stop being a pussy
and just put the fear of God in him?

385
00:28:31.344 --> 00:28:32.470
Yes. sir.

386
00:28:43.856 --> 00:28:46.692
<i>Mary said goodbye. Seems nice.</i>

387
00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:57.328
Don't look at me like that.

388
00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:04.377
Time to go.

389
00:29:05.878 --> 00:29:09.382
You don't want to be late
for your mom's brunch. hmm?

390
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:22.603
Ahem.

391
00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:54.385
Mary Rathcart?

392
00:29:56.929 --> 00:29:58.931
Ben Gibbon.

393
00:30:01.684 --> 00:30:05.062
Do I need to explain to you
why this is unacceptable?

394
00:30:06.564 --> 00:30:07.940
Who told you that?

395
00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:11.610
We've always had
such high hopes for you.

396
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:15.614
But you continually disappoint us.

397
00:30:15.698 --> 00:30:18.576
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to continue...
- To what. Mary?

398
00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:21.954
Help the boy's father drag my fucking name
through the mud?

399
00:30:24.957 --> 00:30:26.792
I'm not sure he needs my help.

400
00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:29.211
My God. you need a leash.

401
00:30:29.295 --> 00:30:30.755
- William.
- Ah!

402
00:30:30.838 --> 00:30:32.590
The Rathcarts have been running
their empire

403
00:30:32.673 --> 00:30:36.552
like a criminal organization
for generations.

404
00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:40.389
but this Rathcart scandal
is a unique opportunity.

405
00:30:40.473 --> 00:30:43.893
It's my chance to end it.

406
00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:48.147
But how can do I that

407
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.650
when my son is photographed
cavorting with the man's daughter?

408
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:54.570
That drags us into it.

409
00:30:54.653 --> 00:30:57.615
It clouds the issue.
just when I need things to be...

410
00:31:05.414 --> 00:31:07.792
Sorry. Dad. I'm listening.

411
00:31:08.834 --> 00:31:11.420
...crystal clear.

412
00:31:11.504 --> 00:31:15.424
Thank God Terrence is so willing
to take you off our hands.

413
00:31:15.508 --> 00:31:17.093
- He is?
- Of course he is.

414
00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:19.011
He's a rabid dog Dad won't call off.

415
00:31:19.136 --> 00:31:23.349
But I thought the two of you
were... friends in Paris.

416
00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:27.520
As much as you can be friends
with a fucking stalker.

417
00:31:29.647 --> 00:31:32.733
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer. right. Dad?

418
00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:44.161
I love the choice of music. Mrs. Gibbon.

419
00:31:45.162 --> 00:31:46.789
Thank you. Mukul.

420
00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:49.625
Do you guys know
what Beethoven's last words were?

421
00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:52.962
<i>"Plaudite. amici. comedia finita est."</i>

422
00:31:53.045 --> 00:31:54.255
"Friends. applaud.

423
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.632
The comedy is finished."

424
00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:59.260
Goddamn it! I've had enough!

425
00:32:00.386 --> 00:32:02.471
All you had to do was play ball

426
00:32:02.555 --> 00:32:04.515
and all of this would have been yours.

427
00:32:04.598 --> 00:32:07.601
I appreciate the offer. Dad.
but I'd rather play with my own balls.

428
00:32:08.936 --> 00:32:13.440
And what will you do when whatever it is
you're living on runs out. hmm?

429
00:32:13.524 --> 00:32:15.484
Please. enlighten us.

430
00:32:15.568 --> 00:32:19.405
You know. I've been really putting
a lot of thought into it.

431
00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:21.407
Glad you ask.

432
00:32:29.415 --> 00:32:30.416
Fishing.

433
00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:33.252
I think I'll be a fisherman.

434
00:32:33.335 --> 00:32:36.297
And Mukul here will
be my first mate. right?

435
00:32:37.882 --> 00:32:40.050
He takes after you. You know that?

436
00:32:41.177 --> 00:32:45.222
This family needs to present
a unified front and we need a distraction.

437
00:32:46.307 --> 00:32:48.017
So I should marry a man I don't love?

438
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.268
Oh. Jesus Christ.

439
00:32:49.351 --> 00:32:53.856
Your entire life. you have lived
off the spoils of your bloodline.

440
00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:56.108
Yes. now comes the reckoning!

441
00:32:56.192 --> 00:32:59.778
So for once you will do as I say!

442
00:33:02.364 --> 00:33:05.367
I worked my entire life
to build my reputation

443
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:11.624
and I am entirely unwilling to let you
and your Rasputin ruin it.

444
00:33:11.707 --> 00:33:13.918
No. no. no. no. no. Mukul is my
very good friend and our guest.

445
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:15.085
Leave him out of this.

446
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:18.088
Don't you think we're taking this
a bit far. boys?

447
00:33:18.172 --> 00:33:22.551
You fight. you steal.
you drink. you're a disgrace.

448
00:33:27.306 --> 00:33:28.432
Do you hear me?

449
00:33:29.725 --> 00:33:31.310
Henry.

450
00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:33.312
Do you hear me?

451
00:33:34.647 --> 00:33:35.940
I hear you.

452
00:33:36.023 --> 00:33:38.609
Your name may be Gibbon...

453
00:33:38.692 --> 00:33:42.238
- And?
- And it's bullshit.

454
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:44.698
...but you're not fit for this family.

455
00:33:44.782 --> 00:33:46.116
And I'm not putting up with it.

456
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.955
- Hey!
- You wanna act like a goddamn animal?

457
00:33:51.038 --> 00:33:52.248
There is your cage!

458
00:34:02.758 --> 00:34:04.260
Okay.

459
00:34:19.608 --> 00:34:20.609
Benjamin.

460
00:34:29.201 --> 00:34:30.577
You're excused.

461
00:34:33.998 --> 00:34:35.791
Sorry. Mom.

462
00:34:38.377 --> 00:34:41.839
I am. I'm sorry.

463
00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:44.717
Go.

464
00:34:46.468 --> 00:34:47.761
Just go. Ben.

465
00:34:59.398 --> 00:35:01.734
I apologize if I played any part

466
00:35:01.817 --> 00:35:06.238
in ruining your lovely Mother's Day
celebration. Mrs. Gibbon.

467
00:35:14.747 --> 00:35:15.581
Hmm.

468
00:35:18.417 --> 00:35:19.335
Mm-hmm.

469
00:35:22.963 --> 00:35:26.717
<i>Later that night.
alone in their respective rooms.</i>

470
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.055
<i>Mary and Ben found themselves doing
what many of us tend to do</i>

471
00:35:31.138 --> 00:35:32.473
<i>when we're feeling forlorn.</i>

472
00:35:33.474 --> 00:35:36.310
<i>They were contemplating
the events of the past...</i>

473
00:35:36.393 --> 00:35:40.689
<i>the precious highs.
the devastating lows.</i>

474
00:35:40.773 --> 00:35:45.194
<i>and the choices they had made
or failed to make in between.</i>

475
00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:48.947
<i>all of which. when added up.
had led them right here...</i>

476
00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:52.826
<i>to this very moment.</i>

477
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:57.206
<i>They felt haunted by a suspicion</i>

478
00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:01.919
<i>that history was somehow repeating itself.</i>

479
00:36:10.928 --> 00:36:13.555
<i>And so each in their own way.</i>

480
00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:16.475
<i>they resolved to throw caution to the wind</i>

481
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.479
<i>and do something quite different
this time around.</i>

482
00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:36.912
Shh. shh! Hey. hey. hey.

483
00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:40.165
- Shh. shh!
- What are you doing here?

484
00:36:45.587 --> 00:36:47.840
Why are you always leaving. huh?

485
00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:50.634
What?

486
00:36:53.137 --> 00:36:55.848
I don't know.
I... I can't be here anymore.

487
00:36:59.852 --> 00:37:03.730
Mary. we're at the age where it's
pretty much time to conform or die.

488
00:37:03.814 --> 00:37:06.066
We grew up thinking
we're gonna be something special

489
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.610
and do something heroic
with our lives. you know.

490
00:37:08.694 --> 00:37:12.114
and they let us live in that fantasy
for 20-something years.

491
00:37:12.197 --> 00:37:13.991
And then what?

492
00:37:14.074 --> 00:37:17.453
We're just supposed to surrender
and grow up. live with the heartbreak

493
00:37:17.536 --> 00:37:20.664
that our lives were never meant to be
as great as we thought they'd be.

494
00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:26.170
Honestly. I'd rather die.

495
00:37:31.133 --> 00:37:32.551
What if there's another way?

496
00:37:35.596 --> 00:37:38.599
What if greatness for me...

497
00:37:42.686 --> 00:37:43.896
is loving you?

498
00:37:45.898 --> 00:37:48.692
Loving you perfectly. and fuck the rest.

499
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.032
I can live with that. you know.

500
00:37:56.992 --> 00:37:59.495
I'm pretty sure
that kind of love never dies.

501
00:38:13.842 --> 00:38:15.511
Mary.

502
00:38:17.846 --> 00:38:18.847
Fuck it.

503
00:38:19.848 --> 00:38:20.849
Fuck it.

504
00:38:25.562 --> 00:38:27.022
You wanna get out of here?

505
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:28.524
Mary!

506
00:38:29.608 --> 00:38:31.109
We need to talk.

507
00:38:49.878 --> 00:38:54.258
I have an idea. in the interest of this
not being weird.

508
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:57.344
Let's just start over. You know.
pretend we're complete strangers

509
00:38:57.427 --> 00:38:59.721
and it's the first time we've ever met.

510
00:39:00.722 --> 00:39:03.475
- Like a blind date?
- Yeah. exactly.

511
00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:05.727
Okay. then.

512
00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:07.813
So hi. I'm Mary.

513
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:10.816
Oh. you're really excited to meet me.

514
00:39:11.858 --> 00:39:14.570
Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm Mary.

515
00:39:14.653 --> 00:39:17.531
Yeah. okay. great.
Mary. hi. I'm Ben.

516
00:39:17.614 --> 00:39:19.032
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

517
00:39:19.116 --> 00:39:20.867
Pleasure's all mine.

518
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.499
Now what?

519
00:39:30.252 --> 00:39:32.921
- Do you know who Ken Kesey is?
- Of course.

520
00:39:33.005 --> 00:39:36.341
You know. he had this thing where he
always talked about making this movie.

521
00:39:36.466 --> 00:39:39.344
like he was living his life
making this movie.

522
00:39:39.428 --> 00:39:44.016
I always liked that.
I always thought of my life that way.

523
00:39:45.017 --> 00:39:46.852
So am I in your movie now?

524
00:39:47.853 --> 00:39:49.646
You've always been in my movie.

525
00:39:50.647 --> 00:39:52.691
You better watch out.

526
00:39:52.774 --> 00:39:56.111
I studied acting. so I'm gonna be
the star of your movie.

527
00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:59.531
- Hmm.
- But I'm really. really bad at crying.

528
00:39:59.615 --> 00:40:01.617
There was. like. a whole class on how
to cry on command

529
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.036
and I could never do it. Never.

530
00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:09.958
All right. Well. we're gonna need
some backstory.

531
00:40:10.042 --> 00:40:13.545
- Um. may I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

532
00:40:14.546 --> 00:40:16.214
Who was the guy you
were with last night?

533
00:40:17.549 --> 00:40:20.969
I wasn't with a guy.
He works for my dad.

534
00:40:21.053 --> 00:40:23.722
When I was in Paris.

535
00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:27.768
my dad sent him to keep an eye on me
and I wasn't supposed to know.

536
00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:30.145
And then one morning.
I was having breakfast in a café

537
00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:32.731
and he just sat down
across from me and said...

538
00:40:32.814 --> 00:40:34.941
Good morning. Mary.

539
00:40:35.025 --> 00:40:37.527
I've weighed out my options
before sitting down with you.

540
00:40:37.611 --> 00:40:39.321
They were three in number.

541
00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:41.907
One. maintain the status quo
and keep my distance.

542
00:40:42.032 --> 00:40:44.910
Two. pretend to be a stranger
and take it from there.

543
00:40:44.993 --> 00:40:49.414
Three. just come right out
and hope for the best.

544
00:40:49.498 --> 00:40:53.126
And that being said.
I simply can no longer keep my distance.

545
00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:55.379
And honesty is usually the best policy.

546
00:40:55.462 --> 00:40:57.547
so I've decided to go with option three.

547
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.135
That's fascinating.

548
00:41:02.219 --> 00:41:05.013
Mostly. though. I'm wondering who you are.
what you want from me.

549
00:41:05.097 --> 00:41:08.809
and why I shouldn't take this knife
and put it in your fucking eye?

550
00:41:10.352 --> 00:41:12.187
My name is Terrence Uberahl.

551
00:41:13.188 --> 00:41:14.898
And I work for your father.

552
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:18.443
Mr. William Rathcart.

553
00:41:18.568 --> 00:41:21.363
He has stationed me here
as an invisible agent. so to speak.

554
00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:26.284
I've been charged more precisely
with keeping an eye on you

555
00:41:26.368 --> 00:41:29.830
and stepping in if you were
to invite undue trouble.

556
00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:32.499
Why doesn't that surprise me?

557
00:41:34.084 --> 00:41:37.003
You know. wouldn't it be so much more...

558
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.676
profitable if I were to come clean
and reveal myself to you?

559
00:41:42.759 --> 00:41:44.302
I mean. after all.
lurking in the background

560
00:41:44.386 --> 00:41:47.055
pales in comparison to being included.

561
00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:48.473
Included?

562
00:41:48.598 --> 00:41:51.476
Well. what I mean is.

563
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:55.313
you know. I could complete my mission

564
00:41:55.439 --> 00:42:00.485
and report all the details of your comings
and goings to your father or...

565
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.534
you and I could become in cahoots.

566
00:42:07.617 --> 00:42:10.203
And all he'd have to hear is
a bare and unexciting minimum.

567
00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:16.877
And you know. all I'd ask in return
is for you to grace me with your company.

568
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.379
only when you have time. of course.

569
00:42:24.134 --> 00:42:26.511
So you're a double agent. are you?

570
00:42:26.595 --> 00:42:29.598
<i>Mademoiselle.</i> I am merely an agent.

571
00:42:29.681 --> 00:42:32.017
Of what. I have no idea.

572
00:42:37.606 --> 00:42:40.025
I haven't been able to shake him since.

573
00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:43.945
It was kind of like
giving scraps to a stray.

574
00:42:45.363 --> 00:42:47.949
He proposed to me last night with a ring.

575
00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:49.785
Like. he actually went out
and he bought a ring.

576
00:42:49.868 --> 00:42:51.828
which means he thought
that I actually might say yes.

577
00:42:51.912 --> 00:42:55.040
which means he's not
just a little off-kilter like I thought.

578
00:42:55.123 --> 00:42:59.211
He's actually... He's insane.
And my dad wants me to say yes.

579
00:42:59.336 --> 00:43:01.880
But I always knew
that he was fucking nuts.

580
00:43:04.132 --> 00:43:06.218
So. here I am.

581
00:43:09.137 --> 00:43:10.138
Hey. you're bleeding.

582
00:43:11.473 --> 00:43:12.599
- Oh.
- Here.

583
00:43:13.975 --> 00:43:16.478
- Oh. No. no. no. it's fine.
- Let me see.

584
00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:40.585
Turn it off. Turn it off!

585
00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.839
Just... Man. turn it off!

586
00:43:43.922 --> 00:43:46.049
Just go. Go. go.

587
00:43:46.132 --> 00:43:48.176
We're gonna piss a lot of people off.

588
00:43:49.177 --> 00:43:50.637
To hell with them.

589
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.915
<i>Meanwhile. Terrence Uberahl's
hitman. Wayne McCarty.</i>

590
00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:21.042
<i>who had instructed Terrence
to leave his payment</i>

591
00:44:21.126 --> 00:44:24.462
<i>in a bathroom stall at Club Wildlife
the night before.</i>

592
00:44:24.546 --> 00:44:26.798
<i>was making a detour with his wife Barbie</i>

593
00:44:26.882 --> 00:44:29.467
<i>en route to killing
Pamela Corbett-Ragsdale.</i>

594
00:44:32.095 --> 00:44:34.890
Hey. You got this. baby.

595
00:44:34.973 --> 00:44:36.933
I'll be right here. cheering you on.

596
00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:39.311
I'm so ashamed.

597
00:44:41.313 --> 00:44:43.315
I feel like a bloody criminal.

598
00:44:43.398 --> 00:44:45.025
You're no criminal.

599
00:44:46.484 --> 00:44:49.654
You're just a guy with a big heart

600
00:44:49.738 --> 00:44:51.990
and an even bigger personality.

601
00:44:53.533 --> 00:44:58.288
Remember. serenity is not
the absence of conflict...

602
00:44:59.456 --> 00:45:02.042
But the ability to cope with it.

603
00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:03.585
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

604
00:45:04.961 --> 00:45:06.212
We slipped.

605
00:45:07.756 --> 00:45:09.925
This is part of making it right.
You know it.

606
00:45:11.343 --> 00:45:12.677
Yeah. I know it.

607
00:45:12.802 --> 00:45:16.222
Mm-hmm.
so you just go on in there

608
00:45:16.348 --> 00:45:20.018
and give that boy back his wallet
and tell him you're sorry.

609
00:45:23.021 --> 00:45:25.815
You're a strong man. Wayne McCarty.

610
00:45:26.816 --> 00:45:29.569
Yeah.
That's why I love you.

611
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:32.822
Now. go be strong.

612
00:45:35.116 --> 00:45:36.868
I don't deserve you. baby.

613
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.038
I don't deserve you.

614
00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:44.209
Okay.

615
00:45:53.802 --> 00:45:55.553
Oh!

616
00:46:06.773 --> 00:46:09.859
<i>Mate. hey. you know. you shouldn't
leave your door open like that.</i>

617
00:46:09.943 --> 00:46:12.070
Geez. any weirdo
could just walk in on you.

618
00:46:14.364 --> 00:46:16.408
Oh. hey. guys.

619
00:46:16.533 --> 00:46:19.494
I'm looking for. uh. Rabbit.

620
00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:21.705
Who the fuck are you. man?

621
00:46:21.788 --> 00:46:24.082
I'm the guy looking for Rabbit.
Who the fuck are you?

622
00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:26.209
We're looking for Ben Gibbon.

623
00:46:26.292 --> 00:46:28.503
Ben is Rabbit. See? We're looking
for the same person. okay?

624
00:46:28.586 --> 00:46:31.965
So relax. I'm friends with him.
You guys friends with him?

625
00:46:32.048 --> 00:46:34.009
Didn't think so.
Look. let's start again.

626
00:46:34.092 --> 00:46:35.093
My name's...

627
00:46:37.303 --> 00:46:38.138
Oh...

628
00:46:40.557 --> 00:46:42.267
Good hit. buddy.

629
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.102
Good hit. Stop. stop. stop. stop.

630
00:46:48.398 --> 00:46:49.774
Oh.

631
00:46:49.858 --> 00:46:51.276
S...

632
00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.613
Stop. Time out. Time out. Stop.

633
00:46:58.283 --> 00:47:00.452
<i>We're all looking for Ben.
You hear that?</i>

634
00:47:00.535 --> 00:47:03.121
Oh. look. he's pulling up
right now. guys. Look at...

635
00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:23.641
Fucking start the car!

636
00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:24.768
Oh. shit.

637
00:47:27.812 --> 00:47:28.772
Hey!

638
00:47:28.855 --> 00:47:29.856
Bye. guys!

639
00:47:31.566 --> 00:47:33.485
- Hey!
- Come on!

640
00:47:36.154 --> 00:47:38.364
Benji. you here?

641
00:47:46.956 --> 00:47:48.041
Oh.

642
00:47:56.633 --> 00:47:58.009
- Hey. Mukul.
- Hey.

643
00:47:58.093 --> 00:47:59.677
Uh. you... you've met Mary.

644
00:47:59.761 --> 00:48:01.805
- Hi. Hi. again.
- Hello. there.

645
00:48:01.888 --> 00:48:03.848
Um. I'm gonna go dry off.

646
00:48:03.932 --> 00:48:04.849
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

647
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.018
She's sweet.

648
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:10.105
- <i>You good?</i>
- Yeah.

649
00:48:10.188 --> 00:48:11.815
- So all bong gone?
- Yeah.

650
00:48:11.898 --> 00:48:13.691
What?

651
00:48:13.775 --> 00:48:17.403
So nothing weird or unusual to report?

652
00:48:18.404 --> 00:48:20.240
- No.
- No one weird?

653
00:48:21.324 --> 00:48:22.826
- No.
- Okay.

654
00:48:24.202 --> 00:48:25.537
- Why?
- Just...

655
00:48:26.704 --> 00:48:29.040
- You good?
- Yeah.

656
00:48:29.165 --> 00:48:31.376
Just keep your guard up. Hmm?

657
00:48:32.836 --> 00:48:35.296
You worry too much. brother. I love you.

658
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.881
- Love you.
- Today is a great day!

659
00:48:36.965 --> 00:48:38.216
Just...

660
00:48:38.299 --> 00:48:39.384
Oh...

661
00:48:49.477 --> 00:48:51.855
Nice coat. Where'd you get it?

662
00:48:51.938 --> 00:48:54.065
A gift from me to you. Take it.

663
00:48:55.066 --> 00:48:56.985
You're too kind. really.

664
00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:02.407
All these people are dead.

665
00:49:09.914 --> 00:49:11.166
Turn around.

666
00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:15.128
Turn around.

667
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.394
Okay.

668
00:49:35.899 --> 00:49:38.193
Stop looking at me like that.
You're making me shy.

669
00:49:59.589 --> 00:50:02.300
Oh. cool.

670
00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:14.479
Hmm.

671
00:50:16.606 --> 00:50:19.901
I still think about going away
to one of these places.

672
00:50:21.236 --> 00:50:25.740
Just starting a totally new life
where no one knows me.

673
00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:28.243
Totally anonymous.

674
00:50:29.244 --> 00:50:30.995
Well. that sounds nice. doesn't it?

675
00:50:33.539 --> 00:50:36.459
No. it's stupid. childish.

676
00:50:36.542 --> 00:50:39.420
- Childish. maybe. Not stupid.
- Yeah.

677
00:50:39.504 --> 00:50:42.757
Well. I tried it. It didn't exactly
pan out. so...

678
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.010
Mm. No. you didn't.

679
00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:47.345
You bailed on it.

680
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.737
You... You kept yours?

681
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:07.240
- You didn't?
- I used mine.

682
00:51:07.323 --> 00:51:09.617
You left. so I went on my own.

683
00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:13.413
I didn't leave. I was sent.

684
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.208
Oh.

685
00:51:19.377 --> 00:51:21.713
It's a pretty crazy idea
for a couple of kids.

686
00:51:22.755 --> 00:51:23.965
Yeah.

687
00:51:30.638 --> 00:51:32.974
- Do you have a death wish?
- What?

688
00:51:34.392 --> 00:51:36.102
Why would you ask that?

689
00:51:36.185 --> 00:51:38.354
I don't know. I'm just curious.

690
00:51:39.355 --> 00:51:40.356
Curious about what?

691
00:51:41.357 --> 00:51:43.735
Do you wanna die?

692
00:51:43.818 --> 00:51:46.738
- Didn't realize I had a choice.
- I'm being serious.

693
00:51:47.822 --> 00:51:49.324
When you think about dying.

694
00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:51.409
is it something that excites you?

695
00:51:54.203 --> 00:51:55.413
I don't know.

696
00:52:06.257 --> 00:52:07.383
Who's this?

697
00:52:08.718 --> 00:52:11.346
- That's my mom.
- My God.

698
00:52:13.514 --> 00:52:15.641
- She was a badass.
- Yeah.

699
00:52:15.725 --> 00:52:17.435
Married my dad young.

700
00:52:37.955 --> 00:52:39.082
May I?

701
00:52:41.667 --> 00:52:42.919
Be my guest.

702
00:52:47.256 --> 00:52:48.424
Thanks.

703
00:53:18.579 --> 00:53:20.415
Why would a guy like you wanna die?

704
00:53:21.791 --> 00:53:24.335
- I never said I did.
- You didn't say you didn't.

705
00:53:29.966 --> 00:53:32.176
What does it feel like
to get punched in the face?

706
00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:36.347
Um. I don't know. It hurts.

707
00:53:37.348 --> 00:53:38.724
Yeah?

708
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.351
You like that or something?

709
00:53:44.647 --> 00:53:46.107
Punch me in the face.

710
00:53:47.775 --> 00:53:50.069
- What? No.
- I wanna know what it feels like.

711
00:53:50.153 --> 00:53:52.405
- I'm not gonna punch you in the face.
- I give you full permission.

712
00:53:52.488 --> 00:53:54.949
Just punch me.
like. right in the kisser. Do it.

713
00:53:55.032 --> 00:53:56.659
- What?
- Come on! A girl never gets a chance.

714
00:53:56.742 --> 00:53:58.119
- No. no.
- Do it!

715
00:53:58.202 --> 00:53:59.871
- Uh. I'm... I'm not...
- Just do it!

716
00:53:59.954 --> 00:54:01.372
Do it or I'll punch you in the face.

717
00:54:01.456 --> 00:54:03.124
- Oh. really?
- Yeah. do it.

718
00:54:03.207 --> 00:54:04.959
On the count of three. all right?

719
00:54:05.042 --> 00:54:07.170
One. two...

720
00:54:08.171 --> 00:54:09.172
I will do it.

721
00:54:10.173 --> 00:54:11.716
- Three.
- All right.

722
00:54:21.559 --> 00:54:22.810
That was a good one.

723
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.441
- What are you doing?
- I told you to punch me in the face.

724
00:54:28.524 --> 00:54:30.151
- I'm not gonna punch you.
- I told you to!

725
00:54:30.234 --> 00:54:32.153
- I'm not... I'm not gonna...
- I told you to punch me.

726
00:54:32.236 --> 00:54:35.656
Uh. Mary. please.
Hey. Mary. stop.

727
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.408
Why was it so easy for you to move on?

728
00:54:37.492 --> 00:54:39.243
Mary. it wasn't easy. It fucking sucked.

729
00:54:39.327 --> 00:54:41.579
- So why didn't you miss me?
- I did miss you!

730
00:54:41.704 --> 00:54:43.998
Why didn't you write me back?

731
00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:45.750
- Back?
- I wrote you!

732
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:47.919
Mary. I never got any letters!

733
00:54:48.002 --> 00:54:50.505
- What?
- I never got any letters.

734
00:54:52.924 --> 00:54:54.467
I promise. I swear.

735
00:54:55.635 --> 00:54:57.053
Oh. my God.

736
00:54:57.136 --> 00:55:00.056
I'm so... Oh. my God.

737
00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:04.894
It's okay. Hey. hey. hey.

738
00:55:13.945 --> 00:55:18.533
My dad. Terrence. they stole
all that time from us.

739
00:55:23.204 --> 00:55:24.580
Hey.

740
00:55:25.957 --> 00:55:28.709
We're here right now
and that's all that matters.

741
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.091
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry.

742
00:55:36.384 --> 00:55:38.261
- I'm sorry.
- No. no.

743
00:55:38.344 --> 00:55:39.470
Hey.

744
00:55:45.893 --> 00:55:48.062
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

745
00:55:49.313 --> 00:55:50.606
Yeah. hello.

746
00:55:51.899 --> 00:55:54.068
<i>Who is this?</i>

747
00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:57.363
I think you have this phone call thing
backwards. You called me.

748
00:55:57.488 --> 00:55:59.115
<i>I'm looking for Mary.</i>

749
00:56:00.366 --> 00:56:02.910
<i>Is everything copacetic over there?</i>

750
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:07.498
Right as rain. friend.

751
00:56:07.582 --> 00:56:09.333
<i>I'm not your friend.</i>

752
00:56:09.417 --> 00:56:12.044
No? Then why'd you call me?

753
00:56:13.045 --> 00:56:16.173
<i>I'm gonna call you Pinocchio.</i>

754
00:56:16.299 --> 00:56:17.633
And why's that?

755
00:56:18.634 --> 00:56:20.094
<i>He was nosy.</i>

756
00:58:09.537 --> 00:58:12.581
<i>If it's true
that Rathcart Computers were wired</i>

757
00:58:12.665 --> 00:58:18.170
<i>to monitor the activity of high-profile
customers through their built-in cameras.</i>

758
00:58:18.254 --> 00:58:19.714
<i>that could very well be the straw</i>

759
00:58:19.797 --> 00:58:23.426
<i>that finally breaks the back
of the Rathcart Corporation.</i>

760
00:58:23.509 --> 00:58:26.887
<i>We go live now
to a GBN breaking news exclusive.</i>

761
00:58:26.971 --> 00:58:29.890
<i>Multiple shots fired
near the financial district.</i>

762
00:58:29.974 --> 00:58:31.976
<i>Reports of a deadly car crash.</i>

763
00:58:32.101 --> 00:58:33.894
<i>We've got more on this story</i>

764
00:58:33.978 --> 00:58:37.982
<i>and continuing coverage
of the Rathcart scandal as it develops.</i>

765
00:59:13.184 --> 00:59:16.437
Oh. sh...

766
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.283
Wake up. angel. Wake up.

767
00:59:46.133 --> 00:59:48.260
Shh. shh.

768
01:00:30.469 --> 01:00:31.470
Mm.

769
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:40.855
Hi.

770
01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:45.067
So what do we do now?

771
01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:49.864
Let's get out of here.

772
01:00:50.823 --> 01:00:52.241
Sure. Where?

773
01:00:52.324 --> 01:00:54.285
No. I mean out of this city.

774
01:00:54.368 --> 01:00:57.621
Let's just get out of here.
away from everything and everyone.

775
01:00:57.705 --> 01:01:00.791
- Let's go.
- Where would we go?

776
01:01:01.834 --> 01:01:06.046
You know. I still like Mexico.

777
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.631
All the fugitives go to Mexico.

778
01:01:07.715 --> 01:01:08.883
Mm-hmm.

779
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:16.056
- We really could. We could. couldn't we?
- Yeah.

780
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.726
We can buy a little spot
on the beach.

781
01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:22.813
Just lay around in the sun
till we're old and gray.

782
01:01:22.938 --> 01:01:25.941
- And I'll become a fisherman.
- And I'll open a snack stand.

783
01:01:26.025 --> 01:01:29.194
And I'll sell fish tacos to tourists.

784
01:01:32.448 --> 01:01:34.783
He'll try to stop us. you know.

785
01:01:34.867 --> 01:01:37.202
- Let him try.
- Yeah.

786
01:01:38.203 --> 01:01:40.623
Well. you don't know my father.

787
01:01:40.706 --> 01:01:43.500
And you don't know Terrence Uberahl.
He will come looking for me.

788
01:01:43.584 --> 01:01:45.044
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

789
01:01:45.127 --> 01:01:47.963
- Then I'll protect you.
- And I'll protect you.

790
01:01:50.132 --> 01:01:51.675
For how long?

791
01:01:51.759 --> 01:01:53.594
For as long as you want me to.

792
01:01:57.681 --> 01:01:59.224
How about forever?

793
01:02:06.148 --> 01:02:07.566
Mary Rathcart.

794
01:02:08.984 --> 01:02:10.152
Yes?

795
01:02:11.987 --> 01:02:13.989
I'm sick of waiting for my life to start.

796
01:02:15.824 --> 01:02:18.410
I'm sick of trying so hard
to feel something.

797
01:02:19.954 --> 01:02:22.623
And you coming back
made me realize I...

798
01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.542
I just wanna be...

799
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:27.836
Happy.

800
01:02:28.963 --> 01:02:29.964
Yeah.

801
01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:37.721
When?

802
01:02:39.932 --> 01:02:42.142
There's no time like the present.

803
01:03:14.717 --> 01:03:15.926
Have a seat.

804
01:03:19.513 --> 01:03:21.807
You're a lot more colorful
than I expected.

805
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.771
Look. I. um. I came here today
as a professional courtesy.

806
01:03:27.855 --> 01:03:30.858
This is me being professional.
and there's your courtesy.

807
01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.610
And I just wanna get
straight to the point here. mate.

808
01:03:33.736 --> 01:03:35.529
Look. you contracted me to do a job.

809
01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.574
you paid in full upfront.
just like I instructed you to do.

810
01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.660
Circumstances have changed

811
01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:45.998
such that they no longer permit me
to carry out the said job.

812
01:03:46.999 --> 01:03:52.588
So therefore. here I am
to willingly return my compensation.

813
01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.757
Whoa. what?

814
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.968
I'm not gonna kill
Pamela Corbett-Ragsdale.

815
01:03:58.052 --> 01:03:59.803
Your cash is in the bag.

816
01:03:59.887 --> 01:04:03.807
You can chalk it up
to a recent personal tragedy.

817
01:04:03.932 --> 01:04:05.809
Now. I've got a new. more pressing job.

818
01:04:05.893 --> 01:04:09.646
- Hey. if it's about the money...
- It's not about the money. mate.

819
01:04:11.774 --> 01:04:13.817
There is an angel up there...

820
01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:17.738
waiting at the gates of Heaven.

821
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.116
and the password for her entrance
is "revenge."

822
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.578
Hey. listen. if Corbett-Ragsdale makes it
to that interview today.

823
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:29.875
there are some very powerful people
that will be awfully upset.

824
01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:32.544
I get that. mate.

825
01:04:32.628 --> 01:04:36.090
But I'm pretty fucking upset myself
at the moment.

826
01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:40.010
And that is why I came here in person.
which I never do.

827
01:04:40.094 --> 01:04:42.096
to give you enough time
to make other arrangements.

828
01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:46.016
Oh. enough time! Enough time!

829
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.561
You've wasted all the time we had!

830
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.441
Fuck!

831
01:04:54.525 --> 01:04:57.820
In the brief duration of your employment.

832
01:04:57.903 --> 01:05:01.865
you have been privy
to some very incriminating information

833
01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:04.034
and that presents me with an issue.

834
01:05:05.536 --> 01:05:08.372
Don't go wasting your time
making idle threats there. lollipop.

835
01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:11.875
I've been in the bloody blood business

836
01:05:11.959 --> 01:05:14.711
since you were handing out
handjobs at Hanson concerts.

837
01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:18.215
So I know better than you.

838
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.300
Loose lips sink ships.

839
01:05:22.136 --> 01:05:24.054
You won't have no problem from me.

840
01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.932
You've got my word.

841
01:05:27.015 --> 01:05:30.185
Now. if you'll please excuse me.

842
01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:32.938
I'm gonna catch a love story
at the local cinema.

843
01:05:34.815 --> 01:05:37.651
And then I'm gonna track down
a pair of lady Killers.

844
01:05:44.032 --> 01:05:46.368
What's the name of that painting
you got there on the wall?

845
01:05:47.578 --> 01:05:49.413
- Fuck you.
- Mm. Good name.

846
01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.807
<i>Gibbon. that son of a bitch.
must have gotten to him.</i>

847
01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:11.768
Follow the didgeridoo.
Take care of him.

848
01:06:11.852 --> 01:06:14.980
You find Mary and that Gibbon kid.

849
01:06:15.063 --> 01:06:16.899
I wanna talk to them personally.

850
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.862
I think we may have
just lost the medicine for our little bug.

851
01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:23.697
- <i>What's plan B?</i>
- Plan B?

852
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

853
01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.742
There is no plan B.

854
01:06:26.825 --> 01:06:30.954
<i>I thought I told you to hire the best.
Who the fuck is this guy?</i>

855
01:06:31.955 --> 01:06:33.957
No. he came highly recommended.

856
01:06:34.041 --> 01:06:35.751
- I wasn't anticipating. sir...
- <i>Terrence. listen to me.</i>

857
01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:36.877
- Yes.
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

858
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.378
<i>I am sick of excuses. all right?</i>

859
01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.005
- <i>I am sick of them.</i>
- Yes. sir.

860
01:06:40.088 --> 01:06:43.217
- <i>Figure this out now.</i>
- I'll handle it myself.

861
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.302
While... While I have you.

862
01:06:45.385 --> 01:06:49.223
I seem to have lost track
of Mary during all this.

863
01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:52.893
I'm beginning to worry and I was hoping
that maybe you had a chance to...

864
01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:55.729
- <i>Terrence. stop.</i>
- Maybe you had a chance to...

865
01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:58.357
<i>Terrence. how about you stop
worrying about my daughter</i>

866
01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:01.485
<i>and focus on silencing Corbett-Ragsdale?</i>

867
01:07:01.568 --> 01:07:03.779
<i>You know where she is. Now. get it done.</i>

868
01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:06.240
- <i>I'm coming in.</i>
- Of course.

869
01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:28.428
<i>I bet your speech was swell.</i>

870
01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.392
<i>Did you tell them that funny story
you told me yesterday?</i>

871
01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:34.893
<i>No.</i>

872
01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:38.730
<i>I didn't think of it.
All I could think of was my...</i>

873
01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:41.608
<i>Fatal errors have
a way of compounding.</i>

874
01:07:41.692 --> 01:07:44.152
<i>and Terrence Uberahl's
previous mistakes</i>

875
01:07:44.236 --> 01:07:46.738
<i>were about to inspire yet another.</i>

876
01:07:46.822 --> 01:07:48.573
<i>...told them that I used
your money. all of it.</i>

877
01:07:48.657 --> 01:07:51.076
<i>to buy furniture for this apartment.</i>

878
01:07:51.159 --> 01:07:52.911
<i>That's silly. Your money. my money.</i>

879
01:07:52.995 --> 01:07:55.122
<i>What difference does it make?
It wasn't very much anyway.</i>

880
01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:57.958
<i>Maybe I could have told them
the baby has to sleep in the dining room.</i>

881
01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.544
It's only temporary
till we get another apartment.

882
01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:13.598
You ever seen this movie? Huh?

883
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:19.730
It was my Barbie's favorite movie!

884
01:08:28.488 --> 01:08:30.407
<i>Speak up.
Stand right up to Doolittle.</i>

885
01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:33.076
<i>Don't ask for your rights.
Demand them.</i>

886
01:08:34.745 --> 01:08:38.123
<i>Remember the day in
Boston when I got you this ring...</i>

887
01:08:41.626 --> 01:08:43.295
<i>Well. I don't
want a better one later.</i>

888
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:49.593
<i>...one with the diamonds.</i>

889
01:08:49.676 --> 01:08:51.178
<i>That can wait.</i>

890
01:08:52.387 --> 01:08:55.640
<i>Yeah. well. I suppose
the mink coat can wait too.</i>

891
01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:27.399
Why can't you be
a good soldier. huh?

892
01:10:27.482 --> 01:10:28.984
Huh?!

893
01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:52.549
Miss Corbett-Ragsdale? I'm
your security detail. here to escort you.

894
01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:59.055
Hello? Miss Corbett-Ragsdale?

895
01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:02.976
Miss Co...

896
01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:29.252
Hello? Ben?

897
01:11:43.892 --> 01:11:45.560
Is it love?

898
01:11:45.644 --> 01:11:46.728
- Yes.
- Yes.

899
01:11:48.522 --> 01:11:51.233
- True love?
- Is there any other kind?

900
01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:54.110
How do you know?

901
01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:57.697
I've always known.

902
01:11:58.823 --> 01:12:00.116
Yeah. me. too.

903
01:12:01.826 --> 01:12:03.954
When you're young.
you know everything.

904
01:12:06.706 --> 01:12:08.166
Try not to forget.

905
01:12:14.047 --> 01:12:18.093
Have you thought about the fallout?
It's not gonna be pretty.

906
01:12:18.176 --> 01:12:21.555
Don't you think that family rivalries
are a little passé?

907
01:12:22.722 --> 01:12:27.143
It is going
to take some heavy lifting

908
01:12:27.269 --> 01:12:28.979
to get our families
together on a wedding.

909
01:12:29.062 --> 01:12:31.648
- No big wedding.
- No families. no.

910
01:12:31.773 --> 01:12:35.902
Just thinking about doing a good
old-fashioned shotgun variety. right?

911
01:12:35.986 --> 01:12:37.571
Yeah. Yeah.

912
01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:39.739
What. today?

913
01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:40.824
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

914
01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:46.329
Benjamin. would you deny your mother
a proper wedding for her only child?

915
01:12:48.123 --> 01:12:51.084
At the very least. a girl needs a dress
on her wedding day.

916
01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.669
- My son needs a tuxedo.
- Mom...

917
01:12:52.752 --> 01:12:55.797
- She's wearing a fucking dress.
- Okay. Mrs. Gibbon.

918
01:12:58.258 --> 01:12:59.843
I'll wear a dress.

919
01:13:03.013 --> 01:13:05.348
I guess you should get
used to calling me "Mom."

920
01:13:08.893 --> 01:13:10.895
What about your mother?

921
01:13:11.021 --> 01:13:13.523
No. No. she wouldn't come anyway.

922
01:13:14.733 --> 01:13:17.819
Mom. you're the only one
that can know about this.

923
01:13:18.903 --> 01:13:22.240
But you need a wedding party.

924
01:13:22.324 --> 01:13:24.367
Don't you have
anyone else you can call?

925
01:13:26.745 --> 01:13:28.204
Um...

926
01:14:06.368 --> 01:14:09.663
- Okay.
- I know. It's so exciting.

927
01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.498
Well. I'm hoping
that we have time to do that

928
01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:13.708
- before everything gets comp...
- Well. wait. wait. wait.

929
01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.335
Well. what...

930
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:18.922
Well?

931
01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:24.386
Thank you for the dress. Mrs. Gibbon.

932
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.888
It's my pleasure.

933
01:14:28.682 --> 01:14:30.350
Excuse me for a moment.

934
01:14:58.753 --> 01:15:00.964
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

935
01:15:01.047 --> 01:15:03.675
Hi. Beatrice. It's Nancy Gibbon calling.

936
01:15:04.884 --> 01:15:07.345
<i>Your daughter and my son
are getting married today.</i>

937
01:15:07.429 --> 01:15:10.140
<i>at the church on St. Peter's Street. 5:00.</i>

938
01:15:10.265 --> 01:15:12.976
<i>and I know that it would mean a lot to her
if her mother was there.</i>

939
01:15:13.059 --> 01:15:15.270
<i>It's time to leave
this bad blood behind us.</i>

940
01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:21.901
<i>What do you want?</i>

941
01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:24.320
<i>What do you know about the wedding?</i>

942
01:15:24.404 --> 01:15:25.405
What wedding?

943
01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.824
<i>Mary and the Gibbon kid.
they're getting married today.</i>

944
01:15:33.538 --> 01:15:34.581
What did you say?

945
01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:37.834
<i>They're getting married. Today.</i>

946
01:15:45.925 --> 01:15:48.094
Oh. fuck me!

947
01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.195
- It's me.
- <i>What do you want?</i>

948
01:16:06.196 --> 01:16:07.947
You're all I ever wanted.

949
01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:12.076
From the moment I laid eyes on you.
it's always been about you.

950
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.538
<i>I mean. I waited. I bided time.</i>

951
01:16:15.622 --> 01:16:18.958
I knew that you needed convincing.
I knew that.

952
01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:20.376
<i>But listen.</i>

953
01:16:20.502 --> 01:16:23.713
<i>I think I might have gotten myself
into a little bit of hot water here.</i>

954
01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:27.300
I think my big city days are done.

955
01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:31.054
I'm skipping town. babe.
and you're coming with me.

956
01:16:31.137 --> 01:16:33.264
- Terrence...
- <i>I need you to understand something.</i>

957
01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:36.726
If you would just give me a chance.

958
01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:40.688
<i>I can make you so happy.</i>

959
01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:53.910
Okay.

960
01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:55.912
Okay.

961
01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:02.752
I've been wanting to tell you something.

962
01:17:02.836 --> 01:17:04.838
but I don't wanna ruin the mood.

963
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.133
Someone called last night.

964
01:17:09.217 --> 01:17:12.262
A guy. Looking for Mary.

965
01:17:14.347 --> 01:17:15.723
He was...

966
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.105
troubling.

967
01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:27.610
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

968
01:17:35.326 --> 01:17:39.789
Do you remember the first time we met?
Remember what you called it?

969
01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:43.042
Fate.

970
01:17:44.043 --> 01:17:45.837
By way of random chaos.

971
01:17:51.885 --> 01:17:54.721
I'm just letting what's meant to be. be.

972
01:18:05.523 --> 01:18:07.567
Hey.

973
01:18:08.568 --> 01:18:11.779
You're not supposed to see me
in my dress. It's bad luck.

974
01:18:11.863 --> 01:18:14.449
I'll take my chances.
You look so beautiful.

975
01:18:21.456 --> 01:18:25.043
It's the moment of truth.
Are you sure you wanna do this?

976
01:18:25.126 --> 01:18:28.880
- I'm sure. Are you?
- I'm positive.

977
01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:34.177
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

978
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:52.737
- <i>William.</i>
- Terrence.

979
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:55.198
Thank God. Where are you?

980
01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:57.408
- <i>You knew about this. didn't you?</i>
- Slow down.

981
01:18:57.492 --> 01:19:00.703
- <i>Huh? The wedding!</i>
- I don't know what you're talking about.

982
01:19:00.787 --> 01:19:03.581
- <i>Mary and the Gibbon kid?</i>
- I swear.

983
01:19:03.665 --> 01:19:07.210
<i>St. Peter's Street.
Why did you let this happen?</i>

984
01:19:07.335 --> 01:19:09.545
- I had no idea.
- <i>I'm going down there.</i>

985
01:19:09.671 --> 01:19:11.214
<i>I'm gonna find that son of a bitch!</i>

986
01:19:11.297 --> 01:19:12.715
I don't think you wanna do that. Terrence.

987
01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.677
- <i>Too late!</i>
- Listen to me. We can figure this out.

988
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.387
Terre... Hello.

989
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:19.973
Terrence? Terrence?

990
01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.359
- Where is that rat-fuck headed?
- A chapel downtown.

991
01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:34.487
My daughter's getting married.

992
01:19:35.488 --> 01:19:36.322
Aw.

993
01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:39.909
Well. let's go.

994
01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:42.578
You're taking me with you?

995
01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:47.208
It's your baby girl's wedding.

996
01:19:54.298 --> 01:19:55.675
Here we are. guys.

997
01:19:56.968 --> 01:19:59.012
I prepared a little something.

998
01:20:01.556 --> 01:20:06.894
Welcome to this beautiful union
between these two people...

999
01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:13.359
in this beautiful space. together.

1000
01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:17.613
Thank you.

1001
01:20:17.697 --> 01:20:19.574
Stunning. both of you.

1002
01:20:21.367 --> 01:20:24.704
In the Judeo-Christian Creation myth.

1003
01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:28.124
Adam and Eve are banished from the Garden

1004
01:20:28.207 --> 01:20:30.543
for disobeying God's sacred laws.

1005
01:20:31.544 --> 01:20:33.838
But I invite you to consider.

1006
01:20:33.921 --> 01:20:36.799
while they knew nothing
but beauty in the Garden.

1007
01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:41.137
they did not know love

1008
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:43.097
until they were forced to face

1009
01:20:43.181 --> 01:20:46.976
the ugliness
of the outside world together.

1010
01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:52.148
They clung to each other
in the face of a vicious world.

1011
01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:58.071
and. in so doing.
gave birth to love itself.

1012
01:21:10.249 --> 01:21:11.584
Terrence.

1013
01:21:13.628 --> 01:21:15.254
Hello. Mary.

1014
01:21:17.757 --> 01:21:19.509
You don't wanna do this.

1015
01:21:19.592 --> 01:21:21.177
Nobody move.

1016
01:21:23.471 --> 01:21:25.681
You broke my heart.

1017
01:21:25.807 --> 01:21:28.184
- Terrence...
- I protected you.

1018
01:21:28.267 --> 01:21:30.937
Just put the gun down.
It's not too late.

1019
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.231
It was always too late!

1020
01:21:35.566 --> 01:21:36.400
Huh?

1021
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:38.903
- Terrence!
- No!

1022
01:21:38.986 --> 01:21:40.863
- You.
- No! No!

1023
01:21:40.947 --> 01:21:41.864
Hey! Hey!

1024
01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:44.492
- Ben! Ben!
- No. no.

1025
01:21:45.493 --> 01:21:47.328
It was always about you.

1026
01:21:47.411 --> 01:21:53.543
I had to listen to her sob stories
about you over and over and over again.

1027
01:21:53.626 --> 01:21:56.796
I was fucking sick of you
before I even met you.

1028
01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:58.297
- Yeah.
- No.

1029
01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:00.633
Back up! Back up!

1030
01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:02.385
- Terrence. please!
- Stay back!

1031
01:22:02.468 --> 01:22:04.095
Please! Please.

1032
01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:06.389
- Shh...
- Stop! Stop.

1033
01:22:06.472 --> 01:22:08.015
No.

1034
01:22:09.308 --> 01:22:11.936
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

1035
01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:13.020
Ben!

1036
01:22:14.355 --> 01:22:15.565
Ben!

1037
01:22:16.941 --> 01:22:20.403
Don't you know the penalty for hunting
in the King's forest is death?

1038
01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:42.383
You call this a man. huh?

1039
01:22:42.466 --> 01:22:44.802
Look at me. I'm a man.

1040
01:22:46.888 --> 01:22:47.889
Give me that.

1041
01:22:57.106 --> 01:22:58.691
Give me the gun.

1042
01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:06.115
Wayne?

1043
01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.409
Rabbit?

1044
01:23:08.492 --> 01:23:10.620
You got your wallet. Right? Eh?

1045
01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:13.956
What?

1046
01:23:20.755 --> 01:23:23.633
All right. could everybody
please sit down? Come on.

1047
01:23:23.716 --> 01:23:25.343
Come on. now. Chop chop.

1048
01:23:26.844 --> 01:23:29.972
Not on the floor. ladies.
You'll ruin your bloody dresses.

1049
01:23:30.056 --> 01:23:31.641
Sit in the pews.

1050
01:23:31.766 --> 01:23:33.226
Come on.

1051
01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.228
Including you. sunshine.

1052
01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:36.979
I'll take it from here.

1053
01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.649
Yeah. yeah. sit. sit. Good boy.

1054
01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:43.527
- Is this your wedding?
- Yeah.

1055
01:23:46.197 --> 01:23:47.490
Congratulations. mate.

1056
01:23:48.449 --> 01:23:50.952
Hey. What are you doing here?

1057
01:23:52.578 --> 01:23:55.039
Well. as fate would have it.

1058
01:23:55.122 --> 01:23:57.541
I reckon we got ourselves
a common enemy.

1059
01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:58.834
Let him up.

1060
01:24:00.294 --> 01:24:01.379
Get up.

1061
01:24:06.425 --> 01:24:09.011
I'm not gonna let you ruin
this love story.

1062
01:24:11.973 --> 01:24:13.349
All right.

1063
01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:20.398
Ladies. you might wanna look away.

1064
01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:27.780
This is for my angel.

1065
01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.960
Oh. shit.

1066
01:24:52.596 --> 01:24:54.557
Hey. hey. hey. hey! Freeze!

1067
01:25:06.819 --> 01:25:09.030
Keep your eyes on the prize. Rabbit.

1068
01:25:19.165 --> 01:25:21.125
Put the gun down!

1069
01:25:29.133 --> 01:25:31.010
Put the gun down. Terrence.

1070
01:25:32.136 --> 01:25:33.262
Mary.

1071
01:25:35.306 --> 01:25:36.307
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

1072
01:25:37.808 --> 01:25:39.352
- No!
- No!

1073
01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:44.190
No!

1074
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:55.701
<i>For Ben. the moment
lasted a lifetime.</i>

1075
01:25:56.702 --> 01:25:59.330
<i>But his life didn't
flash before his eyes.</i>

1076
01:25:59.455 --> 01:26:03.000
<i>Instead. his mind traveled to the memory
of a childhood toy.</i>

1077
01:26:03.084 --> 01:26:06.629
<i>a red View-Master he received
for his fifth birthday.</i>

1078
01:26:06.712 --> 01:26:11.175
<i>As a boy. Ben spent hours flipping
through pictures of miraculous things</i>

1079
01:26:11.258 --> 01:26:14.095
<i>and momentous periods
of human history.</i>

1080
01:26:14.178 --> 01:26:16.138
<i>Though too young
to understand it at the time.</i>

1081
01:26:16.222 --> 01:26:19.475
<i>Ben was struck
by the seemingly impossible fact</i>

1082
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.812
<i>that these were images of real things</i>

1083
01:26:22.895 --> 01:26:27.775
<i>and that they were all mere specks
of a cataclysmically immense reality</i>

1084
01:26:27.858 --> 01:26:31.779
<i>he could never fully grasp or even accept.</i>

1085
01:26:31.862 --> 01:26:34.532
<i>He remembered feeling weightless.</i>

1086
01:26:34.657 --> 01:26:37.868
<i>He had contemplated
this moment many times.</i>

1087
01:26:37.952 --> 01:26:39.995
<i>He had dreamt up countless scenarios.</i>

1088
01:26:40.079 --> 01:26:42.706
<i>He had imagined many good deaths.</i>

1089
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:46.085
<i>But he couldn't remember any of them now.</i>

1090
01:26:46.168 --> 01:26:49.797
<i>Instead. he thought of Mary.</i>

1091
01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:09.483
Hey.

1092
01:27:11.444 --> 01:27:13.154
Ben. Ben!

1093
01:27:53.861 --> 01:27:54.862
Hey. hey.

1094
01:27:54.945 --> 01:27:55.988
Hey.

1095
01:27:56.989 --> 01:27:57.948
Hey.

1096
01:27:58.032 --> 01:28:00.409
Stay with me. Ben.

1097
01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:05.539
I didn't get to say. "I do."

1098
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:10.920
I do. too.

1099
01:28:20.262 --> 01:28:23.849
<i>Ben had always imagined
that. in some shape or form.</i>

1100
01:28:23.933 --> 01:28:25.476
<i>it would end right here.</i>

1101
01:28:25.559 --> 01:28:28.812
<i>He would have gone down in history
as an incorrigible rascal</i>

1102
01:28:28.896 --> 01:28:31.315
<i>just not meant for this world.</i>

1103
01:28:31.398 --> 01:28:33.275
<i>Death makes for good punctuation.</i>

1104
01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.195
<i>and his was supposed
to be a perfect example...</i>

1105
01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:40.616
<i>a romantic hero who lived fast.
died young. and left a beautiful corpse.</i>

1106
01:28:40.741 --> 01:28:43.244
<i>But it doesn't end that way.</i>

1107
01:28:43.327 --> 01:28:48.082
<i>Like it or not. and for reasons none of us
will ever understand.</i>

1108
01:28:48.165 --> 01:28:51.752
<i>sometimes fate decides to step in</i>

1109
01:28:51.835 --> 01:28:55.297
<i>and stick us with a happy ending.</i>

1110
01:29:56.853 --> 01:30:01.853
