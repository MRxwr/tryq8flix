00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.574
From two dots you get a straight line...

2
00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:09.952
Simple and direct.

3
00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.455
It's like throwing a punch.

4
00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:13.157
When I think the time is right.

5
00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.744
I use the most efficient way
to solve a problem.

6
00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.248
Not everyone will agree with me.

7
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.706
but that's me.

8
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:21.208
I'm fallon zhu.

9
00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:24.158
as in Jimmy Fallon and fallon fox.

10
00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.202
a 145-pound

11
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.449
kick-ass policeman.

12
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.287
I honestly did not do it.

13
00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.250
I'm gonna kill you. you little bitch!

14
00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.282
Please don't hit me anymore!

15
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:33.823
I am innocent. sis ling.

16
00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:36.124
I am innocent. sis ling.

17
00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.167
Get out!

18
00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:39.407
Chloe song. are you ready yet?

19
00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:40.577
How many times do I have to rush you?

20
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.206
Yes. I'm ready. Coming...

21
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.810
Took you all that time for just makeup?

22
00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:45.490
We're all set. just missing you!

23
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.910
You think you're a superstar?

24
00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.578
Hurry up... run!

25
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:51.615
The director is waiting!

26
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.750
Yes.

27
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.456
Mr director. I am ready.

28
00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:56.077
Lower your voice. Mr director is
busy pondering the next scenes.

29
00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:57.083
Hurry!

30
00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:04.072
Ready?

31
00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:05.498
Not yet. hang on a minute.

32
00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:07.375
Phone.

33
00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:08.458
Hi Chloe!

34
00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:09.247
Have you wrapped?

35
00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:11.226
One more shot and I'm wrapped.
Have you got out of bed?

36
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.393
Remember to get money for my mom

37
00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:13.726
and be at the wedding
photographer's studio before 1 o'clock

38
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.910
or I won't marry you.

39
00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:16.948
I'll be doomed if you don't marry me.

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.184
Well. if you don't want to be doomed.
then please don't be late.

41
00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.208
And also. I've got
your suit ready in the wardrobe.

42
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.660
Remember to wear it. you hear me?

43
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:24.243
That is it. that suit...!

44
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:26.867
Wow!

45
00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:27.622
Wow what?

46
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.369
What the heck do you know about fashion?!

47
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:30.955
Ok. that's it.

48
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.476
I have to get back to
work. I'll see you later.

49
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Bye.

50
00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:34.958
Move.

51
00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.143
Assistant director.
aren't you just taking my close-up?

52
00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:41.123
This will only work
if it's one continuous shot.

53
00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.282
One continuous shot?

54
00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.324
No. I am acrophobic.

55
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.015
Let's wait for my double to get here. ok?

56
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.161
Why did you jump?
The camera's not even rolling.

57
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.375
Do it again!

58
00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.282
Hi lowell... Wayne! What a coincidence!

59
00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:56.934
- Oh. there's an operation today...
- We're just getting pineapple buns and milk tea...

60
00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:57.788
Need help?

61
00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.726
- Superintendent huang is hungry...
- No. we're on our way to catch some crooks...

62
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.660
Need help?

63
00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:01.413
No...

64
00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:02.197
It's just a small job...

65
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.970
Aren't you on leave? You're all dressed up!

66
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.991
We're having our wedding
photos taken today.

67
00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:07.643
You've got to come to
my wedding next month. remember that.

68
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:08.726
- Of course!
- Congratulations...

69
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.910
Hey. stay safe.

70
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.434
Understood. What is most important...?

71
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:12.698
Staying safe!

72
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.243
Eating pineapple buns again?

73
00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:21.873
You will easily get fat.

74
00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.268
I'm just going after a
bunch of crooks today.

75
00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:24.748
not like I'm tackling bank robbers.

76
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.080
Do I look good?

77
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.706
Looking real good!

78
00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:29.702
You look like a manager
in a Chinese restaurant.

79
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.143
Why? Are you taking your wedding photos
with Chloe in a Chinese restaurant?

80
00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.783
What the heck do you know about fashion?!

81
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.707
People getting married
all suffer from brain damage.

82
00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:38.992
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

83
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:41.536
Our privileged guest. wait...

84
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.078
Wow. so many people in here?

85
00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:02.625
Gentleman.

86
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.250
Gentleman!

87
00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.202
Gentleman!

88
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.240
Calling traffic control...
There's a Van at queen's road central

89
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.582
that is illegally parked.

90
00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:15.033
Please send a tow truck. Thanks.

91
00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.289
Do you have a light?

92
00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.619
No. Try seven eleven down the road

93
00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:21.292
thanks.

94
00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:23.618
Idiot.

95
00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:31.498
May I have your name. sir?

96
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:33.708
Shing huang.

97
00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:35.994
Mr huang. your date of birth is...

98
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.123
March 27th. 2000.

99
00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.476
Sir. you do look a little mature
for your age. ID number please!

100
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.364
What do you want?

101
00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:44.373
I am hksar traffic warden -

102
00:05:44.417 --> 00:05:46.578
obstacle huang. Ui71337.

103
00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:47.740
You have violated the parking regulations.

104
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.365
and will have to pay a fine of $320.

105
00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:50.726
You can settle it through online banking.

106
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.412
pay by cash.
or you can remit the money by cheque.

107
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:54.458
Your driver's license...?

108
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.370
I can sue you for obstructing a police
officer lawfully engaged in public duty.

109
00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:01.442
May you perish in the line of duty.

110
00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:06.031
Honey. it's me.

111
00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:07.368
I'm lining up now.

112
00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:08.726
That means you still haven't got the money.

113
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.070
I ran down the stairs right away.

114
00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:12.498
So I was rushing you. so it's my fault?

115
00:06:12.542 --> 00:06:14.123
No... l was moving too slow.

116
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.410
So have you done it?

117
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.618
I said I am already in line.

118
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.615
So it's my fault. right?

119
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.365
No. it's my fault...

120
00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.823
Our three very privileged customers...

121
00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:25.448
Oh. you've got the flu?

122
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.287
If you sign up for this "influ-surance
plan”. you will definitely...

123
00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:30.948
The signal's dead.

124
00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.042
It's fine.

125
00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:38.708
Help!

126
00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:39.792
Mr Jim

127
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:43.493
everyone get down!

128
00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:46.249
Take everything out - valuables.
non-valuables. everything!

129
00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:50.077
Take the money out of the vault.

130
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.690
I didn't get a duplicate of the key.

131
00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:53.125
You think I'm a fool!

132
00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:56.993
Take it out! Quick!

133
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.365
Do you want to end up like him?

134
00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:00.118
Don't hit my face...

135
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.581
No... give me back my car.

136
00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:32.957
Hey buddy. I just want to
borrow your toy car for a bit.

137
00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:33.947
Will you lend it to me?

138
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.332
- Why are you snatching his car?
- Don't cry.

139
00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:38.536
Don't take his car...

140
00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:42.208
Kill him!

141
00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:51.059
Everybody was happy just chipping in.

142
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:51.913
This is crazy.

143
00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.478
But you have to make me kill somebody.

144
00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:54.601
Stupid restaurant manager.

145
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:55.284
Come out.

146
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.375
Siren. Run!

147
00:07:58.292 --> 00:07:59.292
Quick!

148
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.500
Get out of the way...!

149
00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:09.743
Hey buddy... wait.

150
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.448
Hold it there. stupid cop!

151
00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:16.292
Police! Don't move!

152
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:24.822
Is this the car?

153
00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:26.059
- Get in!
- I don't think so...

154
00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:27.083
Whatever.

155
00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:29.197
Let's move!

156
00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:30.998
Bro. please let me go.

157
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:33.786
Don't hit me.

158
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.035
Shake him off!

159
00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:00.458
Fallon zhu?

160
00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:02.018
Yes. he is still tackling the robbers.

161
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.248
Send assistance immediately.

162
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:05.533
Reduce casualty to minimal.
do not impact the civilians.

163
00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:09.167
Shoot him down!

164
00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:31.125
The stupid manager.

165
00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:32.528
You think I would give up easily?

166
00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:35.413
You alright. superintendent huang?

167
00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:36.618
Fallon. be brutal...

168
00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:37.708
Beat them to death!

169
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.500
Let's get him!

170
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.809
Fallon. here's your chance.

171
00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:14.833
Give him your death blow!

172
00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:34.414
Stop the car... pullover!

173
00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:35.792
Go to hell!

174
00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:54.831
Wanna be a bad guy!

175
00:10:57.833 --> 00:10:58.851
I'm giving you one last chance.

176
00:10:58.875 --> 00:10:59.660
If you surrender now...

177
00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:01.226
I will consider pleading to
the judge for your commutation.

178
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.115
or you will end up like them.

179
00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:05.015
You are the one that forced me into this!

180
00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:07.664
Stupid cop. you're a dead man!

181
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.912
You've just forced my big bro
to use his masterstroke!

182
00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:21.456
Now you have lost your final chance.

183
00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:25.785
Banana daily cares about everything.

184
00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:27.059
keeping you company 24 hours a day.

185
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.619
And I am bringing this to you live.

186
00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.664
We now see a great looking bank robber

187
00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:33.124
being in a vigorous
hand-to-hand fight with a groom.

188
00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:35.226
You have the support of the
viewers in the whole of Hong Kong!

189
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.911
Yes. boss? What's up?

190
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:38.125
What?

191
00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.364
A lot of people are watching.

192
00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:40.247
have to extend the duration?

193
00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:41.292
Roger that!

194
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:42.868
Let's help each other.

195
00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:43.958
Take it.

196
00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.184
A big hello to the viewers of tomato daily.

197
00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:52.601
You must be desperate to see
what's going on at the scene.

198
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.455
Let's have a look.

199
00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:55.203
A happy and hopeful groom is
having a hand-to-hand fight

200
00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:56.493
with an impoverished robber.

201
00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:57.809
Let's take a look at the groom...

202
00:11:57.833 --> 00:11:58.697
Indulged in love and happiness.

203
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.830
And how about the robber...

204
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:01.327
Really impoverished looking.

205
00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:02.601
Why don't you two keep
fighting for a while.

206
00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:04.825
A lot of people
are watching you live. do you know that?

207
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.035
Hide your stupid bald-head.

208
00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:06.827
Who are you calling baldie?

209
00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:07.705
I am calling you baldie. baldie!

210
00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:08.743
You dare say it again!

211
00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:10.233
Mr robber. how are you feeling now?

212
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:14.947
You son of a bitch!

213
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.520
Mr groom. do you have anything to say?

214
00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:25.167
To hell with it.

215
00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:28.042
Blow through it!

216
00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:29.333
Hurry up!

217
00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:38.708
Banana!

218
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.865
I'm doomed.

219
00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:41.038
Hang in there!

220
00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:41.947
You alright?

221
00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.207
Tomato. thank you for your concern.

222
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:16.414
The situation is quickly heading south...

223
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.393
It will impact the 7 million civilians
of Hong Kong anytime now

224
00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:20.137
heading towards the police headquarters?

225
00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:21.375
Wow. that's quick!

226
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.330
What's going on?

227
00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:23.417
Get out of the way!

228
00:13:26.292 --> 00:13:27.292
Get out of the way!

229
00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:36.948
Are you ok. sir?

230
00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:38.907
Thank goodness. you're not harmed!

231
00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.368
I was so worried for you.

232
00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:41.577
Fallon zhu!

233
00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:43.958
Wait a minute...

234
00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:05.833
Today...

235
00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:10.242
I rushed all the way from shenzhen to
Hong Kong to have our wedding photos taken.

236
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:11.330
And what did you do?

237
00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:14.162
You stood me up.
You were having fun going live.

238
00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:17.518
What choices did I have
when shing's life was at stake...

239
00:14:17.542 --> 00:14:18.559
I couldn't just watch him die.

240
00:14:18.583 --> 00:14:20.039
He is my buddy. and I am also a cop.

241
00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:20.947
What cop?

242
00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:23.309
Are you the only cop in Hong Kong?
Are all the other cops dead?

243
00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:24.448
We have been together
for more than 10 years.

244
00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:26.824
You promised you will
let me be the star for once.

245
00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:27.705
And what happened?

246
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.206
Now I am the laughing stock
of the whole of Hong Kong.

247
00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.573
How can I face the world?

248
00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:31.572
It could be good publicity for you.

249
00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:32.910
Publicity your ass!

250
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.860
You have never even been promoted.

251
00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.158
How can you support my living?

252
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.643
If you can support my living.
I shouldn't have to work anymore.

253
00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:40.373
I keep telling you not to work.

254
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.559
Of course I can support your living.

255
00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:43.119
Who will support me if I don't work?

256
00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:46.667
I'll shut up.

257
00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:47.577
It's okay. speak...

258
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:49.518
- Speak! I am letting you speak.
- No. I don't want to speak anymore.

259
00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:50.201
Speak!

260
00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:51.292
Speak!

261
00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:52.542
Honestly...

262
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:54.365
Why do you want to be an actress?

263
00:14:54.542 --> 00:14:56.783
It's not even a proper job.

264
00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.073
Being an actress of a TV station.

265
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.994
you keep being beat up again and again.

266
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:02.118
Why torture yourself?

267
00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.413
You have only one expression
from beginning to end...

268
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:09.833
What did you say?

269
00:15:10.417 --> 00:15:12.057
Don't force yourself to stay on this job.

270
00:15:13.375 --> 00:15:14.455
One expression?

271
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.993
One expression!

272
00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:23.457
Let me give you 10 expressions...

273
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:27.493
You dare hit me?

274
00:15:27.542 --> 00:15:28.622
You bastard. fallon zhu!

275
00:15:29.042 --> 00:15:29.656
You were the one that hit me.

276
00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:30.768
So you were counting my flaws.

277
00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:32.157
I haven't started on yours.

278
00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:33.914
Ok. let's lay all our cards on the table.

279
00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958
On my mom's 60th birthday.
you jumped into the sea.

280
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.739
I was saving lives.

281
00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:38.643
Saving whom? And what were you wearing
when you came to the party?

282
00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:39.281
Swimming trunks.

283
00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:40.869
It's the underwear I bought for you.

284
00:15:40.917 --> 00:15:42.123
I was so embarrassed.

285
00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:44.351
Do you think you are Superman? And the
earth will stop spinning without you?

286
00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:46.184
You are the one that stopped
the earth from spinning.

287
00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:47.493
What is that supposed to mean?

288
00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:49.533
You are more concerned about
the bad guys than me.

289
00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:50.368
Let me ask you...

290
00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:51.497
When did we meet?

291
00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:52.247
Answer me! Quick!

292
00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:53.292
July 8th. 2006

293
00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:54.243
- what is my favourite colour?
- White.

294
00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:55.452
What's the name of my dog?

295
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.500
Sunny. Dolly. Bobby!

296
00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:58.625
October 7th. 1957

297
00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.851
how come you know that and I don't?

298
00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:00.489
That one doesn't count.

299
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:01.406
Who is my favourite male star?

300
00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:02.322
- Brad Pitt.
- Wrong!

301
00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:03.034
- Gary oldman.
- Wrong!

302
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.948
- Al Pacino.
- Wrong!

303
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.559
It was just last week you said
you liked al Pacino.

304
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:07.163
you've changed your mind in a week?

305
00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:08.072
I don't like him anymore this week.
Is that now allowed?

306
00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:08.989
You are just messing with me.

307
00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:09.656
I am messing with you.

308
00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:10.493
I even want to hit you...

309
00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:11.657
Like right now.

310
00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:13.993
Be careful!

311
00:16:57.792 --> 00:16:59.851
There are more than
30 thousand policemen in Hong Kong.

312
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:02.395
Why did you have to crash the car
into the chief superintendent?

313
00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:04.448
You know he is the not-forgiving kind.

314
00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.783
He told me he wanted you
to be "out of the way".

315
00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.101
I have tried my best to talk him out of it.

316
00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:09.125
Tell me...

317
00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:12.648
You should remember the incident
with Tony and his 2 brothers.

318
00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:15.954
It was at nam sang wai. I had to
fight all three of them single-handedly

319
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.037
and finally smashed the whole organization.

320
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:20.934
I didn't mean to claim credit.
but I did sweat blood on it.

321
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.914
But you also burnt down half the place!

322
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.198
Environmental protection groups
have been

323
00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:25.476
complaining to the
chief superintendent non-stop.

324
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.893
about how you ruin the environment
and killed the birds there...

325
00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:29.477
What about the incident at prat Avenue?

326
00:17:32.792 --> 00:17:36.159
I had to face the enemy alone in the alley.
And I was only given a stupid Baton.

327
00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:38.957
That blond kid was a
national martial arts champion.

328
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.831
I almost died in that fight.

329
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.309
You have mistaken me for somebody else.

330
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:48.992
Don't try to deny it!

331
00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:50.327
That's not me. I'm not him.

332
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:50.955
It's youl!

333
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.434
The only resemblance is that
I'm wearing white - it's you!

334
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:53.976
Why is this happening to
me again and again...

335
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.559
I cracked the case and saved the hostages.

336
00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:56.851
yet you got promoted and I got demoted.

337
00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.851
The badges on my shoulders
are not just mine. the honour is yours too.

338
00:17:58.875 --> 00:17:59.995
Don't take it too seriously.

339
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.456
Now even my wife has left me.

340
00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:06.434
What has become of the world?

341
00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:07.789
I told you not to go after
the second tier TV stars.

342
00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:08.406
They are just gold diggers.

343
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:10.619
Actress is a profession

344
00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:13.450
that brings entertainment to people.

345
00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.184
It is a respectable profession.
Do you understand?

346
00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:16.608
That's still "second tier TV star"!

347
00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:18.917
Anyway.

348
00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:22.137
How long do I have stay in that department?

349
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.750
7 months?

350
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:24.868
7 pm tonight.

351
00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.976
Dinner at fook lam moon restaurant -
to celebrate my promotion.

352
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Don't be late.

353
00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:31.833
Salute!

354
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:37.161
Don't worry about me.

355
00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:38.665
Remember these 3 things...

356
00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.158
Stick with your belief...
Maintain our professional image...

357
00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:42.167
Workout all the time.

358
00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:43.667
Fallon.

359
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:45.615
Staying safe is most important.

360
00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:48.493
Take care everyone... stay safe.

361
00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:50.744
Don't worry. I will take over your cases.

362
00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:51.958
Take care of yourself.

363
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.331
And here's another piece of news -

364
00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:57.748
there is no need to get me
wedding gifts next month.

365
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.411
From now on. we can leave on time!

366
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:11.125
Thank you. madam.

367
00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:14.369
All yours now. sergeant zhu.

368
00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.157
Why do we always spend
our holidays riding bikes?

369
00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:39.607
Can't we go to the spa for a change?

370
00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:42.996
Hey. I heard that the south-Asian gang
is rousing trouble again.

371
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:44.368
Reinstate me quickly.

372
00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:45.708
I am really worried

373
00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:47.073
that our men will be in danger.

374
00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:48.948
Fallon. think about this...

375
00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:51.078
If every time a hero saves the earth.

376
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.411
he has to destroy half the planet to do so.

377
00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.059
has peace been restored in that case?

378
00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:56.683
What are you trying to say? Be specific.

379
00:19:57.083 --> 00:19:59.620
Since you have been transferred.
our colleagues have livened up.

380
00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:00.656
I got into less trouble.
and everybody could

381
00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.828
leave on time and enjoy dinner at home.

382
00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:05.328
The earth has to keep spinning -
don't stand in its way.

383
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.581
See the beautiful trees over here.

384
00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.949
Let's slow down and enjoy the views. Ok?

385
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:13.226
There's no need to rise to the fore
everytime. It's not tour de France. you know?

386
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.990
It's important to go with the flow.

387
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.957
to seek comfort and enjoy life...

388
00:20:18.292 --> 00:20:18.906
No. I'm gonna be sick...

389
00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:19.958
I'm gonna throw up.

390
00:20:22.042 --> 00:20:24.203
Seek comfort and and enjoy life...

391
00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:26.458
Bullshit!

392
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.661
Who will plant the trees?

393
00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:32.832
If no one is constructing.
who will build the roads?

394
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.040
I am not going to back down

395
00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:36.125
go! Go! Go!

396
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.332
Who built this stupid road?

397
00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.831
There is no shame in temporary failure.

398
00:20:52.375 --> 00:20:54.036
Because behind hardwork and stamina.

399
00:20:54.042 --> 00:20:55.873
even occasional setbacks
should be glorified.

400
00:20:57.542 --> 00:20:58.702
I didn't come up with this...

401
00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:00.622
He did.

402
00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:02.873
Jin long quan movement number 4:

403
00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:04.407
"Dragon seeks path"

404
00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:07.664
"dragon whips its tail"

405
00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:09.494
"dragon whips its tail"

406
00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:27.226
Chloe. you've been nominated for worst actress
in golden berries award this year again...

407
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.934
What do you think? Do you feel the need
to work on your acting skills?

408
00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.074
What the heck do you know about acting?

409
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.582
- Keep striving. Chloe.
- Let's talk about your ex...

410
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.870
Has that "jackass of the century"
called you recently?

411
00:21:36.917 --> 00:21:38.327
- In fact...
- Did you call him?

412
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.268
In fact. I don't like to
talk about my love life.

413
00:21:40.292 --> 00:21:41.372
Shall we talk about my work?

414
00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:42.490
In fact. I wish to expand
my career to Japan...

415
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.706
Hey. dodo is over there!

416
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.161
Fallon zhu

417
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.365
Hurry up. fallon zhu.

418
00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:40.538
I have to go out for lunch.

419
00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:41.583
There you go. bro.

420
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.500
Found it.

421
00:22:46.792 --> 00:22:47.656
Is it this one?

422
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.750
Yes.

423
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.368
Great. All set!

424
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:55.951
Stay safe!

425
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I'm going for lunch.

426
00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.244
Happy birthday to me...

427
00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:43.740
Happy birthday to...

428
00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:44.907
Fallon zhu.

429
00:23:57.375 --> 00:23:59.015
What is the most important thing in life?

430
00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.039
Staying safe.

431
00:24:15.792 --> 00:24:18.158
Good evening. boss!

432
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:22.161
Good evening. boss!

433
00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:24.369
Good evening. boss!

434
00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.456
I'm gonna kill you. you bitch!

435
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.244
The contract of tsukiji's management
right transfer will be ready next week.

436
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.912
You old moron had better
sign it like a good boy.

437
00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:49.244
Master...!

438
00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:53.414
Oh. you're here. shimakura.

439
00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.369
Be quiet!

440
00:24:55.875 --> 00:24:57.395
Come here. watch TV and learn Chinese.

441
00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:00.239
Get her to join the opening ceremony
at tsukiji next week.

442
00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:06.289
That's yuji over there.

443
00:25:06.542 --> 00:25:08.902
You mean the one throwing the banana
or the one catching it?

444
00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:09.992
Are you messing with me?

445
00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:11.042
The thrower.

446
00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:13.868
This Japanese guy is one of the

447
00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:15.490
injured people in the bank robbery.

448
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.619
He is also a porn director.

449
00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:21.601
Some blood stasis in his right brain is
causing pressure on certain brain tissues.

450
00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:22.625
It's not fatal.

451
00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:24.588
he's just experiencing temporary
loss of memory.

452
00:25:25.333 --> 00:25:26.333
Hey. this way.

453
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.250
About this case.

454
00:25:28.917 --> 00:25:30.202
the Japanese police has evidence

455
00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:33.158
that he is involved in a
car accident in Tokyo.

456
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.130
They would like to have him
extradited to Japan.

457
00:25:35.292 --> 00:25:37.533
I am putting you in charge of this.

458
00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:40.059
All the documents and air tickets are here.
You will leave day after tomorrow.

459
00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:41.203
So soon? Day after tomorrow?

460
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:43.039
Listen. you fool! The sooner the better.

461
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.118
If you can fix this well.

462
00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.809
I can write a good report
to have you reinstated.

463
00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:46.492
Really?

464
00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:47.976
- Of course.
- I am really counting on you...!

465
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.434
- Here's your chance. fallon.
- I am really counting on you...!

466
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:51.540
I always take good care
of you. you know that.

467
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.286
Why are you running?

468
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.330
What's going on?

469
00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:55.038
Nothing.

470
00:25:55.125 --> 00:25:55.739
Where are you going?

471
00:25:55.792 --> 00:25:56.372
Nowhere.

472
00:25:56.417 --> 00:25:57.417
I'm not done talking.

473
00:25:58.417 --> 00:26:00.203
Sir. we've been looking for you.

474
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.851
You haven't settled the fee
for your medical checkup.

475
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:03.393
Don't worry. he will settle it for me.

476
00:26:03.417 --> 00:26:04.577
Fallon. get it done.

477
00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:05.910
Don't get me into trouble.

478
00:26:06.792 --> 00:26:08.059
I am counting on you to get me back my job.

479
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:09.243
Thank you. shing.

480
00:26:10.292 --> 00:26:11.702
Sir. over here please.

481
00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:12.958
How much is that. nurse?

482
00:26:13.083 --> 00:26:13.993
$58.000 in total.

483
00:26:14.042 --> 00:26:15.962
The charge for hemorrhoidectiomy
has been waived.

484
00:26:29.792 --> 00:26:32.124
Hey!

485
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:34.664
Chloe. what a coincidence...

486
00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:37.083
Fallon zhu?

487
00:26:39.292 --> 00:26:40.972
How come... you've gained a lot of weight?

488
00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:42.125
Have I?

489
00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:44.851
- You have put on a lot of weight!
- Just a little. maybe.

490
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:45.875
Am I really fat?

491
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.581
I almost couldn't recognise you.

492
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.535
I have been transferred

493
00:26:52.042 --> 00:26:52.747
to the evidence room.

494
00:26:52.833 --> 00:26:53.572
You know...

495
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.310
Just sitting there all day...
The longer I sit. the more I eat...

496
00:26:56.375 --> 00:26:57.581
And this is the outcome.

497
00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.318
I will go on diet when I get back.

498
00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:00.875
Where are you going?

499
00:27:01.417 --> 00:27:02.726
I have a job in Japan. How about you?

500
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.750
Me too.

501
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.115
Remember to be careful.

502
00:27:06.167 --> 00:27:07.282
Don't try too hard.

503
00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:07.992
and most importantly...

504
00:27:08.042 --> 00:27:09.042
Stay safe.

505
00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:17.782
That's right... recently

506
00:27:18.417 --> 00:27:19.827
congratulations! Your show...

507
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.036
Has very high ratings. I'm watching too.

508
00:27:24.167 --> 00:27:24.701
Thank you.

509
00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:27.540
Dear passengers. we are about to take off.

510
00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:29.592
Will all passengers be
seated and buckled up.

511
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.240
I have to get back to my seat.

512
00:27:31.292 --> 00:27:32.292
Bye.

513
00:27:33.292 --> 00:27:34.292
Chloe!

514
00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:36.067
Let's meet up for dinner some time.

515
00:27:38.042 --> 00:27:39.042
Miss Chloe...

516
00:27:40.583 --> 00:27:42.073
The plane is about to take off.

517
00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:44.657
This is my friend fallon.

518
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.830
This is my client.

519
00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:48.241
Mr fallon. nice to meet you.

520
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500
Hi.

521
00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:51.368
Ok then. Bye.

522
00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:53.542
Bye.

523
00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:25.684
Good afternoon! This is inspector endo.
He is in charge of the extradition.

524
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:26.988
And I am Maggie. the interpreter

525
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.113
- mr fallon. please.
- Thank you.

526
00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:35.625
Sorry...

527
00:28:51.958 --> 00:28:52.958
Did you fart?

528
00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:54.205
No.

529
00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:55.208
Was it you?

530
00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:56.542
Not me.

531
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:59.059
Not me. I haven't eaten anything
that will make me fart.

532
00:28:59.083 --> 00:29:00.198
What nasty smell!

533
00:29:00.292 --> 00:29:01.498
He pooped in his pants!

534
00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:02.656
I don't want to go to the toilet.

535
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.230
- No problem?
- I will take him there.

536
00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.542
Oki

537
00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:07.768
sergeant zhu. would you like a drink?

538
00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:08.792
- My treat.
- Sure!

539
00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:10.663
What about you?

540
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:11.833
I'm fine.

541
00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.125
Good. Thanks!

542
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.583
Sergeant zhu. is this
your first visit to Japan?

543
00:29:18.708 --> 00:29:19.708
No.

544
00:29:20.542 --> 00:29:21.893
You came with your girlfriend before?

545
00:29:21.917 --> 00:29:22.917
Yes...

546
00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:25.125
But we broke up.

547
00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:26.833
It's already past tense.

548
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:27.830
I'm sorry.

549
00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:28.875
It's okay.

550
00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:31.661
I don't want to go. I don't need to poop.

551
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.110
I know. I was the one that farted.

552
00:29:37.583 --> 00:29:38.583
Go.

553
00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:43.490
You're doomed!

554
00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:47.667
Oh dear!

555
00:29:48.458 --> 00:29:49.618
Don't come to me!

556
00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:51.990
My neck...

557
00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:54.692
In fact. being an interpreter
is just a part time job for me.

558
00:29:55.708 --> 00:29:57.664
Actually my real dream job is...

559
00:29:58.125 --> 00:29:59.740
Being a tap-dancer.

560
00:30:03.125 --> 00:30:04.205
But I've changed my mind.

561
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.750
Now...

562
00:30:06.375 --> 00:30:08.255
I'm more interested in
being a helicopter pilot.

563
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:11.625
That's great!

564
00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:16.625
Oh. a nudie!

565
00:30:17.375 --> 00:30:18.865
He ran away! Mr fallon!

566
00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:19.917
Grab him...!

567
00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:22.161
My neck...

568
00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:24.788
You ok?

569
00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:26.458
My lousy luck!

570
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.070
How does this lousy luck follow me
from Hong Kong to Tokyo?

571
00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:39.073
Hey!

572
00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:40.708
Stop!

573
00:30:45.208 --> 00:30:46.493
The car in front - pull over.

574
00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:48.373
Mr endo... wait!

575
00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:50.954
The fugitive at the back -
please put on some pants!

576
00:30:51.375 --> 00:30:54.572
Shit!

577
00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:56.703
That's my car!

578
00:31:01.917 --> 00:31:02.976
Hello. superintendent huang.

579
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.241
I am Maggie.
interpreter for the Japanese police.

580
00:31:05.792 --> 00:31:06.952
I'm Chinese.

581
00:31:07.458 --> 00:31:09.289
I studied in university of Tokyo.

582
00:31:09.708 --> 00:31:11.559
No. not university of Beijing.
it's university of Tokyo!

583
00:31:11.583 --> 00:31:12.583
Excuse me...

584
00:31:12.833 --> 00:31:13.868
I'm 22.

585
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.490
Excuse me...

586
00:31:15.542 --> 00:31:18.830
Where is the best onsen? I like onsens too!

587
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:21.535
Superintendent huang.

588
00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:22.330
What's up. fallon?

589
00:31:22.417 --> 00:31:24.499
Very good. Everything is going fine.

590
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:28.660
Everything is going fine.

591
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.018
That's great.
Did you get the stuff I asked for?

592
00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:32.122
No problem - face masks.
slimming pills. all on me...

593
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.080
Hey!

594
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.325
But there is this one thing...

595
00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:36.708
That's...

596
00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:39.243
The suspect has got away.

597
00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:40.583
He's got away?

598
00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:42.958
Shit!

599
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:43.955
- Listen to me...
- How could he

600
00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:44.697
have run away for no reason?

601
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:45.364
Don't worry...

602
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:46.493
The suspect is only 150 pounds.

603
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.684
how could you let him get away?

604
00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:49.226
Do you want me to keep you company
in the evidence room?

605
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.518
How could you put me in such trouble?

606
00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:51.076
How could you?

607
00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:53.059
The Japanese police are very capable
and determined to get him back.

608
00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:53.993
They promised me

609
00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:56.369
that they will get him back
within the next 2 hours.

610
00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:58.059
I will call you right
away if there's any news.

611
00:31:58.083 --> 00:31:59.963
You had better pray that
they find the suspect.

612
00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:00.827
- Otherwise. you won't even keep your job
- No problem...

613
00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:01.663
In the evidence room!

614
00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:02.873
This is how good guys are repaid...

615
00:32:02.875 --> 00:32:04.831
I will call you right
away if there's any news.

616
00:32:07.542 --> 00:32:08.542
Hello?

617
00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:12.494
Ouch... chief.

618
00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:14.535
thanks for the effort.

619
00:32:14.792 --> 00:32:15.497
Mr fallon. sit down.

620
00:32:15.583 --> 00:32:17.183
- Come on. come on...
- Did you find him?

621
00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:20.625
Sit down.

622
00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:21.667
Did you find him?

623
00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:23.327
He is gone.

624
00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:24.375
What?

625
00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:27.353
He's gone? What do you mean he's gone?

626
00:32:27.417 --> 00:32:28.657
Before tomorrow...

627
00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:30.619
No... I cannot go back to Hong Kong.

628
00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:31.614
We will bring him back...

629
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:32.580
Trust the Japanese police.
we are very very strong...

630
00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:33.322
No! I don't understand your english.

631
00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:35.661
I will be demoted. I don't
want to sweep the street.

632
00:32:36.417 --> 00:32:38.268
I don't understand
what you are saying. interpreter...

633
00:32:38.292 --> 00:32:40.408
Maggie... come here...

634
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.330
- They can't find him. what do we do now?
- Your bag.

635
00:32:44.042 --> 00:32:45.042
Hey. mr endo...!

636
00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:49.476
They say they've lost the suspect.

637
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.114
Why did you lie to me?

638
00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:51.167
Damn you.

639
00:32:51.208 --> 00:32:51.947
How did you know?

640
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.285
I told him.

641
00:32:53.417 --> 00:32:54.702
Let me warn you. fallon zhu.

642
00:32:54.708 --> 00:32:55.367
I know where you live.

643
00:32:55.375 --> 00:32:55.989
Sir. listen to me...

644
00:32:56.042 --> 00:32:57.373
If you lie to me. that's bye-bye for you.

645
00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.956
I will update you if there's any news.

646
00:32:59.542 --> 00:33:00.406
I promise.

647
00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:02.393
If I can't find him. I will not
come back to Hong Kong. Ok?

648
00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:03.782
I got my bro Thor to help you.

649
00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:04.934
- If you need anything. let him know.
- Sure. No problem.

650
00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:06.268
- If you don't have enough money. ask him for it.
- I'll take care of it.

651
00:33:06.292 --> 00:33:07.953
Remember his name. it's Thor.

652
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Thank you. officer.

653
00:33:20.458 --> 00:33:21.573
This is screwed up.

654
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:23.789
Mr endo. this is not my bag!

655
00:33:26.333 --> 00:33:27.618
Excuse me...

656
00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:31.117
Fallon zhu?

657
00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:32.167
Who are you?

658
00:33:32.292 --> 00:33:33.292
Thor!

659
00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:37.667
Hello.

660
00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:39.706
We finally got him.

661
00:33:40.792 --> 00:33:41.372
Good.

662
00:33:41.542 --> 00:33:42.372
Bring him here.

663
00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:44.073
Sure. See you later.

664
00:33:48.167 --> 00:33:49.623
My fart can come in handy sometimes.

665
00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:50.667
It's so stinky!

666
00:33:56.917 --> 00:33:59.829
- You mean there?
- The Chestnut stall is mine.

667
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:02.288
Is that iron palm?

668
00:34:02.417 --> 00:34:03.156
Ganbade!

669
00:34:03.417 --> 00:34:04.748
I will work hard!

670
00:34:06.875 --> 00:34:07.875
It's not hot.

671
00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:11.207
They are never hot. It's
fake. just for show.

672
00:34:11.292 --> 00:34:13.452
As long as we make money.
who cares? Everybody's happy.

673
00:34:13.917 --> 00:34:15.498
I live upstairs. Let's go.

674
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:19.409
How can they do that?

675
00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:21.183
You don't need to do business like that.

676
00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:24.198
What brought you to Japan?

677
00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:25.333
I will tell you later.

678
00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:27.057
I have been here for more than ten years.

679
00:34:27.292 --> 00:34:29.492
Your boss dirty shing
and I were buddies in the academy.

680
00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:31.703
I used to be a cop in Hong Kong too.

681
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.615
My nickname was hard boiled.

682
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:34.743
Your nickname...

683
00:34:36.083 --> 00:34:37.289
Is very famous in the field.

684
00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.033
Dirty shing told me everything about you.

685
00:34:40.083 --> 00:34:41.226
You don't need to hear it from him.

686
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.810
Recently. I make the headline everyday.

687
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.083
It's a great place.

688
00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:48.107
It's a good thing to meet you today.

689
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.018
How about returning the
200 thousand yen that he borrowed from me.

690
00:34:50.042 --> 00:34:51.042
What 200 thousand yen?

691
00:34:52.417 --> 00:34:54.578
He said you would pay me back for him.

692
00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:57.101
Last time when he came to Japan with
a girl. I paid for all his expenses.

693
00:34:57.125 --> 00:34:58.125
That's not right.

694
00:34:58.208 --> 00:34:59.914
He said I can borrow money from you.

695
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.410
You know I have lost my luggage.

696
00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:03.783
Damn! He is definitely
messing with us both.

697
00:35:06.125 --> 00:35:07.740
There's no point jumping up and down.

698
00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:09.018
You've still got to pay me back the money.

699
00:35:09.042 --> 00:35:10.703
No. I need to use the toilet.

700
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:11.455
Where's the toilet?

701
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.205
Why didn't you say so earlier?

702
00:35:12.292 --> 00:35:13.292
In the corner over there.

703
00:35:15.125 --> 00:35:16.535
Welcome.

704
00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:20.577
Welcome.

705
00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:25.417
Boss.

706
00:35:26.208 --> 00:35:27.118
One beer please.

707
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:28.208
Sure.

708
00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:50.289
This place is closed today.

709
00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:52.363
I am here to look for the owner.

710
00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:54.665
All other people. get out!

711
00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:06.123
Welcome.

712
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.910
Go get the sake. quick!

713
00:36:13.292 --> 00:36:15.533
I know you are here for the gambling money.

714
00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:18.248
Please give me a few more days.

715
00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.226
You lost betting on the soccer games.
you gotta pay for it.

716
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.250
5 days...

717
00:36:24.458 --> 00:36:25.458
4 days...

718
00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:26.989
3 days...

719
00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:29.158
Right now!

720
00:36:33.708 --> 00:36:34.893
Please take the interest first.

721
00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:35.952
Are you messing with me?

722
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.680
You wanna close down your business. right?

723
00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:39.198
Can you be a bit more rational?

724
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.143
How can I make money
when you mess up my business?

725
00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:43.167
And how can I pay you back
when I can't make money?

726
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.786
Give me the money now. idiot!

727
00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:45.910
You idiot!

728
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.661
You can take my life.
but there is no money.

729
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.581
Tear this place down!

730
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.250
Go for it!

731
00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:03.809
Have some chestnuts. everyone. my treat.

732
00:37:03.833 --> 00:37:05.073
It's delicious.

733
00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:11.664
Please give us a chance.

734
00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:13.038
Who the heck are you?

735
00:37:13.083 --> 00:37:14.323
What are you doing here?

736
00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:16.414
Bastard. you can't hit him.

737
00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:17.726
Only I can hit him.
you have no right to do that!

738
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.750
Let's talk.

739
00:37:21.042 --> 00:37:22.122
Go to hell!

740
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.750
What do you want?

741
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.250
What are you doing?

742
00:37:31.042 --> 00:37:32.042
I'm sorry...

743
00:37:46.208 --> 00:37:48.415
You guys can't even fix a kid.

744
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.956
Don't hit him anymore.

745
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.833
That's all I have. Please take it for now.

746
00:37:54.042 --> 00:37:55.373
It's not about money anymore.

747
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.161
Stop fighting!

748
00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:08.289
All of you. stand by the wall.

749
00:38:08.542 --> 00:38:09.702
And show me your ID card.

750
00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:16.782
Who the heck are you?

751
00:38:39.292 --> 00:38:40.292
Shit.

752
00:39:09.917 --> 00:39:12.117
I have to lose some weight
when I get back to Hong Kong.

753
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.536
Out of the way...

754
00:39:46.958 --> 00:39:49.449
- Hey...
- Come...

755
00:39:56.292 --> 00:39:57.292
You okay?

756
00:39:57.583 --> 00:39:58.601
- Fine.
- The cops are here.

757
00:39:58.625 --> 00:39:59.745
Just in time. Let's go down.

758
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.705
Tiger. come back.

759
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.617
These cops. they always arrive
when the fight is over.

760
00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.667
You watch.

761
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.250
Over to you.

762
00:40:17.958 --> 00:40:18.492
Let's go.

763
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.750
You're kidding me.

764
00:40:27.375 --> 00:40:28.660
That's enough...

765
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:37.748
Director. so we finally meet.

766
00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:41.161
I didn't expect to be on
the same flight with you.

767
00:40:41.417 --> 00:40:44.159
Not sure if that's my lucky day
or your luckless day.

768
00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:47.075
The film you were shooting that day
was quite a form of art...

769
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.832
No!

770
00:40:50.292 --> 00:40:51.292
Very good...

771
00:40:51.458 --> 00:40:53.119
Cast your emotions on your son.

772
00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.453
A little more emotion from the heart.

773
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.034
Action!

774
00:40:56.208 --> 00:40:58.745
Don't! I will not give up my son.

775
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.740
Sounds like somebody is here...

776
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:05.699
Do you know how much one
gram of this is worth?

777
00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:12.907
What are you doing?

778
00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:13.993
What's going on?

779
00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:15.607
What have I got to do with anything?

780
00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:17.994
Wait!

781
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.366
Apart from the camera.
is there any other evidence?

782
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.115
I don't know.

783
00:41:30.292 --> 00:41:32.578
Let's play a game.

784
00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:34.323
You like baseball?

785
00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:41.245
Quickly. talk!

786
00:41:48.625 --> 00:41:49.865
You can't hide.

787
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.490
Wait.

788
00:41:55.042 --> 00:41:55.906
I remember...

789
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
I remember my mum.

790
00:41:57.875 --> 00:41:58.955
Bullshit!

791
00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:01.875
Stop!

792
00:42:03.958 --> 00:42:05.664
I put it in the rice.

793
00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:08.101
Why are you hitting me?
I'm telling the truth.

794
00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.240
Bullshit!

795
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.115
I clearly saw the cops

796
00:42:15.125 --> 00:42:16.740
and the gangsters were on the same side.

797
00:42:17.542 --> 00:42:18.873
What has become of this world?

798
00:42:19.083 --> 00:42:22.371
Where can you find the dirtiest cops?
The cops in Japan are the dirtiest.

799
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.018
They are on the same side from the start.

800
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:24.747
Nobody cares?

801
00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.873
We have to operate our business everyday.

802
00:42:26.875 --> 00:42:28.991
There is no other way
except tolerating them.

803
00:42:29.208 --> 00:42:30.323
Business?

804
00:42:30.958 --> 00:42:33.870
The cost for repairing this mess
is worth paying the debt three times.

805
00:42:34.417 --> 00:42:35.532
You're such a busy-body.

806
00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:37.818
Thanks to your undesirable friend!

807
00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:39.163
What are you looking at?

808
00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.518
You think you've become
a hero for saving my life once?

809
00:42:41.542 --> 00:42:43.248
If you love saving lives? Be a life-guard!

810
00:42:43.625 --> 00:42:45.185
You're stopping the world from spinning

811
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.115
tiger...

812
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:48.034
Come here! What are you doing?

813
00:42:48.083 --> 00:42:50.199
No. I want to learn kung-fu
from uncle fallon.

814
00:42:50.375 --> 00:42:51.239
You don't have to.

815
00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:53.143
I saw your kung-fu skills just now.
You are one heck of a fighter.

816
00:42:53.167 --> 00:42:54.167
He is a good fighter.

817
00:42:54.208 --> 00:42:55.038
Damn fighting...

818
00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:56.893
Just now you just let
people slap you around.

819
00:42:56.917 --> 00:42:57.957
Why didn't you fight back?

820
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.059
How can you claim you're a man?

821
00:42:59.083 --> 00:42:59.617
Madam...

822
00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:00.497
You shut up!

823
00:43:00.583 --> 00:43:01.583
Go!

824
00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:02.205
Go!

825
00:43:02.417 --> 00:43:03.452
Go!

826
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.250
Tiger. come back here...

827
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.250
Bye.

828
00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:14.583
Auntie...

829
00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.202
This is from uncle Thor.

830
00:43:53.958 --> 00:43:56.199
Tiger is her nephew.

831
00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:58.248
His parents were killed in a car accident.

832
00:43:58.333 --> 00:44:00.226
So she wanted to stay in Japan
to take care of tiger.

833
00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.768
And wouldn't go back to Hong Kong with me.

834
00:44:01.792 --> 00:44:03.828
She also said since
she could not give me a family.

835
00:44:03.958 --> 00:44:04.958
we should just break up.

836
00:44:05.875 --> 00:44:08.207
You know women never mean what they say.

837
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.850
So I just stayed here with her and waited.
It's been 10 years now.

838
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.101
Why do you hold a cigarette
in your mouth and not light it up?

839
00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:17.241
She said I look really cool like this.

840
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.995
But then again she is afraid
I would die from smoking.

841
00:44:20.292 --> 00:44:22.783
So I always just hold it
in my mouth and never light it.

842
00:44:23.417 --> 00:44:24.782
I know your nickname...

843
00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:26.414
Jackass of the century!

844
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.768
How can you believe the
stupid banana daily?

845
00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:32.874
Never ever believe it.

846
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:36.208
I've seen a lot of your
celebrity girlfriend's performance.

847
00:44:36.833 --> 00:44:38.949
Her acting skills...

848
00:44:39.292 --> 00:44:40.652
Different people. different views.

849
00:44:40.917 --> 00:44:42.077
But she is quite pretty.

850
00:44:42.875 --> 00:44:45.275
A girl with such a pretty face has
no reason to fall for you.

851
00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:46.782
Hey. “What?

852
00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:47.917
Really...

853
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.280
Let me show you some real stuff.

854
00:44:51.917 --> 00:44:52.917
This is me...

855
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.830
8 packs.

856
00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:54.739
Several years ago in prat Avenue.

857
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.768
I fought that blond kid
single-handedly with just a Baton.

858
00:44:56.792 --> 00:44:57.893
You should have heard of that before.

859
00:44:57.917 --> 00:44:59.282
That's impressive...

860
00:44:59.417 --> 00:45:00.417
Time for bed.

861
00:45:01.208 --> 00:45:01.788
Sergeant zhu.

862
00:45:01.833 --> 00:45:04.540
The Japanese police
finally found yuji at Tokyo bay.

863
00:45:13.292 --> 00:45:14.292
Mr fallon.

864
00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:18.375
- Good morning. thanks for the effort.
- What's up?

865
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.500
This is your answer.

866
00:45:34.083 --> 00:45:35.523
A dead body floating in Tokyo bay...

867
00:45:37.083 --> 00:45:38.368
You don't think that's unusual?

868
00:45:42.542 --> 00:45:45.579
We found cocaine on him.

869
00:45:46.292 --> 00:45:47.372
From our preliminary investigation.

870
00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:49.455
the cause of death
was drowning due to drug overdose.

871
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.286
We found his suicide note.

872
00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.490
He committed a crime.

873
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.206
That's why he fled to Hong Kong.
but then was extradited back here.

874
00:45:57.208 --> 00:45:58.823
He committed suicide to escape punishment.

875
00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:00.539
Mr endo said it is suicide.

876
00:46:06.667 --> 00:46:07.281
That's it?

877
00:46:07.667 --> 00:46:09.749
Japanese are actually very long-winded.

878
00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:11.042
Ok.

879
00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:12.118
If this person wanted to commit suicide.

880
00:46:12.167 --> 00:46:13.077
he could have done it in Hong Kong.

881
00:46:13.083 --> 00:46:14.434
Why did he wait till he
was back in Japan to do it?

882
00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:16.073
There's a Chinese saying...

883
00:46:16.708 --> 00:46:19.040
When the leaves turn yellow
in Autumn. they will fall off.

884
00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:20.489
The fallen leaves will
return to their roots.

885
00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:21.327
Home sweet home.

886
00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:23.582
His whole body is bruised but not swollen?

887
00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:26.374
The body has been found less than 8 hours.

888
00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:29.659
Plus the water temperature
was close to freezing point.

889
00:46:29.917 --> 00:46:31.498
That's why the body is not swollen.

890
00:46:31.958 --> 00:46:33.539
It's freezing cold...

891
00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:35.518
Dude. he was beaten up so badly that
his eyes were crossed and lips protruded.

892
00:46:35.542 --> 00:46:37.268
There's gotta be some injustice
and grievance somewhere.

893
00:46:37.292 --> 00:46:39.624
Drop the case. Okay?

894
00:46:40.583 --> 00:46:41.583
Go back to Hong Kong.

895
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Goodbye.

896
00:46:43.875 --> 00:46:45.456
Alright.

897
00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:47.083
Thank you.

898
00:46:47.917 --> 00:46:48.917
Goodbye.

899
00:46:49.583 --> 00:46:50.583
Mr endo

900
00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:52.875
your hat...

901
00:46:53.208 --> 00:46:54.448
Get a new one.

902
00:46:54.542 --> 00:46:55.542
Don't touch it!

903
00:46:56.083 --> 00:46:57.809
So the Japanese police
have found him at last.

904
00:46:57.833 --> 00:46:59.619
Why do you care if he's dead or alive.

905
00:46:59.708 --> 00:47:00.708
Go back to Hong Kong.

906
00:47:00.792 --> 00:47:02.018
But you have to give me
back the money first.

907
00:47:02.042 --> 00:47:02.952
Don't always talk about money.

908
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.160
You are hard boiled.

909
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:05.452
Never give up so easily.

910
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.020
Do you know just how many yujis
there are in the whole of Tokyo?

911
00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:13.851
You've already knocked down more than
30 doors in one morning.

912
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.206
That's enough.

913
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.780
Is this really that guy's house?

914
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.309
Let's take a quick look and leave.

915
00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:19.333
I'm starving.

916
00:47:22.875 --> 00:47:24.331
I'm sure I can find some lead.

917
00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:33.615
There's gotta be a clue somewhere.

918
00:47:36.167 --> 00:47:37.167
Did you find anything?

919
00:47:38.083 --> 00:47:39.368
I found a banana.

920
00:48:04.125 --> 00:48:05.331
What did I tell you...

921
00:48:06.292 --> 00:48:08.829
Don't give up so easily.

922
00:48:15.417 --> 00:48:16.577
Find something to hit it!

923
00:48:16.667 --> 00:48:17.827
That's animal abuse.

924
00:48:18.417 --> 00:48:19.532
Get him off...

925
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.832
Quick... hit him

926
00:48:27.167 --> 00:48:28.873
doggie... get out!

927
00:48:31.292 --> 00:48:33.203
Don't make me do it the hard way.

928
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.310
Get something to hit him with. Hit now!

929
00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:42.408
Why did you hit me instead of the dog?

930
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.161
He's got my butt.

931
00:48:50.167 --> 00:48:51.327
Good boy...

932
00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:04.039
Stay...

933
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.365
Stay...

934
00:49:09.792 --> 00:49:10.792
Bad dog!

935
00:49:12.792 --> 00:49:13.872
Thor. are you okay?

936
00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:14.702
I'll live

937
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.741
but my butt is messed up.

938
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:20.285
How long have you been a cop?

939
00:49:20.333 --> 00:49:21.333
More than ten years.

940
00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:23.498
And you are still in this state
after so many years?

941
00:49:24.792 --> 00:49:25.792
Why?

942
00:49:26.458 --> 00:49:27.038
For other people.
ten years in the police force

943
00:49:27.042 --> 00:49:28.828
should at least be inspector grade.

944
00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:31.903
Different people have different
aspirations. I'm happy now.

945
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Uncle fallon.

946
00:49:33.542 --> 00:49:34.327
It's fixed.

947
00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:35.375
Smart boy...

948
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.726
This cell phone had been soaked in water.

949
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.018
Most of the files that could be
retrieved are saved in there.

950
00:49:40.042 --> 00:49:42.122
But there is still a video file
that can't be opened.

951
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.990
I need some more time to fix it.

952
00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:47.373
Isn't this tsukiji?

953
00:49:47.792 --> 00:49:49.792
I'm familiar with that place.
I can take you there.

954
00:50:15.333 --> 00:50:17.226
Thanks taiko drum group.
for that great performance.

955
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:18.690
Let's give them a round of applause.

956
00:50:18.833 --> 00:50:21.713
May I invite the organizer of the event.
mr shimakura to give his speech.

957
00:50:26.417 --> 00:50:27.076
Chloe.

958
00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:29.824
Isn't that... your...

959
00:50:29.875 --> 00:50:30.875
Yes.

960
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.760
She does look prettier
in person than on TV.

961
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.036
We are on a job. Please be professional.

962
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.500
Let's go.

963
00:50:40.542 --> 00:50:45.241
The special guest today... miss Chloe song.

964
00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:10.707
Hasten up. why are you wasting time?

965
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.411
Hurry up. load the fish in the car.

966
00:51:12.458 --> 00:51:13.868
Load it up there!

967
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.230
One fish is missing. where did it go?

968
00:51:16.917 --> 00:51:18.373
Go find it.

969
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:28.585
How come I'm getting
a little high from eating it?

970
00:51:31.958 --> 00:51:33.243
What fish is this?

971
00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:41.583
There's the fish!

972
00:51:49.292 --> 00:51:50.998
This is delicious...

973
00:51:55.625 --> 00:51:58.332
Hold it there. you bastard!

974
00:51:59.125 --> 00:52:00.490
Stop!

975
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:22.785
Are you okay. Thor?

976
00:52:22.833 --> 00:52:23.833
What happened?

977
00:52:23.917 --> 00:52:24.917
Why did they beat you up?

978
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.250
Get down.

979
00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:08.375
Thor.

980
00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.125
Come on!

981
00:54:25.833 --> 00:54:26.868
Thor! Wait for me!

982
00:54:29.083 --> 00:54:30.448
Ready...

983
00:54:45.375 --> 00:54:46.080
You ok?

984
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.784
Wake up.

985
00:54:47.125 --> 00:54:47.739
Ok.

986
00:54:47.792 --> 00:54:48.792
You wanna fight. huh?

987
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Come on.

988
00:54:50.042 --> 00:54:51.248
What are you doing?

989
00:54:51.292 --> 00:54:53.012
- Grandpa. let me handle this.
- Fallon zhu!

990
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.412
Come on.

991
00:54:56.458 --> 00:54:57.618
- Fallon zhu!
- Come!

992
00:54:57.708 --> 00:54:59.664
What are you doing? Why are you here?

993
00:54:59.708 --> 00:55:02.370
I'm sorry. everyone.
There's no need to panic.

994
00:55:02.417 --> 00:55:06.080
That's the fatty that
was messing with us at kabukicho.

995
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:07.785
- Chloe. we were beaten up.
- I'm on a job.

996
00:55:07.792 --> 00:55:08.792
What are you doing?

997
00:55:08.833 --> 00:55:10.101
- These are all Japanese gangsters.
- What do you want?

998
00:55:10.125 --> 00:55:10.955
They are all triads!

999
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.833
Police! Somebody help me... somebody...

1000
00:55:15.542 --> 00:55:17.032
Are you responsible for this?

1001
00:55:17.333 --> 00:55:18.618
He almost killed my grandfather!

1002
00:55:18.667 --> 00:55:20.077
You and this bullshit.

1003
00:55:20.375 --> 00:55:21.415
I'm gonna call the police.

1004
00:55:21.458 --> 00:55:22.573
I am Hong Kong police.

1005
00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.448
You're a bad guy. I'm a good guy.

1006
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.518
I don't care what you say.

1007
00:55:25.542 --> 00:55:26.748
Can somebody call the police?

1008
00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:27.867
Chloe!

1009
00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:30.954
I know who you are. Just
get out of my town.

1010
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.351
You think because you look like
Nicholas tse. you can get out of this.

1011
00:55:32.375 --> 00:55:33.643
If we're in Hong Kong.
I would have arrested you already.

1012
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:34.667
Moshi moshi

1013
00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:35.875
wait...

1014
00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:36.622
I'm sorry.

1015
00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:38.123
Chloe... listen to me.

1016
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.330
You listen to me.

1017
00:55:39.792 --> 00:55:41.953
He is my boss. I'm on a job here.

1018
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.240
- He is a gangster.
- I know!

1019
00:55:43.292 --> 00:55:44.247
- He's a gangster.
- I'm just here to work.

1020
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:45.786
I have bottom lines!

1021
00:55:46.292 --> 00:55:48.226
This is my first time
doing a performance overseas.

1022
00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.393
When will you be happy? When nobody
wants to hire me for a job anymore?

1023
00:55:50.417 --> 00:55:51.893
I don't want anything to happen to you.

1024
00:55:51.917 --> 00:55:52.656
Just hear me out one last time...

1025
00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:53.809
Why should I hear you out one last time?

1026
00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:56.073
Why can't you hear me out one last time?
Can you do that?

1027
00:55:56.167 --> 00:55:58.749
I always listen to you.
I always give in to you.

1028
00:55:58.833 --> 00:56:00.573
I don't need you to give in to me.

1029
00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:03.664
What I need is respect.

1030
00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:05.375
Chloe...

1031
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:07.643
- Leave now. I'm working here.
- Alright.

1032
00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:09.373
- I beg you. leave now.
- Alright!

1033
00:56:09.917 --> 00:56:10.872
Look. because we are friends...

1034
00:56:10.917 --> 00:56:12.157
I just want to tell you this...

1035
00:56:12.583 --> 00:56:14.699
I don't want you to be involved
with these bad guys.

1036
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.455
Okay?

1037
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:16.364
You think about it.

1038
00:56:16.625 --> 00:56:17.625
Thor. let's go...

1039
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:18.865
Thor!

1040
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.282
He misses you...

1041
00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:22.289
- What are you doing here?
- Endo-San...

1042
00:56:22.375 --> 00:56:25.492
- Mr higashino... good to see you!
- Triads...!

1043
00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:27.869
Mr shimakura. how are you?

1044
00:56:28.958 --> 00:56:30.559
- You are in on it together.
- Get in the car...

1045
00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:33.700
Understood... I'll leave.

1046
00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:35.243
I understand too.

1047
00:56:36.333 --> 00:56:40.076
This guy is so troublesome.

1048
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:42.434
You're making everybody work overtime.

1049
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:43.664
Start the car...

1050
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.911
I'm so sorry... sorry.

1051
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.116
Our apologies everyone
for this inconvenience.

1052
00:56:50.167 --> 00:56:53.705
Everything's fine now...

1053
00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:09.243
That was a troublesome guy...

1054
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.130
Mr endo said the higoshina group
has decided not to press charges on you.

1055
00:57:16.292 --> 00:57:17.292
About the drugs...

1056
00:57:17.583 --> 00:57:19.448
The Japanese police have known it all along

1057
00:57:19.708 --> 00:57:21.289
but there's no evidence.

1058
00:57:21.833 --> 00:57:22.913
Do you believe me?

1059
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.241
It doesn't matter. This is Japan.

1060
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.500
I'm sorry.

1061
00:57:31.667 --> 00:57:32.873
Thanks for bailing us out.

1062
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Cut the crap.

1063
00:57:40.042 --> 00:57:42.454
Am I really a 250-pound cop that

1064
00:57:44.292 --> 00:57:46.157
stops the earth from spinning?

1065
00:57:49.167 --> 00:57:50.393
What I've always believed to be right

1066
00:57:50.417 --> 00:57:51.452
are actually wrong.

1067
00:57:53.042 --> 00:57:54.578
Am I Superman?

1068
00:57:54.875 --> 00:57:55.875
Or am I the monster?

1069
00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:01.448
From now on. we can leave on time!

1070
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:05.053
If you want to save lives. be a life-guard!

1071
00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:06.351
How could you put me in such trouble?

1072
00:58:06.375 --> 00:58:07.851
Do you want me to
sit with you in the evidence room?

1073
00:58:07.875 --> 00:58:09.285
Go... Hong Kong!

1074
00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:11.643
We have been together for
more than 10 years...

1075
00:58:11.667 --> 00:58:13.282
More than 10 years!

1076
00:58:14.042 --> 00:58:17.034
I just want to have a stable life.

1077
00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:18.288
Can you give me that?

1078
00:58:18.333 --> 00:58:21.226
There is much more in life that you can do.
you don't have to be an actress.

1079
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.250
Right?

1080
00:58:22.375 --> 00:58:23.364
And you have only
one expression from beginning to end...

1081
00:58:23.375 --> 00:58:24.831
Don't force yourself to go on.

1082
00:58:25.708 --> 00:58:26.288
He is a gangster...

1083
00:58:26.333 --> 00:58:29.133
When will you be happy? When nobody
wants to hire me for a job anymore?

1084
00:58:30.917 --> 00:58:33.408
We have been together for
more than 10 years...

1085
00:59:01.583 --> 00:59:02.698
I have to talk to you.

1086
00:59:03.667 --> 00:59:04.684
Can you give us the space?

1087
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:05.708
Sure.

1088
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:31.255
Don't just walk away like this...
Explain to me.

1089
00:59:32.042 --> 00:59:33.393
What don't you understand?
It's plain and simple.

1090
00:59:33.417 --> 00:59:36.178
I have to sell the restaurant.
then move back to Hong Kong with tiger.

1091
00:59:36.583 --> 00:59:37.583
So we break up again?

1092
00:59:37.792 --> 00:59:39.623
We have broken up years ago. fatty!

1093
00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:41.309
I've been waiting for you
for more than ten years.

1094
00:59:41.333 --> 00:59:43.494
And all I get is a "breakup"?

1095
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:44.726
You are doing very well now.

1096
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:45.990
I see you are back in business.

1097
00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:47.268
You ruined my restaurant two days ago.

1098
00:59:47.292 --> 00:59:49.123
And just today. you
wrecked the fish market.

1099
00:59:49.917 --> 00:59:51.202
You wanna play "hard boiled"?

1100
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:52.786
Why don't you sell the Chestnut stall.

1101
00:59:53.125 --> 00:59:54.809
then put some panties over your head
and pretend to be Superman.

1102
00:59:54.833 --> 00:59:56.448
Do not insult my previous career.

1103
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.500
I was hard boiled.

1104
00:59:57.542 --> 00:59:58.893
- I wasn't pretending.
- Alright. I don't want to talk about it.

1105
00:59:58.917 --> 01:00:00.059
The conclusion is - I
will sell the restaurant

1106
01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:01.268
and pay back the money I owed you.

1107
01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:02.828
Then we don't owe each other anything.

1108
01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:04.268
You think you just owe me money?

1109
01:00:04.292 --> 01:00:05.309
You owe me much more than that

1110
01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.268
why do you keep saying things
the other way round?

1111
01:00:07.292 --> 01:00:08.976
Ok. let's solve our
issues once and for all.

1112
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.490
Let's do it. Bring it on!

1113
01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.393
You always boast about
how good your chestnuts are.

1114
01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:13.281
Bullshit.

1115
01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:15.616
That blonde guy never
takes his job seriously.

1116
01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:16.577
If I haven't been watching
him all the time.

1117
01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:18.143
you think your chestnuts
would be so delicious?

1118
01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:19.202
And don't you think

1119
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:20.850
everybody loves to play mahjong with you

1120
01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:22.268
the Japanese women on this street

1121
01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:23.934
refused to come unless
I paid them everyday to do so.

1122
01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:25.698
They say you have the worst attitude.

1123
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.559
- People line up to play mahjong with me.
- Stop quarrelling.

1124
01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:29.369
Have you considered my feelings?

1125
01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:30.532
What feelings?

1126
01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:31.667
Alright.

1127
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Don't do this.

1128
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.250
Okay?

1129
01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.208
What's the matter?

1130
01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:40.618
I've been there.

1131
01:00:42.292 --> 01:00:44.412
Excuse me for being nosy.
I really have to say this...

1132
01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:45.827
This idiot

1133
01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:48.244
is obviously crazily in love with you.

1134
01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:49.726
He may be a bit too fat. a bit too ugly...

1135
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.750
No offence.

1136
01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:51.867
But really...

1137
01:00:52.042 --> 01:00:53.042
He's one of a kind!

1138
01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:54.125
And as for you?

1139
01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:56.414
I don't think you have no feelings for him.

1140
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.518
Or you wouldn't have helped him
with his Chestnut business.

1141
01:00:58.542 --> 01:00:59.452
When he was beaten up the other day.

1142
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.831
you looked so worried.

1143
01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:02.208
Everyone could see that.

1144
01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:03.292
Right?

1145
01:01:05.417 --> 01:01:06.417
I just wanted to say...

1146
01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:08.823
In this world...

1147
01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.950
No one can wait around for another person
to love him for more than ten years.

1148
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:19.750
I am so right.

1149
01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:26.417
Remember that.

1150
01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:28.162
Fighting is part of the fun.

1151
01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:29.031
Do not give up on Thor.

1152
01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:30.493
Hey. don't leave.

1153
01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:31.667
You take care of them.

1154
01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:33.708
Never give up.

1155
01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:44.117
Right!

1156
01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:45.351
You really sold the restaurant?

1157
01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:46.160
At such a cheap price too.

1158
01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:47.208
That's quick!

1159
01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.289
What happened?

1160
01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.125
Try harder!

1161
01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:09.208
Hey.

1162
01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.208
What do you want now?

1163
01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:13.702
Let's go for some ramen.

1164
01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:35.907
Cheers.

1165
01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:37.490
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1166
01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:38.782
Thank you.

1167
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:47.614
Chloe.

1168
01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:48.625
Cheers.

1169
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.035
Cheers!

1170
01:02:52.708 --> 01:02:56.075
Faster...

1171
01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:56.997
Like in the movie?

1172
01:02:57.042 --> 01:02:58.042
Like this.

1173
01:02:58.083 --> 01:02:59.083
Cheers...

1174
01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:07.167
Chloe.

1175
01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:12.157
I have something to say to you.

1176
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.643
We haven't seen each other for so long...

1177
01:03:13.667 --> 01:03:14.702
Let's not talk tonight.

1178
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.536
Let's just drink. Okay?

1179
01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:17.917
- Good.
- Come...

1180
01:03:19.417 --> 01:03:20.702
I have something to say to you.

1181
01:03:21.292 --> 01:03:22.532
About that night...

1182
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.059
I've been really thinking about
the things you said.

1183
01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.083
Which night?

1184
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:27.073
That "publicity your ass" night.

1185
01:03:27.292 --> 01:03:28.518
Oh. the "publicity your ass" night.

1186
01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:30.157
I know my limitations.

1187
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.114
Don't overthink it.

1188
01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:33.283
I know I don't have acting talent.

1189
01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:34.869
That's crazy.

1190
01:03:35.667 --> 01:03:37.908
You are the most popular
actress these days.

1191
01:03:38.125 --> 01:03:40.457
The entertainment field needs
pretty girls like you...

1192
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.240
With a nice body

1193
01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:45.159
and great acting skills.

1194
01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.125
You have so many fans.

1195
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.582
I know you paid them to be my fans.

1196
01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.240
Well. not every single time.

1197
01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:53.623
I was just kidding...

1198
01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:55.163
Come on. let's drink up...

1199
01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:56.568
Did I say something wrong again...

1200
01:04:02.417 --> 01:04:04.123
The truth is we love each other so much.

1201
01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:07.098
But why do we keep fighting all the time?

1202
01:04:07.167 --> 01:04:08.167
We didn't really fight.

1203
01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:10.744
We were just communicating.

1204
01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:15.115
Shall we start again?

1205
01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.244
We broke up and got back together...

1206
01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:20.536
Then broke up and
got back together again and again.

1207
01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:22.463
The problem is as long as
you are still a cop...

1208
01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:24.453
I would feel very insecure.

1209
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.864
And when I feel insecure.

1210
01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.195
- I will quit.
- I lose my temper.

1211
01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:33.744
- I will quit.
- Stop fooling around!

1212
01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:34.792
I will quit.

1213
01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:36.532
I can start a business like this.

1214
01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:38.661
My two hands and legs are healthy. Why not?

1215
01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:40.667
Right?

1216
01:04:41.292 --> 01:04:42.292
You promise?

1217
01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:43.492
I promise.

1218
01:04:43.542 --> 01:04:44.327
It's a deal!

1219
01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:45.375
It's a deal!

1220
01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:46.953
Deal. okay?

1221
01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:48.452
- Sure.
- Keep your promise!

1222
01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:49.542
Come.

1223
01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:50.367
Cheers.

1224
01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:50.955
Cheers.

1225
01:04:51.292 --> 01:04:52.292
Cheers!

1226
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.615
Cheers!

1227
01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.453
Cheers!

1228
01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:00.448
Cheers!

1229
01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:04.282
Cheers!

1230
01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:27.917
Everybody okay?

1231
01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:30.949
I'm alright.

1232
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.331
Is everybody okay?

1233
01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:33.625
Thank you.

1234
01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:36.792
You okay?

1235
01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.333
Is everybody okay?

1236
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Good.

1237
01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:50.333
Everyone's alright.

1238
01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:54.249
How come there's an earthquake?

1239
01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:55.982
We should never come to Tokyo again.

1240
01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:58.083
Are you hurt?

1241
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.500
Are you?

1242
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:01.750
Where are you hurt?

1243
01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:03.703
Did you mean what you just said?

1244
01:06:07.042 --> 01:06:08.042
Yes. I did.

1245
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
You were lying.

1246
01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:15.078
You can't quit.

1247
01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:17.823
You won't be happy if you are not a cop.

1248
01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.327
In this world.

1249
01:06:25.042 --> 01:06:26.248
there are lots of people

1250
01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:28.828
that need good cops like you.

1251
01:06:31.042 --> 01:06:32.248
But I am not one of them.

1252
01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:08.830
Hello.

1253
01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:09.955
Fallon. what have you done?

1254
01:07:10.083 --> 01:07:12.950
Corpse floating in Tokyo bay...
Melee in tsukiji market.

1255
01:07:13.292 --> 01:07:14.907
When were you gonna tell me all this...
After you wrecked the Tokyo tower?

1256
01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:15.622
No. listen to me shing.

1257
01:07:15.792 --> 01:07:17.272
- Shing...
- I'm not listening to you.

1258
01:07:17.542 --> 01:07:18.782
Come back to Hong Kong at once.

1259
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:21.449
Do you want the earth to
totally stop spinning?

1260
01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:22.583
Moron.

1261
01:07:23.583 --> 01:07:24.914
Did you hear what I said?

1262
01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.493
Listen to me. shing huang.

1263
01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:28.869
I'd rather be a moron

1264
01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.809
than be sorry for the rest of my life.

1265
01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:31.833
And also.

1266
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.537
nobody can stop the earth from spinning.
Do you understand?

1267
01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:36.625
You dare talk back to me?

1268
01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:39.577
And you are the moron.

1269
01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:44.248
Boss. our informer said.

1270
01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:49.744
what are you waiting for then?

1271
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:55.289
Let me handle the tsukiji market issue.

1272
01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:57.498
I can fix it. grandpa.

1273
01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:00.664
Just sign on this.

1274
01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:02.788
Shimakura. what are you doing?

1275
01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.118
It's ok.

1276
01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:19.956
Crazy bitch!

1277
01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:21.160
Bastard! Sign it!

1278
01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:22.452
You'd better sign it for me.

1279
01:08:22.542 --> 01:08:24.078
Shimakura. you have gone too far.

1280
01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:44.994
Sign it now...!

1281
01:09:00.042 --> 01:09:01.282
Hurry up!

1282
01:09:05.667 --> 01:09:06.667
Sign it...!

1283
01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:50.999
Good...

1284
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.206
Afternoon...!

1285
01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:58.664
I've come to say goodbye.

1286
01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:07.739
Come here!

1287
01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:08.792
You stupid bitch!

1288
01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:11.077
Help!

1289
01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:19.535
Help!

1290
01:10:29.417 --> 01:10:31.999
You know. you're only here
because my grandfather loves you.

1291
01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:34.373
But now he's dead...

1292
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.083
Bastard.

1293
01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:40.476
Don't you know I'm a good actress?

1294
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.081
I'm a professional actress.

1295
01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:44.184
How dare you called me a bitch.

1296
01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:45.414
Bastard.

1297
01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.893
Uncle Thor. do you know
where uncle fallon is?

1298
01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:57.393
I have been looking for
him for a while now.

1299
01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:58.417
No. I haven't seen him.

1300
01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:00.039
I fixed that video file.

1301
01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:03.755
If there's nothing else. I will go
back to help auntie with her delivery.

1302
01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:04.833
Give this to her.

1303
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.250
Ok.

1304
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:14.539
Do you know how much a
gram of this is worth?

1305
01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:15.583
Yes.

1306
01:11:16.292 --> 01:11:17.953
Hey. what are you doing?

1307
01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:22.333
Boss. you're back.

1308
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Fallon.

1309
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.250
where are you?

1310
01:11:33.542 --> 01:11:34.809
We managed to open the video file.

1311
01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:37.073
It really contains evidence
of their criminal activities.

1312
01:11:38.667 --> 01:11:39.667
Where's my jacket?

1313
01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:42.292
Ganbade.

1314
01:11:44.292 --> 01:11:45.407
Hey. ganbade!

1315
01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:46.994
Why did you take my phone?

1316
01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:49.914
With this phone I'm gonna be rich!

1317
01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.411
I cook chestnuts for you everyday...

1318
01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:55.743
You bastard!

1319
01:11:56.167 --> 01:11:57.373
Speak Chinese!

1320
01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:01.875
Try harder!

1321
01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:08.205
Charisma.

1322
01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:09.823
The phone contains criminal evidence
of the higashino group.

1323
01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.434
With that. we won't need to
sell the restaurant anymore.

1324
01:12:11.458 --> 01:12:12.458
Run!

1325
01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:15.143
The bitch has got the evidence.

1326
01:12:15.167 --> 01:12:16.327
Go to hell!

1327
01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:49.786
The phone and your gambling debt.

1328
01:12:50.292 --> 01:12:52.283
Hand over to us now.

1329
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.333
Charisma. you go.

1330
01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:07.292
Go!

1331
01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:19.081
Fry... fry...

1332
01:13:47.917 --> 01:13:48.531
Charisma.

1333
01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:49.322
Are you alright?

1334
01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.369
I'm fine. I'm hard boiled...

1335
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.580
How are you?

1336
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.956
Wait!

1337
01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:04.453
It's you again.

1338
01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:10.914
- Thor.
- I'm fine...

1339
01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.698
Just got stabbed...

1340
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.500
What are you doing?

1341
01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:18.042
I thought...

1342
01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:19.373
If I light up a cigarette.

1343
01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.893
I will look real cool
even if I were to die.

1344
01:14:20.917 --> 01:14:22.657
Men that don't smoke are the coolest.

1345
01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.248
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1346
01:14:27.958 --> 01:14:28.572
Charisma.

1347
01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:29.625
What do you want to say?

1348
01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:32.663
I think...

1349
01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:34.308
You had better call an ambulance for me.

1350
01:14:36.042 --> 01:14:37.242
I will make them pay for this.

1351
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:43.365
No one can be spared.

1352
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Come on...

1353
01:16:55.417 --> 01:16:56.417
Sir.

1354
01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:57.239
You've arrived at the right time.

1355
01:16:57.292 --> 01:16:58.156
I know. I know.

1356
01:16:58.208 --> 01:16:59.434
There was a big fight out there.

1357
01:16:59.458 --> 01:17:02.780
- No problem. not to worry.
- There's a big fight...

1358
01:17:02.833 --> 01:17:04.994
Everything is normal. Let's wrap it up.

1359
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.500
Hey!

1360
01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:11.542
Stop!

1361
01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:12.747
Such a trouble-maker...

1362
01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:17.578
Who do you think you are?

1363
01:17:18.042 --> 01:17:19.532
Are you Superman? No.

1364
01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:20.789
You are little monster.

1365
01:17:20.833 --> 01:17:21.833
Pocket monster!

1366
01:17:24.333 --> 01:17:25.243
You're the monster.

1367
01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:26.498
No! You're the monster.

1368
01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.225
He's got to be involved in yuji's death.

1369
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.784
What?

1370
01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.083
Really?

1371
01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:32.083
You and shimakura

1372
01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.073
are in collusion.

1373
01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:36.662
You were a triad member
right from the start.

1374
01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:38.664
Do you have any evidence?

1375
01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:40.833
You!

1376
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.490
Get back to Hong Kong!

1377
01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:43.868
This is Japan.

1378
01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.476
Sooner or later.
you will pay for this. It's Karma.

1379
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.220
Then before Karma hits me. let me tell you.

1380
01:17:47.958 --> 01:17:49.638
I was the one that planned out everything.

1381
01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:51.914
I was the one that farted in the car.

1382
01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.158
I was the one that
handed yuji over to shimakura.

1383
01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:56.324
Do you think you are
Bruce Lee reincarnated?

1384
01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:58.873
Have you seen "way of the dragon"?

1385
01:17:58.875 --> 01:17:59.409
What are you talking about?

1386
01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:00.743
Bruce Lee is like this.

1387
01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.243
You look nothing like him.

1388
01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:06.456
Bruce Lee didn't wear a wig.

1389
01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:09.365
I'm gonna report you to the supervisor.

1390
01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.911
What are you filming?

1391
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.957
You idiot interpreter. I hired you

1392
01:18:15.167 --> 01:18:17.328
because it is beneficial to me.

1393
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.785
Stop doing meaningless things.

1394
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.830
You are fired!

1395
01:18:19.875 --> 01:18:21.081
I quit!

1396
01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.039
Ouch...

1397
01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:25.687
- I hate you!
- Don't you try to leave.

1398
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.250
Stop!

1399
01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:33.083
That way.

1400
01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:35.990
You asshole!

1401
01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:39.542
Quch...!

1402
01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.122
Come on...

1403
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.786
You little bastard!

1404
01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:45.417
Stop!

1405
01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:46.748
Yeah. you keep running!

1406
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Stand still!

1407
01:18:54.792 --> 01:18:57.078
Oh my...

1408
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.750
Karma...

1409
01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:09.417
Chloe. where are you?

1410
01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:10.868
Sorry to disappoint you.

1411
01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:11.997
it's shimakura.

1412
01:19:12.625 --> 01:19:13.865
I want the phone.

1413
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.785
If you don't get your ass over here.

1414
01:19:15.792 --> 01:19:18.204
you're gonna see your girlfriend
fall off the Tokyo tower.

1415
01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:26.790
As long as she stays safe...

1416
01:19:29.667 --> 01:19:30.667
Here.

1417
01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:37.333
Chloe-San!

1418
01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:41.667
Chloe-San!

1419
01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:45.160
Chloe-San!

1420
01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:08.698
Mr fallon.

1421
01:20:09.542 --> 01:20:11.157
I'm glad you got my invitation.

1422
01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:14.657
I've reserved this place for you.

1423
01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:16.205
What you want is here.

1424
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.615
You bastard!

1425
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.500
Fallon!

1426
01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:31.781
Fallon!

1427
01:20:31.833 --> 01:20:32.948
Fallon. don't die.

1428
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:33.785
Don't you die!

1429
01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:35.289
Are you okay?

1430
01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.115
I don't know what I'll do without you.

1431
01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:38.072
From now. on I promise

1432
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.559
I won't force you to watch my shows.

1433
01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:41.059
I won't make you give money to my mom.

1434
01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:41.947
What did you want to say?

1435
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.661
Say it!

1436
01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:44.572
You are kneeing on...

1437
01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:45.625
My private part.

1438
01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:48.078
I'm s 0 rry 2

1439
01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:49.159
boss.

1440
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.831
I thought you were dying.

1441
01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:54.369
I'm lucky enough the bullet
just scratched the surface.

1442
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.500
Chloe-San.

1443
01:20:56.458 --> 01:20:57.823
I am very disappointed in you.

1444
01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.866
What do you see in this
fat bastard anyways?

1445
01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:01.909
What?

1446
01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:05.496
What do you see in this fat ugly bastard?

1447
01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:06.364
I'm fat?

1448
01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:07.542
You say he's fat?

1449
01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:09.323
I like fat guys. so?

1450
01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:10.034
Yes!

1451
01:21:10.167 --> 01:21:10.747
Yes!

1452
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:11.455
Look at you...

1453
01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:12.873
You're like

1454
01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:14.494
a little toothpick.

1455
01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:16.032
Yes. little toothpick.

1456
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:17.455
A little toothpick!

1457
01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:18.583
Yes. little toothpick.

1458
01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:27.119
I don't know why you do this to me.

1459
01:21:28.042 --> 01:21:29.623
I'm a Japanese yakusa

1460
01:21:30.708 --> 01:21:32.289
and you're from Hong Kong.

1461
01:21:33.292 --> 01:21:36.455
Why are you in my life?

1462
01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.125
Go to hell!

1463
01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:40.032
Are you bored of living?

1464
01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:53.447
Chloe!

1465
01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:54.792
Are you alright. Chloe?

1466
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:01.198
Be careful!

1467
01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:27.083
Chloe!

1468
01:23:01.667 --> 01:23:03.203
Come on...!

1469
01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:04.708
Stupid bitch.

1470
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Come.

1471
01:24:00.292 --> 01:24:01.577
Hurry...

1472
01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:17.331
Everybody at the restaurant!

1473
01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:19.289
Please surrender immediately.

1474
01:24:19.542 --> 01:24:21.498
The police will be in force shortly

1475
01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:23.039
and you will be arrested!

1476
01:24:24.667 --> 01:24:27.124
Fallon. I flew in to Japan to back you up.

1477
01:24:27.167 --> 01:24:27.781
Don't worry.

1478
01:24:27.833 --> 01:24:29.184
We will do this together as a team. bro!

1479
01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:30.744
You idiot. you're finally here.

1480
01:24:36.958 --> 01:24:37.947
Maggie babe.

1481
01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:39.809
why is the Japanese police
so efficient this time?

1482
01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:41.559
Sergeant zhu uploaded all the
criminal evidence on the Internet.

1483
01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:44.905
You know... CNN. YouTube.
Facebook. wechat...

1484
01:24:45.042 --> 01:24:46.498
Everyone can see it.

1485
01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:49.659
You know the Japanese.
they really like the face.

1486
01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:51.490
But I really like my life.

1487
01:24:51.583 --> 01:24:52.288
Can you slow down please?

1488
01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:54.255
I'd like to stay alive
for an onsen bath later.

1489
01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:56.625
Watch out!

1490
01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:06.875
Fallon!

1491
01:25:07.292 --> 01:25:08.292
Catch.

1492
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:18.750
Come on.

1493
01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:34.792
Fallon.

1494
01:25:51.375 --> 01:25:52.375
Fallon.

1495
01:25:53.667 --> 01:25:54.326
Fallon.

1496
01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.500
Come on.

1497
01:25:55.792 --> 01:25:57.032
Come here.

1498
01:26:07.542 --> 01:26:08.782
Be careful. fallon!

1499
01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:16.618
Catch this. fallon!

1500
01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:28.531
Fallon.

1501
01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.428
beat the hell out of that little toothpick.

1502
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:42.750
Come on!

1503
01:27:32.542 --> 01:27:33.497
Look behind you.

1504
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:34.500
Fallon!

1505
01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:10.790
I'm dead!

1506
01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:16.869
Shing. are you okay?

1507
01:28:29.708 --> 01:28:31.369
Did you get your license from taobao?

1508
01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:32.657
Taobao?

1509
01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:34.198
I got my license yesterday.

1510
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.684
Fallon. how much longer
are you gonna be fighting?

1511
01:28:37.708 --> 01:28:38.618
Quick. get it over with!

1512
01:28:38.667 --> 01:28:40.077
I'm having a lot of troubles here.

1513
01:28:58.292 --> 01:28:59.292
Wait!

1514
01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:04.490
You lose. man!

1515
01:29:04.542 --> 01:29:07.864
I'm a toothpick...

1516
01:29:07.917 --> 01:29:08.917
Please let me go.

1517
01:29:20.417 --> 01:29:21.417
Watch out!

1518
01:29:36.917 --> 01:29:37.917
He works for me.

1519
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.286
Ok ok... everything's fine..

1520
01:30:24.542 --> 01:30:25.827
Stop talking.

1521
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:36.785
What?

1522
01:30:36.958 --> 01:30:37.743
You told me to stop talking.

1523
01:30:37.958 --> 01:30:40.478
Of course I know that.
I was the one that asked you not to talk.

1524
01:30:43.208 --> 01:30:44.948
So what did you want to say?

1525
01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:47.993
So it is my fault.

1526
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.706
Maybe not every time.

1527
01:30:56.208 --> 01:30:57.208
That's enough!

1528
01:30:57.375 --> 01:30:57.955
Fallon.

1529
01:30:57.958 --> 01:30:59.823
The Japanese cops will be here soon.

1530
01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:01.240
If they catch you.

1531
01:31:01.417 --> 01:31:02.873
you will be interrogated
till the next century.

1532
01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:03.893
and you'll never return to Hong Kong.

1533
01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:04.917
Let's get going!

1534
01:31:08.833 --> 01:31:09.413
Let's go.

1535
01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:10.072
Onsen. here we come!

1536
01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:11.208
Okay

1537
01:31:14.917 --> 01:31:16.782
it's ok...

1538
01:31:18.458 --> 01:31:19.493
Don't be afraid!

1539
01:31:20.042 --> 01:31:21.748
Just hold on to me tightly!

1540
01:31:23.458 --> 01:31:25.574
I will never let go again this time!

1541
01:31:31.167 --> 01:31:32.623
As long as we stay safe!

1542
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.455
Not too tight.

1543
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.036
Don't choke me. Chloe.

1544
01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:38.323
Don't choke me!

1545
01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:42.265
I see now that apart from straight lines.

1546
01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:45.450
there are shapes like curves.
circles and squares in this world.

1547
01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:46.740
As in our everyday lives.

1548
01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:49.205
we shouldn't use just one way
to solve every problem.

1549
01:31:49.292 --> 01:31:51.372
As long as we know how to forgive
and respect others.

1550
01:31:51.542 --> 01:31:52.657
fat or thin

1551
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:53.910
doesn't make any difference.

1552
01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.288
It's like water.

1553
01:31:55.875 --> 01:31:56.976
Whatever shape you put it in.

1554
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.706
so will be the shape of water.

1555
01:31:59.458 --> 01:32:02.495
Did the 250-pound fallon zhu
invent this metaphor?

1556
01:32:02.667 --> 01:32:03.952
Does it matter?
