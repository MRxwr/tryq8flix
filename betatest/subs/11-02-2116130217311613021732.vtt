Ding Yi. can we save the last two?

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:30.125
With the fire and unstable air currents

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.958
I can hover one minute max.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.875
Gao Qian. what's the plan?

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:35.041
Let me down. I'll get them.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.541
Move off and come back when I say.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.583
The oil rig is about to collapse.

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:42.000
You sure about this?

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.333
No problem. Everyone?

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:44.291
All good!

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:45.458
All good!

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:48.875

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.416
Two-three-zero. two-two-zero.

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.041
Rescue boat. leave now!

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:14.708
Bai. look after the captain!

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:15.625
On it!

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:18.625

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.750
Gao Qian reporting -

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:21.666
Captain Ding is injured.

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:23.250
Huo Da. take over!

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.000
Co-pilot Huo Da taking over.

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:27.291
Sorry. Captain.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.041
One more. stay strong...

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.250
You okay. Huo Da?

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.458
Captain Gao.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.791
we can't get over the rig to let you down.

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.000
I'll jump out here.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.458
Huo Da. fly over the flames.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.625
Slow down when I say.

00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:52.791
I'll let the winch swing me over.

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:56.416
Keep an eye on me.

00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:57.916
For sure.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:07.291
Huo Da. go!

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:14.333
Down five.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.000
Down three.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:30.708
Five...

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:32.416
Four...

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.958
Three...

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.166
Two...

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:36.583
One...

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:37.708
Slow down!

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.583
Gao Qian reporting -

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:07.958
Two wounded. One's stable.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.541
One has a compound leg fracture.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:10.750
Look at me. Deep breath.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.875
Breathe in. breathe out.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.958
Breathe in.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.541
Huo Da. we're at three o'clock.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.625
Come in between the cranes.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.875
Copy!

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.125
C'mon.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.041
Come down. now!

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:43.250
Hurry!

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:11.125
Huo Da!

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:20.583
Three-one. behind you!

00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:44.583
Captain Gao!

00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:47.083
Gao Qian. are you okay? Update your situation!

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.416
I'm okay.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.250
Gao Qian. we can't fly over.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.500
Stay put. I'll figure it out!

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.041
Don't go! Come back!

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.458
Come back!

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:10.416
Hurry!

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.958
Help me lift him. let's go.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:18.750
C'mon.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.083
Let's go.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.250
Come. lie down.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.375
Put this on. Give me your hand. hurry.

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:44.916
Take this. I'll contact you.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.250
I'll contact you.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.750
Three-one. come to the tower.

00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.291
Huo Da.

00:07:58.208 --> 00:07:59.416
you can do it.

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:10.583
Three-one. I'm halfway.

00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:28.500
Huo Da. stay focused.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.166
I'll read the data.

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:33.875
Tower height three-three-zero.

00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.791
down another hundred.

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:44.000
Three-one. I'm ten meters from the top.

00:08:55.541 --> 00:08:59.458
Four-four-zero. four-three-five.

00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:02.750
Is this the one?

00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.541
Yes. it is!

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:07.541
Captain Gao. we're nearly there!

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:09.500
Forward four...

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.791
Forward three...

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:17.958
Forward two...

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:19.791
Forward one...

00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.291
We're here!

00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.166
Steady!

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:41.916
Go!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.208
Huo Da... left the team.

00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:08.375
He felt he'd come up short.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:12.333
And Ding Yi?

00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:18.416
His decision I can understand.

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.208
I can't possibly let you leave the team.

00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.666
You were assigned the task urgently. no one would blame you.

00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.916
If it weren't for Captain Ding

00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:31.291
I'd have got all of us killed.

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:34.291
These four years

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.500
I was just lucky.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:42.833
Look at Lucky.

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:47.541
Remember the day we pulled her up from the ocean?

00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:50.416
We were all very amazed -

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.041
how did she manage to survive the sea?

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.541
It wasn't because she was lucky that she found us.

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.833
It was her persistence that got her the lucky chance.

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.666
Remember.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.291
it's not luck that gives out chances.

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:20.875
Captain Gao.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
in the helicopter there should be none who hesitates.

00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:32.791
Ding Yi -

00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.625
It was my fault.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.583
Gao Qian. don't say that.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.208
It's not about you.

00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.291
- No. - But...

00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:44.666
Have you ever considered

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:48.291
why our team works so well together?

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.583
It's because we trust you.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.416
Twenty years of flying

00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:57.875
but this time really scared me.

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:05.291
Once fear comes. it doesn't leave.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Eight...

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:35.541
Nine...

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:36.916
Ten...

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.083
Eleven...

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:39.583
Twelve...

00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:41.000
Thirteen...

00:12:41.666 --> 00:12:42.375
Fourteen...

00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:57.291
Slow down.

00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:02.291
Congcong. you can meet a lot of friends during summer school.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:04.500
and they say the choir here is really good.

00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.916
Does that sound good?

00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:06.666
Yeah.

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:13.541
Men. we're meeting our new pilot. Fang Yuling.

00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.583
So tidy up when we get back.

00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:17.041
Okay.

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.666
We're getting a female pilot?

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.541
Don't act up.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:26.125
No way. Like you. I'm a perfect gentleman.

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:28.666
You're full of it.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:31.416
Just don't embarrass us.

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:35.000
Race to the finish!

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.541
Here I come. Ms. Captain!

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.666
What a steady hand!

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:34.958
Reporting to Chief Pan.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.250
The helicopter performs very well.

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:37.750
Normal function. no problems.

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:39.500
Great. Let me introduce you.

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:41.583
This is Gao Qian. the main winchman.

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:43.333
He's also our operations captain.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:43.958
Hello.

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.625
This is Yuling's co-pilot Liu Bin.

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:46.500
Hi.

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.750
Winch operator Zhao Cheng.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.083
Second winchman...

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:52.416
Hi. Bai Yang. Can't wait to work together.

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:53.333
Hello.

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:55.625
Gao Qian. work with Yuling on the schedule.

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.541
Yes. sir.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.958
This way.

00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:01.625
Hello.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.458
Captain Gao. I've read all your team's reports.

00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:07.541
You've done well. A high number of successful missions.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.500
Thank you. They're a good team.

00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:14.583
But your method has problems.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.208
What problems?

00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:18.791
After the oil rig incident.

00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:21.416
you lost two men. Isn't that a problem?

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.416
You don't have to go to such extremes.

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:29.625
What if there's no other way?

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.833
In rescue work. self-confidence is good.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.791
But you have to think of others too.

00:15:35.666 --> 00:15:36.916
You saved those people.

00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:39.125
But if the team doesn't survive. what then?

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:42.208
I decided to go in.

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.291
I know what I can do and what I can't.

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:48.708
I understand you rely on your intuition.

00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:51.000
I rely on my instrument panel.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.833
It tells me what I can do.

00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:53.750
and what I can't.

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:54.958
I understand this too.

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:57.291
Captain Gao.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.958
we share a goal. it's to save lives.

00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:03.500
You save people. I look after the team.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.166
So we need to work together.

00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:09.041
Our motto is to give hope to others...

00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:11.000
But not at the cost of your own life.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.666
If that's your view. what can I say?

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:18.333
But saving few more lives. isn't it worth it?

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:28.291
You can relax. you can sigh

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:33.375
But don't let defeat make you cry

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:37.625
Or unable to eat your rice

00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:43.625
Every step you take. step on high

00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:48.708
Success is yours if hard you try

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.041
Next.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.250
Gao Yicong.

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:19.125
Quiet.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.041
Gao Yicong. what's wrong?

00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:46.916
Why'd you copy my hairstyle?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.625
I didn't.

00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.750
Mama says wasting food is wrong.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:57.333
You'll be punished for it.

00:17:57.458 --> 00:17:58.833
It's not that I'm greedy.

00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:01.500
I don't want you to be punished.

00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:05.458
Eat it and go. I want to be alone.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.333
Who wants to be alone?

00:18:07.458 --> 00:18:08.291
Look at you.

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:11.583
Alone on the slide. no one even says hello.

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:14.625
If I don't play with you. no one will.

00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:15.416
Also.

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:18.916
No one wants to play with losers.

00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:21.416
No one plays with you either.

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:23.458
That's different.

00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:26.416
I don't like to play with winners.

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.250
What are you looking at?

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:32.000
I'm looking at my mom.

00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:34.833
Your mom? Where?

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.750
She died.

00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:40.791
Died? That's sad.

00:18:40.916 --> 00:18:45.916
You don't really think souls end up there. do you?

00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.250
My grandma says it's true.

00:18:48.583 --> 00:18:50.333
Ever been on a plane?

00:18:51.916 --> 00:18:52.708
I have.

00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:55.541
Up there I saw the sun and clouds.

00:18:55.833 --> 00:18:57.541
But I didn't see your mom.

00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:00.916
You should get your dad to find a new mom.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.458
She'd love you a lot.

00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:03.708
A new mom?

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.208
Alright. let's move on to another case of failed operation.

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:13.541
A two hundred foot fishing vessel

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:17.583
was stranded 60 miles offshore. causing a breach in the hull.

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.375
Twenty people on board.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.958
In the end only ten were rescued.

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:24.166
What was the problem?

00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:27.500
It's how they lifted out the victims.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:31.125
There was a strong breeze. with heavy waves juddering the ship.

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:36.000
There were also antennas. trawl nets and poles on the deck.

00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:40.208
The horrid conditions must have taken them a lot of time

00:19:40.208 --> 00:19:43.708
keeping the helicopter and ship together and delayed the rescue.

00:19:43.708 --> 00:19:44.541
No.

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:48.875
they overestimated the S92A's load and wind resistance

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:51.375
and didn't drop the life rafts at once.

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.208
Or else it would've saved time

00:19:54.291 --> 00:19:57.166
getting on and off the helicopter.

00:19:57.166 --> 00:20:00.083
But there was another complication.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.833
Just ten minutes before the boat sank

00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:05.500
they discovered aside from the twenty crew

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.458
there were eight more trapped in the cargo hold.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:13.125
The ten crew waiting in the helicopter were in medical shock

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.625
and had to be sent away immediately.

00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.541
What should we do next?

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:24.708
We could get in the passenger cabin from the deck.

00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:26.375
through the engine room and into the hold.

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:29.958
The ship was tipping over 30 degrees.

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:33.000
it would be hard to open the hatch.

00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:35.625
We couldn't make it in ten minutes.

00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:39.166
I think Bai is along the right lines.

00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:44.250
The hull breach was closest to the hold.

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:47.666
we could consider getting in from there.

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:48.875
That's right.

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:51.416
I could bring blasting tools and spare air tanks.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.041
get in there via the breach

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.625
and bring them out.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.791
Didn't we say the ten crew needed immediate aid?

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:00.583
We couldn't just wait for you.

00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:01.916
You could send them away.

00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:04.625
I'd bring the rest to the rafts and wait.

00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:06.958
That's impossible in such a nasty condition.

00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:09.250
Your suggestion is way too risky.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.708
Plus I'd got to be responsible for your safety.

00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:13.291
I'd be in good control.

00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:15.333
I am the pilot. I have the power to forbid action.

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:18.000
You are the pilot. so you should trust your team.

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:21.041
Alright. alright. That's it.

00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:25.250
We're the ones with our lives on the line.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.583
If she can't be flexible.

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:29.458
how can we work together?

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:31.875
I get your point.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:35.875
But she's our pilot. We all have to adapt.

00:21:36.291 --> 00:21:38.333
She's done lots of missions.

00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:42.000
That was just talk. On the job. I'm sure she's more open.

00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:43.708
Stop overreacting. okay?

00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:44.916
I'm not overreacting.

00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:48.250
We've all done over hundreds of missions.

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:51.666
We know how to judge a situation.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.416
But when we're flying with her

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.666
she has to agree to our plan. right?

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.583
The truth is -

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:04.958
we two know what works and what doesn't.

00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:07.541
So. it's like this -

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:10.208
if you do it. we say yes.

00:22:10.208 --> 00:22:12.166
If we say yes. you do it. Right?

00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:14.916
Captain Gao -

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.958
let's invite Captain Fang along tonight.

00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:18.750
It'll be our welcome to the team.

00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:22.000
Sure. Who'll ask her?

00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:28.458
I'm afraid if I go I'll ruin your chances.

00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:32.458
Yuk. wet!

00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:33.708
Can I come in?

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:35.375
Sure.

00:22:42.125 --> 00:22:43.500
Are you all free tonight?

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:44.791
I'm inviting you to dinner.

00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:45.916
I'm free.

00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:47.083
The two of us can go.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.791
The others are busy.

00:22:50.833 --> 00:22:52.333
There's a big beach party.

00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:53.666
Come with us.

00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:55.708
Sure. sounds good.

00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:00.833
What? It's true.

00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:19.791
She's like a different person.

00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:24.708
This is her when she's off-duty.

00:23:55.666 --> 00:23:58.833
Onwards. Gao Yicong!

00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:01.250
We're here.

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:05.083
Dad. I beat Uncle Cheng!

00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:07.250
That's amazing.

00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:08.916
What. you can't even beat my son?

00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:11.250
He learned to fight from you.

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:12.958
Congcong. you fight well.

00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:14.083
Cheng's always teasing me.

00:24:14.083 --> 00:24:15.083
Hit him for me. okay?

00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:16.000
- I didn't - Sure.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.916
Hit him again...

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:32.208
Congcong. what's up?

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:35.458
Auntie Yuling. you're a pilot?

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:37.125
Yes.

00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:40.125
Can I fly with you?

00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:43.541
No.

00:24:43.833 --> 00:24:46.041
It's not for everyone.

00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.583
So who's it for?

00:24:49.416 --> 00:24:51.250
People who need to fly.

00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:52.916
I need to.

00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:55.708
You do? Why's that?

00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:58.166
I want to see my mom in heaven.

00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:07.875
Adults can't lie to children.

00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:15.958
Auntie Yuling. do you have kids?

00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:17.083
No.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.375
Do you like children?

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:22.125
Sure. why do you ask?

00:25:22.208 --> 00:25:24.875
Congcong. come here.

00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:32.166
Quick!

00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:44.375
Sorry. my son keeps pestering you.

00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:47.041
Not at all.

00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:50.708
How'd you come to be a pilot?

00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:53.375
Not many girls want to do that.

00:25:54.208 --> 00:25:55.083
Is it so strange?

00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:01.625
My dad was a military pilot.

00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:04.041
So I like flying too.

00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:06.375
I used to be with the infantry.

00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:09.041
Where did your dad serve?

00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:13.166
He was a fighter jet test pilot. Fang Muting.

00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:16.833
The one who died 6 years ago on a test flight?

00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:20.833
In fact.

00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:24.583
he inspired me to take this path.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.958
I remember Mr. Fang used to say

00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:33.666
the courage to go forward

00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:35.875
is the key to success.

00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:38.750
I really agree with that.

00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:41.250
Our talk earlier today. that's what I meant.

00:26:44.583 --> 00:26:45.583
I apologize again.

00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:52.625
You didn't tell me about school.

00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:54.208
Make any new friends?

00:26:56.583 --> 00:26:57.416
Dad -

00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:02.166
when will you find me a new mom?

00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:09.750
You just said you missed mom.

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:11.958
Why look for a new one?

00:27:12.083 --> 00:27:13.166
I miss her.

00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:17.000
But a new mom can love me and care for me.

00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:21.125
I love you and care for you. don't I?

00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:24.083
You're a dad. not a mom.

00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:25.916
Isn't it the same thing?

00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.166
It's different.

00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:29.250
It's the same.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.750
Hurry and find one.

00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:33.458
I dropped a screw!

00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:35.291
Quick. find it or the plane won't fly.

00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:40.750
Dad. you're so dumb.

00:27:41.833 --> 00:27:44.041
Darling.

00:27:44.416 --> 00:27:46.291
do you like this bridal gown?

00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:47.083
Very pretty.

00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:49.250
It's hand-made in Italy.

00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:50.625
Of course it's pretty.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.458
Italian -

00:27:57.416 --> 00:27:58.625
sounds expensive.

00:27:58.625 --> 00:27:59.875
Of course it is.

00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:02.500
Here. sit down.

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:06.458
We...

00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:10.291
need to watch our money.

00:28:12.125 --> 00:28:14.291
Don't go wasting your money.

00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:17.250
I'm not. I bought it with yours.

00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:20.458
That's even worse!

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.000
Your money means more than wedding photos?

00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:30.916
Fine.

00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:34.041
I'll buy a bunch of expensive dresses

00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:36.500
for people who do want photos.

00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:38.416
Anyway. you won't do it. right?

00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:39.625
I'm going to buy this now.

00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:40.791
I'll get more later.

00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:42.541
- Calm down. - Buying it.

00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:44.583
- I was wrong. - Buying now.

00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:47.000
I'll do it!

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.708
Why not just say so?

00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:53.041
When we have time.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.625
Rescue 102. CRS431. over.

00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:03.250
Heading to 23˚ 39' 57" N.

00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:07.333
107˚ 34' 59" E. mountain rescue training.

00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:12.833
Search radius three nautical miles.

00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:16.541
Sector pattern search. 45 minutes max.

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.458
102 copy. watch the weather.

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:21.625
Stable weather for two hours. Good luck.

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:24.625
Putting through APR 2.

00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:26.333
Signal light. check. Power. check.

00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:28.375
Target hover height fifty feet.

00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:30.416
Eight-zero. seven-zero...

00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:38.833
Zhao Cheng is off hook.

00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:45.333
Bai Yang is off hook.

00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:49.833
You two set up.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.750
We'll report from the standby point.

00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:53.500
Copy.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:01.208
Liu Bin -

00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:03.125
We have a problem. check it out.

00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:03.791
What's wrong?

00:30:04.708 --> 00:30:05.666
The joystick is stuck.

00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:09.250
Captain. the main reducer...

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:11.666
We're losing oil pressure.

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:19.625
Mayday! Mayday!

00:30:19.958 --> 00:30:22.333
Everyone - seat belts. prepare for forced landing.

00:30:23.458 --> 00:30:25.541
The signal's too weak to put out a mayday!

00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:28.833
Reduce speed to Vy. shut the vents.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.125
Turn off autopilot. down five hundred.

00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:35.916
Speed check. vents check. AP check!

00:30:36.416 --> 00:30:38.875
Liu Bin. monitor obstacles at ten to twelve o'clock.

00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:40.208
Hill in six-zero.

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:42.250
Altitude six-two-zero feet. we're clear.

00:30:44.166 --> 00:30:45.083
There's a waterfall ahead.

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:46.708
We'll land above it.

00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:48.875
Captain. what if it's unstable?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.875
No choice. That's it.

00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:54.750
Landing spot at eleven o'clock.

00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:56.208
Distance five-zero. Speed?

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.250
Sixty knots.

00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.208
Temperature. pressure?

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.333
Temperature one-two-five. pressure twenty.

00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:02.000
Drop wheels.

00:31:02.083 --> 00:31:03.208
Check.

00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:05.708
Bank angle?

00:31:05.833 --> 00:31:09.291
Normal. Altitude one-zero-zero... Nine-zero...

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:10.291
Cancel hovering.

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:11.083
Prepare to land.

00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:12.250
Seven-zero...

00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.375
Six-zero...

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.791
Five-zero...

00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:16.583
Four-zero...

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:18.375
Three-zero...

00:31:19.333 --> 00:31:20.291
Two-zero...

00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:35.041
Gao Qian. what's the situation?

00:31:35.541 --> 00:31:37.791
We're still inspecting. I'll report any update.

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:40.375
The weather there is unpredictable.

00:31:40.416 --> 00:31:42.625
Night flight is too risky. Stay there.

00:31:42.666 --> 00:31:44.041
Be safe and stay in touch.

00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:44.833
Copy.

00:31:44.958 --> 00:31:46.958
Also. we've contacted Zhao and Bai.

00:31:47.041 --> 00:31:47.958
They're both safe.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.291
Roger. Thank you.

00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:51.875
Why's this in the main reducer?

00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:54.583
Didn't you say you checked it twice?

00:31:57.166 --> 00:31:58.333
I'm sorry. Captain. I slipped up...

00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.750
Slipped up?

00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:01.125
Is that okay then?

00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:04.541
Liu Bin.

00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:06.875
Need any help?

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.750
No. I can handle it.

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:16.333
Inspect it again properly!

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.833
The weather's turning.

00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:31.000
They said wait till tomorrow to fly.

00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:34.291
Who knows if we can fly at all?

00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:37.833
I'd stop blaming him.

00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:40.000
He feels guilty enough as it is.

00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:41.791
As team leaders.

00:32:41.875 --> 00:32:44.000
we're liable for everyone's safety.

00:32:45.583 --> 00:32:46.333
True.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.916
This is fun.

00:32:51.541 --> 00:32:52.583
Try it.

00:32:53.708 --> 00:32:54.875
Clear your mind.

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:00.833
Just give it a try.

00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:18.333
Congcong told me.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.833
He was two.

00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:27.291
She died of cancer.

00:33:32.166 --> 00:33:33.833
He's so little. who looks after him?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.375
His grandmother was.

00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:41.375
She thought it'd be better for him.

00:33:42.708 --> 00:33:45.583
But he's grown so introverted.

00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:48.833
So I brought him here and hope it'll help.

00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:54.958
He said that your wife once rescued you.

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:56.791
Was she part of the rescue team?

00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:01.250
No. it was me who rescued her.

00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:06.125
She was the first person I ever saved.

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:28.416
I'm Gao Qian.

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:45.458
That's so corny.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.000
Sure you didn't make it up?

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.416
Does it sound made up?

00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:54.291
The storm. lightning. cliff...

00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.416
You can improve on those old cliches.

00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:17.208
Cold?

00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:24.500
Aren't you?

00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:26.833
What d'you think?

00:35:29.166 --> 00:35:30.250
I think...

00:35:31.166 --> 00:35:32.791
let's keep each other warm.

00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:38.291
Don't give me that look.

00:35:39.708 --> 00:35:41.000
I like girls.

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:45.250
But I'm freezing.

00:35:52.958 --> 00:35:55.875
Turn around. Don't look at me.

00:35:56.375 --> 00:35:58.000
I'm not.

00:36:03.583 --> 00:36:04.708
Don't tell anyone.

00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:06.791
Our secret.

00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:09.041
Our secret.

00:36:10.583 --> 00:36:11.208
Our secret.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.625
CRS431. Rescue 102. over.

00:36:43.708 --> 00:36:44.958
Four-three-one copy.

00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:48.083
22˚ 06' 18" N.

00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:50.708
107˚ 22' 45" E.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.458
A 3.6 earthquake just hit.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.541
How's your fuel level?

00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.375
Are you fit for mission?

00:36:55.916 --> 00:36:57.333
We're six nautical miles from the site.

00:37:00.041 --> 00:37:01.541
Ninety from base.

00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:03.083
Fuel level six hundred.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.208
We'll have only ten minutes on site.

00:37:05.291 --> 00:37:07.875
We're mission-ready. good to go.

00:37:07.916 --> 00:37:09.250
Agree. go to it.

00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:37.666
Rescue 102. CRS431 on site. over.

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:44.291
Vehicle transporter totalled.

00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:46.250
Oil tanker cabin wedged into cliff.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.833
The driver is still conscious.

00:37:51.166 --> 00:37:52.666
The tanker may explode any minute!

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:57.333
Three-one. one survivor. planning rescue. over.

00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:01.666
I'll secure the cabin with the second winch.

00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:04.833
Move a safe distance away. Agreed?

00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:06.041
Agreed.

00:38:08.875 --> 00:38:09.958
It's sheltered here

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:13.458
with a narrow gorge and unstable air currents.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.125
Liu Bin. what's the data?

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:19.750
Southeast wind. speed six mps.

00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:22.791
Downdraft sixty mpm.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.958
Close the doors. hold on!

00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:16.041
Follow it!

00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:25.916
Turbulence!

00:39:33.625 --> 00:39:35.000
SEP decreasing

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
to ten percent.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.791
Watch it. if it's under five tell me.

00:40:10.083 --> 00:40:10.750
Air currents stable.

00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:13.500
Prepare for rescue.

00:40:33.708 --> 00:40:34.500
Steady. Lower cable.

00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:36.125
Opening the rear door!

00:40:43.083 --> 00:40:43.958
Right four.

00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:47.500
Right two.

00:40:49.458 --> 00:40:50.291
Maintain.

00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:00.916
Lock it!

00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:05.000
Captain Gao is out!

00:41:09.125 --> 00:41:10.083
Lock the second winch!

00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:12.500
I'm on site.

00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:14.958
Liu Bin. monitor wind change.

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:16.708
What's the SEP?

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:19.250
Eight. Temperature normal.

00:41:32.375 --> 00:41:34.375
Captain Gao! Watch your back!

00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:41.250
Gao Qian!

00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:42.250
Bai. tighten it up!

00:41:49.875 --> 00:41:50.541
Zhao Cheng!

00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:02.166
Captain Gao!

00:42:05.125 --> 00:42:06.000
Save him first!

00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:16.833
Hold on. you'll be okay.

00:42:17.083 --> 00:42:18.125
Hold on.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.500
My foot...

00:42:35.416 --> 00:42:36.083
Zhao Cheng!

00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:38.958
Zhao Cheng! The spare mask!

00:42:39.083 --> 00:42:39.916
What's happening?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.083
His leg is trapped.

00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:44.666
Bai. tool bag. hurry!

00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:20.375
Tanker parts in the river!

00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:23.291
Captain Gao. watch out for debris!

00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:26.250
Zhao Cheng!

00:43:27.083 --> 00:43:27.916
Hurry!

00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:30.958
Welding gun!

00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:33.666
Here.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:45.791
Watch out. Captain Gao!

00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:51.708
Zhao Cheng!

00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:56.333
What's happening?

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:11.458
Zhao Cheng!

00:44:14.416 --> 00:44:16.250
Zhao Cheng! Buddy!

00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:18.000
Buddy!

00:44:19.541 --> 00:44:21.166
Zhao Cheng is injured. over.

00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:23.875
Captain. tanker body approaching fast.

00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:30.041
Captain Gao. time's up. hurry!

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:36.958
Captain Gao -

00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:38.833
hurry!

00:44:41.166 --> 00:44:43.541
Give me your hand.

00:44:51.583 --> 00:44:52.583
Bai. go!

00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:53.875
Prepare to cut cable.

00:45:20.958 --> 00:45:21.875
What did the doctor say?

00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:23.958
It's nothing.

00:45:24.666 --> 00:45:25.916
That's nothing?

00:45:26.708 --> 00:45:28.791
It was so hectic. I had no time to think.

00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:31.458
You knew the chopper hit turbulence.

00:45:31.458 --> 00:45:32.791
You should've obeyed the pilot's orders.

00:45:32.875 --> 00:45:33.583
True.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.000
But I'm so used to your pace.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.791
It was a gut reaction. hard to change.

00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:39.416
Listen -

00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.333
when you stopped breathing I nearly lost it.

00:45:45.958 --> 00:45:49.750
It's true what they say about dying.

00:45:50.625 --> 00:45:51.375
What's that?

00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.125
Just as the soul is about to leave the body

00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:58.125
you see the person most important to you.

00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:01.125
Is that me?

00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:03.833
Thankfully. no.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.500
Thankfully. you're still here.

00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:10.875
Joker!

00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:27.541
Do you read the words on that orange every day?

00:46:28.458 --> 00:46:29.250
Of course.

00:46:31.541 --> 00:46:32.416
I have something to tell you.

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:35.541
My love.

00:46:40.791 --> 00:46:41.833
What are you doing?

00:46:42.083 --> 00:46:44.791
I always thought taking wedding photos

00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:46.750
was a trivial matter.

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:49.666
But why

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.916
couldn't I do such a small thing for you?

00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:57.375
I don't want us to have regrets.

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:01.500
But how?

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.000
You won't even wear a suit.

00:47:04.083 --> 00:47:05.291
I've prepared everything.

00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:12.666
How's this. darling?

00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:16.791
Here. take this.

00:47:21.125 --> 00:47:22.250
Group A. get ready!

00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:23.416
Over there. you too.

00:47:28.208 --> 00:47:29.000
Remember -

00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:31.666
your struggle is with nature. not each other!

00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.625
You two catch up! Didn't you eat breakfast?

00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:41.916
Faster! Push through your limits!

00:49:03.458 --> 00:49:05.166
C'mon. faster!

00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:07.291
Too slow!

00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:10.375
Don't slack off.

00:49:10.708 --> 00:49:11.666
Yuling. faster!

00:50:09.666 --> 00:50:10.416
Daddy.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.041
Are my pants brownish?

00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:15.166
Yup.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.666
But brown looks ugly here...

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:21.375
Daddy's off from work tomorrow.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.333
We can go fly this plane.

00:50:24.416 --> 00:50:25.333
Yeah!

00:50:29.666 --> 00:50:30.541
Daddy.

00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:33.375
Do you like Auntie Yuling?

00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:37.750
Kids shouldn't be asking these questions.

00:50:38.083 --> 00:50:40.541
Why can't I ask?

00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:51.666
Do you like her or not?

00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:53.416
No.

00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:03.250
Why don't you?

00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:05.000
Why can't I not like her?

00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:08.083
I like her. so you should too.

00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:09.625
That's not how it works.

00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:12.916
Daddy. you've got to say yes.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.375
C'mon. say yes!

00:51:28.541 --> 00:51:29.458
Got it?

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.666
Come out.

00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:51.666
Leave me alone. daddy.

00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:54.833
I've got some good news for you.

00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:57.291
I'm pooping!

00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:04.875
There are plenty of helicopters I will visit tomorrow.

00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.333
Does anyone else want to go?

00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:09.958
I wanna go. I wanna go!

00:52:11.791 --> 00:52:13.666
Go where?

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.708
I wanna go!

00:52:16.208 --> 00:52:18.000
What's that stink? Didn't you wipe?

00:52:21.833 --> 00:52:22.625
Does it stink? Does it?

00:52:22.625 --> 00:52:23.958
Gross!

00:52:23.958 --> 00:52:27.000
So stinky. go wipe yourself...

00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:43.708
Go. go...

00:52:48.125 --> 00:52:49.833
Wow. that's amazing.

00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:52.625
That's my dad.

00:52:52.791 --> 00:52:54.875
Your dad's amazing.

00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:55.916
Yeah. he really is.

00:53:07.666 --> 00:53:11.666
My dad's amazing...

00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:14.958
Didn't you promise me a helicopter ride?

00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:16.833
That's where we're going.

00:53:16.833 --> 00:53:17.875
Great.

00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:21.291
Let's go.

00:53:23.916 --> 00:53:26.750
Congcong. first you need to learn this hand signal.

00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.291
Ready for take off.

00:53:45.916 --> 00:53:46.541
Dad!

00:53:46.625 --> 00:53:47.416
What?

00:53:48.416 --> 00:53:50.000
We're flying!

00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:58.375
So pretty. like the real thing!

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.166
Congcong.

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.416
Auntie Yuling granted you your wish.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.875
What do you say?

00:54:09.208 --> 00:54:10.791
Thank you. Auntie Yuling!

00:54:10.791 --> 00:54:11.625
Good boy.

00:54:11.625 --> 00:54:14.333
But I have another wish.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:16.916
Don't be so greedy.

00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:19.125
You can tell me when we get home.

00:54:19.833 --> 00:54:23.000
What is it. Congcong? Maybe I can help?

00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:26.166
Do you like my dad?

00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:31.041
Congcong. look at that sky...

00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:33.041
My dad likes you!

00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:37.541
Stop joking. I never said I liked her. so -

00:54:37.541 --> 00:54:39.541
I'm so sorry. that's not what I meant.

00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:42.791
This kid - he's always kidding around.

00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:44.625
Can you be my new mom?

00:54:45.083 --> 00:54:47.375
We're falling! Danger! Hold on!

00:54:47.375 --> 00:54:50.333
Can you?

00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:54.875
Xinqiao.

00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:56.416
Where'd you go?

00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.625
Hello. Congcong's mom!

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:04.791
Let's go play.

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:06.041
Okay. let's go.

00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:07.500
Mom. I'm going to play.

00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:08.916
Sure.

00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:11.375
Have fun. Be good!

00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:19.000
Yuling -

00:55:20.708 --> 00:55:21.458
Go play.

00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:25.125
Liu Bin is quitting. Did he tell you?

00:55:25.333 --> 00:55:26.416
Quitting?

00:55:30.875 --> 00:55:31.666
Liu Bin!

00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:38.208
What happened? Why the sudden decision?

00:55:39.166 --> 00:55:40.208
Personal reasons.

00:55:42.083 --> 00:55:43.083
Liu Bin -

00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:45.333
this will have an impact on morale.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:50.166
People go all the time. no big deal.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.375
I followed procedure.

00:55:52.458 --> 00:55:54.291
and paid compensation.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.000
Find a better job if you like.

00:56:01.375 --> 00:56:03.833
But to go like this is irresponsible!

00:56:04.458 --> 00:56:06.333
Critical incident. critical incident!

00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:10.625
All unit directors and captains to the command room immediately...

00:56:12.291 --> 00:56:13.250
Are you coming?

00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:17.083
Captain Fang. let's go.

00:56:23.041 --> 00:56:24.916
Hurry. this way!

00:56:25.833 --> 00:56:26.791
This way!

00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:28.666
This way!

00:56:29.333 --> 00:56:30.750
Cheng!

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.666
Look after Congcong. Wait here for me.

00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:33.791
This way!

00:56:33.875 --> 00:56:35.250
Careful!

00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:40.750
We'll wait here. You take this zone.

00:56:43.208 --> 00:56:44.791
A passenger jet. Larus Wings HL538.

00:56:44.875 --> 00:56:48.625
ran into extreme weather and got caught

00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:50.791
in a thunderstorm thirty nautical miles wide.

00:56:50.833 --> 00:56:53.375
Hail has taken out both engines.

00:56:53.583 --> 00:56:55.333
It's now gliding

00:56:55.458 --> 00:56:58.500
towards its scheduled destination.

00:56:58.666 --> 00:57:00.041
But the situation is unclear.

00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:01.541
Rescue ships are on the way.

00:57:01.583 --> 00:57:03.791
Prepare diving gear and life rafts.

00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:04.541
Stand by at the helipad.

00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:05.125
Yes sir!

00:57:06.166 --> 00:57:07.250
Chief -

00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:09.666
I can't make Liu Bin stay.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:10.791
But this is huge.

00:57:10.875 --> 00:57:12.666
Let me fly by myself.

00:57:12.958 --> 00:57:14.208
It's been too long

00:57:14.666 --> 00:57:16.375
since I've seen action.

00:57:17.416 --> 00:57:18.083
I'll go with you.

00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:19.750
Yes. sir!

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:42.791
It's okay my love.

00:57:49.708 --> 00:57:51.625

You will be out of the storm area. expect three minutes.

00:57:58.166 --> 00:58:00.041
Commander. all flights have landed.

00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:04.750
Departures cancelled. Runway is clear.

00:58:11.125 --> 00:58:13.125

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.708
We've lost the RAT!

00:58:49.958 --> 00:58:51.791
What's the charge on the battery?

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.625
At 25 percent.

00:58:54.666 --> 00:58:57.708
Okay. I think we can make it to the airport.

00:59:09.666 --> 00:59:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen. this is the captain speaking.

00:59:12.291 --> 00:59:13.500
We are through the storm.

00:59:13.541 --> 00:59:15.625
and you can remove your mask.

00:59:16.125 --> 00:59:18.708
Our plane will be landing at the airport as planned.

00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:21.208
Please remain calm.

00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:24.750

00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:26.333

It's all we need. we gonna make it okay...

00:59:29.791 --> 00:59:30.875
Are you okay?

00:59:32.875 --> 00:59:35.000
Sir please sit down. leave her to us.

00:59:36.208 --> 00:59:37.708
Sit down. leave her to us.

00:59:48.208 --> 00:59:48.958
Robert.

00:59:55.208 --> 00:59:56.250
That's my baby!

00:59:59.125 --> 01:00:02.083
No! Don't pull!

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.291
Inflate them only at our instruction!

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.208

We can't land at the airport as planned.

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:25.833
Attention. rescue units. change of plan!

Larus Wings 538. this is China Rescue.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.666
We're heading to your position.

01:01:37.916 --> 01:01:39.208
Larus Wings 538 -

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:42.041
Rescue team is now estimating twenty miles from you.

01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:47.666

Oh my god. are you okay?

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:55.833
Prepare for ditching.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.500
Press ditching button.

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.166
Turn off all ventilation.

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:00.583
Ready all flaps in position.

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:01.750

Chief. three choppers can hold up the tail.

01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:29.666
A slower sink rate means more time for the rescue.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.083
Pilots. can you do this?

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:32.458

Great. I've finally found you.

01:22:55.708 --> 01:22:57.250
We went to the base in Hainan.

01:22:57.333 --> 01:22:59.500
They said you transferred here.

01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:01.791

01:23:08.708 --> 01:23:10.708
To apologize in person.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.791

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.500
I'm so sorry...

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.625
I'm sorry...

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:28.666
Five years ago.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.875
there was a fire on a cruise ship.

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:33.000
It was you who saved her.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.250
Afterwards.

01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:38.833
we returned to England for medical treatment.

01:23:39.208 --> 01:23:41.958
But she couldn't face her injuries.

01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:43.708
She was so depressed

01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:45.666
she tried to kill herself.

01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:50.166
Luckily. fate intervened.

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:52.375
Then one day

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:56.541
she saw a newspaper report of the accident

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.958
and broke down.

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:01.750
She came crying to me.

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:03.500
She felt she had done wrong

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:06.500
to the man who risked his life to save her.

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.125
It's my job.

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:09.958
Mr. Li.

01:24:12.125 --> 01:24:15.208

01:24:17.041 --> 01:24:17.916

01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:40.875

01:24:44.708 --> 01:24:47.000
Everyone says you're a hero.

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.000
Does that make me one?

01:24:53.791 --> 01:24:56.750
And another.

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:09.583
I've come to see you.

01:25:09.916 --> 01:25:11.291
Thanks. Come in.

01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:13.666
Congcong.

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.125
Auntie Yuling.

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:16.375
What's this game?

01:25:16.458 --> 01:25:17.666
Racing cars.

01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:19.583
Wow. you're good.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:25.291
What's wrong?

01:25:25.916 --> 01:25:29.208
Dad. I can't see that well.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.666
What. do your eyes hurt?

01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:35.833
I'm okay.

01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:37.916
Right. no more gaming.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.083
You should take a rest.

01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:40.875
Let's have some cakes!

01:25:41.458 --> 01:25:44.333
Let's fly! Look what Auntie Yuling brought!

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:47.750
Which one do you want?

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.541
How about this one?

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:53.541
Okay.

01:25:53.833 --> 01:25:54.666
Go on.

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.166
Can we have a chat?

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.166
Sure.

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:59.458
Everyone wants you back.

01:26:05.708 --> 01:26:07.416
Is it because of Congcong?

01:26:08.958 --> 01:26:10.291
It's because of me.

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:19.125
When we met. I said you went to extremes.

01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:20.875
Do you remember what you told me?

01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:25.333
I understand your concerns.

01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:27.666
But with your experience and abilities

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:30.833
I'm sure you can get past this.

01:26:38.916 --> 01:26:40.791
I know what fear is.

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:09.333
I'm afraid it'll affect my decision-making.

01:27:13.208 --> 01:27:17.291
You know there're only 300 of us in the country.

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:19.666
Without you. we're one part weaker.

01:27:20.041 --> 01:27:22.125
But in fluid situations.

01:27:22.916 --> 01:27:24.541
I need to rely on my intuition.

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:25.166
I can't hesitate...

01:27:25.166 --> 01:27:27.208
Don't overthink.

01:27:28.583 --> 01:27:31.666
On the job. you know what to do.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:36.750
Wenshan says

01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:39.333
you gave this watch to Zhao Cheng.

01:27:40.875 --> 01:27:42.500
Zhao Cheng always said

01:27:43.708 --> 01:27:46.750
happiness was working with you.

01:27:49.416 --> 01:27:54.333
He'd want to carry on by your side.

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.166
Where's Congcong?

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:07.041
Congcong?

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:10.500
I'm in the bathroom. Where's Auntie Yuling?

01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:13.708
Right here. Come have some more cakes.

01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:16.333
Dad. why'd you turn off the lights?

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.041
I didn't.

01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.208
What happened?

01:28:19.208 --> 01:28:22.250
Dad. I can't see anything.

01:28:22.291 --> 01:28:23.416
I'm scared.

01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:27.291
Don't be scared. I'm coming.

01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:29.791
Dad. I'm so scared!

01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:30.916
Don't be afraid. Congcong.

01:28:32.416 --> 01:28:33.083
What is it?

01:28:33.166 --> 01:28:36.833
Dad. I can't see you.

01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:39.291
It's okay. I'm here. Don't be scared.

01:28:39.708 --> 01:28:41.666
Let's go. I'll drive you to the hospital.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:42.541
Let's go.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:43.916
Hurry.

01:28:44.208 --> 01:28:45.541
Don't be scared...

01:28:47.416 --> 01:28:49.333
According to the biopsy.

01:28:49.833 --> 01:28:53.625
his osteosarcoma is no longer in remission.

01:28:54.333 --> 01:28:56.333
And it's spread to his brain...

01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:07.416
What did the doctor say?

01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:10.750
The doctor said...

01:29:12.125 --> 01:29:16.708
the tumor in his brain is 3cm in diameter.

01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:22.125
The pressure on his optic nerve caused the loss of sight.

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:27.166
Although the condition has stabilized.

01:29:29.625 --> 01:29:31.791
if we delay treatment.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.333
the cancer could spread and kill him.

01:29:38.666 --> 01:29:40.791
They'll operate tomorrow.

01:29:41.458 --> 01:29:45.416
He's so young. It's too risky.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.041
The doctor says the success rate is only thirty percent.

01:29:59.666 --> 01:30:00.916
I don't understand -

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:09.125
why take the people I love the most?

01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:16.125
To make up for those I've snatched from death?

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:21.833
It's okay.

01:30:27.375 --> 01:30:29.333
You want to defeat me.

01:30:34.083 --> 01:30:36.958
I'll fight you to the end.

01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:50.291
Dad.

01:30:50.708 --> 01:30:53.041
When can we go home?

01:30:55.958 --> 01:30:57.750
Not yet.

01:30:59.416 --> 01:31:02.458
There's a little monster in your body.

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:04.875
It's trying to get you.

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:09.375
Can the doctor chase it away?

01:31:12.083 --> 01:31:13.666
But the doctor says

01:31:14.666 --> 01:31:16.541
you have to be brave.

01:31:17.958 --> 01:31:20.916
You need to fight the monster together.

01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:25.541
If we lose do I die?

01:31:32.166 --> 01:31:33.625
Of course not.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:38.083
Remember what the foreign auntie called me?

01:31:38.791 --> 01:31:40.291
Hero.

01:31:40.416 --> 01:31:41.625
That's right.

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:44.875
You're the son of a hero.

01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:52.458
You'll be a hero too one day.

01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:33.916
Mr. Gao. over the next hour

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:36.708
we'll be preparing your son for surgery.

01:32:36.958 --> 01:32:38.333
Thank you.

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:43.541
Dad.

01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:46.375
I'm so hungry.

01:32:47.291 --> 01:32:49.875
Be patient. You can eat right after.

01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:53.125
New footage just in. The cause of the accident is unclear.

01:32:53.166 --> 01:32:55.791
There's a danger of a second explosion.

01:32:55.833 --> 01:32:58.291
as natural gas is highly explosive.

01:32:58.375 --> 01:33:01.791
The area within three nautical miles is sealed off.

01:33:01.833 --> 01:33:03.416
Rescue boats have had to evacuate.

01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:06.250
More than twenty crew remain in the ship.

01:33:06.416 --> 01:33:10.041
A special rescue team was dispatched

01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:13.250
to try to save them before a second explosion.

01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:15.041
Some rescuers have been injured.

01:33:15.625 --> 01:33:16.625
Dad.

01:33:17.166 --> 01:33:19.333
You have to save them.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.500
You'd let me go?

01:33:27.041 --> 01:33:29.000
Yes. You have to save them.

01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:33.291
You're okay here by yourself?

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.083
I'm fine.

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:40.791
Hero. you have to come back!

01:33:51.416 --> 01:33:53.583
Hi. I'm Gao Yicong's dad. room 708.

01:33:53.666 --> 01:33:55.708
I have to be somewhere urgently.

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:56.708
I'll be back as soon as possible.

01:33:58.958 --> 01:34:01.166
Li. I need help over here. hurry.

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:02.666
Coming through!

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:05.583
This way! Head to this side!

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.875
Captain Gao...

01:34:07.916 --> 01:34:09.500
Xiao Liang.

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:13.583
Make way. make way!

01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:25.083
Base - Four wounded. all needing stretchers.

01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:28.791
Refuel. hurry!

01:34:28.791 --> 01:34:29.333
Roger.

01:34:36.041 --> 01:34:37.125
Captain An. ready to go.

01:34:37.333 --> 01:34:38.250
Wait by the chopper.

01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:38.791
Copy!

01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:51.500
Captain Gao...

01:34:51.541 --> 01:34:52.416
What's the situation?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.791
We've rescued fifteen crew.

01:34:54.833 --> 01:34:57.625
Eight more are in the B6 safe room.

01:34:57.875 --> 01:35:01.000
They flooded it and try to cool it down.

01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:05.208
Four rescuers including Bai Yang are trapped on B3.

01:35:05.791 --> 01:35:08.083
More wounded are about to arrive. notify the hospital.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:09.625
Chief -

01:35:09.958 --> 01:35:13.166
the additional rescue teams have a thirty minutes ETA.

01:35:16.291 --> 01:35:18.375
Chief. how many rescuers were injured?

01:35:23.458 --> 01:35:25.333
Isn't Congcong having surgery?

01:35:26.291 --> 01:35:28.833
The team needs people. We can go.

01:35:29.291 --> 01:35:32.083
You should be with your kid. Why are you here?

01:35:32.291 --> 01:35:34.291
Everyone belongs to a battlefield.

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.833
Mine is rescue.

01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:40.166
Base - CRS431 landing with two injured.

01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:43.291
It was carrying 100.000 cubic metres of natural gas.

01:35:43.708 --> 01:35:45.583
Luckily. before it exploded.

01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:48.291
it already offloaded 70.000.

01:35:48.583 --> 01:35:50.125
Tanks 2 and 4 were empty.

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.333
Tank 3 exploded. the fire burned from the bottom up.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:56.583
Storage pipes pushed the heat through the ship.

01:35:56.958 --> 01:35:58.708
The lowest decks got extremely hot.

01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:01.458
Tank 1 is only one-third fulll.

01:36:01.541 --> 01:36:03.416
If it explodes. the damage can be contained.

01:36:03.541 --> 01:36:05.750
But the Tank 5 is close to the main structure.

01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:06.833
And it's the fullest.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:08.416
Expert calculations

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.958
say that if it blows. it could destroy the ship.

01:36:11.291 --> 01:36:12.708
Did they say how much time we have?

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:13.958
Less than thirty minutes.

01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:14.708
I see.

01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:15.958
Captain Gao!

01:36:22.416 --> 01:36:23.166
Be very careful.

01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:23.666
We will.

01:36:26.375 --> 01:36:27.958
Come over to three-one!

01:36:31.333 --> 01:36:32.000
Captain Fang.

01:36:32.083 --> 01:36:34.291
Refuelling complete. Final checks. one minute.

01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:37.125
CRS431. you have clearance for takeoff...

01:36:38.541 --> 01:36:40.625
The ship's doors are damaged.

01:36:40.708 --> 01:36:42.750
Only door 4 on the rear deck is passable.

01:36:42.875 --> 01:36:45.041
Ladders go straight to the bottom deck.

01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:46.500
B6 entrance is blocked.

01:36:47.041 --> 01:36:49.791
We have to go through the B5 generator room

01:36:49.916 --> 01:36:51.625
to reach the safe room on B6.

01:36:53.166 --> 01:36:56.208
Captain An. you're across the situation on B3.

01:36:56.791 --> 01:36:58.500
You rescue Bai Yang and the others.

01:36:58.791 --> 01:36:59.166
Okay.

01:36:59.208 --> 01:37:00.083
I'll go for the ship's crew.

01:37:01.291 --> 01:37:03.291
It's a volatile situation.

01:37:03.375 --> 01:37:05.208
We have to be clear on our course of action.

01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:06.875
Successful or not.

01:37:06.958 --> 01:37:09.250
in fifteen minutes. we must clear out.

01:37:09.833 --> 01:37:10.625
- Right. - Copy that.

01:37:10.666 --> 01:37:11.750
Captain Fang. ETA?

01:37:12.166 --> 01:37:13.333
Ten minutes.

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:09.125
When did you start?

01:38:09.791 --> 01:38:10.833
A week ago.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.208
It's normal to be nervous.

01:38:15.041 --> 01:38:16.375
Look after your oxygen.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.708
Remember what you've learned.

01:38:25.416 --> 01:38:27.208
45 seconds to approach.

01:38:44.833 --> 01:38:47.875
CRS431 approaching target. over.

01:38:48.583 --> 01:38:49.250
Open the rear door.

01:38:59.375 --> 01:39:00.625
Rear deck fifty degrees.

01:39:01.208 --> 01:39:02.083
Get ready.

01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:11.375
Gao Qian!

01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:15.333
Fifteen minutes.

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:43.125
It's too hot inside. it won't open.

01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:44.791
Use C4 to blow it open.

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:45.333
Copy.

01:39:52.583 --> 01:39:53.916
Three. two. one...

01:39:57.333 --> 01:40:00.291
Gao Qian - get them. tell me. and I'll be back.

01:40:19.416 --> 01:40:20.083
Go. go. go!

01:40:38.875 --> 01:40:39.625
Watch the time.

01:40:45.541 --> 01:40:46.291
150 degrees.

01:40:46.333 --> 01:40:46.833
Copy.

01:41:15.375 --> 01:41:17.291
Move fast. follow me.

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.333
The tumor is wrapped around the carotid artery.

01:41:44.458 --> 01:41:45.750
Monitor his data closely.

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:46.500
Wait!

01:41:47.666 --> 01:41:50.000
Blood pressure is 75 over 40. Heart rate 73.

01:41:50.083 --> 01:41:50.916
His blood pressure is unstable.

01:41:51.041 --> 01:41:51.916
Pause the operation.

01:41:53.333 --> 01:41:56.541
Atropine 0.3. Deoxygenated kidney five mgs. IV push.

01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:04.458
Don't move. I'm coming.

01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:09.541
Hold on.

01:42:37.625 --> 01:42:39.375
Here. give me your hand.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.208
Up and over.

01:42:43.291 --> 01:42:44.041
You okay?

01:42:46.375 --> 01:42:48.750
Any injury? You okay?

01:42:50.916 --> 01:42:52.833
No. I'm okay.

01:42:54.208 --> 01:42:55.041
Stay with me.

01:43:13.625 --> 01:43:14.833
Fire extinguisher bomb! Hurry!

01:43:32.958 --> 01:43:35.041
Gao Qian. out of B5 generator room. over.

01:43:49.166 --> 01:43:51.000
An Peng reporting. we've reached B3.

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:01.000
Bai Yang!

01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:05.541
Bai Yang!

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.083
I'm trapped in here!

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.166
Hold on. Bai Yang. we're coming!

01:44:14.708 --> 01:44:15.750
Are you okay?

01:44:45.916 --> 01:44:47.208
We're on our way.

01:44:47.375 --> 01:44:49.333
Hold on. We're nearly there.

01:44:50.333 --> 01:44:51.291
Hold on...

01:45:02.166 --> 01:45:04.208
Gao Qian. entering B6. over.

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:17.458
Safe room. safe room.

01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:19.541
we are the rescue team. can you hear me?

01:45:19.625 --> 01:45:21.291
Yes. yes I hear you!

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:22.916
What's the situation?

01:45:23.125 --> 01:45:25.875
It's too hot. we can't take it any longer!

01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:27.541
Hang in there. we're coming.

01:45:40.041 --> 01:45:40.625
Let's go.

01:46:03.958 --> 01:46:05.000
320 degrees.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:06.708
Safe room. safe room.

01:46:06.791 --> 01:46:08.416
can you confirm that it's flooded?

01:46:08.583 --> 01:46:09.250
How much water?

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:13.125
30.000 liters. we've released all the water in the tank!

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:14.916
You're doing well. Okay listen.

01:46:15.375 --> 01:46:19.250
I'm gonna put out the fire. and I need you to work with me. okay?

01:46:19.666 --> 01:46:20.375
Okay!

01:46:21.333 --> 01:46:23.666
Open the door once you hear the explosion.

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:27.708
so the water can cool down the corridor. Are you with me?

01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:29.250
Okay. got it!

01:46:29.333 --> 01:46:30.041
Let's do it.

01:46:38.208 --> 01:46:39.083
Ready?

01:46:40.333 --> 01:46:41.375
Steady.

01:46:42.375 --> 01:46:42.791
Go!

01:47:04.916 --> 01:47:05.958
Careful. gently.

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.666
Hang in.

01:47:12.916 --> 01:47:13.583
Stench the bleeding.

01:47:13.708 --> 01:47:14.208
Copy.

01:47:16.125 --> 01:47:17.666
C'mon. wake up!

01:47:18.041 --> 01:47:19.333
Wake up!

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:21.333
Hold on.

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:24.416
There are two more team members inside.

01:47:38.958 --> 01:47:41.250
Don't go to sleep!

01:47:48.458 --> 01:47:50.041
We're going.

01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:04.166
Gao Qian. bringing crew to B5. over.

01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:06.166
Copy. We're standing by.

01:48:10.958 --> 01:48:13.208
Come on. let's move it! Hurry up!

01:48:14.125 --> 01:48:15.666
Watch out!

01:48:20.375 --> 01:48:21.125
Get down!

01:48:26.083 --> 01:48:27.208
Stay here.

01:48:35.541 --> 01:48:36.708
No way out up there.

01:48:36.958 --> 01:48:39.041
We have to exit from below.

01:48:39.291 --> 01:48:41.958
Five hundred degrees. Extinguisher bombs won't work.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.041
Gao Qian. we're here. where are you?

01:48:44.125 --> 01:48:45.666
We've got the crew and are on our way.

01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:47.541
But the fire on B5 is out of control.

01:48:47.625 --> 01:48:48.458
I'm working out a plan.

01:48:49.166 --> 01:48:50.125
Watch the time.

01:48:50.958 --> 01:48:53.791
Our only hope is via an elevator shaft that leads to the emergency cabin.

01:48:53.833 --> 01:48:56.583
and to explode the ship's fire extinguishers in there.

01:48:58.166 --> 01:48:59.500
Give me your explosives.

01:49:02.958 --> 01:49:04.000
Let me do it. Captain.

01:49:04.833 --> 01:49:06.083
You look after them.

01:49:06.375 --> 01:49:08.083
As soon as the fire's out. race across.

01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:13.416
The temperature is so high. the fire could re-ignite at any time.

01:49:15.791 --> 01:49:16.416
Careful.

01:49:25.583 --> 01:49:28.458
Go inside! Hurry!

01:50:13.958 --> 01:50:15.333
Weiquan. get ready.

01:50:19.333 --> 01:50:20.875
Hurry...

01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:42.041
Go. go. go!

01:52:06.875 --> 01:52:08.166
Captain Gao. you okay?

01:52:09.541 --> 01:52:11.083
Take them. don't worry about me.

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:12.083
Roger.

01:52:15.041 --> 01:52:16.041
What's the situation down there?

01:52:19.041 --> 01:52:20.000
Nearly there.

01:52:22.958 --> 01:52:23.125
Okay.

01:52:28.083 --> 01:52:30.000
Captain An. I've got the crew!

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.166
Move! Quick! Hurry!

01:52:33.125 --> 01:52:34.125
Where are you. Gao Qian?

01:52:34.958 --> 01:52:36.083
Elevator shaft. coming up.

01:52:37.166 --> 01:52:40.125
Get them out first. then return for me!

01:53:40.083 --> 01:53:41.000
Wait.

01:53:41.041 --> 01:53:43.125
Blood pressure 79 over 46. Heart rate 89.

01:53:44.041 --> 01:53:46.083
He's losing too much blood. he's critical.

01:53:47.125 --> 01:53:48.125
Prepare transfusion.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Deoxygenated kidney five mgs. IV push.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.083
Gelfoam. quick.

01:53:55.166 --> 01:53:56.041
Hurry.

01:53:56.125 --> 01:53:58.083
Blood pressure 62 over 30. heart rate 120.

01:53:58.125 --> 01:53:59.041
Again.

01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:00.125
Hurry. hurry!

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Pressurize the transfusion.

01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:04.041
Again.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Blood presure?

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.083
Blood pressure 54 over 23. heart rate 130.

01:54:10.083 --> 01:54:12.208
Blood pressure 50 over 24. heart rate 140.

01:54:12.958 --> 01:54:14.000
He's going into shock.

01:54:22.166 --> 01:54:27.000
Head down! Go! Quick!

01:54:28.041 --> 01:54:29.083
Are they all out?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
The eight crews are safe

01:54:31.125 --> 01:54:32.166
but Captain Gao is still inside.

01:54:34.166 --> 01:54:36.166
CRS431 ready for takeoff.

01:54:38.125 --> 01:54:39.208
You can't go back. Captain Fang.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.083
The ship is about to explode!

01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:43.958
That's why I have to go. to save him!

01:54:44.041 --> 01:54:48.000
If you go now there'll be more casualties.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.166
His life is precious but so is yours.

01:54:55.166 --> 01:54:56.958
Everyone. out.

01:54:57.125 --> 01:54:58.125
I'll go myself.

01:54:59.083 --> 01:55:01.125
Sir. co-pilot ready to go.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.125
Sir. your winchman too.

01:55:06.083 --> 01:55:09.125
CRS431 requests permission to take off.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.041
Don't come back...

01:55:13.125 --> 01:55:14.958
Is that you. Gao Qian?

01:55:15.125 --> 01:55:16.125
Where are you?

01:55:17.125 --> 01:55:19.041
The engine room.

01:55:21.125 --> 01:55:23.041
The fire's out of control.

01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:26.958
I'm trapped.

01:55:29.041 --> 01:55:30.166
There's got to be a way.

01:55:31.083 --> 01:55:32.083
Gao Qian -

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
there's got to be a way out.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
We're all waiting for you.

01:55:38.125 --> 01:55:40.041
Congcong too.

01:55:42.166 --> 01:55:43.958
Gao Qian.

01:55:46.041 --> 01:55:47.166
Gao Qian. answer me!

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.125
Gao Qian!

01:55:51.083 --> 01:55:53.125
Answer me. Gao Qian!

01:55:54.083 --> 01:55:56.166
Go see Congcong in hospital.

01:55:59.125 --> 01:56:01.125
Don't tell him what happened.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.958
Just say that

01:56:08.166 --> 01:56:11.041
when I'm done here

01:56:13.166 --> 01:56:16.041
I'll come get him.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.041
Gao Qian!

01:56:27.166 --> 01:56:29.000
Gao Qian!

01:56:32.125 --> 01:56:34.041
Gao Qian!

02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:11.083
Captain Gao!

02:02:12.083 --> 02:02:13.125
Captain Gao!

02:02:35.083 --> 02:02:39.125
One-zero-one. over.

02:02:44.041 --> 02:02:45.166
Is that you. Gao Qian?

02:02:46.958 --> 02:02:48.125
It's me.

02:02:50.041 --> 02:02:51.125
It's Gao Qian.

02:02:57.041 --> 02:02:58.125
Gao Qian's alive!

02:03:00.125 --> 02:03:01.125
Gao Qian's alive!

02:03:04.041 --> 02:03:05.125
Wait for me. I'm coming.

02:03:06.125 --> 02:03:07.958
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

02:03:11.166 --> 02:03:13.958
Request permission to take off immediately.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.958
Gao Qian. the hospital says

02:03:53.083 --> 02:03:57.000
Congcong's surgery isn't going so well.

02:05:09.166 --> 02:05:11.000
You'll make it.

02:05:13.125 --> 02:05:14.166
You'll make it.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.041
You can hang on.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.125
You're so brave.

02:05:25.125 --> 02:05:27.125
You're so brave. hang in there.

02:05:30.083 --> 02:05:32.083
You can defeat the monster.

02:05:34.083 --> 02:05:35.125
I came back.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.166
just like you told me to.

02:05:57.166 --> 02:05:59.000
People ask me -

02:05:59.958 --> 02:06:02.166
when you charge into danger

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.166
do you ever think you might die?

02:06:07.083 --> 02:06:08.083
The answer is

02:06:08.125 --> 02:06:09.125
yes.

02:06:10.041 --> 02:06:11.125
Countless times.

02:06:12.958 --> 02:06:15.125
Life is full of sudden disasters.

02:06:16.125 --> 02:06:18.208
frustrations and challenges.

02:06:19.208 --> 02:06:21.125
One following the other.

02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:23.125
If you don't want to give in.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.083
your only choice is to resist.

02:06:28.041 --> 02:06:31.000
When we struggle for life to the last breath.

02:06:32.041 --> 02:06:33.125
that breath

02:06:35.125 --> 02:06:37.083
is courage itself.

02:07:24.041 --> 02:07:26.125
- Hello. thank you for inviting us! - You're all most welcome.

02:07:40.166 --> 02:07:41.166
Congcong!

02:07:41.958 --> 02:07:43.958
Xinqiao. happy new year!

02:07:44.083 --> 02:07:46.000
Are you having fun?

02:07:46.083 --> 02:07:47.125
Lots!

02:07:47.125 --> 02:07:49.041
Do you miss me?

02:07:49.083 --> 02:07:50.125
I do!

02:07:51.083 --> 02:07:52.166
So where's my present?

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.166
Don't tell me. let me guess.

02:08:00.166 --> 02:08:01.125
Thank you.

02:08:04.083 --> 02:08:07.125
Who's she? Why does she smile at you like that?

02:08:07.166 --> 02:08:08.125
She's a friend.

02:08:08.958 --> 02:08:11.208
So why are you smiling at her like that?

02:08:12.166 --> 02:08:13.166
Answer me!

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.166
Hmph. don't think I'll be here waiting for you!
