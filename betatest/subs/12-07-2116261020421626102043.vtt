the world. crocodiles and
alligators are on the move.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.040
heading out to sea and
deep into shark territory.

Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.200
From mysterious
severed heads.

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.120
NEALE: You can see
where the shark's
actually bitten it.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.440
NARRATOR: To ambush attacks.

8
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.560
MIKE: Oh man. This
is incredible.

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.880
NARRATOR: What happens
when two of the deadliest

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.560
predators on the planet.
go head-to-head?

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.880
The Everglades. Florida.
a vast tropical wetland.

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.600
crisscrossed by a
network of swamps.
channels and rivers.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.560
And an unlikely
mecca for sharks.

14
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.480
MIKE: When you think about
the Everglades. you don't
really think about sharks.

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.080
but every year we get
adults of Bull sharks. Lemon
sharks. and Blacktip sharks.

16
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.880
coming here to have their
young. because it's such

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.280
a great place for those
baby sharks to grow up.

18
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.360
NARRATOR: Dr. Mike
Heithaus has been studying

19
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.880
the predators here
for almost 20 years.

20
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.320
He discovered young sharks
can spend the first four
years of their lives

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.120
hunting for small fish in
the web of mangrove roots
that line these waterways.

22
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.560
MIKE: As the tide
goes down and there's
less space to hide.

23
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.320
those fish have to
come into the channel

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.040
and that's where the
sharks have a really good
chance of catching them.

25
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.520
But. they're not the
only predators in town.

26
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.720
NARRATOR: Alligators also
stalk these mangroves.

27
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.560
Able to hold their breath for
over 30 minutes. they move
silently through the water.

28
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.680
barely creating a ripple.

29
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.720
Feeding on everything from
fish to small mammals.

30
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.920
But do they also have
a taste for sharks?

31
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.160
In recent years.
members of the public

32
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.360
have captured glimpses
of shark gator clashes.

33
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.720
in the brackish borderlands
that separate Florida's
fresh and saltwater systems.

34
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.840
MIKE: We usually think
of sharks as saltwater
creatures and alligators

35
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.560
as freshwater creatures and
they should never interact.
but it's not that simple.

36
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.880
These sharks can come
up and live in almost
entirely fresh water

37
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.480
and alligators can survive
where there's a fair bit
of salt in the water.

38
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.680
My hunch is that these
animals run into each other
more often than we'd think.

39
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.200
Are they competitors or
this predator versus prey?

40
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.720
And who's the predator?

41
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.000
NARRATOR: As dusk falls.
the team prepares

42
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.720
for a groundbreaking
tagging operation.

43
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.800
Their mission for the
first time ever.

44
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.840
to put cameras on the
backs of sharks and gators

45
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.520
in the suspected
predator battleground.

46
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.360
As a thermal drone helps
looks for gators from above.

47
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.720
MIKE: Jack. what you
got? Point it directly
at one. yeah.

48
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.920
NARRATOR: The team begins
to explore a series of
narrow channels

49
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.760
that carve through
the shark nursery.

50
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.480
Gators are easier
to spot at night.

51
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.840
Their eyes contain guanine
crystals which reflect
light back off the retina.

52
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.320
that gives them the
effects of night vision.

53
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.880
But under flashlight.
their eyes glow bright red.

54
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.920
HUNTER: There's one. there's
one. Up on the left. left.

55
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.920
MIKE: That's a big
one. Oh. he's down.

56
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.080
See him?

57
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.840
Oh. I think I got it!
Yes. yes! Cut the
ropes. cut the ropes.

58
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.360
NARRATOR: As the team
wrestles the six-foot
gator alongside the boat.

59
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.760
they need to be careful.

60
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.840
Alligators are armed
with up to 80 teeth.

61
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.600
MIKE: Close that
now. please. Just
close it a bit.

62
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.440
NARRATOR: With a
bite force of over 2000
pounds per square inch.

63
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.920
their jaws are nearly twice
as powerful as a Bull shark.

64
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.360
MIKE: There. perfect.
Very nice.

65
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.720
So. the impressive thing
about alligator jaws

66
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.720
is they've got tons of
force to close 'em.

67
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.800
but not a lot to open
'em. so five or six wraps
of this tape

68
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.040
and it will not be able
to open those jaws.

69
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.600
which makes it safer
for the alligator and
definitely us.

70
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.680
NARRATOR: As the team
drags 150 pounds of angry
alligator onto the boat.

71
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.880
There's a shocking
discovery.

72
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.200
MIKE: Oh. look at
that! Look at his tail
or lack thereof.

73
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.720
NARRATOR: He's missing
over a foot of tail.

74
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.080
Has this potential shark
hunter. become shark prey?

75
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.320
Male alligators are
highly territorial and
regularly clash.

76
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.880
They can lose limbs
and tails to these
violent attacks.

77
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.720
But sharks are more than
capable of inflicting
similar wounds.

78
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.440
The team decides on a name.

79
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.000
HUNTER: I think Stumpy.

80
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.880
MIKE: Stumpy. He looks
pretty fat and happy.
HUNTER: Yeah.

81
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.000
MIKE: Not having any
trouble getting dinner.

82
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.320
NARRATOR: Next. they
ready the state-of-the-art
camera system. Gator Cam.

83
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.040
Armed with depth.
accelerometer. GPS and
temperature sensors.

84
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.920
For the next 24 hours.
it will record every
move Stumpy make.

85
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.800
MIKE: That looks pretty good.

86
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.040
NARRATOR: If he has
a run in with a shark. it
will be caught on camera.

87
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.640
MIKE: Cool?
HUNTER: Yep.

88
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720
MIKE: Clear.

89
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.000
Yes! Yes! Woo!

90
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.000
HUNTER: Yeah!

91
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
MIKE: Yes!

92
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.200
NARRATOR: For the
first time ever. we're
riding on the back

93
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.720
of an alligator as it moves
through the Everglades.

94
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.320
Hugging the edge of
the mangroves. Stumpy
moves north.

95
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.800
just beneath the surface.
at a steady speed of two
miles per hour.

96
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.320
With pressure sensitive cells
around his jaw that detect
the slightest movement.

97
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.720
he's perfectly designed to
hunt in these murky waters.

98
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.720
But how do gators like
Stumpy. with a burst speed
of just 20 miles per hour.

99
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.360
catch faster and
more agile sharks?

100
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.760
Footage captured by a
member of the public
in South Carolina.

101
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.080
provides an important clue.

102
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.680
FEMALE: He is not playing.

103
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.840
MIKE: So. this victim
is a Bonnethead shark.

104
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.400
you can tell right away
from the shape of the head.

105
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.640
and they are a member
of the Hammerhead family

106
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.880
and. you know. from
the size of it.

107
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.840
you could say that's
probably a three and a half

108
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.080
or four foot long shark.
so that's an adult.

109
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.600
Bonnetheads are one of
the species that we
would expect to run

110
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.480
into alligators
fairly often.

111
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.920
They live in shallow water.
sometimes close to mangroves

112
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and also where it's
really murky.

113
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.800
But they're not an
easy meal for a gator.

114
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.320
having that head helps them
be super maneuverable. they
can turn on a dime.

115
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.160
An alligator is not gonna
be able to chase down
and catch a Bonnethead.

116
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.160
but if that gator is lying
motionless on the bottom
and the shark swims along.

117
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.720
a lightning-fast strike
and the gator gets a meal.

118
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.640
NARRATOR: Most of the
victims photographed
by the public

119
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.080
were struck from
below on the abdomen.
they were ambushed.

120
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.280
MIKE: You could see that
these gators are able

121
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.480
to catch sharks that
are three and a half.
four feet long

122
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.560
or even a bit bigger. I
mean. look at the size
of that nurse shark.

123
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.280
relative to that alligator.

124
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.880
These are smash and grab
killers and evolution

125
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.040
has honed those techniques
over millions of years.

126
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.880
But what happens when they
run into a much bigger shark?
Who comes out on top?

127
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.120
REPORTER: Alligators had
people scurrying for sand
today in Collier County.

128
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.600
FWC officers told people.
"Get out of the water."

129
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.880
NARRATOR: In recent years.
there have been growing
reports of America's

130
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.000
gators entering the ocean.

131
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.760
One was even spotted circling
an offshore oil platform.

132
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.720
some 40 miles from the
Louisiana mainland.

133
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.320
Like most crocodilians.
alligators are
freshwater creatures.

134
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.760
if they spend too
much time in salt water
they dehydrate and die.

135
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.520
So why are they
heading out to sea and
how are they doing it?

136
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.120
MIKE: The good news for
most alligators is that
they're fairly big.

137
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.400
so they can go out to
the ocean. slowly take
salt into their body.

138
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.840
it's a bit stressful.
but then they can move
back up to freshwater

139
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.360
and kind of flush their
bodies out and reset.

140
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.600
So. some of the alligators
we watch are commuters.
they'll go out to the ocean.

141
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.320
then they'll come back.

142
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.880
Now if you're an
alligator why would you
go to all that stress?

143
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.720
It's pretty simple. food.

144
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.520
When you look at these
coastal systems. there's
just a ton of life.

145
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.360
here in South Florida
that's especially true.

146
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.960
The further downstream
you move and out into
those coastal oceans.

147
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.080
there's a lot more food
than up at the rivers.

148
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.760
NARRATOR: But out at sea.
it's not just dehydration the
gators need to worry about.

149
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.920
The coast around Florida
is home to some of the
biggest sharks on Earth.

150
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.240
Bulls. Hammerheads. Tigers
and even White sharks all
patrol this rich coastline.

151
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.880
So. what happens when a big
gator and a big shark clash?

152
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.320
The discovery of a severed
croc head in South Africa
could hold the answer.

153
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.640
Saint Lucia beach.
South Africa. 2013.

154
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.480
As Neale and Brigitte
Cary-Smith take their
daily walk along the beach.

155
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.240
they spot a strange
shape on the shoreline.

156
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.200
NEALE: At first. we
thought it was a log
because a lot of

157
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.280
debris floats down
the estuary which
runs into the sea.

158
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.160
But about 30 meters
away. I realized that
it was a crocodile head.

159
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.600
NARRATOR: Turning
their camera on. they
carefully approach.

160
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.720
NEALE: Look how
big that thing is.

161
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.680
As we got closer. we
realized just how big
this head was.

162
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.720
It was absolutely enormous.

163
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.040
BRIGITTE: Just come stand
closer. my darling. just
so people can see the size.

164
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.800
Put your hand on its head.

165
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.720
It's estimated to be in
the region of about a
120. uh. pounds or so.

166
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.440
So. if that was the size of
the head. imagine what the
size of the crocodile was.

167
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.040
It was just very exciting.
and we just realized

168
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.680
we had come across
something quite special.

169
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.560
NARRATOR: Like their alligator
cousin. Nile crocodiles
are freshwater predators.

170
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.680
More at home ambushing
wildebeest. than moving
through the waves.

171
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.760
So. what was this croc
doing out in the ocean?
And what killed it?

172
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.640
NEALE: The more I inspected
the head. the more I saw

173
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.280
that there were teeth
marks on the side of it.

174
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.840
BRIGITTE: And being a
deep-sea fisherman.

175
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.600
he's sorts of quite
knowledgeable about
that kind of thing

176
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.040
and he said to me. "That's
definitely a shark cut."

177
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.160
Something must have
happened. some drama
unfolded here.

178
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.680
NEALE: You can see
where the shark's
actually bitten it.

179
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.440
There's no doubt in my
mind whatsoever that
that was a shark

180
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.920
that had bitten that
crocodile. none whatsoever.

181
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.720
NARRATOR: The wild waters
of South Africa are
world famous for sharks.

182
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:43.520
Tigers. Bulls. Bronze Whalers
and White sharks all patrol
Saint Lucia's shoreline.

183
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:50.240
But could one of them
really have taken on
the huge Nile crocodile?

184
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.920
Mike Heithaus is a
world leading expert in
marine predators.

185
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.760
He's convinced sharks.
crocs and gators

186
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.480
could be clashing far
more regularly than
we ever realized.

187
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.880
MIKE: Looking from the
size of this head.

188
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.920
this was a big croc. I mean
probably over 10 feet long

189
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.320
and it raises a lot
of mysteries like what
was it doing out at sea?

190
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.000
And how did it end
up a head on a beach?

191
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.840
This is a map showing where
that severed head was found.
and when we zoom in here.

192
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.640
what you can is that it
wasn't too far away from two
really major river systems.

193
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.960
So. it's possible that
the crocodile died

194
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.920
in the river system and
the head floated out

195
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.920
or it could have come
into these coastal
waters to feed

196
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.320
because those are
really rich waters.

197
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.200
Now. there are White sharks
in this part of the world.

198
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.240
but White sharks don't
tend to be in those super
shallow turbid waters

199
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.160
where you might
find crocs and gators.

200
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.480
but it could also be a
really big Tiger shark
or a Bull shark.

201
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.720
And the Bull sharks in
this part of the world do
get really. really big.

202
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.480
They're one of the few
species of sharks that will

203
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.920
tangle with animals close
to their own body size.

204
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.400
So yeah. if any
shark's gonna go after
a bigger crocodile.

205
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.040
Bull sharks are
definitely on that list

206
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.720
and those big Bull
sharks do go up into
these river systems.

207
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.960
NARRATOR: Just as at
home in freshwater
as salt water.

208
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.240
Bull sharks have a
unique adaptation

209
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.760
in their kidneys and livers
which allow them to thrive
in both environments.

210
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.760
MIKE: They're famous
for being in turbid
murky waters

211
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.480
and that suite of sensory
systems they have

212
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.160
helps them zero
in on their prey.

213
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.200
NARRATOR: But could
they really take down a
huge Nile croc?

214
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.360
MIKE: Bull sharks when they
get really big do have the
teeth to get through it.

215
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.880
but it might be a pretty
big effort. you know.

216
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.200
and that's one thing when
you look at that head.

217
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.880
if a Bull shark had
done that and the
croc was struggling.

218
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.800
I would have expected a lot
more slashes and cuts.

219
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.720
it wouldn't be a
clean bite through.

220
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.400
they would not be able
to get through that
skin just in one bite.

221
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:22.080
Tiger sharks are really
different predators. their
teeth are curved and serrated.

222
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.680
they are built for cutting.

223
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.280
One of their favorite
foods is sea turtles

224
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.120
and they can cut
straight through the
shell of a turtle.

225
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.760
You know. they've got
this reputation of being
the garbage cans

226
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.680
of the sea and I guess
it's fairly well earned.

227
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.400
I mean. you know. they are
the consummate scavenger.

228
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.320
but in the areas where
there's lots of prey.

229
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.200
they can also be
impressive predators.

230
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.520
They can eat big prey.
they can cut through

231
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.840
something tough like the
hide of an alligator.

232
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.760
so could a Tiger shark eat
an alligator or crocodile?

233
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.680
If they ran into
one. yes. they could.

234
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.640
But. without that severed
head here in front of me. it's
impossible to say if sharks

235
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.160
removed the head
from that crocodile.

236
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.560
Was it poached?

237
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.080
Did this croc die and
then something eat it?

238
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.720
Big boat propellor. there
are lots of things that
could have happened here.

239
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.000
This raises a lot more
questions than answers.

240
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.080
NARRATOR: Four years later.
Saint Lucia estuary

241
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.080
provides the backdrop
for another even more

242
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.040
dramatic shark
croc confrontation.

243
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.360
CASPER: The shark is just
in front of the crocodile.

244
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.080
Did you see that?

245
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.360
NARRATOR: Wildlife guide.
Casper Badenhorst.

246
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.880
is birdwatching along
South Africa's St.
Lucia river mouth

247
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.200
when he spots
something strange
in the water.

248
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.760
CASPER: It was a
perfect day. it was no
wind. it was quiet.

249
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.480
the water was flat and
that's when I noticed
something different.

250
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.560
I start seeing this shark
fin and getting bigger

251
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.440
and coming out of the
water and eventually

252
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.680
the tail of the shark
and I knew this can be
nothing else than a shark.

253
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.760
NARRATOR: Grabbing
his camera. Casper
begins filming.

254
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.680
CASPER: And as I
videoed the shark. from
the corner of my eye.

255
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.600
I was starting to see
a crocodile swimming
towards the shark.

256
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.160
A crocodile. A crocodile
is going to the shark.

257
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.360
The crocodile was twice
the length of the shark.

258
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.280
You could see his aim
was to get the shark
and to take it down.

259
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.760
(inaudible)

260
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.920
The crocodile was
edging closer.

261
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.120
The shark is just in
front of the crocodile.

262
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.920
There was a big splash
and for a few seconds
we couldn't see.

263
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.360
you know. what happened.
The shark went under.

264
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.200
But then a few seconds
later. the shark emerged
and just keep on swimming.

265
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.800
This crocodile was clearly
going for the shark.

266
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.440
going to have as his next
meal and so the shark was
lucky to get away.

267
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.680
MIKE: Oh man. this
is incredible.

268
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.360
I mean. you just don't
see footage like this.

269
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.600
You can see by the way
the crocodile is
shifting its body.

270
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.800
it's aware of that shark
from pretty far away.

271
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.920
and even though
it's aware of it.

272
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.640
it's not really
starting to chase it.

273
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.200
it's just slowly kind
of turning its body

274
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.960
and moving to be on an
interception course.

275
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.280
Then it waits until
it's really close and
it makes that last

276
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.720
super powered kind of
lunge swim to try to
get the shark.

277
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.080
That's a predator
trying to get a meal.

278
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.400
The shark doesn't look
that much smaller than
the crocodile

279
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.320
and so you'd think
they'd be fairly

280
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.760
evenly matched. but the
crocodile just doesn't
care at all and. I mean.

281
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.160
if you think about crocodiles.
they are really good at
getting big prey. I mean.

282
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.800
zebra. wildebeest.
they don't care that
it's a shark.

283
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.440
So. you know. this starts
to ask that question.

284
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.080
what happens when they're
more evenly matched?

285
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.720
If the crocodile is
in position. it's
gonna have a shot.

286
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.800
NARRATOR: Back in
the Everglades. the
investigation

287
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.040
into the suspected
shark gator
battleground heats up.

288
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.320
MIKE: Clear!

289
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.680
NARRATOR: With the camera
tag successfully deployed

290
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.920
on a big adult male
gator called Stumpy.

291
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.760
MIKE: Yes! Yes!

292
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.040
NARRATOR: the team's
attention now turns to sharks.

293
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.520
Setting a series of baited
lines across the bay.

294
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.000
it's not long before they
get their first bite.

295
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.000
MIKE: Hey shark.

296
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.320
That is bite size
for a big gator.

297
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.720
NARRATOR: It's a Bull
shark and at four feet
long. a juvenile.

298
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.920
A miniature camera tag
prepped. within minutes the

299
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.280
shark is released back
into the battle zone.

300
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.280
MIKE: Yes!
MAN: Woo!

301
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.880
MIKE: Good job.
MAN: Good work.

302
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.560
MIKE: I mean that was
amazing. you know.

303
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.920
for a shark in the trip and
it was the perfect size

304
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.280
for the camera and that's
a really cool size

305
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.040
of Bull shark in this area
because it's small enough

306
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.880
that it could get eaten
by a really big gator.

307
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.720
but it's big enough that
baby gators could be on the
menu for that.

308
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.560
Oh. aren't they cute?

309
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.080
NARRATOR: Over the
next few hours. five
more Bulls are caught.

310
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.920
and tiny acoustic transmitters
inserted inside their bodies.

311
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.800
The data they collect could
change our understanding of
how these sharks survive

312
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.080
in such dangerous waters.

313
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.440
KRISTINE: So that tag has a
Pinger essentially that sets
off at a certain frequency.

314
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:12.200
roughly every 90 seconds.
and all across the bay we
have acoustic receivers

315
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.200
which are just these
listening devices that
will pick up those pings.

316
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.520
so that we can
essentially track the
Bull shark's movements

317
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.360
throughout the bay as
it's passing each of
those receivers.

318
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.560
NARRATOR: Will their
movements overlap with
Stumpy. the alligator?

319
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.760
And will the camera tags
capture the first underwater
footage of a clash?

320
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.760
If it does. it will
be a world first.

321
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.640
MIKE: If you go that way.
there are alligators.

322
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.360
that way. there are
alligators and here we
are with Bull sharks

323
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.240
all over the place.

324
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.480
So. it really shows this
is the collision zone for
these two big predators.

325
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.440
NARRATOR: As the team
waits for their camera
tags to pop off.

326
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.360
the investigation
heads to Maryland.

327
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.880
where new research suggests
shark gator conflicts have
been taking place here

328
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.680
for millions of years.

329
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.680
And the sharks sometimes
come out on top.

330
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.680
STEPHEN: A professional
collector came to visit me.

331
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.080
his name is Dougie
Douglas and he's well
known in the area

332
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.080
for collecting fossils
from along Calvert Cliffs.

333
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.600
And he came to my office
with this coprolite.

334
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.280
Now a coprolite is the
technical term that we give

335
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.440
to fossilized feces and
we think that this

336
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.080
kind of coprolite came
originally from a crocodile.

337
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.120
But when he first
showed it to me.

338
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.800
I just could not
believe what my eyes
were seeing because

339
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:54.800
there are tooth impressions
along both surfaces. deep
ones on this flattened side.

340
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.840
but more shallow ones
on this convex side and
it's really clear that

341
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.840
these tooth impressions
were actually made by a
shark.

342
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.160
NARRATOR: 23 million
years ago. ancient sharks

343
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.160
and crocodiles roamed
this coastline hunting
for prey like turtles.

344
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.880
But did they also
prey on each other?

345
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.000
Stephen is convinced this
fossil holds the answer.

346
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:39.040
STEPHEN: I thought to myself.
"If I take a liquid molding.
I'll be able to see hopefully

347
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:45.560
the shape of the teeth
that penetrated into
the coprolite."

348
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.800
Now. one of the amazing
things about sharks

349
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.120
is that you can almost
always identify the
species of shark

350
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.400
by the shape of
the tooth.

351
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.400
And by looking at
the natural cast.

352
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.000
I was able to determine that
these teeth came from

353
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.040
one of the extinct kinds of
Tiger sharks that we find
along Calvert Cliffs.

354
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.320
NARRATOR: The culprit
is identified.

355
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.080
But one mystery
remains. How were the
teeth marks made?

356
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.120
STEPHEN: So. when I
noticed that the shark
tooth impressions

357
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.280
did not equally penetrate
into the coprolite.

358
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.240
I wondered why that was?

359
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.880
Because if the shark had
bitten the feces and they had
been floating in the water.

360
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.520
I would have expected
the teeth in the upper
and lower jaws

361
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.160
to have equally penetrated
into the fresh feces.

362
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.920
I realized that maybe
the feces were not outside
the body of the crocodile.

363
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.720
but still within the
abdominal cavity and
that's why the teeth

364
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.440
had not equally penetrated
both sides of the coprolite.

365
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.840
That when the shark
ploughed into the abdomen.

366
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.880
its teeth penetrated one
side further than the other.

367
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.280
this then came detached
from the rest of the
crocodile's body.

368
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.920
sank to the bottom of
the ocean. was entombed
by sediments

369
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.160
and 15 million years later
was found by Dougie Douglas.

370
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.800
Clearly. crocodilians.
which are apex predators.

371
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.360
and sharks. which are
also apex predators.

372
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.200
have been clashing
for millions of years.

373
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.680
NARRATOR: Could modern
day sharks take down a
crocodile?

374
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.640
MIKE: I mean. this
is really incredible.

375
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.240
NARRATOR: The investigation
heads down under.
in search of answers.

376
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.560
The Northern
Territory. Australia.

377
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.600
Home to the biggest
crocodilians on Earth.
saltwater crocs.

378
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.720
In the rivers here.
salties rule supreme.

379
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:10.000
Bulls. Sawfish. and
Spear tooth sharks all
patrol these waterways.

380
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.880
But they're no match for
the salties. which can
reach 20 feet in length.

381
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.200
In recent years.
clash after clash has been
recorded along these rivers.

382
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.360
With crocs coming out on
top every single time.

383
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.480
Ten percent of the
river sharks have
scars from attacks.

384
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.680
Hunted to near
extinction in the 1960s.

385
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.760
in recent years
salty numbers have
been exploding.

386
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.680
Now. up to 200.000 live
in Northern Australian.

387
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.720
And running out of space
in the rivers. they're
heading out to sea.

388
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.360
MIKE: Saltwater crocodiles
are the champions of the
crocodile world

389
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.840
when it comes to spending
time in the ocean.

390
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.800
and it's because they can get
rid of the salt so well.

391
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.920
they have salt glands on their
tongue. they keep pumping
that salt out of there.

392
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.960
You know. it's not uncommon
for them to make movements

393
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.440
of more than 100
kilometers out to sea

394
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.720
and that's one of the
reasons that they've spread
over such a big area.

395
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.240
NARRATOR: But despite their
ability to spend several
weeks in salt water.

396
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.080
growing evidence suggests
they might not be as dominant
over sharks here in the ocean.

397
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.560
Alan Withers lives and
works in one of Australia's

398
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.320
most remote areas. the
Cobourg Peninsula.

399
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.200
ALAN: We can go for two.
three months without
seeing other people.

400
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.840
we're cut off around
four months a year.

401
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.320
during the wet
season. by rivers
which are impassable.

402
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.440
NARRATOR: While people
are thin on the ground.
turtles are not.

403
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.840
Throughout the year. they
head to the peninsula's

404
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.440
isolated beaches to
lay their eggs.

405
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.520
And the coastal crocodiles
take full advantage.

406
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.880
ALAN: The crocodiles
troll the beaches.

407
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.240
just waiting for a turtle
to come up and nest.

408
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.600
and bang. gotcha.

409
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.960
NARRATOR: In 2016. Alan
captured something
extraordinary.

410
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.840
ALAN: We'd seen a crocodile
a fair way offshore

411
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.080
heading towards the
beach with the turtle
in its mouth.

412
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.480
So. I put the drone
up and sent it out.

413
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.400
NARRATOR: His
footage was a first.

414
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.920
The croc was being tailed
by a pack of sharks.

415
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
ALAN: They were pretty
much onto it straightaway.
they come in like bullets.

416
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.720
NARRATOR: As the croc
tries to flee with the
turtle in its mouth.

417
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.240
more and more sharks
arrive including a
large Tawny Nurse shark.

418
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.600
ALAN: And the big Tawny
sharks and the Blacktips

419
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.400
were actually swimming
up beside him and

420
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.720
nipping chunks off it
while it was in the
crocodile's mouth.

421
00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.960
By the time the crocodile
got to the beach.

422
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.560
all it had left was
literally an empty shell.

423
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.600
The sharks had
stolen the lot.

424
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.880
NARRATOR: Incredibly
this clash between
packs of sharks

425
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.960
and huge saltwater
crocodiles is not a one off.

426
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.000
ALAN: It's a regular
event. whenever a large
crocodile catches a turtle.

427
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.120
there's certainly a
percentage of body fluid

428
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.640
and blood in the water
which attracts the sharks

429
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.920
and. indeed. pretty much most
times that we've seen large
crocodiles with turtles.

430
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.040
the sharks. they're present
for an easy meal. ripping
bits off as it goes.

431
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.400
MIKE: So. yeah. this footage
shows just how complex

432
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.560
the relationship between
sharks and crocs can be.

433
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.600
It's not just about
who eats who.

434
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.600
this shows that sharks
might actually take
advantage of crocodiles.

435
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.840
none of those sharks
on their own.

436
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.760
could really match up one
on one with that crocodile.

437
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.600
But with those numbers. you
know. in that ocean realm.

438
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.800
where they've got
lots of space to maneuver.

439
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.800
the croc's got
no chance if it wants
to try to keep its meal.

440
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.520
'cause as soon as it. you
know. looks at one shark.
another one comes in.

441
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.880
But while this footage is
unique. and I would bet that
this kind of interaction

442
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.480
is happening a lot
more often than we
think because

443
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.080
sharks are kind of the
ultimate opportunists.

444
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.920
and a free meal is not
something they'll pass up.

445
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.880
NARRATOR: Across the
mangroves and
twisted waterways

446
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.960
of Rookery Bay in the
Everglades.

447
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.000
a unique experiment
is coming to an end.

448
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.120
For the past 24 hours.
camera tags record
every move

449
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.120
alligators and
Bull sharks make

450
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.400
in the suspected shark
gator battleground.

451
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.360
KRISTINE: Alright. it's like
a lot louder over there.

452
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.080
NARRATOR: Now released.
they're emitting a weak
VHF signal

453
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.000
the team is using to zero
in on their location.

454
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.360
KRISTINE: Woo! We did it.

455
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.560
NARRATOR: And the data
inside shows Stumpy
striking to kill.

456
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.080
MIKE: Oh man.

457
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.840
NARRATOR: Back at
base. Mike analyses
Stumpy's data.

458
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.880
MIKE: This is super
cool. I mean. this
is the first time

459
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.960
we've been able to put a
camera on an alligator
in these coastal

460
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.360
Everglades waters. you
know. there's just so
much we're gonna

461
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.960
be able to learn by
getting this window
into their world.

462
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.360
NARRATOR: Stumpy spends
most of the night hugging
the edge of the mangroves

463
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.520
and resting at the surface.

464
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.640
MIKE: But then at about
2:45 in the morning.

465
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.680
things change. and he
goes into hunting mode.

466
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.440
You see him a couple of
times make these big lunges
to try to catch something.

467
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.880
You can also see
in one of these.

468
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.960
a fish swim into the frame
and then as it swims out.

469
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.160
Stumpy makes a big
lunge to try to catch it
as it's swimming away.

470
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.840
And alligators have these
sensors called dome pressure
sensors on their snout.

471
00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.680
and those sense
vibrations in the water.

472
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.880
So that fish swimming by
would have triggered those

473
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.560
and he just lunged
to try to catch it.

474
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.880
You can see from that
speed. if a little Bull
shark got too close.

475
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.720
Stumpy could catch it.

476
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.120
NARRATOR: GPS coordinates
from Stumpy's tag

477
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.880
reveal exactly where and
when he was hunting.

478
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.280
At two in the morning.
he moves out into the canal

479
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.800
and his movements become
a lot more purposeful

480
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.120
as he moves upstream
looking for prey.

481
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.000
MIKE: You know. why
did that change
happen? We don't know.

482
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:59.080
I mean. maybe that's
it's favorite hunting
time and hunting ground.

483
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.920
But then. you know. as
we get onto six thirty
in the morning.

484
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.400
unfortunately something
else happened.

485
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.520
The camera and the
GPS stopped working.

486
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.520
but luckily the
depth sensor and the
accelerometer

487
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.680
kept on going and the
data we got from those
is really intriguing.

488
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.240
So. this graph is showing
us the depth where
Stumpy is spending time.

489
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.160
and the yellow shows us
how fast it's moving.

490
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.800
Things change when
the sun comes up.
Stumpy's going down

491
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.160
to the bottom and
just being completely

492
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.680
motionless for long
periods of time. maybe 20
minutes or more.

493
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.640
And then you have
these quick bursts up.

494
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.640
where he changes
the depth and you
see that kind of

495
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.720
explosive speed.
which could be him
lunging at prey

496
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.000
and that's kind of what
we'd expect for a sit
and wait predator.

497
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.720
especially during the day.

498
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.160
NARRATOR: It's a unique
insight into how gators
ambush their prey

499
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.560
and are able to bring down
faster and more agile sharks.

500
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.720
MIKE: So. here's what
we think is going on. those
alligators are lying in wait.

501
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.920
their dark skin probably
blends in with the
habitat around them.

502
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.200
And then when something
like a shark swims over
the top. they detect it.

503
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.920
they can burst up
from the bottom with
that powerful tail

504
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.720
and grab that shark on
the soft underbelly

505
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.040
before it even knows
the alligator is there.

506
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.840
And. you know. that's
really the only way
these gators

507
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.040
are gonna be able
to catch sharks

508
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.800
that are faster and more
agile than they are.

509
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.680
NARRATOR: Footage from
sharkcam reveals just
how hard it is

510
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.160
for sharks to spot
the gators in these
murky waters.

511
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.760
MIKE: You can see that the
visibility is terrible.

512
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.520
and this is really
typical of the waters

513
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.640
that these Bull
sharks are inhabiting.

514
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.680
Virtually zero visibility.
so they can't rely on

515
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.760
their eyes to find a
meal or avoid predators

516
00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.200
which can include
big alligators.

517
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.840
NARRATOR: Despite the
dangers. evidence from
the acoustic tags

518
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.720
fitted inside the sharks.

519
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.920
shows just how close
they come to gators on
a daily basis.

520
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.520
MIKE: The baby Bull
sharks are spending the
majority of their time

521
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.960
in the mouth of
the river here.

522
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.800
they're in these
very shallow bays.

523
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.000
Occasionally though.
they are going
upstream and. in fact.

524
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.480
when we look at the
monitors here.

525
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.920
there's a shark that
hits them all pretty
much every day.

526
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.640
and we know that
alligators go

527
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.280
further down than
Stumpy did. we've seen
them right here

528
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.480
at the very base
of the habitat.

529
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.800
where all of these sharks
are spending a lot of time.

530
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.120
NARRATOR: The team
may not have captured
a clash on camera.

531
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.120
but it's groundbreaking
evidence

532
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.040
that the Everglades is a
shark croc battleground.

533
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.760
MIKE: Yeah look. when you
see these tracks and you look
at the data we've collected.

534
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.280
there's no question
that Bull sharks

535
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.640
and alligators overlap a
ton and that's why we're

536
00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.600
starting to see more
and more pictures

537
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.680
and videos come in
from around the world
of crocodiles

538
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.080
and alligators that
have eaten sharks.

539
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.120
NARRATOR: But do meetings
always end in confrontation?

540
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.920
Back in Australia.
the death of a whale
brings a ten-foot

541
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.840
shark and a 13-foot
croc face to face.

542
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:41.880
Around the world. evidence
of crocs and gators clashing
with sharks is on the rise.

543
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.920
In Florida. research shows
their territories overlap

544
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.680
and sharks sometimes end
up on the gator menu.

545
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.560
In South Africa. Nile
crocodiles attack Bull sharks

546
00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.440
and mysterious severed
heads wash up on beaches.

547
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.480
And off the coast of
Australia. sharks
use their strength

548
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.200
in numbers to mock crocs
and steal their food.

549
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:15.040
Now. remarkable new
evidence suggests shark
croc encounters

550
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.880
might not always end
in confrontation.

551
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.760
The Kimberley Coast.
Western Australia.

552
00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.640
Jeremy Tucker is skippering
a whale spotting cruise

553
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.120
when he comes across
the body of a huge

554
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.320
50 foot Humpback floating
four miles from the coast.

555
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.720
JEREMY: We realized
that it was upside down
and just floating.

556
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.800
so we went over
to the whale.

557
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.680
and we realized that
there was a few sharks
feeding on it.

558
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.040
And as we got closer.
we realized that they
were Tiger sharks

559
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.040
and there was a couple
of really big ones.

560
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.400
NARRATOR: Around the world.
the death of the whale

561
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.720
often triggers a
shark feeding frenzy.

562
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.600
Whale blubber is one of
the most energy rich
foods in the ocean.

563
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.560
Every pound contains
over 3000 calories.

564
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.280
A single whale can
attract over 200 sharks.

565
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.880
But today. the
sharks have company.

566
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.320
JEREMY: I decided to
put the drone up.

567
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.480
and there was a lot of bite
marks out of the whale.

568
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.920
As we got closer. we realized
that there was a croc
there feeding on the whale.

569
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.600
It was really unique.
and we all realized that.

570
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.920
He was probably about
three meters long

571
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.720
and he wasn't fussed
about the sharks around.

572
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.400
he just did his own thing.
and he was sort of trying

573
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.600
to sit on the pectoral
fin and. and get a feed.

574
00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.760
The bigger Tiger
shark actually went
underneath the whale

575
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.520
and sort of stayed
in the shadows.

576
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.160
They didn't seem to be too
worried about each other.
I think the food was there

577
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.480
and they had plenty to
eat. so they were happy.

578
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.280
NARRATOR: For 45 minutes
this unique footage shows

579
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.000
the two predators feeding
on the huge whale carcass.

580
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.680
JEREMY: I think they
were pretty full.

581
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.800
We noticed the Tiger
shark swimming around
and just having a bite.

582
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.440
and a little bit of a shake
and then swimming off.

583
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.640
But there was no
aggressiveness or
there was no feeding

584
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.320
frenzy or anything
like that.

585
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.600
So obviously they had
been feeding on that
whale for a while.

586
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.000
NARRATOR: As Jeremy is
about to leave. something
extraordinary happens.

587
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.880
The croc and the shark
begin feeding within
inches of each other.

588
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.280
JEREMY: And when we first
saw it. we seriously thought
it was quite unique. I mean.

589
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.600
you just don't see that.

590
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.920
MIKE: I mean. this is
incredible. I mean.

591
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.120
you know. sharks feeding
from a whale carcass.

592
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.760
that's something you're
used to seeing. but a
crocodile?

593
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.960
Yeah. I've never seen that.

594
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.680
We usually think of
crocs. gators and sharks

595
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.080
as the consummate
predators. you know.

596
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.120
chasing or ambushing their
prey. but they are not
gonna pass up a free meal.

597
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.520
and they are amazing
scavengers. and when you
find a bonanza like a whale.

598
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.560
these animals can fill
their stomachs up

599
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.040
and go many months without
having to eat again.

600
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.840
So. this is a real
windfall for them.

601
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.840
And when you've got this
much food around.

602
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.080
you wouldn't expect
there to be any
aggressive interactions.

603
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.480
the predatory instincts
are put aside

604
00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.920
and it's all about just
having a free meal.

605
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.200
But if you took that
food source away. things
could be very different.

606
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.720
Crocs and sharks are two
amazing predator groups

607
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.680
that have been interacting
for millions of years.

608
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.160
But in the 20th century their
populations have plummeted.

609
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.920
Now they're just
starting to rebound

610
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.440
and we're seeing
the interactions
happen more often.

611
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.560
and there are more
people out there filming
and photographing it.

612
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.920
When you go up into the
rivers and estuaries.

613
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.080
it looks like the crocs
and gators reign supreme.

614
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.760
They've got the size.
they've got the burst speed.

615
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.920
you know. small sharks
that live there. they
can be on the menu.

616
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.960
But as you move out to
the ocean. that is the
shark's ground

617
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.920
and the sharks those
gators and crocs run into

618
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.800
are gonna probably
be a lot bigger.

619
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.360
So. if I were a croc or
a gator in the ocean.

620
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.360
I'd watch my back
a bit more.

621
