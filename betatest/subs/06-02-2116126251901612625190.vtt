(serene accordion music)

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.200
- Do people say you
know. was this your dream

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.400
when you set out to do a game?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.040
This is way beyond any
dream that existed then.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.760
I mean. you couldn't have
dreamt this back then.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.960
It. we're creating the
dream. we created the dream.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.720
And I feel like THPS was a huge part

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.200
of why skateboarding is here to stay.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.320
Why it's in the Olympics.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.280
Why it's. what kids gravitate to.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.520
more so than team sports now.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.280
A big reason that I'm still here.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.680
that I'm still even relevant in this world

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560
is because of that series.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.600
I mean for sure it's
the reason I'm standing

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.640
on this million dollar ramp
that I get to skate everyday.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.200
(skateboard wheels rumble)

(old school upbeat piano music)

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.440
- Well in the 80s the skateboard scene

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.080
had a lot of ups and downs.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.920
I remember when I got
into it the late 70s.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.720
it was pretty popular.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.200
Skate parks were getting
built all over the country

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.400
specially California side.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.600
And then around 1980. '81. I don't know

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.120
something happened and it
just kinda just crashed.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.280
And all the skate board
parks that I would see

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.160
in the magazine were like closing.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.440
- You know the skate boarding
scene in the early 80s

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.320
was raw. it was backyard.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.600
We went from skate parks being

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.400
where we performed and did competitions

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.120
to now it's backyard ramps.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.160
Thrasher Magazine just came out in 1981.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.200
Transworld and. we really took
it to a underground level.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.560
We were making seven hundred
bucks for first place contest.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.200
Just wanting a picture in the magazine.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.360
But you know what to us. it
was like a million bucks.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.040
And so it didn't matter. we
were going to do it regardless.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.160
But. we were really paving
the way for what it is today.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.360
- When I first started skating.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.920
I didn't even know other people skated.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.400
I didn't know anything about it cause.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.080
I'd grew on up in Alabama and
it was. pretty. pretty rural.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.000
We had like pigs and
chickens and goats and stuff

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.320
and skateboarding was like
not even on my radar so.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.960
if it wasn't on like the weekly episode

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.040
of'' Dukes of Hazard. '' I
didn't know anything about it.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
- There was a couple of demos at my school

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520
that they'd come in on a
plexiglass ramp (chuckles)

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.440
and. I really liked it .

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.000
I like the transition skating and.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.080
But every time I. like my friends

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.800
had a quarter pipe down the street.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.200
and I'd go skate and
try to skate with them

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.320
and they would just make fun of me.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.480
you know it was late 70s and kids are like

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.000
telling me that I can't skate
because girls don't skate.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.040
- Skating grew in the 80s because it was.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.000
sort of. new. flashy
activity and you know.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.520
skating kinda went through
an underground phase

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.680
in the late 70s.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.160
And when it emerged it was
suddenly this new sport

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.920
with acrobatics and aerials
out of swimming pools

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920
and it was exciting and it was irreverent.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.920
Kids were in to it you know.
cause their parents hated it.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.760
(chuckles)

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.600
- Skating wasn't popular.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.000
I couldn't even begin to
use the term mainstream

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.280
until mid 80s.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.160
I think 86. I don't know. whenever it was.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.480
But going on tour every year.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.080
suddenly we went from a few
people showing up at demos

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.040
to being surrounded.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.400
- We kept continuous skating

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.080
and kept promoting and kept traveling.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.520
We even started making videos.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.040
(loud bang)

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.680
- Now this is a skateboard.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.360
- So the earliest videos.
Stacy Peralta. created that.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.080
And he turned it into. for
what it was an art form.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.040
And he put so much thought into it.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.040
Structurally it was so professional.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.880
The word got out. the
videos become a huge success

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.520
and we started getting this momentum.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.960
We started selling
skateboard more and more.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.760
Bigger companies wanted to use.
the skaters in like movies.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.520
commercials and a contest
started happening again.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.080
We started doing skateboard
contests in like colossseums

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.600
and auditoriums where
we had built huge ramps

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.960
and people would. you know come all.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.080
all over the world to just try
to come and meet these pros

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.200
that they've seen in these
videos now and those magazines.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.360
By the late 80s it was huge.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.920
(crowd cheers)

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.200
(wheels rumble)

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.760
(crowd cheers)

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.920
- [Commentator] All right
lets give him a big hand.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.440
Last run of the day.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.480
- There was a big
transition in the late 80s

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.120
early 90s from vert
skating. like vert skating

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.840
was like what was on television.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.600
It was like what was portrayed as the cool

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.480
thing in skateboarding.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.800
But vert skating wasn't
accessible for every kid.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.200
Especially like myself.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.320
I didn't have a vert ramp.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.920
I had a driveway and a
street in front of my house.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.880
- In that time there wasn't
all these skate parks

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.840
to go skate (chuckles). like there is now.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.880
So. it was such a different time

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.320
compared to like. oh where
are we gonna skate today.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.280
- With all the skate park
closures in the late 80s.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.080
skating. the only way
skating could survive

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.520
was if you were doing it on the streets

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.080
because there were no facilities

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.560
designated for skate boarding anymore.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.240
- Everyone just started.
kind of at a default

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.880
just skating what they had
which was streets you know.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.240
You had streets in front of your house

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.720
and everyone had like a town. a downtown

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.840
were you lived in even if you
lived in the smallest town

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.800
you still had a downtown.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.040
- So people took what they loved

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.840
and started doing it out in the wild.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.080

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.200
- Street skating started
to become like the thing

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.560
that was very attractive.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.120
Where a kid could get a board
and just go out and skate

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.680
in the streets.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.480
And because of that. all the
stars that were vert skaters

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.560
really didn't have a place to perform

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.920
because like people just
wanted to see a street skater.

- No one skated vert anymore so

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.160
we had to get really technical.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
They had to get technical in street.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.880
To be the best you gotta
be the most technical

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.760
so you gotta somehow figure out

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.200
how to fling that board around.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.360
Whether it would be late. early or

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.560
both a combination of early and late.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.960
And getting to fling that thing
around and get back on it.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.440
Who cares what it looked like
to do that. you just did it.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.320
All the guys that I feel
like made it out of that

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.200
made it through that. that shit storm

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.200
was. have been able to sort
of have that understanding

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.280
of like. this could be gone at any moment.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.120
Be prepared.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.360
- Yeah with skateboarding
it had these huge explosions

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.640
in the 70s. and then kinda died out.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.920
Then it happened in the 80s again

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.760
and then it kinda died out.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.120
And then the 90s. it
was just the early 90s

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.280
it was like. I remember that time period

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.800
where I would go out skate
boarding all around Arizona

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.640
or Las Vegas. and be the only skater

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.840
for you know. weeks on end.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.800
And if you saw another
skater boarder at that time

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.120
you were instantly like. ''Whoa. a skater.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.040
like what's up homie?''

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.080
Like we're friends you
know like (chuckles)

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.240
like instantly friends just
because you skateboarded.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.600
- I was a fading vert skater so it was

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.320
especially hard for me cause
the interest in vert skating

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.240
had dropped off almost completely.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.360
And my income was getting
cut in half every month

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.680
by my sponsors. by my royalties.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.160
And so I started doing whatever
I could taking on jobs.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.120
I had a little bit of an editing system.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.480
video editing system so I
would take freelance work

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.440
doing that.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.720
Usually from other skate companies.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.320
Actually from a video game
company as well coincidentally.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.160
And. it was hard.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.280
It was super hard but I
didn't want to quite skating

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.320
so I made it work however I could.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.760
(techno music)

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.160
- There was this element of change

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.880
but it was good because
it really made people

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.800
think about you know. what they love

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.280
and if they were really committed to it.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.240
Whether I wads truly in
love with skate boarding.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.480
it was a challenged.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.400
Was I going to quit cause the industry

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.720
went down in my area?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.480
Or I'm gonna still skate anyway.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.160
I choose to still skate anyway.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.560
(heavy metal rock music)

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.360
- I mean skating in the 90s was just raw.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.080
Like everybody that was doing it.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.520
was. you know. you were
part of a small group

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.840
that were completely dedicated to it.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.280
You felt like in the 90s
everything about skateboarding

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.200
was an us versus them mentality.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.440
Like. you got it and only
the people that you knew

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.120
would understand it and
nobody else can get it

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.760
- Street skating is now
evolving with tricks.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.160
From Rodney Mullins. you know. invention

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.280
of probably two thirds
of all the street tricks

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.680
you know. in the early 80s he
was inventing these things.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.440
And then by the early 90s he was actually

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.280
even doing it in the street.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.320
Putting a video park that looked

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.280
almost like a PlayStation game.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.480
(upbeat guitar music)

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.320
- It was just really go get the trick.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.640
It doesn't matter how it
looks in terms of perfection

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.200
of the shot. just get the trick.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.920
And go out and do this until you get it.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.080
And that was Rubbish Heap.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.120
We created almost
intentionally to look rough.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.120
and you know bad as oppose and contrast

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.480
to the sort of slick or silky
or were very professional

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.320
whatever you think of the "Bonus Brigade".

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.600
The tricks. the community. the identity.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.480
that meant a lot.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.120
Where we would all work
and focus on a part

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.640
and every little trick
you got. you focused on

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.680
okay what next. how I can outdo that next.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.600
Where am I taking this?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.680
(upbeat electronic guitar music)

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.600
- With the sort of underground revolution

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.760
of street skating in the mid 90s.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.960
suddenly it came in to the forefront again

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.720
because it was like. wait a second.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.800
these skaters are doing something new

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.960
that you couldn't deny.
you couldn't avoid.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.200
because it was right
there in all the cities.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.560
- Skateboarding with the economy.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.080
it started kinda booming again.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.440
It started picking up
momentum and by the time

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.240
we got to the mid 90s. it was peaking

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.560
the mainstreams interest.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.800
So they wanted to create
a skateboard contest

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.560
that puts skateboarding on the grand stage

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.800
and that was the X games.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.000
(funky techno music)

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.920
So in '95. the X games started

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.200
and the first one was in Rhode Island.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.920
And it was the first kinda contest

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.640
to put skateboarding onto
televisions everywhere

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.760
and kinda put it into
everyone's households.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.760
- [TV Narrator] Extreme
skateboarders rolled over

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.840
the roadway.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.080
- When I watch it on TV. it was horrible.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.040
I just wanted to turn the volume down.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.440
It was just like what are
these guys talking about.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.680
this is not what we are. who we are.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.520
This is not our scene.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.720
this is not what we think.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.320
You know. the commentators were off.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.560
like everything was off about it.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.840
But you know. it was
exposure so how do we.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.320
instead of going like. oh boycott.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.920
you know. you go like.
how do we figure that out.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.520
How do we make it to where the message

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.040
is right and we get it out there.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.920
And as time went by.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.240
they start. you know. kept going.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.600
They kept tweaking the event.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.760
And we. you know. there
was advisory boards

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.560
that were formed.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.360
Tony and I were on one and. you know.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.800
just kinda. you know.
tryna explain to them.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.280
it was just this whole nother. you know.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.400
sports world trying to say
this is what skateboarding is

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.520
and we're just saying. ''Hey that's cool.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.000
We wanna have that exposure but. this is

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.960
what skateboarding is.''

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.040
- Most of my run was just doing
what vertical tricks I could

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.440
on this speed course.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.360
So I didn't even expect It
that long. when I had it.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.360
- Tony Hawk become this
poster child for the X games.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.000
And everybody was like you
know oh Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.560
and he's very successful.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.760
And people talked like. you know.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.400
he had made money off of it.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.880
And other people that weren't
a part of skateboarding

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.640
who may have looked at skateboarding

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.440
as a bunch of young punks
who would never amount

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.160
to anything or achieve anything.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.480
now looked at them like.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.160
oh wow these kids can become
something. can make money

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.440
and are on television.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.760
- [Sports Commentator] His style is really

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760
what he's know for.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.480
- [TV Narrator] Nice
50 50 across in down.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.840
- [Sports Commentator] Making
the hard stuff look easy.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.480
- I don't know if there ever a moment

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.000
when I was like a younger kid

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.320
where I'm like. this has to be my career.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.680
I was just like I saw
these dudes doing it on TV

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.600
and. like.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.880
I just wanted to do it
at that level. you know.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.360
I wanted to be that good.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.800
Definitely seeing the X
games and seeing. you know.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.320
guys on TV and stuff
like. definitely helped

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.760
push me in that direction
of like. oh I wanna do this.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.640
But. I think it was just like..

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.680
I wanna just be as good as them.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.160
And then the career
stuff kinda came later.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.640
(hopeful music)

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.160
Skateboarding is
interesting and it's cool.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
It's cool to watch. its
different than everything else.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.040
It's creative. it's rebellious
and people enjoyed it.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.880
You know and the X games seemed
like they found their niche

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.400
and they fired skateboarding
into homes everywhere.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.200
- A lot of these games
I knew in their arcade.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.280
you know. era. long before
they reached the home era.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.640
It was really great.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.560
And of course as time went on
and the extreme sports games

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.880
became more and more
popular. eventually this game

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.120
became a real big deal in the arcade.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.560
This was tremendous.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.800
720. 720 one of the earliest. you
know. skateboarding games.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.040
It was a very big deal in the arcade.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.880
And the reason I know from my
prospective at Twin Galaxies

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.600
how big of a deal it was.
by the number of people

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.880
competing to be the world record holder.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.920
- [Interviewer] Tony
what have we got here?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.160
- 720 by Atari. its pretty hot.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.120
- [Interviewer] So where
are you skating right now?

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.720
- Just like around the city
and then I gotta go find a park

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.720
to skate at.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.400
- I've heard you've always
been a gamer to some extent?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.240
- Yeah.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.200
Well I have played video
games since their inception.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.040
You know.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.440
since going to arcade. playing
PacMan. Missile Command.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.080
Having an Atari at home. you know.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.920
Getting into the Super Nintendo.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.360
So I was an arcade kid really.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.360
Skate games were rare.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.040
You know. they made 720
then they made Skate or Die

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.400
for Commodore 64.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.160
California games had skateboarding in it.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.480
But it was few and far
between that (mumbles)

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.720
when it was included at all
in any kind of video game.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.840
And I always knew that it
would be a fun platform

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.960
to make a game. whether
it be a home console

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.960
or a stand up arcade game.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.920
And eventually Top Skater came around

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.760
and I felt like that was a
step in the right direction.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.640
At least it was more experiential.
standing on the board

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.120
and you're controlling
the moves a little bit.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.720
But I always felt like there
was something more to it

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.280
that could be explored.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.080
(guitar strums)

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.360
(loud crash)

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.280
- I never thought to care about.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.280
because Joel. Chris and I were all working

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.160
at Malibu together and
Joel had seen people

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.800
leaving Malibu and starting
their own companies.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.520
And making a lot of money doing it.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.120
So Joel thought. he'd do that.
he'd start his own company.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.440
He gathered together the
best people he could find

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.560
which was me and Chris at the time.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.040
and we got a deal doing a
game called Skelton Warriors

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.480
which was a little side
scrolling. slashing game.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.520
(loud bangs)

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.440
After Skeleton Warriors we were looking

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.480
for another project and we
got a deal doing this game

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.640
called Big Guns for Sony.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.880
It didn't really work out
and Sony canceled the game.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.080
So we had a real. really
hard time around that period.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.400
where we were looking for another project.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.360
And then we eventually did this game

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.320
called Apocalypse for Activision.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.960
(fast drumbeat)

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.640
And that worked out really well.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.960
We did a very quick game.
we knocked it out in a year.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.520
And. after that. Activision wanted

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.160
to continue working with us
cause it worked out so well.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.040
- I got approached by a PC developer

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.200
that wanted to do a video
game based on skateboarding.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.240
And he had a very crude engine.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.440
It was all keyboard commands.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.800
He asked if I would go pitch this idea

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.560
to different publishing companies

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.520
and just came up against
a lot of hesitation.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.880
A lot of negativity.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.480
People just said you know.
skateboarding is not popular.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.560
Why would a skateboarding game be popular?

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.040
He finally gave up on it and said look.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.240
I you know. I can't go
any further with this.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.000
but your name is out there now
for the video game companies.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.840
And he was right.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.280
I got a call from Nintendo
to come up and talk to them.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.840
They said no.(chuckles)

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.200
I had been working with Neversoft

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.800
on a game called Apocalypse

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.200
And then around that time
in the halls of Activision

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.880
there was an idea to do
a skateboarding game.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.800
So. we kinda got that going.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.200
We hired Neversoft to
start building a demo.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.920
And then we started looking
for who could we attach

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.200
to that project to kinda
make it a bigger deal.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.960
So we were looking at some magazines.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960
some personalities and it just seemed like

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.080
Tony Hawk was the guy.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.920
(uplifting music)

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.240
- I don't think there's
anybody really at Neversoft

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.560
in the team. Joel. Chris and I

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.360
who'd ever skateboarded before.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.880
So this was like a new thing to us

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.600
and I remember Joel said.
there wouldn't be any market

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.160
for a game like that cause it's
just a small. niche market.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.840
So no one was really thinking
skateboarding would be good.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.080
(loud crash and grinds)

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.600
- I got a call from Take-Two
which is now Rockstar Games.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.760
And they wanted to work on a game

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.280
and I liked what they were doing

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.520
but their game seemed a little
too difficult to master.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.760
(relaxed guitar music)

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.960
It was as hard as
skateboarding to learn almost

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.640
and so I'd felt like
that's not really the.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.240
the hook that's gonna bring in a whole

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.640
new audience to skateboarding.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.480
(thunder rumbles)

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.160
Activision called me and said
we are working on a game.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.280
we heard you might be
working on another game.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.960
we would like you to come
see what we're doing.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.840
- He came in. he showed
up in like a T-shirt

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.640
and like ripped up cargo pants

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.640
and Activision had all these executives

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.880
all lined up in a conference room.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.600
They sat Tony down and
they started showing him

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.600
PowerPoint after PowerPoint
of like revenue this.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.160
and Activision that and
like. just all that stuff.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.560
And I could just see Tony
just sort of sinking lower.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.520
and lower in his chair.
just kinda. seemed like

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.480
he was kinda bored out of his mind.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.120
But at the the meeting. we actually got

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.560
to roll in the demo level
that Neversoft had created.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.760
And it was their. kind of first attempt

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.880
at a skateboarding game.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.040
- What they actually
showed me was Bruce Willis

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.720
with a gun strapped to
his back. on a skateboard

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.960
riding through this wasteland.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.280
♪ Well I can't wait to
tell you all about her ♪

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.800
♪ All about my new girl ♪
♪ He can't wait to tell you ♪

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.640
♪ About his new girl ♪

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.680
♪ And I can't wait for

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.360

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.480
♪ About his new girl ♪

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.640
As silly as that sounds.
as soon as I played it

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.760
and I felt just some of the controls.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.280
I knew that was the end.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.600
That was intuitive. that was fun and.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.720
with my influence. with my resources

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.800
we could make this
something truly special.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.800
(upbeat rock music)

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.040
- When we started designing the levels

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.920
we basically stood on
front of a big white board

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.040
and we drew up ideas. just
off the top of our heads.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.800
People where just shouting things out.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.600
- I went to many skate shops.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.400
I talked to many skaters.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.840
I went to skating shows.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.360
where I met pros and talked to everybody

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.000
and look. looked at everybodys style.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.240
The way they dressed.
the music they listened.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.880
And the culture.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.880
I immersed myself completely
for a period of six months.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.760
And this is what inspired me.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.440
This is what made me come
up with that specific look.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.040
- [Narrator] This is the correct way

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.960
to absorb the impact of a fall.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.160
The first thing you wanna do is

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.920
to lower your center of gravity.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.880
Relax. and if you have to fall.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.360
just turn your head away from the fall.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.240
- We were trying to be realistic.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.120
People would say when the
skater falls off his skateboard

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.720
he should take damage.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.320
You might. you know damage your ankle

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.120
or your skateboard might get messed up

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.680
and start going slower.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.320
And this has always been a problem

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.000
with this type of video game.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.920
People want realism where. really

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.680
people just want to have a fun time.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.400
- I was looking to make a game

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.240
that was easy to pick up and
start playing right away.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.040
That you didn't have to know
a ton about skateboarding

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.440
to get the controls.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.480
That you could instantly
start doing tricks

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.880
without having some deep
knowledge of skate history

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.440
(chuckles) or of board controls.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.000
So. for me. I didn't
want. I don't want to say.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.760
that I wanted it to be arcadic.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.120
I wanted it to be authentic.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.520
- When I came in. the game itself.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.800
they had started building kind of a demo.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.760
And they we really inspired by Top Skater.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.080
the Sega arcade game.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.800
One of the early test levels
was. like an aqueduct.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.680
You would skate down this river bed.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.280
Once you got to the bottom of it

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.240
there was what become the warehouse level.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.640
It was just kind of. like just a room

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.600
with that particular pool that was in it.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.680
And everybody would get to
the bottom of that level

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.840
and then you know. in a minute

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.880
and then just spend a
half hour in the pool.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.120
And that was one of those kinda moments

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.440
where you realize. like. okay.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.960
this is what we wanted to do.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.400
(loud crash)

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.760
(drum beats)

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.240
(wheels roll)

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.000
- Cool Dad. but can you do it
in a loin clothe like Tarzan?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.160
- I had seen a lot of.
kind of cooperate entities

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.560
come into skateboarding and try and see

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.960
what they could take from skateboarding

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.000
and then they would just leave.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.400
And they would leave whoever.
whatever. high and dry

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.040
and they just didn't even
care about the effect.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.280
The effect that they had on skateboarding.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.000
It was just like see how long they could

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.920
make money off of it.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.120
So I the very beginning
I was leery of you know.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.800
the whole video game concept.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.880
And. you know. personally
I felt like the X games

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.720
were a little bit cheesy and corny.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.000
And I felt like if this video game

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.560
is gonna be cheesy and
corny. then everybody

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.280
that's involved in the
game is gonna be the same.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.520
You know. and I knew that Tony

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.400
was a little bit closer to the X games.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.080
And his persona was a
little bit more wholesome.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.240
and you know. a little bit more mainstream

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.680
and. than mine was.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.400
So I was a little bit like
leery in the beginning

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.520
and almost didn't even want to do the game

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.600
because I just felt like
it was gonna be cheesy.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.000
- Can't even remember exactly

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.720
how it happened but somebody called me up.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.960
I don't know if it was Tony Hawk

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.560
or from somebody from Neversoft

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.800
and they were like do you
wat to be in a video game?

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.200
And I was just like.
at that time I remember

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.640
I couldn't even believe it
was gonna be real you know.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.840
I was just like. I was amazed
by that idea. you know.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.680
And it was a big idea I
felt like at that time.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.600
I remember thinking like. thats just crazy.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.800
Skateboarding has got to that level

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.360
that these major companies are
going to invest into an idea

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.320
that's a skateboarding video game.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.200
And I just thought it was
the coolest thing ever.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.840
- They game me the list
of everybody involved

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.600
and I kinda was like.
okay if I don't do this.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.920
I'm gonna be like the one
dude that isn't with his peers

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.080
and so I kinda almost did
it because I felt like

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.440
I didn't want to be left out because those

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.200
were going to be household
names from this video game.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.440
And so I did it.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.640
(upbeat guitar music)

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.600
♪ Tonight's the night
that we got the truck ♪

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.440
♪ We're going downtown gonna beat ♪

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.680
♪ Up drunks ♪
- Once Tony came in.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.640
he actually was. you know. was really good

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.040
in terms of giving his ideas

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.440
and giving us a lot of
feedback in the game.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.240
He did a lot of actual play
testing of the game himself.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.480
- When I first signed
up I had to teach them

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.240
the softer ropes about
skateboarding you know.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.000
It was a crash course.
none of them really skated.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.800
Pushing out this way is
called one type of trick

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.200
and pushing out this way
is another kind of trick.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.920
There's no such thing as a front side indy.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.280
stuff like that. I mean it
was. pretty overwhelming

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.720
the amount of information
I had to give them.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.320
But they were very receptive you know.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.120
there are a lot of people
that are in that position

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.400
that thought they had the upper hand.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.240
You know. they. the
video game is happening

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.760
so they didn't have to
adhere to some crazy.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.000
demand list of making it authentic.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.320
(Tony chuckles)

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.320
(wheels roll)

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.280
the Mocap was. for one. embarrassing

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.480
cause you're wearing a skin tight suit

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.200
that's covered in what
looks like ping pong balls.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.640
That's humiliating enough
but then to be asked to do

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.280
your absolutely most difficult
and most dangerous tricks

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.120
while wearing that was ridiculous.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.240
And I got hurt a lot doing that.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.960
Because you're not wearing like.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.440
really the kinda of padding
you would usually wear.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.560
And it's like okay go do a 900. like what?

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.720
- Generally I probably wouldn't have been

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.320
too involved in the process
but I blow my knew out

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.680
and I had to have ACL
surgery and I was on a couch

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.560
for. you know. a long period of time.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.440
So that meant I had a month before surgery

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.120
and then a month after surgery
when I was just on a couch.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.480
I started playing the game like crazy

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.320
and I. you know. played
video games growing up

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.560
but I'd never had a video game

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.640
that I had so much interest in

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.440
because it was like
basically. my whole life

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.320
was around skateboarding
and now I have a game

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.240
that has to do with every
aspect of what I do.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.880
And so it was so intriguing to me.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.640
I could still get the
satisfaction of doing tricks

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.280
and trying things very
similar to how skating was.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.760
except I could do it
through the video game.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.880
- The only hope I had for the game.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.520
is that skaters would be proud of it.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.480
And skaters might be inspired
to buy a PlayStation.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.600
that was it.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.720
I thought that if I can get
a skater to buy a PlayStation

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.840
and play this game. that's success.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.560
When we started Tony Hawks.
we didn't really think

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.680
it was going to be a super success.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.080
But I think as we developed the game.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.560
we personally enjoyed playing it.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.080
I really like. you know.
jumping doing like.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.360
big tricks in the half pipe.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.160
And I was just trying to make
a game that I enjoyed playing.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.560
But then we started getting
focus testers coming in

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.440
and they would start playing the game.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.680
And I remember these
two testers coming in.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.160
the first ones we did and they kept saying

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.720
how tight it was.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.320
Which was like a term
I never heard before.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.280
Like.'' Dude. this game is really tight.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.680
Isn't this video game tight.''
''Yeah man. its tight.''

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.480
So they were really like enthusiastic

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.440
about how tight it was.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.280
And then the thing that really tweaked us

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.760
to the fact that it was
going to be successful

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.760
was when we released the demo disk

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.120
which was a disk given
away at Pizza Hut I think.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.360
and at supermarket checkouts.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.280
The demo disk had a
bunch of small versions

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.720
of different games on.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.400
And we got a lot of feedback from that.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.440
from people who really enjoyed
just playing that one game.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.680
It was just like a small segment

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.680
and you could play two minutes

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.560
just skating around a warehouse.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.360
But people really just enjoyed it.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.240
you know I really enjoyed
playing that little demo.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.480
Everybody was talking about this demo.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.560
And. you know. I think on that disk too

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.680
was like a Final Fantasy game

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.800
which at the time. would
have been you know.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.840
like seeling millions
and millions of copies.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.160
And everybody is talking about

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.240
the Tony Hawk game on there instead.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.560
- You would have to put
a skateboarding game out

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800
and there has been a few and you're like.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.600
ah that's fun. but like this is weird.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.080
And then you get someone like
Tony Hawk. work on a game.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.720
specifically and you
know its gonna come out

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.080
with that language ad that representation.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.440
so. immediately skateboarders were in.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.000
And then non skateboarders were addicted

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.760
and that just became
you know. what happened.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.720
(upbeat rock music)

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.920
♪ Jerry was a race car driver ♪

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.760
♪ And he drove so goddamn fast ♪

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.040
♪ He never did win no checkered flag ♪

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.040
- Mean I don't know if there was songs

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.080
in video games before Pro Skater.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.480
So when they asked us about
having a song in there.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.280
I don't think we knew what that meant

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.880
because. every video game I
had I don't remember songs

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.400
and like song songs.
they'd have a built in song

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.760
that was coming form a chip or something.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.760
It was like a song from
a band or anything so.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.840
yeah I don't think we knew what that mean.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.240
I hate it when you use your
music in the video game.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.200
Okay. but.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.480
- Back in the 90s people where

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.880
so precious about their music.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.880
No one wanted their music
to be in commercials.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.520
or movies. they just wanted it to be like.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.280
only the tour and only as their own.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.440
They didn't want to sell out or whatever..

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.480
it was just like. really
difficult to kind of like.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.480
want to do sync store
licenses for your music.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.560
For me. growing up with the
culture of skateboarding

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.120
like I talked about it was a no brainer.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.320
I'm like of course. this
makes complete sense

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.720
for the style and music we do.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.480
The ska punk song in a video game

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.400
that supports the culture
of what were doing.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.400
(heavy metal music)

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.160
- You know the song wasn't necessarily.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.920
it was on the radio a tiny
bit and weird markets.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.520
And there was video
that was sort of a seen

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.440
but. definitely I remember noticing

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.960
a lot of people finding out about it

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.880
through the video game. (chuckles)

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.080
Of course you know. down the road

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.640
I thought it would become
like. dude I can't listen

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.480
to that song again.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.920
I've heard that loop a
million times in my head

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.760
playing the game.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.440
Like I love your band but I
can't hear that song again.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.480
Cause you know. it wasn't the whole song.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.040
it was just the little bit.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:24.840
So you know you could hear that part

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.120
lopping over and over again.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.720
- The video game obviously
turned into something

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.720
much bigger than I think anyone expected.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.440
And the soundtrack
become like a real thing

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.880
that people like listened to.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.280
If you're able to have people in Sweden

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.960
or Italy discover Southern
California punk rock in the 90s

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.200
that they wouldn't be
able to get to otherwise.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.240
You know. because the internet
didn't exist back then.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.200
- I was getting really excited

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.320
to be able to play it and see it.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.200
And I think that started
to trigger my mind

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.680
and start to think what
is this gonna do for kids.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.320
like. cause they're gonna
be playing this robotically

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.360
and its gonna. they're gonna train

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.600
by playing this video game.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.480
And that was an interesting thought for me

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.960
at that time. you know. to think that.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.640
this may actually affect the
evolution of skateboarding

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.120
which ultimately it did.

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.360
Crazy. (chuckles)

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.200
- [Narrator] X games
five in San Francisco.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.680
a full moon rising over the bay.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.600
Some of the gods of skateboarding past

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.160
went right in there shoulder to shoulder.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.320
with thousands of screaming
fans who waited a long time.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.720
Other skaters had had their moments.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.000
Alan McKay drop it in there.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.960
But this has really become a
personal quest for Tony Hawk

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.880
to master the trick.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.040
He is beating himself up
doing for a decade. the 900.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.080
(crowd cheers)

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.080
- [Commentator] Oh baby.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.160
Stomp your feet everybody!

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.520
- Very close to the release
Activision offered me a buy out

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.280
and future royalties for
half a million dollars.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.680
And I had never heard anyone even speak

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.280
half a million dollars to me.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.200
And so that was incredible.
that was to me unbelievable

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.920
but at the same time. my career had

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.120
kinda turned around right then.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.720
I was making pretty good money.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.960
I had just bought a new house.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.280
I had a family.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.360
I. you know. I had potential

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.800
and so I felt pretty comfortable.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.360
And for the first time really in my life

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.920
I felt fairly confident in my career

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.400
and so I declined their offer
to just see what happens.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.280
ride it out. I mean it
was probably the best

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.480
business decision I ever made.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.000
But it seemed risky at the time. you know.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.520
that seems like a lot of money.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.160
It is a lot of money. (chuckles)

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.320
it still is a lot of money.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.160
- [Commentator] Tony.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.000
Tony.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.480
900!

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.720
900!

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.560
Oh!

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.640
(crowd cheers)

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.520
oh god. the closest I've
ever seen in my life.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.480
(crowd drowns out commentator)

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.600
I feel like there are so many factors

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.400
of why the first game was a success.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.400
First and foremost it
was. it was made well.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.400
It was a great game to play.
I mean that is all Neversoft.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.320
And yeah. I mean I landed
the 900 that summer

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.800
by pure coincidence you know.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.720
three months before the game was released.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.760
And into the very end of the
development cycle of the game.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.280
(crowd cheers)

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.160
- [Commentator] Are you seeing this?

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.840
Tony Hawk everybody!

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.080
- Watching skateboarding
go through that stage

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.200
of going from. okay that's
about as much as you can do

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.960
on a skateboard to. no there's more.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.600
It opened up and took the
ceiling off of skateboarding.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.640
It said skateboarding
has not stopped here.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.400
I remember emailing Joel.
probably the next day

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.200
and I said. hey do you
guys think you could get

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.440
a 900 in the game.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.400
He's like. ''Already on it.''

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.200
And it was you know. about to
be released for submission.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.480
You know. there's a lot
of whatever folklore

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.280
that's like you've got the 900
then you got the video game.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.400
No we were working on the
video game for two years

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.120
prior to that and there was no grand plan

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.440
of trying to make this trick happen.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.360
Like are you kidding me?

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.680
I would never have been that methodical

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.080
about anything in my life.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.080
The fact that Activision
was so excited about it

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.280
and started putting more
marketing money into it

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.640
that gave me the sign that
it was gonna be popular

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.880
beyond just skateboarders.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.160
(siren wails)

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.160
(upbeat rock music)

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.080
- [Advertiser] Tony Hawks Pro
Skater. now everyone things

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.320
they can skate like Tony.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.960
(wheels rumble)

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.880
(soft thuds)

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.480
- I remember playing the video game

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.160
and me and my brother
had a pool in my backyard

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.280
and we would go out there

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.280
and we would have our
skateboards on our hands

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.400
and do like tricks that we would see

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.320
like in the video games.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.560
And then we would think to ourselves

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.880
like damn. I wonder if Tony Hawk

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.560
came and skated in my pool.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.080
if he could do those
tricks that (chuckles).

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.080
And now that I'm older
my pool is like that deep

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.080
and no way. you couldn't
do anything in it.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.040
But it still just like inspires

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.240
you to think outside the box. I think.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.160
I definitely don't think that I would be

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.800
were I'm at if it wasn't
for that video game

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.800
cause it definitely did
inspire me to skate more.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.200
Cause it was so fun to play the video game

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.840
that it was just fun for me to skate.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.520
And then you know. you got older

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.760
and then kinda phased out video games

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.200
and just got skating you know. so.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.000
- Yeah. the game definitely
affected my career.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.320
It was one of the main things that

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.160
got me like started I think.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.400
You know I was already
like super into video games

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.800
so. once that game came
out. I just was like.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800
I was all about that game.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.040
I spent countless hours playing that game.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.040
And I think that can be said
for a lot of other people too.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.360
just over the years.
talking to other people

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.440
that I'm traveling with and skating with.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.600
They're like dude. I played that game.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.960
I played the shit out of that game.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.880
(game sounds whir)

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.520
- It seems to me that Tony Hawk Pro Skater

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.720
was a pioneer in the same way Pac-Man

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.560
had pioneered the world's
love for maze games

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.080
even though it didn't invent necessarily.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.000
you know the extreme sport game.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.160
It pioneered the incredible
community and culture

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.200
so that could expand
further. expand wider.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.800
And it would allow actually more producers

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.480
to be bold enough to embrace that genre.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.080
of you know. extreme sports games

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.720
and get more and more
extreme sport games titles

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.160
the chance to come to life.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.360
- I had not monetary expectations.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.320
I had no like. this is
gonna help skateboarding.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.880
Its going to educate
kids that don't skate.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.080
I didn't even think about any of that.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.600
It was just like this game is fun to play.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.440
I enjoy it.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.520
I'm hyped to be in it.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.160
I'm hyped to be around and associated

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.000
with all these other pro-skateboarders

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.920
who are at the top of their game.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.480
And it was a good feeling. you know.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.240
X games was like the tip of the iceberg.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.160
Like Tony Hawk Pro
Skater sent skateboarding

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.240
into millions of homes.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.040
And it didn't just send it in there

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.320
and it was gone the next week.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.400
It sent it into their homes and it stayed.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.120
- Sony PlayStation!

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.600
Oh my god!
(paper rustles)

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.440
Oh my god!

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.840
- I can't speak enough
on how much of an impact

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.160
that this video game had for skateboarding

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.200
and the skateboarding
industry to be presented

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.520
to the masses on a whole.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.240
It probably made hundreds of thousands

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.800
if not millions of kids
start skateboarding

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.040
that may have never touched
a skateboard in their life.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.360
If anything it showed our world to people

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.200
that didn't skate and got them interested.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.040
So there are a lot of kids
that started skateboarding

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.360
because of the game right.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.240
They started playing the game.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.040
they kinda got interested in skating

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.880
and then they started skating.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.160
- As skaters we were blown away

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.480
because we're like looking
at people that we know.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.840
and we know nobody else
knows who these people are.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.600
Ad suddenly there's people that have never

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.840
ridden a skateboard before
that asking me like.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.760
do you know Chad Muska?

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.640
Do you know Tony Hawk?

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.560
Do you know Andrew Reynolds?

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.840
I'm like. you've never riden
skateboarder a day in your life

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.440
how do you even know who these people are?

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.560
Or trick terminology. like people

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.120
that have never even ridden a skateboard

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.040
talking about skate tricks as
if they knew what that meant.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.720
- You're getting an education
basically on skateboarding.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.040
And yeah. it is a little bit skewed.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.200
It's through this video game. you know.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.200
and not all the trick names are right.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.280
in my opinion and you know.
somethings are undoable

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.440
and were kind of distorting peoples views

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.760
on what's possible in skateboarding.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.160
But that also could be a good thing.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.160
I mean future generations could think that

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.000
that stuff is possible
and they could progress

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.880
skateboarding in a way.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.480
(loud rumbles)

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.560
- So towards the end of
'99. we're playing Europe

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.720
on this first kind of real tour of Europe.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.000
We had toured the states from '94 to '98.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.400
Solid right?

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.600
First time really touring
there and we played the set.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.200
No one really gave a shit about our band.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.600
We're opening for the Bloodhound gang.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.920
Then we play Superman.
its like the entire place

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.240
goes fucking ballistic.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.560
Like full circle everyone staged

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.960
it was just crazy. right. it's intense.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.520
I'm like what the fuck man!

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.840
The game completely changed the trajectory

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.880
of my band. without question.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.960
Like I play that show. we played

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.520
that song. and it was just like.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.080
this is the biggest song we have

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.800
because of a skateboarding video game.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.840

- You have sold

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.360
a billion dollars of video games.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.360
That is insane my friend
- It's well--

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.440
- I take it you get a
little slice. just my guess.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.080
- Yeah. I can't complain.
- Yeah absolutely

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.920
my guess would be.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.400
- The game itself changed my life.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.800
I mean I started getting
recognized everywhere I went.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.400
It was not something I was accustomed to

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.080
nor was it something
that I was looking for.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.000
When you set out to be a skateboarder

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.560
and when I started.
you were never gonna be

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.600
rich or famous from it
cause no one else was.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.320
So that wasn't the driving factor.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.880
And so when. suddenly I found myself

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.080
with this unparalleled
fame from skateboarding.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.520
I didn't really understand
it. I didn't know

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.400
how to handle it but. yeah it
changed my life completely.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.520
You know. I'm like. it
provided for my family.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.800
It allowed me to travel the world

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.400
at someones else's expense. it allowed me

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.280
to skate more than ever. do tours.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.080
I mean I can't like. the
list goes on and on and on.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.120
You know. I was on the ''Simpsons''.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:57.960
I was in the White House and a lot of that

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.400
is because of the game.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.440
- All right.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.560
So right now I'm here with Tony Hawk.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.760
The music is bumping. the
party is getting live.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.400
it's crazy here at Activision 2000.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.440
Now we got his number
two coming out right now.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.120
and what do you think of it?

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.600
- The second one just
blows away the first one.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.440
I don't think people would
believe that it can get the most.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.280
this much better.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.080
(upbeat rock music)

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.320
- How I heard about the first Tony Hawk

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.400
Pro Skater game was I saw it.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.440
And then I saw it come out

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.960
and saw people playing it.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.520
And I looked at it. I
looked at the characters

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.560
and I'm like man. that would have been

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.160
so cool to be in this game. like.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.760
Why didn't I get picked.
(chuckles) you know?

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.680
I guess because of the
success of number one.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.200
I heard there was going
to be a number two.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.920
- There was no plan from
the start for a sequel.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.760
I think Activision thought obviously

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.200
if it was going to be a success

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.480
they would do a sequel but they weren't.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.880
we had no plans as a company to do it.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.400
We were just going to do this one game

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.680
and see how it did.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.400
So it was all very contingent upon

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.240
whether the game was a success or not.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.200
And of course it was. so we started going

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.680
on Tony Hawk two. as soon as we finished

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.080
working on Tony Hawk one.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.080
So Pro Skater one was all
about figuring out the core.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.960
right like. the core physics.
the core trick system.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.360
getting levels to work.
getting animations to work.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.400
Getting everything to kinda feel good

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.360
and work good together.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.240
And I think we got all that stuff working

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.960
kinda at the very end of the project

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.920
and then we put some goals on top of it

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.480
and that was the first game.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.720
So two. was all about
expanding on that base.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.080
Now we had a solid base and
we could start to explore.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.320
kind of interesting new
features in the second game.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.320
(upbeat rock music)

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.680
- Two I felt like was the
version that we wanted to make

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.400
for one. which I'm sure everybody says.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.240
But it really. it really nailed it.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.880
Like after two. or as
we're working on two.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.040
there wasn't that. you know.
what if we added this factor.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.120
It felt like we added everything
that needed to be added

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.080
and this was gonna be really cool.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.560
♪ Predict me ♪

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.000
♪ I'm predictable ♪

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.960
- Tony. when he made the
900. he just blasted off.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.840
And he was everywhere. I mean everywhere.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.040
And I remember because we
didn't hang out as much

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.840
because we both weren't on Pal anymore

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.640
and when I saw him I was actually nervous

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.440
to be around him because
he seemed like such a star.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.120
And then seriously within five seconds.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.440
or less. you realize he's just Tony.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.840
Like when he had the first
game. I was like. wow

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.400
that's something but. I don't play games.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.520
I didn't relate. I didn't pay attention.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:19.520
It was until I got hurt
and busted an ankle

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.680
and going back to our Pal days.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.640
of all the people I
didn't relate to anyone

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.760
the way I relate to Tony.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.440
I called him Tony.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:33.440
I need to talk to you. I
don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.760
And he just did his usual.
of I don't even know

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.640
what you're talking
about. it's gonna heal.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.240
Weird set of ankles and by the way.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.600
do you wanna be in my game?

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.360
I went up there. met Ralph.
all these characters.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.960
Neversoft was tiny at that stage.

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.440
Game comes out. I didn't
pay much attention

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.320
cause it just goes out.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.040
It doesn't affect your life.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.080
Then I go on tour in a few months.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.640
and I couldn't believe it.
the difference it made.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.520
Look because I was in the game. like

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.440
they had to lift me onto a
van to separate from guys

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.240
that were my peers if not better.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.840
I mean not just better. a lot better.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.840
The van was rocking. like it
was nuts. what that game did.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.320
Not just for skateboarding as a whole

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.040
but for us as individuals.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.400

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.840

- I would get letters.
it was just me and Bret

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.280
working at Epitaph it
was just the two of us.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.040
And we would get letters
from people. that like.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.920
this was around the time
the handycam was invented.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.520
Guys were . making movies
and they were saying.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.880
hey can we have your songs.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.160
And I would send them every record we had.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.400
Use whatever you want.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:06.480
Cause it just made sense
to be part of that world.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.600
I was part of that world.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600
And I wanted to be in that.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.480
Tony. was making Pro Skater 2

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.320
and had his collection of friends

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.160
that he was going to put in the game

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.760
and had asked him to
give him a list of songs

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.200
from bands that they
wanted to be in the game.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.360
Tony approached Brett at Epitaph

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.040
said we wanna use your song.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.840
And I remember back going. I
don't even know what this is.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.640
What is this? (laughs)

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.840
I think it is a video game.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.360
- Once the second game came out

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.040
ad it had such rave
reviews. and there was this

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.800
huge wave of interest in the game.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.880
But also in skateboarding I knew that

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.680
there was something happening more

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.280
than just a successful video game.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.400
There was something happening were it's

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.840
drawing attention to skateboarding.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.000
If nothing else. it helped to
create a fan base for skating.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.480
Which we had never really had before.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.200
The only fans of skating prior to that

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.200
were ones that actually skated themselves.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.200
- So I would love to know how many hours

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.600
you spend playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.840
- Upwards of 100 hours really.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.760
A lot of hours.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.360
I put a lot of hours into
and I'm glad I got selected.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.840
to you know. for the competition.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.840
- Kara here in San Francisco
at the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.800
Big Score contest.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.480
We've got 12 contestants
from all over the world.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.240
They're gonna go head to head
for number one spot $12.000.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.120
$10.000 excuse me. twelve
contests $10.000. woo!

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.000
- For Twin Galaxies our big investment

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.120
of time and energy was Pro Skater 2.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.920
The video game world loved
Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 so much.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.520
that large crowds of people
swarmed to our website

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.240
and got involved with Twin Galaxy program.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.760
Because they were essential invited in

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.240
by our Tony Hawk Pro
Skater 2 championships.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.400
So its a very smart investment

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.280
cause Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.160
was the best thing we could
have put our attention on

00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:00.160
and supported because
it was the big. big game

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.920
in the world at that time.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.280
It was one of the biggest
things we ever did

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.360
based on the number of people

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.880
who actively got engaged.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.720
- Within five years of
that game coming out.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.720
more people would come
to the shows and say.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.240
I first heard you on this
game. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.520
I never heard your band
before but I heard this

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.760
and that's how I found you.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.800
And that still happens today.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.560
- As the game was still on the rise.

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.280
they. Activision was doing well

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.200
and they wanted to lock me into a contract

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.160
because they wanted to
tell their stockholders

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.600
that they had me for this many years.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.320
or for the next decade or so.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.320
And offered me a giant
advanced royalty for games.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.520
It was weird because my agent
was sort of waffling on it.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.040
saying whoa we can cut
this out. cut this out.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.160
I was like. I've never going to see

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.880
this much money in my lifetime.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.720
Take it.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.760
I love working with them.
(chuckles). you know.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.520
This hasn't been a struggle.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.000
this has been the best time of my life.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.720
And so. I told him like.
just let's just do it.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.720
The craziest part about all of that.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.200
is that I made those royalties back

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.520
in almost have that time.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.800
- Well I think that the games got better.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.000
I think that the first one was like

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.320
here's a new idea. its
super fun and exciting.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.880
And you know. the warehouse
and the opening levels

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.400
so rad and it was like.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.960
in theory you could play
there for years. you know.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.000
But. they started expanding
so many different ideas

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.960
and you know. interacting and
then bringing in real spots.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.080
And I thought it was amazing.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.080
I thought the evolution of it was awesome.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.520
- THPS 3 was a huge
improvement because it was

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.920
on the next console.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.480
So the graphics were better.
the motion was better.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.280
the maps were bigger. you know.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.320
obviously we were embracing the technology

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.080
and Neversoft was always on
the pulse of any new console.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.840
- And the direction went
a little more arcadey.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.360
you know. a little
more. I don't know like.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.320
satire. you know. of skateboarding.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.880
And it wasn't quite as skater centric

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.040
as the first couple of titles were.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.000
When four came around. we decided like.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.840
we wanna go back to. you know.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.600
servicing the skateboard crowd.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.800
And I think we can do more with the game

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.480
than just the goals
that we kept repeating.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.440
♪ Oh ♪

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.440
♪ It's set in 1848 in the
crush of New York state ♪

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.680
♪ And the thing about destiny ♪

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.800
♪ Is it never ever sets you free ♪

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.880
- [Game Character] Yes. that was so sick!

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.400
- Once the fourth game came out

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.240
and the other three were
still in the top ten of sales.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.040
that was the tipping point.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.320
That was when we're
here to stay. you know.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.160
in so many ways and
Activision started talking

00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.160
about doing the O2 brand you
know with BMX and Snowboarding.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.800
With wakeboarding. it was
like this is way beyond

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.840
anything I ever imagined.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.560
We did create a genre.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.480
(countdown beeps)
(film rolls)

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.160
(camera clicks)

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.640
(loud crash)

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.120
♪ Don't you wanna go ♪

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.000
- I think for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.160
was the last one I that
remember being like. big.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.080
By the time we got to Underground

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.360
it had lost a little bit of that. like.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.240
I don't wanna say innocence
but like original intent.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.760
And maybe I'm biased because I was only

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.560
in the first five games. but you know.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.160
the first four. the progression was so rad

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.560
and you couldn't wait till the next one

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.000
for the next one to come out.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.960
The potency or the relevance starts to get

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.240
a little bit muddled
and convoluted. you know

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.120
as you keep trying to reinvent the wheel.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.360
- The video game franchise. I don't know

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:12.080
if it was sustainable
on a pop culture level

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.080
because there was you know. the best ones

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.040
were still kinda like the first ones.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.240
It just seemed like the
franchise had kind of like.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.200
done what it had meant to do

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.400
and people and gamers
interests just kind of changed.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.080
- When we came out with the first one.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.800
we doing something that
hadn't been done in ages.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.920
You know. it's not
football. it's not baseball.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.160
It's not this thing that's
been around for a 100 years

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.400
and isn't going anywhere.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.600
It's always had it's audience.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.040
and it's always had kind
of these ups and downs.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.120
I think what wanted happened is. you know.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.160
we were putting out a lot
of the same feeling thing.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.600
which is what you want. but
we kept adding a layer to it.

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.400
You know. another layer and
another layer and another layer.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.960
And the stuff that we were adding to it

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.480
just became less and less important.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.920
- We we're still trying to figure out

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.160
how we could continue
the franchise to make it.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.240
desirable for people.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.600
And so the experience
with THUG 2 in particular.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.680
and we knew it wasn't going to be

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.040
probably as popular as five.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.040
And obviously. you know
we were always trying to

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.560
capture the magic of
two and three and one.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.600
to try and get that back up.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.000
But yeah. there was. you know.
starting to be a little bit.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.800
okay. we are just making
another Tony Hawk game.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.040
Honestly I don't even know
if we could have continued

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.440
if we had hadn't had the
coolest ideas possible

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.280
that it could have continued to go upward

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.520
opposed to plateauing and the
slowly losing it's interest.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.720
- Well we saw a decline in sales you know.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:44.600
once project eight came out.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.600
And the skate franchise
was coming into the scene.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.080
That pretty much split the market so

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.560
it was like suddenly
we got half the sales.

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.200
thanks to a whole new franchise.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.920
This thing is full of technology.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.360
It's got accelerometers.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.560
It's got infrared senses here.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.240
It knows where your feet are.
it knows where your hands are.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.960
You can come in ad actually go for grabs.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.520
You can lean it. you can kick it up.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.320
you can actually put your
foot on the side of it

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.280
as if your pushing along.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.840
The whole thing responses
like a real skateboard.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.920
Really. the best way to
experience skateboarding.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.200
is as it's meant to be. on a board.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.200
When we did it Ride it
was released too soon.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.040
It just wasn't ready.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.440
it wasn't you know. the
syncing issues were a problem already

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:28.080
and just the control
mechanism was pretty wonky.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.560
So I think that by the time that we got

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.560
the second game out.
Shred that was the game

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.240
that I had in mind for the first one.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.280
By the time that game came out.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.640
people were over peripherals.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.800
They were over Guitar Hero.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.720
you know the plastics
were done pretty much.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.160
And it was just. bad timing.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.200
I don't think that was
in line with a decline

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.400
in skateboarding popularity.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.120
I feel like skateboarding had come so far

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.880
and it was kinda here to stay.

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.480
The types of things that have happened

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.280
since that series ended. in
skateboarding. it's huge.

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.240
Its in the Olympics
now. it's street league.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.240
You know. it's still a big thing.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.080
- Over the years. what
the video games and stuff

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.960
ad what I see now. today. I see

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.560
how skateboarding has progressed.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.200
The tricks that was doing back in those.

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:22.120
early you know 2000s. with my fingers.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.560
I now look at Instagram now and I see kids

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.600
actually doing these tricks.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.680
you know which I would never even think.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.680
like. the progression of
skateboarding would get that far.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.560
But I think because of the help.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.840
of the imagination of what
we could do with our fingers

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.920
they actually thought they were possible.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:40.960
So they would try them.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.960
- Yeah I definitely thing that the game

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.320
evolved skateboarding in general.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.760
And it made it so that.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.200
all these new people would
try these new crazy tricks

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.200
that you haven't seen before.

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.320
I think it really does help.
visualizing the video game.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.600
you know like. I think
I could maybe do that

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.880
with my feet like. (chuckles) you know.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.800
So. I think it definitely
inspired a whole new genre

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.440
of just skating.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.200
- Because of the growth of
skating over these decades.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.680
there has been shifting perspective

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.480
of what mainstream really means.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.040
I remember in the mid 80s. when I was

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.160
doing demos for Swatch. for Converse.

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.640
I took a little heat from that because

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:30.800
that was considered mainstreaming it.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.160
And a little bit of deal
with the devilishness.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.760
Later one when the video
game started to appear.

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.840
it was the same argument
of. yeah but that's

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.760
not core. it will deface what we do.

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.160
That also. if anything.
only lifted the bar.

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.520
bringing in more and more
talented people all the time.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.200
Never was it selling out. never
was it mainstreamification.

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.360
In a sense we think of the downsides.

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.880
Oh it's just another baseball
diamond type of sport.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.000
- I never coveted
skateboarding as something

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.760
that I wanted to keep to
myself or to hide away

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.600
from the general public.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.680
I always wondered why kids or people

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.120
who were into mainstream sports.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.440
didn't appreciate skateboarding.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.440
I felt like it had so many of the elements

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.880
of something that's cool.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.160
It was daredevil. it was creative.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.920
it was difficult. it was
accessible. you know.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.040
And I never understood
why it was not popular.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.240
So for me. I wasn't looking to go back

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.080
to the old days of
underground skateboarding.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.720
If nothing else I was
happy that I could finally

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.880
make a living doing it.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.800
I think skateboarding should be.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.040
and can be enjoyed by everyone.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.200
And there's people out there that

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.000
just want the sport for themselves.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.080
And when they see that it gets popular.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.920
or other people are doing
it. they get offended by it.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.120
you know. and they get turned off by it

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.240
because it was something that was theirs.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.840
It was special to them.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.360
It's something that they discovered.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.800
And they don't wanna share it.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.000
I've never had a negative
outlook when X games started.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.720
I never had a outlook. negative outlook

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.720
when the Tony Hawk Pro
Skater games became available

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.880
and I'd have to say. you know that

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.040
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
really helped along my career

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.800
you know. because it put
me on another level of fame

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.760
and some recognition for what I have done

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.760
over the years to promote skateboarding

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:45.760
and show the world. you
know. this art form.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.320
(uplifting rock music)

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.560
I had these two friends
growing up. they were brothers.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.480
I went over there one day after school

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.920
and we started playing
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.840
and I saw that there
was a black skateboarder

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.000
and I was like. oh my god
(laughs). this is kinda cool.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.160
I feel like if I didn't see
Kareem Campbell in that though.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.240
I probably wouldn't have
like been interested.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.080
But because I saw like. representation.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.400
I felt like it was
something that I could do.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.280
I was expected to like play football.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.840
and like basketball and stuff like that.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.720
You know I'm just like. well
I'm probably just gonna skate.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.840
(laughs)

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.960
- The fact that the
characters where pro-skaters

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.760
I think was.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.320
like a key factpr for parents to see

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.880
because their kids are like.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.480
oh look Tony did this. and
Bucky did this on the game.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.440
And they find out who these people are

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.160
and that skating is. you
know. its a good thing.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.200
There's good influential
people in skateboarding.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.520
They inspire all types of
kids. all types of people

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.400
and I think that's like.
the game shows that.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.480
(hopeful drum music)

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.120
- As a hardcore skater and you know.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.720
somebody who came up when
it was this underground

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.040
industry. I'll always love it as that

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.000
and I'll aways cherish those times

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.920
and those moments because that's when

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.400
it was the most. pure to me at least.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.600
But with the growth of
skateboarding is the growth

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.800
of the industry which means
more jobs for skateboarders.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.480
More jobs for people that are involved

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.680
in the skateboard industry.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.000
So to see the growth of skateboarding

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.040
and then to become this
culturally mainstream

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.360
accepted thing. for me. I love it.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.320
I think it's great.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.400
- I hated it when I was in high school

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.800
and the jocks would find
me and the gangsters.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.080
were like jumping me and my friend.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.640
After school we had to run from them.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.000
you know. that was not cool.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.680
It's way cool when they think. you're .

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.920
what you do is awesome.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.520
- I never really saw a girl skate

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.360
until I heard about the Combi Contest.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.160
You know I saw Lizzy
there for the first time.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.200
I saw Kerrybeth Burnsides
and then of course like.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.040
little girls like myself at the time.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.960
who were just learning how to skate

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.200
and it really opened my eyes
to be like oh this is so rad.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.280
like lots of girls do this you know.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.320
I think. having Elissa
Steamer in the video game.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.040
was like a huge step forward
for women skateboarding.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.960
Just because it showed like inclusion

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.320
and it showed you know.
girls who did play the game

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.160
and wanted to skate as a girl.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.280
They got to be able to skate as Elissa.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.840
And I think that's super
rad and like I'm thankful

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.160
for the people who created the game.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.800
to have done that for it I'm sure

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.600
it opened a lot of girls eyes.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.640
- Skateboarding became bigger
that Little League. truly.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.440
Americans past time. had been surpassed

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.800
by skateboarding at that time.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.800
And. definitely the video game
was a huge factor in that.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.120
- The game had an enormous impact.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.120
I remember distinctly on
a like Samoan pretty tough

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.240
neighborhoods.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.480
I remember filming in
there. one particular time

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.400
and these dudes come
out and they were huge.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.000
And they definitely looked like
fresh out of prison at best.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.640
In the middle of the intimidation

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.400
of just what is gonna happen right here.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.800
are we gonna get beat up. it's like wait.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.520
are you that guy?

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.080
Are you in the Tony Hawk video game?

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.560
And I remember his posture
went from like bully to kid.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.520
To like oh my god i've been playing you.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.640
can you really do this trick?

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.640
And when you hear a guy like that

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.760
rattle off a name of some crazy combo.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.600
like nose wheelie nollie 360 to shove

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.320
nose wheelie to nollie flip out.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.640
something like that.
you're like holy crap.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.120
How does this guy know anything?

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.480
Like he appreciates what we do.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.120
I thought I brought just one example

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.000
of how it brought the
complexity of what we do

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.160
to the general public.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.240
- It is beautiful to just to see

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.600
like people like. be able to share

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.400
this thing that we all
love. like you know.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.880
Without feeling like they're
an outsider or anything

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.480
cause most people who skate
already feel like outsiders.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.480
So it's like. what's the point
of trying to make us feel

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.760
like even more isolated.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.400
- The generation that grew up playing THPS

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.680
and started skating because of it

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.440
thought that like. 360
flip to crooked grind

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440
is just something you do
when you learn to skate.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.320
And that shit didn't even
exist when I grew up.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.840
You really. if you looked today.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.360
the kind of tricks that
people are putting on video

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.320
and doing in contests. its THPS stuff.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.360
I'm sorry but. (chuckles)
that is where it came from.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.480
- The tricks are just getting insane

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.720
and everyone is taking
it to the next level.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.320
And everyone is getting so good. so good.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.560
And I think that it's
just gonna keep going

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.720
and going and going.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.160
- I'm hugely proud of the series you know.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.720
It was. I never imagined
that it would go so far.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.840
I never imagined that it
would resonate that much.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.560
and that it would be that popular.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.920
I think the. a big reason
that I'm still here.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.640
that I'm still even
relevant in this world.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.840
is because of that series.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.960
I mean for sure it's
the reason I'm standing

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.960
on this million dollar ramp.
that I get to skate everyday.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.680
- [Commentator] Everybody
