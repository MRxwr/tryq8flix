Alert. biodome breach.

17
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.416
Alert. biodome breach.

18
00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:21.250
Dr. Andrews. did you see that?

19
00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.499
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

20
00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:25.915
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

21
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.458
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

22
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.541
If he leaves.
Godzilla will come for him.

23
00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:33.042
There can't be
two alpha Titans.

24
00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:35.000
The whole theory
of an ancient rivalry

25
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:36.541
stems from Iwi mythology.

26
00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:37.915
He's gotten too big over time.

27
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.790
This environment
won't sustain much longer.

28
00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:41.333
It's too unstable.

29
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:45.915
Hey.

30
00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.624
Off-site would be
a death sentence.

31
00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.957
You don't think the King
could take care of himself?

32
00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:06.083
There has to be another way.

33
00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.666
Finding the origin
of these creatures

34
00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.707
is essential
to mankind's survival.

35
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.333
The interior
of the Earth

36
00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:25.166
is made up of vast cabins
and air pockets.

37
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.832
joined by natural avenues.

38
00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:32.208
The admiral
begins his expedition.

39
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.749
searching for an entrance
to a hidden world.

40
00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:36.416
The purpose
is the discovery

41
00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:37.915
and the release to the world

42
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.042
of the unknown treasures
of Antarctica

43
00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:43.582
in the interests
of all mankind.

44
00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:46.749
Members of the lost
party were never seen again.

45
00:04:46.832 --> 00:04:49.166
Still no word
on what may have happened.

46
00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:55.874
There's an ecosystem
out there.

47
00:04:55.957 --> 00:04:58.291
the likes of which
we can't imagine.

48
00:04:58.374 --> 00:05:01.374
And the place to find it
is this island.

49
00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:30.790
Hello. loyal listeners.

50
00:06:30.874 --> 00:06:32.957
Welcome to TTP.
Titan Truth Podcast.

51
00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:35.333
Episode number 245.

52
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.083
Today is the day.

53
00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:39.042
Maybe the last podcast
I ever record.

54
00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:40.790
And look. I know
I said that last week

55
00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:42.707
and maybe the week before
and a few other times.

56
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.291
But. look. this is the point.

57
00:06:44.374 --> 00:06:47.125
After five years of deep cover
at Apex Cybernetics.

58
00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:48.957
I'm finally taking my shot.

59
00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:50.624
Something bad
is going on here.

60
00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:52.042
I don't know what it is.

61
00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:54.458
but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

62
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.042
and expose
a vast corporate conspiracy.

63
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.666
Yeah. you can call me
a whistleblower.

64
00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:00.125
but I ain't just whistling.

65
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.707
I mean. this is more
than a leak. It's a flood.

66
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.499
And believe me. this flood

67
00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:08.666
is gonna wash away
all of Apex's lies.

68
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:10.458
You can believe that.

69
00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:17.707
Welcome to Apex Cybernetics.

70
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.333
No unauthorized persons
allowed beyond this point.

71
00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:24.166
When we started
Apex Cybernetics.

72
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.666
we dreamt of new ways

73
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.083
to push past the limits
of human potential.

74
00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:33.208
Robotics. the human mind.
artificial intelligence.

75
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.874
Who knows what brave new
future we'll dream of next?

76
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.790
I'm Walter Simmons.

77
00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:43.250
and it is my privilege
to lead Apex

78
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.874
into humanity's bold new era.

79
00:07:45.957 --> 00:07:47.874
We're not going anywhere.

80
00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:49.915
And neither are you.

81
00:07:52.624 --> 00:07:54.291
There you are. baby.

82
00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:05.874
No. don't eat that!

83
00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:07.707
It's incredibly unhealthy.

84
00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:10.707
It's just all the GMOs.

85
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.291
Growing a second head
could be useful.

86
00:08:12.374 --> 00:08:13.374
You have to let me know.

87
00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:14.749
Because me. myself?

88
00:08:14.832 --> 00:08:16.374
I can barely handle
the one I got.

89
00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:19.416
Bernie. you're not
supposed to be in here.

90
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.208
You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

91
00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:23.790
I mean. really doing here.

92
00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:25.208
Why are you here?

93
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.083
This isn't Engineering.

94
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:28.541
Because. you know.
I had to wait

95
00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:29.915
because they're rendering
these new specs.

96
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.707
which is gonna
take over. uh...

97
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.125
That's calculator mode.

98
00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:34.832
...over one hour.
maybe even more.

99
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.915
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

100
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.458
-and make some new friends.
-Oh.

101
00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:40.790
Oh! Now that
we're new friends.

102
00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:42.624
I can share something
with you. right?

103
00:08:42.707 --> 00:08:44.250
I know it's in here somewhere.

104
00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:45.915
This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

105
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.250
It's really amazing.

106
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.125
Don't know
if I used that or not.

107
00:08:51.083 --> 00:08:53.582
Yes. This. Check this out.

108
00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.333
That right there
is radio mesh networking

109
00:08:56.416 --> 00:08:58.083
with a voice-record
subprocessor.

110
00:08:58.166 --> 00:08:59.915
-Guess from where. Come on.
-I don't care.

111
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.250
A toaster!

112
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.000
It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

113
00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:04.624
I have to go to the bathroom.

114
00:09:04.707 --> 00:09:06.083
Is it one or two?

115
00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:07.749
'Cause if it's two. it's
probably from these apples.

116
00:09:07.832 --> 00:09:10.458
Hey. you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

117
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:11.541
I'm good.

118
00:09:11.624 --> 00:09:14.208
Okay. I'll just stay here.

119
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.499
Okay. Yeah.

120
00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:20.582
Ah. let's see.

121
00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:21.749
Whoo.

122
00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:24.749
Screen.

123
00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:31.624
What are they shipping
to Hong Kong?

124
00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:33.874
What's Sublevel 33?

125
00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:37.666
What the...?

126
00:09:41.042 --> 00:09:43.125
Evacuation. Titan alert.

127
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.874
This is not a drill.

128
00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:46.832
All Apex employees.
please proceed...

129
00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:49.083
That is my cue. That's my cue.

130
00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.957
This is not a drill.

131
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.957
Proceed to the fallout shelter
in a single-file line.

132
00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:22.042
Let's go!

133
00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:23.666
They used
cyanide capsules

134
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.208
instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in.

135
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.707
but. you know.
that's neither here nor there.

136
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.374
so don't listen to me.

137
00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:32.250
Level two personnel.
this way! Let's go. let's go!

138
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:34.874
Yeah. that way.

139
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.000
It's time!

140
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:47.458
We need to go now!

141
00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:15.458
Evacuate.

142
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.042
One level at a time. okay.

143
00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:21.125
-No.
-Hey. you!

144
00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:23.125
-Where's your clearance tag?
-You know what?

145
00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:24.582
The fact that
you're talking about

146
00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:26.125
clearance tags right now
in a time of crisis

147
00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:27.749
is incredibly unprofessional.

148
00:11:27.832 --> 00:11:29.666
We should be talking
about evacuation.

149
00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:30.874
Yo! Okay!

150
00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.458
Oh. my God.

151
00:11:57.208 --> 00:12:01.000
Oh. no. What the hell is that?

152
00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:21.208
This is CNN breaking news.

153
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:23.125
The United States
Navy's Fourth Fleet

154
00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:25.125
is deployed off
the southeastern seaboard

155
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:28.291
of the U.S. after last night's
sudden Godzilla attack.

156
00:12:28.374 --> 00:12:30.083
A time of
relative peace shattered

157
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.582
when the massive Titan.

158
00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.166
once thought to be
a hero to humanity.

159
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.374
made landfall
in Pensacola. Florida.

160
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.250
While the damage
was largely contained

161
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.000
to the U.S. headquarters
of Apex Cybernetics.

162
00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:42.790
governments around the world
aren't taking any chances

163
00:12:42.874 --> 00:12:45.000
after the first substantiated
Titan sighting

164
00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:46.499
in over three years.

165
00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:49.666
CEO Walter Simmons
had this to say.

166
00:12:49.749 --> 00:12:53.624
It's about working together
to ensure a safer world.

167
00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.166
Godzilla's a threat
to humanity.

168
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.166
and Apex has a plan
to deal with it.

169
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.333
once and for all.

170
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:01.666
Students and faculty.
please be advised

171
00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:03.333
a mandatory assembly
will be held

172
00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.832
at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

173
00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:06.374
Guidance counselors
will also be holding

174
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:08.250
additional office hours
all this week

175
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.790
for individual
and group sessions.

176
00:13:09.874 --> 00:13:11.333
Welcome back. loyal listeners.

177
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.042
to Titan Truth Podcast.
episode 246.

178
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.624
Oh. my God. I was there.

179
00:13:15.707 --> 00:13:18.416
Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!

180
00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:20.707
You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears

181
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.416
and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?

182
00:13:23.499 --> 00:13:27.208
Ha-ha. no. no. no. no.
No such thing as coincidence.

183
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.790
Dad. I'm telling you.
there's something

184
00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:36.582
provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

185
00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:39.042
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

186
00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:40.624
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

187
00:13:40.707 --> 00:13:42.707
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

188
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.541
-You should be in school.
-I am just trying to help.

189
00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.790
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

190
00:13:47.874 --> 00:13:49.790
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things.

191
00:13:49.874 --> 00:13:52.042
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

192
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.707
I don't have any more.

193
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.707
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

194
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.042
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

195
00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:00.416
How could you doubt him?

196
00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:02.083
-There has to be a pattern.
-There doesn't.

197
00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:04.125
-A reason why he was provoked.
-There isn't.

198
00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:05.416
How do you know that?

199
00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:07.374
Because creatures.
like people. can change.

200
00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:08.874
And right now.
Godzilla's out there

201
00:14:08.957 --> 00:14:11.000
and he's hurting people.
and we don't know why.

202
00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.707
So cut your pop some slack.
would ya?

203
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.250
See you at home. Dad.

204
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:23.166
You wanna know
my theory?

205
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.000
I mean. of course you do.
That's why you're here.

206
00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:27.499
Come on. it's all about
patterns and variables.

207
00:14:27.582 --> 00:14:29.291
Oh. wait. stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back

208
00:14:29.374 --> 00:14:31.083
to sixth grade with this.
okay?

209
00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:33.582
Godzilla attacks when
provoked. that's the pattern.

210
00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:36.291
Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub

211
00:14:36.374 --> 00:14:37.541
with an advanced robotics lab.

212
00:14:37.624 --> 00:14:38.874
That's the variable.

213
00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:40.707
And add them up
and your answer is

214
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.416
that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.

215
00:15:00.707 --> 00:15:01.832
Can I help you?

216
00:15:03.707 --> 00:15:05.291
If you want an appointment.

217
00:15:05.374 --> 00:15:06.790
my office hours
are nine to five.

218
00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:09.624
- Please. Dr. Lind.
- What the f...

219
00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:11.957
Guys like you and me.

220
00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:14.042
we don't do normal hours.
do we?

221
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.291
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

222
00:15:18.374 --> 00:15:19.790
for as long as you have.

223
00:15:19.874 --> 00:15:22.874
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

224
00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:24.166
is fascinating.

225
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.208
Your book was very impressive.

226
00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:29.166
Oh. yeah? Well. I got
about 30 unsold boxes

227
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.832
in my apartment
if you want some.

228
00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:33.957
Walt Simmons.

229
00:15:34.042 --> 00:15:35.832
I know who you are. sir.
It's an honor.

230
00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:39.499
No. the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

231
00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:42.874
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

232
00:15:42.957 --> 00:15:45.874
These are dangerous times.
Dr. Lind.

233
00:15:45.957 --> 00:15:47.333
Allow me to introduce

234
00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:51.125
our Apex chief technology
officer. Mr. Ren Serizawa.

235
00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:54.624
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

236
00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:02.749
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

237
00:16:02.832 --> 00:16:05.374
You know what this is. right?

238
00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:06.790
Hollow Earth.

239
00:16:06.874 --> 00:16:10.166
An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean.

240
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.749
right beneath our feet.

241
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.125
This energy signal
is enormous.

242
00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:21.624
And almost identical
to readings from Gojira.

243
00:16:21.707 --> 00:16:23.957
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface.

244
00:16:24.042 --> 00:16:26.333
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth.

245
00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:31.125
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

246
00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:34.166
If we can harness
this life force.

247
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.832
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

248
00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:40.083
I need your help to find it.

249
00:16:42.541 --> 00:16:45.832
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

250
00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:48.208
Did you read the reviews?

251
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:51.250
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

252
00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:52.874
Look where they put my office.

253
00:16:52.957 --> 00:16:56.291
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

254
00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:59.083
Besides. I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

255
00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:01.499
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

256
00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:03.541
We tried.

257
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.582
I'm sorry about your brother.

258
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:11.582
He was a true pioneer.

259
00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:12.749
Thanks.

260
00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:19.624
See. all of our forward scans

261
00:17:19.707 --> 00:17:23.000
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

262
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:28.749
So. what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

263
00:17:31.458 --> 00:17:34.250
When they tried to enter.

264
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:36.957
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

265
00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:39.333
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

266
00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:41.541
reversed in a split second.

267
00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:46.291
They were crushed
in an instant.

268
00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:51.624
What if I told you
that we. at Apex.

269
00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:53.790
have created
a phenomenal craft

270
00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:56.499
which could sustain
such an inversion?

271
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:01.749
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

272
00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:03.541
HEAV.

273
00:18:06.624 --> 00:18:07.666
We can make the journey

274
00:18:07.749 --> 00:18:10.042
to Hollow Earth possible.
Dr. Lind.

275
00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:12.666
But we need you
to lead the mission.

276
00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:20.541
Help me.

277
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.499
Help everyone.

278
00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:27.000
Finding this needle
in a haystack

279
00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:29.333
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

280
00:18:29.416 --> 00:18:33.208
Well. I. uh.
might have an idea.

281
00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:35.166
But it's crazy.

282
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.874
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

283
00:18:40.374 --> 00:18:42.874
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

284
00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:45.749
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

285
00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:47.874
to return
to their evolutionary source.

286
00:18:47.957 --> 00:18:49.291
Like spawning salmon.

287
00:18:49.374 --> 00:18:53.582
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

288
00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.874
So if this is the Titans' home

289
00:18:55.957 --> 00:18:58.083
and this life force
sustains them...

290
00:18:58.166 --> 00:19:00.000
A Titan
could show you the way.

291
00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:03.666
Yeah.

292
00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:05.790
With a little help
of an old colleague.

293
00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:41.582
Ugh. where is it?

294
00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:44.666
Dr.
 Andrews. you have a visitor waiting for you at security.

295
00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.582
Okay.

296
00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:09.416
A power source
in Hollow Earth?

297
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:11.707
This sounds nuts. Nathan.
even for you.

298
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.707
It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

299
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.291
The second you take
Kong out of containment.

300
00:20:17.374 --> 00:20:18.832
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

301
00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:20.374
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

302
00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:22.416
No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

303
00:20:22.499 --> 00:20:23.624
on Kong's habitat.

304
00:20:23.707 --> 00:20:25.125
No way am I
letting you drag him

305
00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:26.832
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

306
00:20:26.915 --> 00:20:29.291
No. not as a weapon.
As an ally.

307
00:20:29.374 --> 00:20:31.458
To protect us.
lead the way down there.

308
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:33.707
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

309
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.499
You always believed
that Skull Island

310
00:20:35.582 --> 00:20:38.000
was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface. right?

311
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:39.832
And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

312
00:20:39.915 --> 00:20:41.042
Mm-hmm.

313
00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:42.250
Through the entrance
in Antarctica.

314
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:44.374
we could help him
find a new home.

315
00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:46.374
And he could save ours.

316
00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.582
Hers.

317
00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:51.125
That power source
may be our only hope.

318
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:54.208
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

319
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.624
We have to take it.

320
00:21:14.042 --> 00:21:15.291
-Okay.
-Yes!

321
00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:18.499
But when it comes to Kong.
what I say goes.

322
00:21:18.582 --> 00:21:20.749
You name the terms. Thank you.

323
00:21:22.374 --> 00:21:24.707
Sorry. Thank you.

324
00:21:25.915 --> 00:21:27.333
You won't regret this.

325
00:21:27.416 --> 00:21:29.624
Mm. I already regret this.

326
00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:51.291

Well. he can smell you. too.

338
00:23:02.624 --> 00:23:04.374
Still not a fan. huh?

339
00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:11.374
What's she saying?

340
00:23:12.416 --> 00:23:13.957
Just an Iwi expression.

341
00:23:14.042 --> 00:23:15.624
It means
that you're very brave.

342
00:23:15.707 --> 00:23:16.874
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

343
00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:21.374
Hey. use a light touch
on the sedatives.

344
00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:22.915
He's our escort.

345
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.208
We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

346
00:23:25.291 --> 00:23:27.291
What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

347
00:23:27.374 --> 00:23:29.125
What do you do then?

348
00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:30.624
Dr. Lind. please report

349
00:23:30.707 --> 00:23:32.707
to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.

350
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.915
Excuse me.

351
00:23:35.499 --> 00:23:36.790
New arrivals.

352
00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:01.125
Welcome.

353
00:24:03.707 --> 00:24:08.666
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

354
00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:10.499
-Ha-ha.
-I'm Maia Simmons.

355
00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:11.624
My father sent me.

356
00:24:11.707 --> 00:24:13.166
I run point for Apex.

357
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.957
Nathan Lind. mission chief.

358
00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:20.499
Yeah. don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

359
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.541
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles

360
00:24:23.624 --> 00:24:25.874
are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

361
00:24:25.957 --> 00:24:28.333
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge.

362
00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:30.042
but these prototypes
we're loaning you

363
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:33.582
will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

364
00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:35.166
I love Miatas.

365
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.374
Forget about the price tag.
which is obscene. of course.

366
00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:39.166
The antigravity engines
alone produce

367
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.666
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

368
00:24:42.957 --> 00:24:44.874
Feel free to be impressed.

369
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.957
Wow.

370
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.042
All right. we'll be

371
00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:03.083
at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

372
00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:06.250
This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

373
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:10.042
Once we're inside. Kong should
lead us to the power source.

374
00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:11.582
Now. the gravitational
inversion

375
00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:13.083
will be quite intense.

376
00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:14.541
Our best guess
is that on entry.

377
00:25:14.624 --> 00:25:16.624
it'll feel like
bungee jumping...

378
00:25:16.707 --> 00:25:18.874
with the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

379
00:25:18.957 --> 00:25:21.291
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

380
00:25:21.374 --> 00:25:22.582
HEAVs.

381
00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:25.208
If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are.

382
00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:26.915
I believe we can do this.

383
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.499
They'll do the job.

384
00:25:29.208 --> 00:25:31.250
You just gotta do yours.

385
00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:32.707
Excellent.

386
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.749
Dr. Andrews.

387
00:25:36.832 --> 00:25:39.624
We've avoided
all of Godzilla's
known territorial waters

388
00:25:39.707 --> 00:25:41.416
according to your guidelines.

389
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:42.416
Good.

390
00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:43.832
Do I need to be concerned?

391
00:25:43.915 --> 00:25:45.749
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

392
00:25:45.832 --> 00:25:48.291
And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

393
00:25:48.374 --> 00:25:49.915
The myths say
that their ancestors

394
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.458
fought each other
in a great war.

395
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:54.624
So if they meet again.
who bows to who. is that it?

396
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:58.749
No. I spent 10 years
on that island studying him.

397
00:25:58.832 --> 00:26:00.957
I know this for sure.

398
00:26:01.042 --> 00:26:03.333
Kong bows to no one.

399
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.166
Is she supposed
to be out there?

400
00:27:58.582 --> 00:28:00.250
Jia. come on. Come on.

401
00:28:55.624 --> 00:28:57.832
Did the monkey just talk?

402
00:29:02.749 --> 00:29:04.957
Okay. class. listen up.

403
00:29:05.042 --> 00:29:08.624
In the midst of Godzilla's
attack on Apex Pensacola.

404
00:29:08.707 --> 00:29:12.499
I found some crazy tech with
no official classification.

405
00:29:13.374 --> 00:29:14.790
What I saw doesn't match

406
00:29:14.874 --> 00:29:16.582
any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.

407
00:29:16.666 --> 00:29:20.042
So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy. hmm?

408
00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.749
This could be the thread
that finally unravels

409
00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:23.458
the Apex sweater
of conspiracy.

410
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:26.250
You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.

411
00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:27.666
For now. I'm secure.

412
00:29:27.749 --> 00:29:29.166
Anonymous
and hiding in plain sight

413
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.832
as I continue my mission.

414
00:29:33.832 --> 00:29:36.666
♪ Breaking the law
Breaking the law ♪

415
00:29:36.749 --> 00:29:39.832
♪ Breaking the law
Breaking the law ♪

416
00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:48.374
To be clear. my brother can
never know we took his van.

417
00:29:48.458 --> 00:29:50.832
Josh. to be clear. even if
we got into an accident.

418
00:29:50.915 --> 00:29:52.374
I don't think he could tell.

419
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:54.250
No. no. my brother would never
let you drive either.

420
00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:55.458
My mission. my wheel.

421
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.957
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

422
00:29:57.042 --> 00:29:58.832
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

423
00:29:58.915 --> 00:30:01.208
I mean. we just had
an assembly about this.

424
00:30:01.291 --> 00:30:03.624
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

425
00:30:03.707 --> 00:30:05.624
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

426
00:30:05.707 --> 00:30:07.166
about Godzilla and Apex.

427
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.874
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

428
00:30:09.957 --> 00:30:11.208
Because...

429
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:13.458
If we don't. nobody else will.

430
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.083
Are you coming or not?

431
00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:18.582
Obviously I'm coming.

432
00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:21.458
It's stuck.

433
00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:23.957
Wait. wait. wait. wait!

434
00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:36.166
Mind control.
Read up on it. sheep.

435
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.874
Psionic link technology
is a reality.

436
00:30:37.957 --> 00:30:40.125
That's right.
One brain controlling another.

437
00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:41.499
Oh. man.

438
00:30:41.582 --> 00:30:42.582
Imagine that
on a global scale

439
00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:43.957
and Apex is invincible.

440
00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:45.749
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

441
00:30:45.832 --> 00:30:47.666
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

442
00:30:47.749 --> 00:30:49.832
Whoa! Knock it off!

443
00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:51.749
Wait. this is the part
I was telling you about.

444
00:30:51.832 --> 00:30:53.790
...need special UV to
even know you've been marked!

445
00:30:53.874 --> 00:30:55.458
One or two gallons
won't cut it.

446
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:58.250
I need my bleach in bulk!

447
00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:00.374
Because spy dust
is real. people!

448
00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.083
I mean. come on.
invisible to the naked eye...

449
00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:03.790
That's how we find him.

450
00:31:03.874 --> 00:31:05.790
-The bleach.
-Bleach?

451
00:31:05.874 --> 00:31:07.790
He consumes a ton of bleach.

452
00:31:07.874 --> 00:31:09.333
He drinks bleach?

453
00:31:10.374 --> 00:31:11.749
Showers with it.

454
00:31:11.832 --> 00:31:14.624
Oh! Yeah. I shower
with bleach. No. what?

455
00:31:14.707 --> 00:31:17.582
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

456
00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:20.083
See? Tradecraft.

457
00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:22.749
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

458
00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:30.291
Come on.
just one more place.

459
00:31:30.374 --> 00:31:32.874
Madison. this is getting old.

460
00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:35.250
Hey. you sell bleach?

461
00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:37.458
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

462
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:39.250
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods.

463
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:40.957
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

464
00:31:41.042 --> 00:31:43.291
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

465
00:31:43.374 --> 00:31:44.707
Look. we're looking for a guy

466
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.291
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

467
00:31:46.374 --> 00:31:49.208
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

468
00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:50.666
He's probably paranoid.

469
00:31:50.749 --> 00:31:52.957
high-strung.
doesn't like daylight.

470
00:31:53.042 --> 00:31:55.083
You know. has a lot of crumbs
in his beard.

471
00:31:55.166 --> 00:31:56.291
if he has a beard.

472
00:31:56.374 --> 00:31:57.915
Okay. look.
you kids want some candy?

473
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.666
Because I can help you
with candy.

474
00:31:59.749 --> 00:32:03.000
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

475
00:32:03.083 --> 00:32:04.499
Yeah. we want lots of candy.

476
00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:07.874
What are you doing?
You think...?

477
00:32:07.957 --> 00:32:11.250
Oh. you mean Bernie.

478
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.250
Yeah. I know that guy.

479
00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:14.874
He buys.
like. a ton of bleach.

480
00:32:14.957 --> 00:32:16.374
I know where he is. too.

481
00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:18.666
If you buy a live fish.
I'll give you his address.

482
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.374
Bernie?

483
00:32:23.458 --> 00:32:25.000
Mister...
Mis...

484
00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:27.749
Mister Bernie not home.

485
00:32:27.832 --> 00:32:29.125
Yep. that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

486
00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:30.624
Yeah. Um...

487
00:32:30.707 --> 00:32:35.000
Hi! Hi. Listen. we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

488
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:37.125
No. No. No.

489
00:32:37.208 --> 00:32:41.000
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

490
00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:42.208
For knocking on a door?

491
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:43.499
No. No.

492
00:32:43.582 --> 00:32:45.666
Bernie. you don't trust
the authorities.

493
00:32:45.749 --> 00:32:47.666
My name is Madison Russell.

494
00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:50.707
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

495
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.915
Emma Russell. right?

496
00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:57.624
Before we go any farther.
I got one question.

497
00:32:58.458 --> 00:32:59.915
Tap or no tap?

498
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.541
No tap.

499
00:33:01.624 --> 00:33:03.957
-Excuse me. what is "tap"?
-Water.

500
00:33:04.042 --> 00:33:06.250
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

501
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:09.083
Theory is it makes you docile.
easy to manipulate.

502
00:33:09.166 --> 00:33:10.790
Oh. I drink tap water.

503
00:33:11.707 --> 00:33:13.166
Yeah. I kind of figured that.

504
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.749
But she does the thinking
for both of you.

505
00:33:14.832 --> 00:33:16.707
so it should be all right.

506
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.624
-Thanks.
-Okay.

507
00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:19.832
What you got?

508
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.166
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

509
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.499
haven't just been random.

510
00:33:24.582 --> 00:33:26.499
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

511
00:33:26.582 --> 00:33:28.042
I'm of the same opinion.

512
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:30.458
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

513
00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:33.083
For five years. I embedded
myself inside this company.

514
00:33:33.166 --> 00:33:35.250
trying to figure out
what their game was.

515
00:33:35.333 --> 00:33:37.832
Then. last week...

516
00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.042
I saw this.

517
00:33:40.333 --> 00:33:43.416
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

518
00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:44.915
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

519
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.374
which makes no sense

520
00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:48.291
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

521
00:33:48.374 --> 00:33:49.624
-Then what?
-And then boom!

522
00:33:49.707 --> 00:33:51.416
Godzilla shows up.

523
00:33:51.499 --> 00:33:52.915
Caved in half the facility.

524
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.749
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

525
00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.416
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

526
00:33:56.499 --> 00:33:58.458
I mean. some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

527
00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:00.749
Yeah. but what is that?

528
00:34:04.707 --> 00:34:06.083
That's. um...

529
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:09.874
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

530
00:34:09.957 --> 00:34:12.250
Yeah. but it's
in a gun holster.

531
00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:14.333
It was a gift from my Sara.

532
00:34:14.416 --> 00:34:15.499
You have a Sara?

533
00:34:15.582 --> 00:34:17.125
She was my wife.

534
00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:19.291
Um. she passed on.

535
00:34:22.874 --> 00:34:24.499
She was my rock.

536
00:34:24.957 --> 00:34:26.915
My truth.

537
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.042
I'll tell you something.
the day that this goes empty.

538
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:32.083
that's the day
you know I've given up.

539
00:34:37.291 --> 00:34:38.915
Bernie.

540
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.790
I think we can
help each other.

541
00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:47.166
Okay. I guess
now that we're a team.

542
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.624
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

543
00:34:49.707 --> 00:34:51.000
We're breaking into Apex.

544
00:34:51.083 --> 00:34:53.208
- Wait. what?
- You heard her.

545
00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:55.000
Tap water.

546
00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.541
Shit.

547
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:27.707
Hey.

548
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.042
Thank you.

549
00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:13.000
How is she?

550
00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:16.083
Calm. So calm. it's scary.

551
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:18.250
That was extraordinary.

552
00:36:18.333 --> 00:36:22.083
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

553
00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:24.707
I thought that he showed
recognition. but he never...

554
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.707
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

555
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.083
No.

556
00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:31.291
I knew that they had a bond.

557
00:36:31.374 --> 00:36:32.832
He trusts her.

558
00:36:32.915 --> 00:36:35.125
Without her. he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

559
00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:39.915
You know. Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

560
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.125
When the storm
took over the island.

561
00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:43.957
it wiped out
the native people.

562
00:36:44.042 --> 00:36:45.416
But Kong saved her.

563
00:36:45.499 --> 00:36:47.582
She had nowhere to go.

564
00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:49.083
So I made a promise.

565
00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:51.666
then and there.
to protect her.

566
00:36:51.749 --> 00:36:55.915
And I think that in some way.
he did the same.

567
00:36:58.624 --> 00:37:01.125
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

568
00:37:03.374 --> 00:37:04.707
No.

569
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.458
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

570
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:08.749
Yeah. no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

571
00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:11.832
And she's a child.

572
00:37:39.832 --> 00:37:43.166
I know
Jia is only a child.

573
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:47.166
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

574
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.291
And we need Kong
to find that power source.

575
00:37:51.915 --> 00:37:54.000
The world needs him.

576
00:38:07.042 --> 00:38:08.707
What's she saying?

577
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.915
Godzilla.

578
00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:20.874
Did we change course?

579
00:38:20.957 --> 00:38:22.749
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

580
00:38:22.832 --> 00:38:24.749
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

581
00:38:24.832 --> 00:38:26.042
He's not coming for us.

582
00:38:26.125 --> 00:38:28.416
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

583
00:38:28.499 --> 00:38:30.707
How about we throw you off
instead. huh?

584
00:38:32.707 --> 00:38:33.874
We have to release him.

585
00:38:33.957 --> 00:38:35.458
If we lose Kong.
the mission is over.

586
00:38:35.541 --> 00:38:36.832
He's a sitting duck out there.

587
00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:38.874
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

588
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.790
Oh. my God. Jia!

589
00:40:34.874 --> 00:40:36.000
Nathan?

590
00:44:28.125 --> 00:44:29.416
He needs our help.

591
00:44:29.499 --> 00:44:31.541
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

592
00:44:31.624 --> 00:44:33.250
Depth charges.

593
00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.666
He's circling back.

594
00:45:45.749 --> 00:45:48.832
This won't end
until one of them submits.

595
00:45:51.374 --> 00:45:53.374
- Shut it down.
- What?

596
00:45:53.915 --> 00:45:55.208
All of it.

597
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:57.000
Guns. engines.

598
00:45:57.083 --> 00:46:00.042
-Shut it down. Right now.
-If we do that. we're dead.

599
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.832
No. we're playing dead.

600
00:46:01.915 --> 00:46:03.790
And we're making him think
that he's won.

601
00:46:07.707 --> 00:46:10.166
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

602
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.582
Kill anything
that makes a noise.

603
00:46:24.874 --> 00:46:26.333
This better work.

604
00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:20.874
As soon as we move.
he'll be back.

605
00:47:20.957 --> 00:47:23.624
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

606
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:32.416
How's Kong with heights?

607
00:47:42.749 --> 00:47:44.083
So. what's the plan?

608
00:47:44.166 --> 00:47:46.790
We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

609
00:47:46.874 --> 00:47:48.042
Ow.

610
00:47:48.125 --> 00:47:49.957
Keep it moving. tap water.

611
00:47:53.125 --> 00:47:54.374
Go ahead.

612
00:48:02.707 --> 00:48:06.000
All right. Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

613
00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:09.208
Okay. We got this.

614
00:48:09.874 --> 00:48:11.125
Oh. my God!

615
00:48:11.208 --> 00:48:12.291
Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

616
00:48:12.374 --> 00:48:13.790
Yeah. why?

617
00:48:13.874 --> 00:48:15.458
Well. mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

618
00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:16.832
and carries
a bottle of whiskey

619
00:48:16.915 --> 00:48:18.915
from his dead wife like a gun.

620
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.666
I think it's romantic.

621
00:48:20.749 --> 00:48:21.832
Whoo-hoo!

622
00:48:22.874 --> 00:48:25.000
I really don't
understand women.

623
00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:43.874
Okay. come on.

624
00:48:49.915 --> 00:48:52.874
This whole thing came
down. and there was this...

625
00:48:53.749 --> 00:48:55.582
eye.

626
00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.624
Uh. what are
we looking at?

627
00:48:57.707 --> 00:49:00.125
No. no. no. no.
No. it was here.

628
00:49:00.208 --> 00:49:03.000
I swear to God. it was...
it was right there.

629
00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:04.666
Hey. guys.

630
00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:09.624
Anyone know
where this leads to?

631
00:49:10.957 --> 00:49:12.208
You believe me. right?

632
00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:13.749
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

633
00:49:13.832 --> 00:49:16.666
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

634
00:49:16.749 --> 00:49:20.166
"Sublevel." How deep
does this thing go. Bernie?

635
00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.458
Hell. Goes to hell.

636
00:49:23.541 --> 00:49:25.416
Sublevel 33.

637
00:49:27.291 --> 00:49:28.874
Maglev shuttle departure

638
00:49:28.957 --> 00:49:32.208
to Roswell. New Mexico
at 0900 hours.

639
00:49:36.042 --> 00:49:38.000
Whoa.

640
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:42.915
What is all this?

641
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.208
It's breakaway civilization.

642
00:49:45.291 --> 00:49:46.707
I mean. come on.
This is page one

643
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.541
in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

644
00:49:49.624 --> 00:49:52.749
I mean. the Illuminati
running shadow economies

645
00:49:52.832 --> 00:49:55.083
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

646
00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:57.042
in case any
of these governments

647
00:49:57.125 --> 00:49:58.208
and megacorporations

648
00:49:58.291 --> 00:50:00.458
accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

649
00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:02.832
It makes sense

650
00:50:02.915 --> 00:50:03.874
-if you think about it.
-Yeah. sure.

651
00:50:06.458 --> 00:50:07.624
- Someone's coming.
- What?

652
00:50:07.707 --> 00:50:09.000
-Someone's coming.
-What?

653
00:50:09.083 --> 00:50:10.666
- Someone's coming?
- Yes!

654
00:50:14.874 --> 00:50:16.624
Oh. my God.

655
00:50:20.832 --> 00:50:24.083
- They look like eggs.
- Skull-crawlers.

656
00:50:24.166 --> 00:50:26.582
What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

657
00:50:26.666 --> 00:50:27.957
All right.
let's load it up!

658
00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:30.832
What was that?
What was that?

659
00:50:30.915 --> 00:50:32.874
No way. No. no. no. Come on.

660
00:50:32.957 --> 00:50:35.000
Okay. guys.
I think we're moving.

661
00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:53.374
It says we're headed

662
00:50:53.458 --> 00:50:54.915
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

663
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.458
- What?
- Hong Kong.

664
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.749
That means that we're gonna
get some answers.

665
00:50:58.832 --> 00:51:01.042
G10. clear for launch.

666
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.915
Here we go.

667
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:44.707
We're getting close!

668
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:58.624
It's not working.

669
00:53:58.707 --> 00:54:00.458
Just wait. Wait. wait. wait.

670
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:01.666
What if she tells him

671
00:54:01.749 --> 00:54:03.624
there are others
down there like him?

672
00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:05.790
But you don't know that.

673
00:54:05.874 --> 00:54:08.458
We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

674
00:54:09.374 --> 00:54:11.458
There's no way back for him.

675
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:13.624
And he can't survive here.

676
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.957
All right. All right.

677
00:54:35.749 --> 00:54:36.957
Hey.

678
00:55:20.541 --> 00:55:23.832
He's going. Prepare to launch!
Everybody to their station.

679
00:55:23.915 --> 00:55:25.042
We gotta go.

680
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:38.250
All flights crews cleared

681
00:55:38.333 --> 00:55:40.458
for immediate HEAV launch.

682
00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:42.957
HEAV 1 online.
We're clear for launch.

683
00:55:43.042 --> 00:55:45.166
Copy that. HEAV 1.

684
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.790
HEAV 2 online.
Exiting hangar now.

685
00:55:47.874 --> 00:55:51.416
HEAV 2.
confirmation 4055.

686
00:55:51.499 --> 00:55:53.832
This is HEAV 3
online. launching now.

687
00:55:53.915 --> 00:55:55.582
We'll follow him from behind.

688
00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:16.749
There.

689
00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:18.000
There he is.

690
00:56:32.042 --> 00:56:33.874
Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

691
00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:36.291
Oh. he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

692
00:56:36.374 --> 00:56:39.499
We're about to be launched
1.000 miles in two seconds

693
00:56:39.582 --> 00:56:44.624
until gravity inverts itself
and spits us into free fall.

694
00:56:46.333 --> 00:56:48.832
It'll be the most amazing
thing you've ever seen.

695
00:56:51.042 --> 00:56:52.957
Here. For the vomit.

696
00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.166
What?

697
00:57:56.374 --> 00:57:59.707
Engine failure. gravity low.

698
00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:01.957
Engine failure.

699
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.042
All Delta. reverse gravity
propulsion!

700
00:59:43.374 --> 00:59:45.541
It's beautiful.

701
00:59:45.624 --> 00:59:47.083
This is HEAV 3.

702
00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:49.250
we're getting some
strange radar activity.

703
00:59:49.333 --> 00:59:50.874
We're gonna circle back and...

704
01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.624
All Delta. prepare to attack!

705
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:17.208
That's gross.

706
01:01:23.374 --> 01:01:24.582
Kong's on the move.

707
01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:25.790
We gotta go.

708
01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:54.250
Well. he seems to know
where he's going.

709
01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:56.666
Oh. he certainly can move.

710
01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:25.957
Okay. okay.

711
01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:28.458
Creepy monorail
is slowing down.

712
01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:31.374
Attention:
Shipping pod arriving.

713
01:03:40.624 --> 01:03:43.291
Okay. Keep quiet.
Follow me.

714
01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.458
We're going in?

715
01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:51.790
Yeah.

716
01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.374
Oh. no!

717
01:03:58.624 --> 01:04:01.333
Every time. I swear.
Doors hate us.

718
01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:04.582
Oh. yeah.

719
01:04:09.499 --> 01:04:11.707
- Aah!
- Oh. my God!

720
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:16.208
It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

721
01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.915
So. what is this place?

722
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.166
Well. if there's
a corporate-friendly term
for "sacrifice pit."

723
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.749
I'd say we are in it.

724
01:04:24.666 --> 01:04:26.957
Oh. God. that stinks.

725
01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:34.125
That's not good. Bernie!

726
01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:35.624
I really hate this place.

727
01:04:38.582 --> 01:04:40.790
Attention: Demonstration

728
01:04:40.874 --> 01:04:42.957
in T-minus one minute.

729
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:48.874
All personnel
are to stay clear of the area.

730
01:04:57.499 --> 01:05:01.000
Mr. Simmons.
systems are coming online now.

731
01:05:25.666 --> 01:05:27.374
Commence uplink.

732
01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:31.957
Engaging uplink.

733
01:05:32.042 --> 01:05:34.291
Pilot engaged.

734
01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:07.333
That's robot Godzilla.

735
01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:09.083
Oh. no. That's...

736
01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:11.042
That's Mechagodzilla.

737
01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.083
Release number 10.

738
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.832
Go. go!
Go through there!

739
01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:50.915
Madison! Run. girl!

740
01:07:18.707 --> 01:07:19.832
Yes!

741
01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:32.125
Damn it.

742
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:34.790
System only reached 40% power.

743
01:07:34.874 --> 01:07:35.957
Oh. I know.

744
01:07:36.042 --> 01:07:37.291
As expected.

745
01:07:37.374 --> 01:07:38.874
Don't worry.
Once the Hollow Earth

746
01:07:38.957 --> 01:07:40.541
sample is uploaded.

747
01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.749
our power troubles
will be over.

748
01:07:42.832 --> 01:07:44.666
If they can find
the source.

749
01:07:44.749 --> 01:07:48.790
Oh. they'll find it.
I have faith in my daughter.

750
01:07:48.874 --> 01:07:51.125
I have faith in our creation.

751
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:54.166
And humanity
will once again...

752
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:57.582
be the apex species.

753
01:07:57.666 --> 01:08:01.624
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

754
01:08:01.707 --> 01:08:04.707
They're trying
to replace him.

755
01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:32.166
Come on. Maddie.

756
01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:36.042
Sir.
Godzilla just made
an abrupt change

757
01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:37.749
in direction.
He's moving very fast.

758
01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:40.166
Projections show he's likely
headed to Hong Kong.

759
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.208
Transport is ready and waiting
to take you there. sir.

760
01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:05.666
That has to be it.

761
01:11:05.915 --> 01:11:07.707
We were right.

762
01:11:08.749 --> 01:11:10.166
He's home.

763
01:12:33.832 --> 01:12:35.582
All personnel must display

764
01:12:35.666 --> 01:12:38.541
their Apex employee badge
at all times.

765
01:12:38.624 --> 01:12:40.707
Follow me.

766
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.499
Lizard people
build all their facilities

767
01:12:42.582 --> 01:12:44.582
the same way.
I can find the exit.

768
01:12:46.707 --> 01:12:48.749
The exit's this way.

769
01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.957
Guys. Madison!

770
01:13:00.749 --> 01:13:02.582
Oh. my God.

771
01:13:04.874 --> 01:13:07.291
Bitch. what?

772
01:13:07.374 --> 01:13:08.832
It's a Titan skull.

773
01:13:08.915 --> 01:13:12.125
No. no. no.
That's not just any Titan.

774
01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:13.707
That's Monster Zero.

775
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.166
Ghidorah.

776
01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:22.458
They hardwired its DNA.

777
01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:24.541
Self-generating
neural pathways

778
01:13:24.624 --> 01:13:26.749
capable of intuitive learning.

779
01:13:26.832 --> 01:13:28.915
Okay. I'm smart.
but I only go to high school.

780
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.291
- It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

781
01:13:34.374 --> 01:13:36.666
It had three heads.

782
01:13:36.749 --> 01:13:37.957
Its necks were so long.

783
01:13:38.042 --> 01:13:40.291
they communicated
telepathically.

784
01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:41.749
And there's one here

785
01:13:41.832 --> 01:13:43.707
and another one
inside of that thing.

786
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:46.208
Yeah. it could be
a psionic interface.

787
01:13:46.915 --> 01:13:48.666
Oh. my God.

788
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:51.458
Careful.

789
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:52.624
It's a pilot.

790
01:13:52.707 --> 01:13:55.957
Yeah.
He's in a trance.

791
01:13:56.042 --> 01:13:57.915
That's a psionic uplink.

792
01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:01.499
It follows his will.

793
01:14:01.582 --> 01:14:03.957
Oh. Apex. what have you done?

794
01:14:46.624 --> 01:14:49.749
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order. Doctor.

795
01:14:49.832 --> 01:14:51.582
The city is being evacuated.

796
01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:03.208
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

797
01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.499
What is he doing?

798
01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:55.582
It's the axe.

799
01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:57.582
It's drawing radiation
from the core

800
01:15:57.666 --> 01:15:59.166
like it's charging.

801
01:16:41.042 --> 01:16:44.749
Whoa! Godzilla's
responding! They found it!

802
01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:50.250
What in the hell?

803
01:17:03.915 --> 01:17:05.541
What are you doing?

804
01:17:05.624 --> 01:17:07.374
Extracting a sample.

805
01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:09.666
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

806
01:17:09.749 --> 01:17:11.333
You can't just drill into it.

807
01:17:11.416 --> 01:17:13.333
Actually. we can.

808
01:17:16.125 --> 01:17:18.166
My father gets what he wants.

809
01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:19.915
That's Apex property now.

810
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.208
What?

811
01:17:26.874 --> 01:17:29.374
Energy signature incoming.

812
01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:32.499
We should be able
to recreate it soon.

813
01:17:35.374 --> 01:17:37.666
That is the discovery
of the millennium.

814
01:17:37.749 --> 01:17:40.374
-You can't strip it for parts.
-Hold it.

815
01:18:06.166 --> 01:18:08.250
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

816
01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:09.915
Let's go!

817
01:18:11.624 --> 01:18:12.832
Yes.

818
01:18:12.915 --> 01:18:16.416
Mr. Serizawa.
start your engines!

819
01:18:16.499 --> 01:18:17.749
The upgrade is untested.

820
01:18:17.832 --> 01:18:19.291
Once we get online.

821
01:18:19.374 --> 01:18:21.042
Gojira will come
straight for us.

822
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.707
He's been coming for us

823
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:24.749
since our creation
first awoke.

824
01:18:24.832 --> 01:18:27.166
-We must embrace it.
-We shouldn't rush this.

825
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.374
We have no idea
how this energy source

826
01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:30.499
will affect the Mecha.

827
01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:32.416
Get in the goddamn chair.

828
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:50.250
- Go. go. go!
- Come on. come on!

829
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.874
Move! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

830
01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:02.042
This way. sir! Hurry!
We gotta get back...

831
01:19:28.707 --> 01:19:30.458
Okay.

832
01:20:05.874 --> 01:20:08.749
Get him out of the way!
Shoot him!

833
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.582
Go. go. go!

834
01:20:21.582 --> 01:20:22.749
Oh. no.

835
01:20:23.416 --> 01:20:24.707
No. no. no...

836
01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:30.083
Oh. Jesus!
Come on. let's go!

837
01:20:58.666 --> 01:21:00.042
-Hold on. ladies.
-Yeah.

838
01:21:00.874 --> 01:21:02.000
Whoa.

839
01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.541
Stay low.

840
01:21:34.374 --> 01:21:36.624
Yeah. Going viral.

841
01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:38.416
What?

842
01:21:38.499 --> 01:21:41.125
We've gotta try and stop this.

843
01:21:43.458 --> 01:21:45.333
Mm-mm. I don't like this. guys.

844
01:21:45.416 --> 01:21:47.374
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction.

845
01:21:47.458 --> 01:21:49.042
this would be
a great DJ booth.

846
01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.541
I know what it... Maintenance.

847
01:21:54.624 --> 01:21:56.208
Madison. we should go.

848
01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:57.915
I'm Maintenance.
You don't have to alert the...

849
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.624
She doesn't buy that.
Uh. Madison. we need to go.

850
01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:01.624
The woman
with the villain hairdo...

851
01:22:01.707 --> 01:22:03.166
Madison. they have guns.

852
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:05.957
Hey. guys. Uh. it's soundproof
so I can't really...

853
01:22:06.042 --> 01:22:08.042
-I wanna communicate...
-Open the door!

854
01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:09.208
Say again?

855
01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:11.000
Oh. God!
Get down! Get down!

856
01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:13.166
Oh. shit!

857
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.458
We're about to breach
the veil! Hold on!

858
01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:03.915
Looks like round two
goes to Kong.

859
01:26:16.499 --> 01:26:17.582
Hey!

860
01:26:22.666 --> 01:26:26.291
Oh. come on. guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

861
01:26:26.374 --> 01:26:28.333
Greenpea...

862
01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:30.624
Actually. sir. not like
you would know this.

863
01:26:30.707 --> 01:26:32.541
but I'm Level Two
Assistant Engineering...

864
01:26:32.624 --> 01:26:35.083
Well. Provisional Level Two
Assistant Engineering.

865
01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:36.458
not like you would know that.

866
01:26:36.541 --> 01:26:38.499
My evaluations
were incredibly encourag...

867
01:26:38.582 --> 01:26:42.874
I'm just saying Greenpeace
wishes. is all I'm saying.

868
01:26:43.874 --> 01:26:46.624
Where do I know you from?

869
01:26:49.208 --> 01:26:51.416
Oh. my goodness.

870
01:26:51.499 --> 01:26:54.666
Director Russell's daughter.
yes?

871
01:26:54.749 --> 01:26:56.333
You caused all of this.

872
01:26:56.416 --> 01:27:00.624
If by "all of this."
you mean I. and I alone.

873
01:27:00.707 --> 01:27:03.291
have given humanity a chance
against the Titans.

874
01:27:03.374 --> 01:27:06.291
then. yes.
I will own that title.

875
01:27:06.374 --> 01:27:08.790
Godzilla had left us in peace.

876
01:27:08.874 --> 01:27:10.624
You provoked him into war.

877
01:27:10.707 --> 01:27:13.458
There can only be one alpha.
Miss Russell.

878
01:27:13.541 --> 01:27:16.416
It seems to have been
providence.

879
01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:07.790
It's time to launch.

880
01:30:07.874 --> 01:30:10.042
Begin pilot integration.

881
01:30:17.874 --> 01:30:19.208
And now...

882
01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:21.624
my Mecha.

883
01:30:22.874 --> 01:30:25.374
It's not only
Godzilla's equal...

884
01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:29.042
but his superior.

885
01:30:31.083 --> 01:30:34.707
The Apex Titan of my own hand.

886
01:30:36.458 --> 01:30:39.458
It's time to show
the world what you can do.

887
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:43.749
Pilot engaged.

888
01:30:47.582 --> 01:30:50.749
Alert: Failure.
System unstable.

889
01:30:50.832 --> 01:30:54.957
Alert: Failure.
System unstable.

890
01:30:57.083 --> 01:31:00.541
This is how we.
as a species. win.

891
01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:03.624
You see. 10 years ago.

892
01:31:03.707 --> 01:31:07.333
when Gojira was first revealed
to the world.

893
01:31:07.416 --> 01:31:09.541
I had a dream.

894
01:31:09.624 --> 01:31:12.707
And in that dream.
I saw one thing.

895
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:18.541
And that beautiful.
amazing thing was...

896
01:31:21.624 --> 01:31:22.790
Oh. shit.

897
01:31:22.874 --> 01:31:23.957
No!

898
01:31:37.042 --> 01:31:38.832
It's unfair.

899
01:31:38.915 --> 01:31:41.208
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

900
01:32:17.499 --> 01:32:19.125
What in God's name is that?

901
01:33:04.083 --> 01:33:06.458
It's thinking for itself now.

902
01:33:06.541 --> 01:33:08.624
We have to warn Monarch.

903
01:33:08.707 --> 01:33:11.208
Or try to stop it ourselves.

904
01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:13.000
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

905
01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:15.083
Wait. Josh.

906
01:33:15.166 --> 01:33:17.166
If I can figure out
the password.

907
01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:19.000
maybe we can shut it down.

908
01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:20.166
All right.

909
01:33:33.915 --> 01:33:35.499
What the hell is that?

910
01:34:27.291 --> 01:34:28.541
What?

911
01:34:34.374 --> 01:34:36.291
What's happening?

912
01:34:36.374 --> 01:34:38.208
She can feel his heartbeat.

913
01:34:38.832 --> 01:34:39.874
He's dying.

914
01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:44.416
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

915
01:34:44.499 --> 01:34:45.915
We'd need a charge
big enough to...

916
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.832
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

917
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.499
Is that a password?

918
01:35:13.957 --> 01:35:15.208
Is that a password?

919
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:16.541
I don't know!
I'm not used to this.

920
01:35:16.624 --> 01:35:18.208
I'm used to pirating
movies online.

921
01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:19.790
Okay. then go to Settings.

922
01:35:19.874 --> 01:35:21.374
- This is Mark.
- Dad?

923
01:35:21.458 --> 01:35:23.416
Madison. where are you?

924
01:35:23.499 --> 01:35:25.666
Dad. can you hear...

925
01:35:25.749 --> 01:35:27.541
Can you hear me?
I'm in Hong Kong.

926
01:35:27.624 --> 01:35:29.125
-Mad?
-Dad!

927
01:35:29.208 --> 01:35:31.042
Mad? Madison!

928
01:35:35.707 --> 01:35:36.957
A-ha!

929
01:35:40.291 --> 01:35:42.458
Okay. you two better
get some distance.

930
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.291
Hey.

931
01:35:52.042 --> 01:35:55.125
You are
a very brave little girl.

932
01:36:02.666 --> 01:36:04.042
I don't know.

933
01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.749
Maybe we both are.

934
01:36:44.416 --> 01:36:45.666
Okay.

935
01:36:49.624 --> 01:36:51.291
Good luck. big fella.

936
01:38:26.416 --> 01:38:27.832
I thought you said
you were a hacker!

937
01:38:27.915 --> 01:38:29.790
I said I took an HTML course
at summer camp.

938
01:38:29.874 --> 01:38:31.458
-HTML?
-Yes. at summer camp.

939
01:38:31.541 --> 01:38:33.915
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use QWERTY.

940
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.291
Error. Security lock.

941
01:38:36.374 --> 01:38:38.790
No. Shit!

942
01:38:38.874 --> 01:38:40.291
Shit.

943
01:40:17.915 --> 01:40:19.666
Josh!
You have to do something.

944
01:40:19.749 --> 01:40:21.749
We tried to take down
those Apex bastards.

945
01:40:21.832 --> 01:40:23.250
but I think this is
as far as we go.

946
01:40:23.333 --> 01:40:24.582
so bottom's up.

947
01:40:24.666 --> 01:40:26.874
I was hoping to die
with adults. but okay.

948
01:40:31.874 --> 01:40:34.957
If you've never
had a drink before.
now's the time 'cause...

949
01:40:35.042 --> 01:40:36.582
Drink. Drink!

950
01:40:36.666 --> 01:40:38.374
Hey! What are you...

951
01:40:40.166 --> 01:40:41.582
That's your solution?

952
01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:43.832
I gotta die here with you.
and sober!

953
01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:09.166
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

954
01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.832
Hey. Nathan?

955
01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:07.208
Nathan?

956
01:42:07.291 --> 01:42:09.042
Nathan. are you okay?

957
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.083
Dad?

958
01:42:35.624 --> 01:42:36.707
Dad!

959
01:42:37.624 --> 01:42:38.582
Dad!

960
01:42:46.874 --> 01:42:50.250
Hi. Um. it was. um...
Madison's idea.

961
01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:52.874
Shut up. Josh.

962
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.707
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

963
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:58.125
Bernie. meet Dad.

964
01:42:58.208 --> 01:42:59.582
Dad. Uh. Bernie.

965
01:42:59.666 --> 01:43:01.582
Um. it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

966
01:43:01.666 --> 01:43:04.749
I was wondering
if I could invite you
onto my podcast

967
01:43:04.832 --> 01:43:08.083
to talk about the Monarch
facility in Roswell because...

968
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.333
It's amazing. It happened...

969
01:43:29.166 --> 01:43:30.790
Jia? Jia!

970
01:44:46.125 --> 01:44:49.000
Heads up. guys! He's coming
around for his morning walk.
