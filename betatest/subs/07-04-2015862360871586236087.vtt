180
00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:15.383
I wanted to tell you that...

181
00:09:17.217 --> 00:09:18.216
Uh...

182
00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:23.522
You're crushing it
at this queen thing.

183
00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:25.424
Aw. Branch. thank you.

184
00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.058
Being a good queen is

185
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.328
the most important thing
in the world to me.

186
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.095
Other than being your friend.

187
00:09:31.097 --> 00:09:33.232
Friend. friend. friend. friend.

188
00:09:33.234 --> 00:09:35.300
friend. friend. friend.

189
00:09:35.302 --> 00:09:37.503
Uh. five it up?

190
00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:40.006
Huh. That could've been better.
Let's try that again.

191
00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:43.174
O-Okay. one more.

192
00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:45.444
Huh. For some reason. we can't
seem to make a good connection.

193
00:09:47.548 --> 00:09:49.281
Oh. yes. Fuzzbert!

194
00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:51.417
Now. that's a good connection.

195
00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:53.084
Poppy. help!

196
00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:53.951
- Ooh.
- Poppy!

197
00:09:57.525 --> 00:09:58.590
Watch it. watch it!

198
00:09:58.592 --> 00:10:00.559
- Biggie?
- Oh. run!

199
00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:03.362
Help!

200
00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:06.265
I'm being harangued
by a monster!

201
00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:08.536
Someone stop it!

202
00:10:10.504 --> 00:10:13.070
Gotcha! Ah! It's in my hair!
It's in my hair!

203
00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:15.006
Get it out. get it out. get it out!

204
00:10:17.076 --> 00:10:18.209
There you go.

205
00:10:20.781 --> 00:10:22.314
There you go. Calm down.

206
00:10:22.316 --> 00:10:23.582
Who's a good boy?

207
00:10:23.584 --> 00:10:25.149
What is that thing?

208
00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:26.217
It's creepy.

209
00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:27.352
It's scary.

210
00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:29.521
And nasty.

211
00:10:29.523 --> 00:10:31.958
- Hold me. Daddy.
- Oh.

212
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.430
"To Queen Poppy."

213
00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:41.500
Oh. don't worry. everyone.

214
00:10:41.502 --> 00:10:43.402
It looks like
it's just an invitation.

215
00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:44.603
Whew!

216
00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:46.238
Just an invitation.

217
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.539
I love invitations.

218
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.541
"Barb. the Queen of Rock.

219
00:10:49.543 --> 00:10:53.645
"announces her One Nation
Under Rock World Tour.

220
00:10:53.647 --> 00:10:55.347
"Bring your string

222
00:10:56.617 --> 00:10:59.083
- Queen of Rock?
- It's nothing!

223
00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:01.520
It means nothing at all.
It's just junk mail.

224
00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:02.421
You don't need
to worry about it.

225
00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:04.121
I mean. quit looking at it.
everyone.

226
00:11:04.123 --> 00:11:05.491
Forget what you saw!

227
00:11:10.163 --> 00:11:11.563
There you go. There you go.

228
00:11:11.565 --> 00:11:14.065
Calm down. Calm down.

229
00:11:14.067 --> 00:11:15.469
There you go.

230
00:11:16.504 --> 00:11:19.070
Okay. I'm calm.

231
00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:20.071
I'm calm.

232
00:11:20.073 --> 00:11:22.241
Dad. what's going on?

233
00:11:22.243 --> 00:11:25.477
Well. I have long feared
this day would come.

234
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:28.447
I was hoping to protect you
from this. Poppy.

235
00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:29.281
Protect me?

236
00:11:29.283 --> 00:11:31.182
I'm not a little kid
anymore. Dad.

237
00:11:31.184 --> 00:11:32.286
I'm the queen now.

238
00:11:33.287 --> 00:11:35.621
You're right.

239
00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:40.459
The truth is we are not alone
in this world.

240
00:11:45.164 --> 00:11:47.566
There are other kinds
of Trolls.

241
00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:49.434
- What?
- Wow. That's...

242
00:11:49.436 --> 00:11:50.502
Dad. that's great.

243
00:11:50.504 --> 00:11:52.404
The more Trolls. the merrier.

244
00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.138
You don't understand.

245
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.173
These other Trolls
aren't like us.

246
00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:58.175
They're different.

247
00:11:58.177 --> 00:11:59.578
Different how?

248
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.679
Different like Legsly?

249
00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:02.314
I love being me.

250
00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:03.582
Or Fuzzbert? Or Smidge?

251
00:12:03.584 --> 00:12:05.116
Or Skyscraper Troll?

252
00:12:05.118 --> 00:12:06.885
Yeah. different like me?

253
00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:08.554
No. it's not that.

254
00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:11.623
They're different in ways
you can't even imagine.

255
00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:14.125
You see. we love music

256
00:12:14.127 --> 00:12:16.461
with a hummable hook.
with an upbeat melody.

257
00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:19.264
with a catchy rhythm that makes
you want to snap your fingers.

258
00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:21.500
tap your toes
and wiggle your butt.

259
00:12:21.502 --> 00:12:22.668
That's our music.

260
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.537
That's what makes us
Pop Trolls.

261
00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:27.306
- Ooh.
- It is. -Yes.

262
00:12:27.308 --> 00:12:29.608
But these other Trolls.
they sing different.

263
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.609
They dance different.

264
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.445
Why. some of them
can't even begin to grasp

265
00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:36.147
the concept of Hammer Time.

266
00:12:38.419 --> 00:12:39.718
You can't touch that!

267
00:12:46.327 --> 00:12:48.329
♪ Stop. ♪

268
00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:52.698
How about we break down
to a smaller group?

269
00:12:56.737 --> 00:13:00.372
It's a story as old as time.

270
00:13:01.575 --> 00:13:04.345
In the beginning.
there was silence.

271
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.380
Boring.

272
00:13:08.382 --> 00:13:11.316
Until one day.
someone made a sound.

273
00:13:12.653 --> 00:13:15.721
Our ancestors were
so inspired by the sound.

274
00:13:15.723 --> 00:13:18.490
they took six strings.

275
00:13:18.492 --> 00:13:22.761
And those six strings had
the power to control all music.

276
00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:24.396
They could play anything.

277
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.266
Techno. funk. classical.

278
00:13:28.268 --> 00:13:30.736
country. hard rock and pop.

279
00:13:30.738 --> 00:13:33.538
And every kind of music
in between.

280
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.340
There was something
for everyone.

281
00:13:35.342 --> 00:13:36.742
It was one big party.

282
00:13:36.744 --> 00:13:38.377
Yay!

283
00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:39.778
But little by little.

284
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.447
Trolls became intolerant
of each other's music.

285
00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:43.715
I want it!

286
00:13:43.717 --> 00:13:45.717
- I want to listen to techno!
- No fair!

287
00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:47.719
Hey. y'all. I want country.

288
00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:50.221
They fought
over what kind of music

289
00:13:50.223 --> 00:13:51.723
the strings would play.

290
00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:54.426
The elders realized
there was but one solution.

291
00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:56.561
Blah.
blah-blah-blah-blah. Agreed.

292
00:13:56.563 --> 00:13:59.398
Each tribe would take a string

293
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.402
and go their separate ways.

294
00:14:03.437 --> 00:14:07.406
Those six tribes have lived
in isolation ever since.

295
00:14:07.408 --> 00:14:10.242
Techno. Country. Rock.

296
00:14:10.244 --> 00:14:12.244
Classical. Funk.

297
00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:14.715
and us. the Pop Trolls.

298
00:14:16.016 --> 00:14:18.450
Now Barb's announcement
makes sense.

299
00:14:18.452 --> 00:14:20.018
She wants to reunite
the strings

300
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.654
so the Troll World
can be one big party again.

301
00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:24.289
Wait. that's all you heard?

302
00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:26.291
- One big party?
- Yeah!

303
00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:28.026
It's when all the Trolls
lived in harmony.

304
00:14:28.028 --> 00:14:30.462
And what's more important
than living in harmony?

305
00:14:30.464 --> 00:14:31.697
Well. I heard fighting.

306
00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:33.298
The strings together
leads to fighting.

307
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.533
Exactly. Branch.

308
00:14:34.535 --> 00:14:37.302
That's why we need
to keep our string safe.

309
00:14:37.304 --> 00:14:38.939
♪ ♪

310
00:14:42.843 --> 00:14:44.042
Behold!

311
00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:46.845
The pop music string.

312
00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:49.848
♪ Oh. yeah. ♪

313
00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:56.755
It's beautiful.

314
00:14:56.757 --> 00:14:58.590
And powerful.

315
00:14:58.592 --> 00:15:01.727
Which is why we can't let it
fall into the wrong hands.

316
00:15:01.729 --> 00:15:03.862
And we won't.
Not on my watch.

317
00:15:03.864 --> 00:15:06.498
What we need is a plan.

318
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.466
Don't worry.

319
00:15:07.468 --> 00:15:10.669
I've been preparing
for this day for years.

320
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:12.370
- We run.
- Run?

321
00:15:12.372 --> 00:15:13.371
And hide.

322
00:15:13.373 --> 00:15:14.606
On it.

323
00:15:14.608 --> 00:15:18.343
But we don't even know what
we're running and hiding from.

324
00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:21.680
We're hiding from Barb and
all the other different Trolls.

325
00:15:21.682 --> 00:15:23.515
You're assuming the worst about

326
00:15:23.517 --> 00:15:24.716
someone you haven't even met.

327
00:15:24.718 --> 00:15:28.487
- You're not listening to me.
- You're not listening to me.

328
00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:31.323
- I'm your father!
- And I'm the queen.

329
00:15:31.325 --> 00:15:32.791
Uh. father trumps queen.

330
00:15:32.793 --> 00:15:35.527
Now. there's no time
to debate this. Let's go.

331
00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:37.362
Come along. Branch.

332
00:15:37.364 --> 00:15:38.799
Well. I. um...

333
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:42.367
We're all Trolls.

334
00:15:42.369 --> 00:15:44.371
Differences don't matter.

335
00:15:46.673 --> 00:15:48.673
Oh. look how cute you are!

336
00:15:48.675 --> 00:15:50.809
Barb is gonna love
your new look.

337
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:52.744
Tell her I look forward
to helping her

338
00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:54.412
plan the world's biggest party.

339
00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:55.480
Poppy.

340
00:15:55.482 --> 00:15:57.482
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Nothing.

341
00:15:57.484 --> 00:15:58.683
Ooh!

342
00:15:58.685 --> 00:16:01.386
Poppy's busted.

343
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:03.889
Sneaking out to meet Barb?

344
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:05.423
Headed into enemy territory?

345
00:16:05.425 --> 00:16:06.458
She's not the enemy.

346
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.926
She's a queen. the same as me.

347
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:11.930
Bye-bye. little bat.

348
00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:15.367
Your dad just told us
that Queen Barb is bad news.

349
00:16:15.369 --> 00:16:16.568
Well. my dad
doesn't know everything.

350
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.436
He knows more about this.

351
00:16:18.438 --> 00:16:20.639
You didn't even know there was
a string until this morning.

352
00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:23.375
He may be fine in a world where
everybody lives in isolation.

353
00:16:23.377 --> 00:16:24.943
- but I'm not.
- Well. but we don't know

354
00:16:24.945 --> 00:16:27.379
anything about
the other Trolls.

355
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:28.814
Well. we know they're Trolls.

356
00:16:28.816 --> 00:16:30.649
Branch. look around
Troll Village.

357
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:32.851

898
00:43:01.308 --> 00:43:02.541
Poppy.

899
00:43:02.543 --> 00:43:05.176
how'd you like the sushi?

900
00:43:05.178 --> 00:43:06.578
Oh.

cheesy. pointless pop music.

My name's Hickory.

908
00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:28.767

for smooth jazz.

909

Oh. yeah?

910
00:43:30.271 --> 00:43:35.039

the Chaz experience.

Who was that guy?

917
00:43:57.531 --> 00:44:00.265
One of the many bounty hunters
out there looking for you.

918
00:44:00.267 --> 00:44:02.234
That was awful.

919
00:44:02.236 --> 00:44:04.236
So smooth and easy and awful.

920
00:44:04.238 --> 00:44:05.604

921
00:44:05.606 --> 00:44:08.105

off jazz altogether.

922
00:44:08.107 --> 00:44:10.409
All right. that's it!
We need to go home.

When we were both babies.

1002
00:48:52.726 --> 00:48:54.693
my egg got snatched
out of the nest.

1003
00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:56.762
Mom and Dad looked everywhere.
but they couldn't find me.

1004
00:48:56.764 --> 00:48:58.764
- so you guys raised me as one of your own.
- Aw.

1005
00:48:58.766 --> 00:49:00.465
Now dig this.

1006
00:49:00.467 --> 00:49:02.534
And then
when I went out to go find

1007
00:49:02.536 --> 00:49:06.738
other Trolls like me. my mom
and dad finally found me.

1008
00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.673
Q. is that him?

1009
00:49:08.675 --> 00:49:10.342

is finally over.

1010
00:49:10.344 --> 00:49:12.410
Our son is finally home.

1011
00:49:14.481 --> 00:49:16.381
I guess it wasn't
too complicated.

1012
00:49:16.383 --> 00:49:17.816

1013
00:49:17.818 --> 00:49:21.653

00:49:35.936 --> 00:49:37.702

1033
00:50:00.561 --> 00:50:01.960

without song or dance.

1041
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:22.881

found the strings.

1042

00:50:26.787 --> 00:50:30.555

tried to steal our strings.

So the Trolls live in isolation
because of what Pop did?

1111
00:52:46.893 --> 00:52:49.928
Pop tried to destroy our music.

1112
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:52.697
Just like Barb is trying to do.

1113
00:52:52.699 --> 00:52:53.999
I can make it right.

1114
00:52:54.001 --> 00:52:55.900
History's just gonna
keep repeating itself

until we make everyone realize
that we're all the same.

1116
00:52:58.772 --> 00:53:00.772
But we're not all the same.

1117
00:53:00.774 --> 00:53:02.907
It's why all our strings
are different.

1118
00:53:02.909 --> 00:53:05.076
Because they reflect
our different music.

1119
00:53:05.078 --> 00:53:08.013
Denying our differences

1120
00:53:08.015 --> 00:53:10.917
is denying the truth
of who we are.

1121
00:53:12.953 --> 00:53:15.086
I hadn't thought of it
like that.

1122

It's on!

1123

Rock on!

1140
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.723
No!

1141
00:54:25.725 --> 00:54:27.759
We have to get back down there.
There's still hope.

1142
00:54:27.761 --> 00:54:29.994
- We can still fix this.
- Poppy. enough.

1143
00:54:29.996 --> 00:54:31.930
I've listened to you
and I've done it your way.

1144
00:54:31.932 --> 00:54:33.965
and now it's your turn
to listen.

1145
00:54:33.967 --> 00:54:36.000
It's time to get back home.

1146
00:54:36.002 --> 00:54:38.136
I'm not like you.
I can't just give up.

1147
00:54:38.138 --> 00:54:39.737
Give up?

1148
00:54:39.739 --> 00:54:41.673
I want to protect
our friends and family.

1149
00:54:41.675 --> 00:54:45.244
I can't go home until I've
proven myself as a good queen.

1150
00:54:45.246 --> 00:54:47.446
So that's what this is
really all about?

1151
00:54:47.448 --> 00:54:49.013
Why are you so upset?

1152
00:54:49.015 --> 00:54:50.882
Because your dad was right

1153
00:54:50.884 --> 00:54:53.151
and Biggie was right
and Queen Essence was right.

1154
00:54:53.153 --> 00:54:56.990
And I've been backing you up
even when you ignore them.

1155
00:54:59.759 --> 00:55:01.960
But you never listen to me.

1156
00:55:01.962 --> 00:55:03.830
Branch. what are you
talking about?

1157
00:55:04.865 --> 00:55:06.865
You want to be a good queen?

1158
00:55:06.867 --> 00:55:08.766
Good queens actually listen.

1159
00:55:08.768 --> 00:55:10.935
You know what I heard
back there?

1160
00:55:10.937 --> 00:55:13.039
Differences do matter.

1161
00:55:15.175 --> 00:55:18.042
Like-like you and me.

1162
00:55:18.044 --> 00:55:20.778
We're too different
to get along.

1163
00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.782
Just like all the other Trolls.

1164
00:55:34.495 --> 00:55:36.928
- We are really different.
- So different.

1165
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.230
- Completely out of harmony.
- Completely.

1166
00:55:38.232 --> 00:55:39.797
I don't even know
why we're friends.

1167
00:55:39.799 --> 00:55:41.868
Neither do I.

1168
00:55:49.343 --> 00:55:51.943
So...

1169
00:55:51.945 --> 00:55:55.949

00:55:59.886 --> 00:56:01.888

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.123
She learned
that from watching me.

1416
01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:06.124
Give me that!

1417
01:11:06.126 --> 01:11:08.693
I'm not gonna let you
do this to anyone else!

1418
01:11:08.695 --> 01:11:11.796
A world where everyone looks
the same and sounds the same?

1419
01:11:11.798 --> 01:11:13.832
That's not harmony.

1420
01:11:13.834 --> 01:11:15.001
Hey. Barb?

1421
01:11:16.002 --> 01:11:17.135
Hi.

1422
01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:19.070
Maybe Queen Poppy has a point.

1423
01:11:19.072 --> 01:11:22.274
If we all look the same.
act the same. dress the same.

1424
01:11:22.276 --> 01:11:26.010
how will anyone know
we're cool or something?

1425
01:11:26.012 --> 01:11:28.079
Yeah. He's got a point.

1426
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:29.981
A good point.

1427
01:11:29.983 --> 01:11:32.986
A good queen listens.

1428
01:11:35.456 --> 01:11:38.156
Real harmony
takes lots of voices.

1429
01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:41.025
Different voices!

1430
01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.744
Oh.

1431
01:12:04.818 --> 01:12:07.118
Branch!

1432
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.255
No.

1433
01:12:14.094 --> 01:12:15.862
My strings.

1434
01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:23.269
What have you done?

1435
01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:26.104
You've destroyed music!

1436
01:12:26.106 --> 01:12:28.274
Give it up. everybody.

1437
01:12:28.276 --> 01:12:33.281
Thanks to the Queen of Pop.
we've all lost our music.

1438
01:12:35.182 --> 01:12:37.916
History repeats itself.

1439
01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:41.121
Pop has ruined everything.

1440
01:13:38.144 --> 01:13:40.878
Those are my sons.

1441
01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.348
Making music.

1442
01:14:09.109 --> 01:14:12.112
Queen Barb can't take away
something that is inside us.

1443
01:14:13.614 --> 01:14:16.182
Because that's where music
really comes from.

1444
01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:21.919
It started with the strings.
but now it comes from us.

1445
01:14:29.896 --> 01:14:32.997
Yeah. it comes from
our experiences.

1446
01:14:32.999 --> 01:14:34.266
Our lives.

1447
01:14:34.268 --> 01:14:36.034
Our culture.

1448
01:14:37.305 --> 01:14:39.338
Beautiful.

1449
01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.172

1450
01:14:41.174 --> 01:14:43.342

Dad. I should've listened
to what you had to say

1546
01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:20.217
and not run off like that.

1547
01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:23.220
I'm so glad
you didn't listen to me.

1548
01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:25.524
You weren't naive
about this world.

1549
01:19:25.526 --> 01:19:28.462
You were brave enough
to believe things can change.

1550
01:19:30.364 --> 01:19:32.198
Braver than me.

1551
01:19:33.534 --> 01:19:36.935

strong and self-confident.

1552
01:19:36.937 --> 01:19:39.404
I was a genius.

01:19:39.406 --> 01:19:40.739
Ha! Ha! Yeah!

1554
01:19:44.445 --> 01:19:46.244
Well. now that
you're not forcing me.

1555
01:19:46.246 --> 01:19:47.512
I hope we can be friends.

1556
01:19:47.514 --> 01:19:48.513
Yes!

1557
01:19:48.515 --> 01:19:49.748
Did you hear that. Carol?

1558
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.250
We have a girl group now!

1559
01:19:52.252 --> 01:19:54.586

1560
01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:00.559

1561

1562

- Yeah!
- Yes!

1567
01:20:20.981 --> 01:20:24.683
Now. that's a good connection!

1568
01:20:24.685 --> 01:20:27.686
In the beginning.
we were divided.

1569
01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:31.323
Our ancestors thought

1570
01:20:31.325 --> 01:20:34.626
we were just too different
to get along.

1571
01:20:34.628 --> 01:20:36.695
It turns out they were wrong.

1572
01:20:36.697 --> 01:20:38.697
Very. very wrong.

1573
01:20:38.699 --> 01:20:39.965
We're sorry.

1574
01:20:39.967 --> 01:20:42.768
You have to be able
to listen to other voices.

1575
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:44.503
even when they don't
agree with you.

1576
01:20:46.573 --> 01:20:48.573
They make us stronger.

1577
01:20:48.575 --> 01:20:51.410
more creative. more inspired.

1578
01:20:51.412 --> 01:20:54.312

sad and heartfelt.

1579
01:20:54.314 --> 01:20:56.515

1581
01:20:58.419 --> 01:21:01.319
or even if you're
a little bit of each.

1582
01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:03.689
it's all these sounds
and all our differences

1583
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:05.757
that make the world
a richer place.

1584

1585
