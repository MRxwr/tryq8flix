00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.793
May all beings and all
be happy and free

2
00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.578
and may the thoughts. words and actions

3
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.617
of my own life contribute in some way

4
00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.874
to the happiness and freedom for all.

5
00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:32.703
may health abound forever.

6
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:37.414
May peace.

7
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.831
Verta.

8
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Sister.

9
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.241
I had that vision again.

10
00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:00.784
I've meditated for 500 years.

11
00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.040
Immortality's nearly within reach.

12
00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:09.375
But I can never break through the wall.

13
00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.995
I know. it's always treacherous.

14
00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:33.623
There's an emptiness inside my heart.

15
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.494
It's missing something.

16
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.079
Why is it when I get
close. I always get thrown

17
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.662
into all this chaos?

18
00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.789
Just what is it that I lack?

19
00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:55.202
Hold this hairpin.

20
00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.665
Hold it. you've always worn it.

21
00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.198
You've never let me...

22
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.115
[Vertal I'll allow it now.

23
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:06.618
It was yours after all.

24
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:09.789
Hold it tight.

25
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.537
Late in the
tang dynasty. chaos reigned.

26
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.699
demons haunted the world.

27
00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.332
The emperor craved eternal life.

28
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.697
His dark general unable
to fulfill that desire.

29
00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.490
incurred his wrath.

30
00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:47.079
In order to regain the emperor's favor.

31
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.286
The general had the people catch snakes

32
00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:51.540
to feed his daoist powers.

33
00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:31.705
Force of
darkness. flow and gather.

34
00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:36.114
Spread your power across the land.

35
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.868
Force of darkness. flow and gather.

36
00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:48.534
Spread your power across the land.

37
00:05:56.292 --> 00:05:57.577
Assassin!

38
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.082
Seize her!

39
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.330
On her. positions!

40
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:13.533
Where is she?

41
00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.369
There you are. - Who are you?

42
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.458
It's a scary world. you're safe here.

43
00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:28.906
Where are we?

44
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.244
Snake catcher village.

45
00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.999
What should I call you.
where are you from?

46
00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:50.865
What's wrong?

47
00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:52.578
You don't remember anything?

48
00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:58.829
Oh. it's the snake catchers.

49
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.912
It was our young xuan who saved you.

50
00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:03.083
So xuan...

51
00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:08.947
We catch snakes for a
living and we build our houses

52
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:12.367
this way because the
mountains and forests are full

53
00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:16.080
of wild beasts and demons as well.

54
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.081
I'm a demon!

55
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.059
- Careful where you run. kids.
- Auntie!

56
00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:22.742
- Hey. wait!
- The herbs xuan

57
00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:24.032
picked out really worked!

58
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.574
- I'm almost healed!
- Be careful!

59
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.366
Catching snakes is dangerous!
She's a real beauty.

60
00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.578
Hua. can you lower that wine down?

61
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.332
Sure. it's the good stuff too!

62
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.159
Keeps snakes away!

63
00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:36.493
Young lady. let's go.

64
00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:44.532
Xuan. you're the last one again?

65
00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.351
You'll be sleeping with
the snakes tonight.

66
00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:47.740
You better hurry!

67
00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:14.534
It's xuan!

68
00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:26.083
You're awake?

69
00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:31.875
Dudou?

70
00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:33.782
How'd you get down there?

71
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.370
What. no snakes again. xuan?

72
00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:37.622
You want one of mine?

73
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:41.081
A catcher afraid of snakes.

74
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.115
If only your herbs could pay taxes.

75
00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:46.079
Who needs taxes
when you can save lives?

76
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.161
- Xuan is back!
- Yay. xuan!

77
00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:48.992
What did you bring?

78
00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:50.407
Come take a look.

79
00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:51.618
Who wants this one?

80
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:52.622
- I want it!
- Oh?

81
00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.114
- Give it to me.
- Oh. easy now.

82
00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:03.948
Help.

83
00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:06.283
Help. they're going to eat us.

84
00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:11.208
Young lady.

85
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.537
Xuan. she doesn't
remember anything at all.

86
00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.494
Hey. miss?

87
00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:22.534
Don't worry. I'll take
you to where I found you.

88
00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:23.708
There could be clues.

89
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.286
Our snake traps are
usually set down there.

90
00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:33.039
Why do you trap snakes?

91
00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:35.574
The world's
getting worse and worse

92
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.661
and taxes just keep getting higher.

93
00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:39.824
The general lets us pay
them off with snakes.

94
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:42.869
Which means no forced labor.

95
00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.828
so we all decided to catch snakes.

96
00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:48.864
It's dangerous work.
but if you don't do it.

97
00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:50.077
things would be worst.

98
00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.415
There. it was under that waterfall.

99
00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.823
Dudou. I know that's a shortcut

100
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.332
but it's a rough path even for us

101
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.615
and don't forget her.

102
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.489
Dudou!

103
00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:16.542
Huh?

104
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.831
You know magic?

105
00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.118
Why don't I go first?

106
00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:32.372
You can take your time.

107
00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:40.700
Dudou. we ought to follow
her. wouldn't you say?

108
00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:41.875
Huh?

109
00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.292
Dudou?

110
00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:47.448
Go on home then.

111
00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:28.166
I wish I knew magic.

112
00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.790
What do you wanna bet you're
some kind of immortal?

113
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.073
I don't recall.

114
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.368
What is this place?

115
00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.498
Oh. this is a shack I built.

116
00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:38.328
It's usually where I do this and that.

117
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.831
Like dry herbs.

118
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.197
When I'm a doctor. I won't
have to catch snakes.

119
00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.331
"Hall of defense?"

120
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.240
Why is it that you call it that?

121
00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:49.248
Huh. oh. this?

122
00:12:49.417 --> 00:12:51.057
It's something that I found by the river.

123
00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:53.579
Ah. right. so I was making umbrellas

124
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.990
and then I heard dudou.

125
00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:57.829
I went to look and you were
just there on that rock.

126
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.831
floating halfway in the water.

127
00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:09.951
Kill the general.

128
00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.615
even if it costs your life.

129
00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.434
Master. he's our greatest enemy.

130
00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:14.243
You have our gratitude.

131
00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:15.122
I'm not ready.

132
00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:16.077
We have rules.

133
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.161
you can't just act as you please.

134
00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.490
Did you remember something?

135
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:29.368
Are there things you don't want to do

136
00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.203
yet you find you have to?

137
00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:34.162
Sure. I don't wanna do lots of things.

138
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.991
but that's what life is.

139
00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.079
Though naturally I'd rather
live it as freely as I can.

140
00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:43.448
That's why I study everything.

141
00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:47.072
Medicine. the stars. along
with the esoteric arts.

142
00:13:48.542 --> 00:13:52.330
Your fate may be set in
stone. how you live isn't.

143
00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:01.831
Spread
your power across the land.

144
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You okay?

145
00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:15.824
I'm flying.

146
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.240
Hey. I can fly.

147
00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:20.583
Wa-hoo!

148
00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:23.618
Hey. hey. look!

149
00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:36.499
This is great. the wind's got us.

150
00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:39.667
Wa-hoo!

151
00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:38.697
Xuan!

152
00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:40.991
I'm fine. I grabbed this.

153
00:15:41.167 --> 00:15:42.407
What is this?

154
00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:46.161
- Just focus on climbing.
- Right.

155
00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:53.667
Miss. miss!

156
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500
No!

157
00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:14.123
Wait. I know her.

158
00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:19.707
Isn't she the assassin
the general's after?

159
00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:23.743
- She is.
- The general. assassin?

160
00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:25.327
It could be a trap.

161
00:16:29.042 --> 00:16:30.907
Quick. before she wakes up.

162
00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:33.833
Who's there?

163
00:17:15.792 --> 00:17:18.499
That hairpin
and I are connected.

164
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:19.667
You're awake.

165
00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:26.199
I think this is magic.

166
00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:28.703
But I don't know how to use it.

167
00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.698
"Precious Jade."

168
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.115
Wait a second.

169
00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:38.452
Precious Jade.

170
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.164
Precious Jade.

171
00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:46.993
Oh. that workshop.

172
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.202
What workshop?

173
00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:49.893
I've heard that it's in an almond grove

174
00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:51.077
just outside of yongzhou.

175
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:54.142
And that they craft the finest wares out

176
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.618
of that little workshop.

177
00:17:55.792 --> 00:17:58.283
This must be one of theirs.
let's go ask them about it.

178
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.785
Xuan. thank you.

179
00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:03.615
Don't trouble yourself though.

180
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.623
Who knows what kind of person I am.

181
00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:10.666
Even if that isn't
clear yet. I know this.

182
00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:11.868
you're not evil.

183
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.865
We're with the general!

184
00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:19.042
Open up!

185
00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:22.748
Everyone come out now.

186
00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:24.625
The general?

187
00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:27.699
Those two soldiers. we should go.

188
00:18:49.292 --> 00:18:53.490
Forgive us. this
year. snakes are scarce.

189
00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:56.659
We've done our best.

190
00:18:56.833 --> 00:19:00.030
The world's in chaos
and demons are rising.

191
00:19:00.208 --> 00:19:02.665
The general is hard at
work honing his skills

192
00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:04.494
to save the country.

193
00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:07.704
Right. demons feast on
flesh and show no mercy.

194
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.866
We're truly grateful for the general.

195
00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:14.957
However. tonight. I'm here
regarding this umbrella.

196
00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:17.160
Whose is it?

197
00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:21.246
Also is there an unusual
woman dressed in white

198
00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:22.532
in this village?

199
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.410
Answer him!

200
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:29.938
- Please!
- Please don't hurt my baby!

201
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.164
Relax. just state the truth
and nothing shall happen.

202
00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:37.119
Fine. I'll tell you.

203
00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:38.623
I saw her with xuan earlier.

204
00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:40.917
My baby!

205
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.241
- Search the village.
- Yes. sir.

206
00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:45.122
- Come on.
- Over here.

207
00:19:45.292 --> 00:19:46.612
- I'll take this side.
- This way!

208
00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:00.787
How much longer do we
have to stay in this cave

209
00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:01.958
and live in fear?

210
00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.949
It was a crucial task.

211
00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:08.366
Our master should've chosen me.

212
00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.248
The scout's back!

213
00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.074
She really attacked you?

214
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.411
Yes. and she was serious enough

215
00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:30.993
that she nearly killed me!

216
00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:32.327
How dare she?

217
00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:36.540
And for some reason. the general's army

218
00:20:36.708 --> 00:20:37.914
is racing this way.

219
00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:46.075
Master. she's joined the
dark forces and betrayed us.

220
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.413
Also. I saw her with a snake catcher.

221
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:51.995
It looked as if they
were fond of each other.

222
00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:53.167
What?

223
00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:58.866
Really?

224
00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:09.615
Master.

225
00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:13.968
Don't forget that the mantra

226
00:21:14.042 --> 00:21:17.489
I've taught you all is the
very key to mutual strength.

227
00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:22.656
This hand flows to the source.

228
00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:25.575
United in good and bad.

229
00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:32.866
My thanks. master. to you and everyone.

230
00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:34.748
I am restored.

231
00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:37.499
Master. the white snake
has betrayed us all.

232
00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:40.454
That's the...

233
00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:43.037
Master. she would not betray us.

234
00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:44.038
I'll bring her back.

235
00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:47.621
You. we all know how close you two are.

236
00:21:47.792 --> 00:21:50.283
Master. use the scorching death scales.

237
00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:51.789
Is she serious?

238
00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:55.246
Is she serious?

239
00:21:57.792 --> 00:22:00.534
Bring her and the
hairpin back in three days.

240
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:03.780
Even I can't save you.
should the scales activate.

241
00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:05.625
Yes.

242
00:22:07.458 --> 00:22:09.073
Chang pan.

243
00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:15.909
And these are the boy's belongings?

244
00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:23.620
Notify the general. he should head here.

245
00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:24.792
Yes. sir.

246
00:22:24.917 --> 00:22:27.784
If 1 can extract that
young lady's energy.

247
00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:31.780
you snake catchers will
no longer have any use.

248
00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:57.365
Yongzhou's not far.

249
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:02.375
Still no memory?

250
00:23:05.458 --> 00:23:08.530
If I had that issue. I'd
have a huge headache.

251
00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:11.905
I just can't imagine not knowing yourself.

252
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.948
Where you've been. what you've done.

253
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.867
Then again. there's a lot

254
00:23:20.042 --> 00:23:21.748
that's better off forgotten.

255
00:23:21.917 --> 00:23:24.249
Look the wrong way and seasons turn.

256
00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:26.499
our lives are short but sorrows long.

257
00:23:28.042 --> 00:23:31.239
And so. we might as well
just focus on the good stuff.

258
00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:49.166
Hey captain. that song
of yours is ancient.

259
00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:50.493
What dynasty is that from?

260
00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:51.873
How about I sing one?

261
00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:53.282
Sure. go ahead.

262
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:06.618

272
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:07.583
Lovely.

273
00:25:08.917 --> 00:25:09.917
It's so true.

274
00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.040
It is like a dream.

275
00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:15.824
Enjoying life. it's nice.

276
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.286
If you like that song.
I'll teach it to you.

277
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:21.118
All right.

278
00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:58.039
Got it?

279
00:25:58.208 --> 00:25:59.823
Let's sing it together.

280
00:26:01.292 --> 00:26:04.580
We might as well. we've got the time.

281
00:26:16.042 --> 00:26:19.455
A mysterious girl. mysterious powers.

282
00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:23.161
She could be human or demon.

283
00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:24.664
You think you're a demon?

284
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.573
They're all shapes and sizes. sure.

285
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.911
but they're also known to eat people.

286
00:26:29.083 --> 00:26:30.083
How could you be one?

287
00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:33.494
And who cares if you are?

288
00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:35.157
For instance. dudou.

289
00:26:37.792 --> 00:26:40.204
If he was one. I'd still like the fella

290
00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:42.661
and I know the reverse
is true. right. boy?

291
00:26:43.958 --> 00:26:44.958
Really?

292
00:26:46.292 --> 00:26:47.702
- Who says I like you?
- What?

293
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:50.161
You're just the one who feeds me.

294
00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:52.324
Am I talking now?

295
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.500
Woof. woof?

296
00:26:56.542 --> 00:26:58.203
Why am I talking. why am I talking?

297
00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.375
I shouldn't be?

298
00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:03.619
Will people think I'm a
demon now and kill me?

299
00:27:03.792 --> 00:27:04.451
Why does my voice sound like this?

300
00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.286
Sh. sh. not so loud.

301
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.618
He'll hear you. - I can talk.

302
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.822
Be careful.
the river runs fast here!

303
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.240
You'll fall in!

304
00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:50.619
You really are with a human.

305
00:27:51.542 --> 00:27:53.032
Your life is mine!

306
00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:01.708
No!

307
00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.125
Watch out!

308
00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:43.583
Hey.

309
00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:09.954
Xuan. xuan. why don't we just go?

310
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:13.448
I'm talking to you.

311
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.456
I really think we should go.

312
00:29:23.417 --> 00:29:24.417
Xuan!

313
00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:31.993
Stop that!

314
00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:33.782
Aren't you scared of snakes?

315
00:29:33.958 --> 00:29:35.619
That's a snake demon. xuan!

316
00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:37.123
Quiet!

317
00:29:37.292 --> 00:29:39.078
I can't just leave her all alone here.

318
00:29:40.542 --> 00:29:42.123
Do what you like.

319
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:01.665
Dudou. why was he holding me?

320
00:31:01.833 --> 00:31:04.415
You were shivering. cold as ice.

321
00:31:04.583 --> 00:31:07.996
Xuan kept you warm. that's
why he was holding you.

322
00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:10.283
That brought you around. you were so cold.

323
00:31:10.458 --> 00:31:11.948
you iced up the floor.

324
00:31:12.125 --> 00:31:14.036
But we didn't leave you.

325
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.581
There you are.

326
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.990
I was afraid you'd left.

327
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.750
A demon's tail.

328
00:31:58.458 --> 00:31:59.868
I guess I am one.

329
00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:03.368
Does it matter?

330
00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:07.450
The world's full of awful
folks without tails.

331
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:08.956
Who cares if you've got one.

332
00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:24.157
You weren't awful.

333
00:32:46.292 --> 00:32:48.157
Well. what
do ya think. huh. huh?

334
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:48.992
No thanks.

335
00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:52.204
Good sir. we barely made it
to the city with our lives.

336
00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:54.125
Do you have any food?

337
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:56.199
There's so many vagrants around lately.

338
00:32:56.375 --> 00:32:58.036
Let's go. dear.

339
00:32:58.208 --> 00:33:00.995
Out of the way!

340
00:33:01.167 --> 00:33:02.226
- You're all right.
- Is she okay?

341
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.832
Don't cry.

342
00:33:07.542 --> 00:33:10.534
Those poor refugees. it's so sad.

343
00:33:10.708 --> 00:33:12.108
They're considered lucky.

344
00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:14.494
Yongzhou is still relatively safe.

345
00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:20.333
Huh?

346
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:22.364
What's wrong?

347
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:23.622
Oh. it's nothing.

348
00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:30.458
Let's go.

349
00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:37.157
Huh?

350
00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:41.155
You're not alone. you know.

351
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.660
Precious Jade workshop

352
00:33:50.167 --> 00:33:51.532
Faster!

353
00:33:51.708 --> 00:33:54.996
- I think I was here once.
- Position 31.

354
00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:56.167
Stop!

355
00:34:01.542 --> 00:34:04.124
Ah. we have guests. I see.

356
00:34:06.167 --> 00:34:09.830
Oh. you've returned. young lady.

357
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.285
Issues with the wand?

358
00:34:12.958 --> 00:34:15.791
Oh. right. we would like to
know more about its origin.

359
00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:25.905
Hm. do tell.

360
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:37.077
Though you're human. I detect
the distinct scent of a demon.

361
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:42.244
Perchance you were
cozy with a certain one?

362
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.161
Well. regardless. come.

363
00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:20.114
Every demon within 300 li flocks here.

364
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:23.034
If you require artifacts
of the magical sort.

365
00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:25.324
come to precious Jade workshop.

366
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.242
where all our weapons
are of demon quality.

367
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Whoa.

368
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:02.750
Get to work!

369
00:36:18.083 --> 00:36:20.165
This hairpin belonged to another owner

370
00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.619
if I recall correctly.

371
00:36:22.792 --> 00:36:26.614
It saps the energy of others
and converts it to its owner's

372
00:36:26.792 --> 00:36:28.157
for future use.

373
00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:31.200
- Saps energy?
- Indeed.

374
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:33.787
This wand has no equal.

375
00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:49.906
When young lady was here.
you asked for an alteration.

376
00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:51.539
so you could control it.

377
00:36:53.417 --> 00:36:54.417
Good.

378
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:58.413
Good.

379
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.073
No good!

380
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.822
But such changes could
create large side effects.

381
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.491
I'll say. she can't recall a thing.

382
00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:07.497
That's the reason why?

383
00:37:07.667 --> 00:37:10.409
Oh. I think you're right.

384
00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:13.620
One's foes do get drained. but then...

385
00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:20.405
It could in all likelihood
erase one's memories

386
00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:24.997
and without those. what
use are magic powers?

387
00:37:25.167 --> 00:37:30.082
Heaven knows. for every
gain. there's a loss.

388
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:32.118
Poetic. no?

389
00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:32.951
Yet you...

390
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:35.081
But young lady was insistent.

391
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.287
you can blame it on this fox's vanity.

392
00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.198
These sorts of reversals.

393
00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:42.411
changing heaven into earth.

394
00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:45.871
evil to good. people to demons.

395
00:37:46.042 --> 00:37:49.159
manipulating that. holds interest to us.

396
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.536
So this hairpin then.

397
00:37:54.708 --> 00:37:56.619
Do you know where its old owner is?

398
00:37:56.792 --> 00:37:59.955
Of course.

399
00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:28.825
That's pretty big. isn't it?

400
00:38:30.167 --> 00:38:33.785
It's from one of my kind.
though they're clearly stronger.

401
00:38:33.958 --> 00:38:35.573
I can tell it's a snake scale.

402
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.750
A snake's?

403
00:39:13.083 --> 00:39:15.165
You're a snake catcher!

404
00:39:18.458 --> 00:39:19.743
Blanca!

405
00:39:19.917 --> 00:39:21.532
- Blanca!
- Blanca!

406
00:39:21.708 --> 00:39:23.073
- Blanca!
- Blanca!

407
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.706
- Blanca!
- Blanca!

408
00:39:24.875 --> 00:39:25.875
Verta.

409
00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:28.875
Blanca?

410
00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:35.625
Verta! I

411
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.455
you're verta!

412
00:39:39.583 --> 00:39:40.583
I know who I was.

413
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.662
You were given that
hairpin and an order.

414
00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.164
To kill the general.

415
00:39:52.792 --> 00:39:54.953
You don't recall. sister?

416
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.831
Why does he need snakes?

417
00:40:01.917 --> 00:40:04.158
That swine is using dark kung-fu.

418
00:40:04.333 --> 00:40:06.164
The same that we snakes employ.

419
00:40:06.333 --> 00:40:09.370
He increases his power through
feeding on our essence.

420
00:40:10.542 --> 00:40:13.659
Master hates the general and his kind.

421
00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:18.702
She says they're sinister
and vicious to the last.

422
00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:19.875
He's different.

423
00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:23.366
When I was lost. with no memory.

424
00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:26.698
he saved me.

425
00:40:26.875 --> 00:40:29.207
Even so. I don't trust him.

426
00:40:29.375 --> 00:40:32.117
So that's what the general's
been up to with the snakes.

427
00:40:32.292 --> 00:40:35.455
Deceiver! And you catch snakes. killer!

428
00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:36.625
I really had no idea.

429
00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:40.705
Death to collaborators!

430
00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:42.160
What's your plan now?

431
00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:44.244
Verta. release xuan.

432
00:40:46.208 --> 00:40:47.698
Xuan!

433
00:40:53.333 --> 00:40:56.405
A snake catcher like you. so
unwilling to leave her side.

434
00:40:56.583 --> 00:40:57.242
You're hiding something.

435
00:40:57.417 --> 00:40:58.907
- Verta.
- You're a snake?

436
00:40:59.083 --> 00:41:01.665
So hot blooded. not good for your health.

437
00:41:04.542 --> 00:41:06.248
Talk. what are you after?

438
00:41:19.708 --> 00:41:22.040
Huh. so you are with the dark forces.

439
00:41:22.208 --> 00:41:24.665
I have no idea what
that is or what's going on

440
00:41:24.833 --> 00:41:25.492
with this thing.

441
00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:27.578
See. sister. he is with the general.

442
00:41:31.542 --> 00:41:33.032
I trust xuan.

443
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.493
Trust. huh?

444
00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:40.083
I refuse to.

445
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:42.414
The snake catcher is mine!

446
00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:52.324
Get up!

447
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.287
Sister. you've forgotten
our clan's teachings!

448
00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:58.530
All humans are devious.
they are cheats and thieves!

449
00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.578
Verta. I don't remember a lot.

450
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.786
only our journey here and
he's not those things.

451
00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:06.494
I do remember!

452
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:08.750
Follow Mel

453
00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:14.907
careful.

454
00:42:15.083 --> 00:42:16.083
Could be dangerous.

455
00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:35.619
Oh. who'd have guessed that
this pagoda had a hidden tunnel.

456
00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:42.115
We should find a way out.

457
00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.417
Blanca!

458
00:43:21.917 --> 00:43:22.917
Blanca!

459
00:43:39.042 --> 00:43:40.873
Bird on a ceiling. tortoise under.

460
00:43:41.042 --> 00:43:43.408
palace within. gate without. eight doors.

461
00:43:43.583 --> 00:43:45.244
the door of life. that's it!

462
00:44:05.583 --> 00:44:09.531
Don't worry. you went
through the door of life.

463
00:44:20.917 --> 00:44:22.282
What is this place?

464
00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:26.697
It looks like an
underground exorcism chamber.

465
00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:29.412
So it should be safe for humans.

466
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:33.952
Still. why is there a
daoist chamber down here?

467
00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:35.911
I guess there was an abandoned temple

468
00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:37.948
and they built the pagoda on top of it.

469
00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:45.538
Relax. there should be clues
around here. I'll go look.

470
00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:49.614
We will get out. wait here. okay. hm?

471
00:45:05.708 --> 00:45:09.200
Heaven and earth. breath of all life.

472
00:45:09.375 --> 00:45:12.287
Ceaseless honing. magic abounds.

473
00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:15.746
Demons wither. monsters shrivel.

474
00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:18.875
Evil expires. drowned by heaven.

475
00:45:28.917 --> 00:45:32.284
Spread
your power across the land.

476
00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:35.700
This is a magic weapon. take it

477
00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:38.116
and assassinate the general.

478
00:45:41.792 --> 00:45:42.792
Miss?

479
00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:51.207
I remember it all.

480
00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:56.289
I found the exit. let's go.

481
00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.250
Hey xuan.

482
00:45:59.542 --> 00:46:02.705
Would you say demons are fated to die?

483
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.867
Blanca. you're...

484
00:46:16.625 --> 00:46:19.367
Forcing us to catch
snakes for the slaughter.

485
00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:21.533
The world is in chaos!

486
00:46:21.708 --> 00:46:25.155
And if this goes on.
things will get even worse.

487
00:46:27.208 --> 00:46:29.824
Blanca. whatever happens.

488
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:31.990
I'll be there.

489
00:48:10.208 --> 00:48:11.208
Dudou!

490
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.250
You.

491
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:20.539
Sister?

492
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:23.290
Verta. I'll go with you.

493
00:48:23.458 --> 00:48:25.323
Sister. you've seen the light?

494
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.500
Where are you going?

495
00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.697
Sorry. we need to part ways.

496
00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:32.285
Why should we?

497
00:48:32.458 --> 00:48:33.789
The world's heartless.

498
00:48:36.708 --> 00:48:40.656
There are rules here and so many things

499
00:48:40.833 --> 00:48:42.118
that I'm forced to do.

500
00:48:43.708 --> 00:48:46.495
You're human. I'm demon.

501
00:48:48.042 --> 00:48:52.786
You said once. there are things
that are better forgotten.

502
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:05.165
It's like you say.
the world's heartless.

503
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:07.039
our paths different.

504
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:08.744
What we have is real though.

505
00:49:11.833 --> 00:49:13.414
I'll find a way for us.

506
00:49:19.375 --> 00:49:21.707
It won't take long.

507
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:22.875
Wait for me.

508
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.957
Dudou.

509
00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:47.208
You're human. if we're together.

510
00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:49.869
it'll just hurt you.

511
00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:58.286
Sister. I doubt he'll
return. we should go back.

512
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:04.032
Sister.

513
00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:08.825
We've been together for
hundreds of years now.

514
00:50:10.417 --> 00:50:13.659
Things are different though. for him.

515
00:50:24.292 --> 00:50:27.614
We worked so diligently
and endured such hardship.

516
00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:30.625
Forms such as these aren't easy to attain

517
00:50:30.792 --> 00:50:32.783
nor these lovely faces.

518
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.457
But our true nature will reveal itself.

519
00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:43.697
When it does. will he
still find you charming?

520
00:50:47.792 --> 00:50:51.410
Master once said. only
humans know the taste

521
00:50:51.583 --> 00:50:53.744
of love and desire.

522
00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:56.533
When I first awoke. I thought I was one.

523
00:51:00.208 --> 00:51:03.621
I think the taste of love
and desire is overrated.

524
00:51:03.792 --> 00:51:07.614
Laying like this. it's like
the statue's embracing me.

525
00:51:07.792 --> 00:51:09.282
Isn't this good enough?

526
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.330
It's cold though.

527
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.706
Am I cold too?

528
00:51:21.792 --> 00:51:23.328
- What's that on you?
- Don't.

529
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.661
It's the scorching death scales.

530
00:51:27.667 --> 00:51:30.864
I promised the master I'd
get you back in three days.

531
00:51:31.042 --> 00:51:32.042
If not...

532
00:51:32.167 --> 00:51:35.239
The death scales will tear you in two.

533
00:51:35.417 --> 00:51:37.703
Why did you?

534
00:51:37.875 --> 00:51:39.155
- Hurry. surround them!
- Sister.

535
00:51:40.375 --> 00:51:45.165
Yes. young one. I can help you.

536
00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:46.333
You can?

537
00:51:46.958 --> 00:51:51.372
You know. I was young once too.

538
00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:53.282
Rather frivolous as well as wild.

539
00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:57.575
Even now. I have quite a few regrets.

540
00:52:00.667 --> 00:52:03.454
You should know one day.

541
00:52:03.625 --> 00:52:04.705
you could regret this.

542
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.331
I'll regret things right now

543
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.601
as long as we're not together.

544
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:11.823
So be it. you
are young. aren't you?

545
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.663
Though transactions require an exchange.

546
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:19.121
Can you afford what it will cost?

547
00:52:19.292 --> 00:52:21.203
I'll trade you anything.

548
00:52:21.375 --> 00:52:24.162
Good. there is one way.

549
00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.782
Become a demon.

550
00:52:26.958 --> 00:52:28.118
What?

551
00:52:28.292 --> 00:52:28.951
What do you...

552
00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:31.457
Young one. think.

553
00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:35.322
If you're a demon. then
you two can stay together.

554
00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:40.948
However. I would need to
take your vital essence.

555
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.447
Demons such as ourselves
require human vitality

556
00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:49.081
to create our magic weapons.

557
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.912
The most effective
demonic weapons are forged

558
00:52:53.083 --> 00:52:54.823
from this very vitality.

559
00:52:55.958 --> 00:52:58.825
Precious Jade workshop
is renowned for staying

560
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.082
on the leading edge of that front.

561
00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:05.538
If I have to. it's a deal.

562
00:53:05.708 --> 00:53:07.915
Good.

563
00:53:10.792 --> 00:53:15.240
However. do you understand
the consequences of this?

564
00:53:15.417 --> 00:53:19.456
As a human. you're currently
afforded several advantages.

565
00:53:19.625 --> 00:53:21.536
Such as peace and safety.

566
00:53:21.708 --> 00:53:25.075
You muddle through life
taking it for granted

567
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:29.243
but as one of us. gods. humans and daoists

568
00:53:29.417 --> 00:53:30.827
will all want to kill you.

569
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.616
Even your own kind will want to kill you.

570
00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:37.790
Once I finish taking your vital essence.

571
00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:41.906
you'll be turned into the
weakest and smallest of demons.

572
00:53:42.083 --> 00:53:45.871
However hard you try.
there will be no advancing.

573
00:53:46.042 --> 00:53:48.158
I understand. do it.

574
00:53:49.208 --> 00:53:50.869
Sure. let's start.

575
00:54:19.583 --> 00:54:22.416
I merely forgot. for this to work.

576
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.616
I still require one ingredient.

577
00:54:27.417 --> 00:54:28.907
What ingredient?

578
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.616
You can't do this!

579
00:54:32.792 --> 00:54:34.077
Let go of him!

580
00:54:46.417 --> 00:54:48.408
Hello. we meet again.

581
00:54:49.625 --> 00:54:52.492
That hairpin isn't so fearsome.

582
00:54:52.667 --> 00:54:56.330
You tried to kill my master
with such meager power?

583
00:54:59.583 --> 00:55:02.825
One of your kind is
quite the valuable thing

584
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.581
to daoists like us.

585
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:07.116
You're worth 10.000 snakes.

586
00:55:07.292 --> 00:55:08.372
Why youl

587
00:55:08.542 --> 00:55:10.999
which is why I informed
my master you were

588
00:55:11.167 --> 00:55:13.078
at snake catcher village.

589
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:16.208
Looking at the hour. he
could arrive there soon.

590
00:55:17.458 --> 00:55:20.325
Leaving you two all to me.

591
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.412
There's no reason to share the credit.

592
00:55:23.583 --> 00:55:26.165
Little daoist. you really are awful.

593
00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:27.994
but thanks for the information.

594
00:55:28.167 --> 00:55:29.407
Once we're finished with you.

595
00:55:29.583 --> 00:55:31.574
your master will shortly follow.

596
00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:16.576
So the little
daoist is actually this ugly?

597
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.832
No wonder you wrecked the place.

598
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.207
With all these handsome statues around.

599
00:56:21.375 --> 00:56:23.787
you were jealous.

600
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:39.916
Escaping this net is
quite futile. I assure you.

601
00:57:51.417 --> 00:57:52.417
No!

602
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Xuan. xuan!

603
00:58:09.667 --> 00:58:10.873
You're awake?

604
00:58:11.042 --> 00:58:12.498
Xuan. xuan!

605
00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:17.125
Xuan!

606
00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:23.702
You still have it.

607
00:58:27.625 --> 00:58:28.705
How are you?

608
00:58:28.875 --> 00:58:31.457
Huh?

609
00:58:38.667 --> 00:58:40.373
Dudou! - You have a tail now.

610
00:58:40.542 --> 00:58:42.624
Look!

611
00:58:42.792 --> 00:58:43.622
I'm a demon.

612
00:58:43.792 --> 00:58:44.934
With a tail and everything.

613
00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:46.573
Dudou. where's your tail?

614
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.081
It's right...

615
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.740
Where is it?

616
00:58:49.917 --> 00:58:51.748
- This was dudou's.
- It's gone!

617
00:58:52.833 --> 00:58:55.870
Dudou. easy. looks like
we're both freaks now.

618
00:58:56.042 --> 00:58:58.499
We'll make the best of it
moving forward. together.

619
00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:03.785
Let's go.

620
00:59:07.625 --> 00:59:10.116
Dudou. I can run so fast now!

621
00:59:10.292 --> 00:59:12.123
Too fast. I can't catch up.

622
00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:32.615
Ah. gees!

623
00:59:32.792 --> 00:59:35.249
I'm back. blanca. and I'm like you now.

624
00:59:37.167 --> 00:59:39.624
Didn't they take your vitality?

625
00:59:39.792 --> 00:59:44.707
You're so fast!

626
00:59:54.167 --> 00:59:56.249
Blanca. blanca!

627
00:59:57.333 --> 00:59:58.333
Where are you?

628
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.750
Blanca!

629
01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:03.625
Xuan. xuan!

630
01:00:18.417 --> 01:00:20.783
Don't take my powers. don't do it.

631
01:00:21.958 --> 01:00:23.323
I beg you.

632
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.365
Xuan. look at this!

633
01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:40.115
Demons are coming!

634
01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:41.573
Run for your lives!

635
01:00:51.292 --> 01:00:53.453
Demons are coming!

636
01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:00.289
Blanca. blanca!

637
01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:06.958
Blanca?

638
01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:14.123
Hurry.

639
01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:48.823
Wait. blanca!

640
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.250
Blanca!

641
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.162
It's huge. is that blanca?

642
01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.449
Let's just go. maybe
they can turn us back.

643
01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:02.583
You really did return.

644
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.822
Though blanca herself has now
turned into a giant python.

645
01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:11.375
That daoist stole her weapon.

646
01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:14.909
but somehow she drained
his strength instead.

647
01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.289
How could that be?

648
01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:21.750
Interesting. you're one of us now.

649
01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:26.291
Little one. you scarcely know her.

650
01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:28.323
What kind of connection could you share?

651
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.199
In the end. you just fell
for my sister's pretty face.

652
01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:37.744
Now that she has
changed into her full demon form.

653
01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:39.282
are you still fond of her?

654
01:03:40.667 --> 01:03:42.248
Where is she going?

655
01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:45.580
Snake catcher village. little one.

656
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:47.286
you're still in the dark?

657
01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:48.994
The general's there now.

658
01:03:49.167 --> 01:03:51.374
She's looking to settle the score.

659
01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:52.577
He's there?

660
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.366
And before too long. that village

661
01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:57.453
will be drowned in tragedy.

662
01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:58.740
Our village?

663
01:03:58.917 --> 01:04:00.532
Pick a side.

664
01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:06.490
Xuan. where do we go now?

665
01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:10.458
We're going home.

666
01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:27.369
The general's at snake catcher village?

667
01:04:27.542 --> 01:04:30.249
I saw his fleet. it's gigantic.

668
01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:31.827
My guess is that he already knows

669
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.242
where we're hiding and he's coming for us.

670
01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:36.827
How can he know where we are?

671
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:37.659
Unless there's a...

672
01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:40.199
Chang pan is loyal to
us and the green snake

673
01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:43.287
has the death scales. neither
one can be the betrayer.

674
01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:44.789
Maybe it was the white snake.

675
01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:47.244
she could've joined the general's side.

676
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.411
There's clearly a traitor among you!

677
01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:56.040
But we won't wait for them to attack us.

678
01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.449
Though we're outnumbered.
we'll take our chances

679
01:04:58.625 --> 01:04:59.990
on the front lines.

680
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.412
All of us will attack
snake catcher village!

681
01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:05.915
Find the traitor. kill the daoists!

682
01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:07.323
Crush the village!

683
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.300
Find the
traitor. kill the daoists.

684
01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.161
crush the village. find the traitor.

685
01:05:11.333 --> 01:05:14.575
kill the daoists. crush the village!

686
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.366
Have a load and back here.

687
01:05:17.542 --> 01:05:20.079
Everyone run. the village is in danger!

688
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.411
A giant python is on its way here!

689
01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:24.103
Hurry. stop what you're doing and run!

690
01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:25.247
What's gotten into you?

691
01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:27.101
Walls are high here.
what are you scared of?

692
01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.116
So are yongzhou's and it was destroyed.

693
01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.032
We have to run. there's no time.

694
01:05:31.208 --> 01:05:33.790
Yongzhou's solid stone.
pythons. there's no way.

695
01:05:33.958 --> 01:05:35.434
Xuan. you finally returned.

696
01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:37.244
Auntie. you should leave now.

697
01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:39.453
I should. let me tidy up first.

698
01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:40.625
Just go!

699
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.286
The general has arrived.

700
01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:13.865
A giant python.

701
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:27.117
The truth is that you're a demon.

702
01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:30.784
So how do we know this
isn't some demon trick?

703
01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:33.165
General. you should defend the peace.

704
01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:35.198
not invite disaster.

705
01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:41.034
- He is a demon.
- Yeah. but who really cares?

706
01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:45.076
I'm still xuan and I still
ran here to warn all of you.

707
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.457
Yongzhou's in ruins
and this place is next.

708
01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:49.240
Listen. you have to run!

709
01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:53.905
You're evil!

710
01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:56.244
Useless little thing.

711
01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:59.665
It's all your fault.
you risked our lives.

712
01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:01.744
made us catch snakes to feed your power

713
01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:04.158
and forced blanca to turn into a python!

714
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.742
She's here. let me go. I could save us!

715
01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:15.327
Why not?

716
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.535
Go ahead.

717
01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:37.375
Blanca!

718
01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:45.825
Blanca. in yongzhou. you
had to face those soldiers.

719
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.661
You didn't want to hurt them.

720
01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:50.040
but up ahead. while they may catch snakes.

721
01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:51.618
they really are all innocent.

722
01:07:51.792 --> 01:07:54.955
so please don't turn the
village into a second yongzhou!

723
01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.125
Blanca!

724
01:09:02.542 --> 01:09:04.658
Blanca. just listen.

725
01:09:06.333 --> 01:09:07.994
I've been turned into one of you.

726
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.160
Now we're both demons.

727
01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:17.492
Even though you've
grown. it doesn't matter.

728
01:09:17.667 --> 01:09:19.373
There's a vast world out there.

729
01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:21.328
full of all kinds of wonders.

730
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.161
So who cares what your body's like.

731
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.618
Blanca. even though I'm
the weakest of your kind.

732
01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:29.407
I'll give my all to protect you.

733
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:32.164
And if they won't accept us.

734
01:09:32.333 --> 01:09:34.824
we'll just go to the ends of the earth.

735
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.492
Our place is out there.
we just have to find it.

736
01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:42.285
A pair of demons. together and free.

737
01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:47.750
Blanca.

738
01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.208
Blanca!

739
01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:05.083
Sister!

740
01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.780
Surprising. there
was a python after all.

741
01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:31.994
You're to thank for this. little demon.

742
01:10:32.167 --> 01:10:32.826
You!

743
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.787
Without you. I could not
have readied this trap.

744
01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:47.326
You shall now be
extinguished. body and soul.

745
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.500
What?

746
01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:02.583
What is this?

747
01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:06.283
It's your essence. your spirit.

748
01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:09.530
Snake catcher. little demon.

749
01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:12.450
He's extinguishing us. body and soul.

750
01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:15.367
Once your soul scatters
away. you won't be able

751
01:11:15.542 --> 01:11:16.952
to be reborn again.

752
01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:18.285
It is gone for good.

753
01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:20.574
It's gone for good?

754
01:11:22.375 --> 01:11:27.039
Quite true. sadly. and such
a waste now that I hear it.

755
01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:29.369
I prefer having it over losing it.

756
01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:36.325
Once I've perfected my dark powers

757
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.741
and reached a higher state of being.

758
01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:41.875
his highness will then
see what I've achieved.

759
01:11:42.042 --> 01:11:45.705
I hold the secret to immortality.

760
01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:52.621
Immortality. you brag
of knowing its secret.

761
01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:56.614
but all you're doing is
stealing ours. so do it.

762
01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:08.993
What's this?

763
01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.582
That was foolish.

764
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:14.661
You absorbed the scorching death scales.

765
01:12:15.667 --> 01:12:18.955
It's nearly time. they're
just about to explode.

766
01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:35.828
Not so difficult.

767
01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.495
I see this is your doing. witch.

768
01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:47.578
You forced my hand.

769
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:51.538
Today we're going to settle
things once and for all.

770
01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:52.708
Master.

771
01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:46.864
Blanca!

772
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.456
Way of fire.

773
01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:55.417
Mountainous earth!

774
01:13:58.458 --> 01:13:59.743
Watch out!

775
01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.206
Master. sister!

776
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.740
Catch!

777
01:15:36.375 --> 01:15:37.375
Blanca!

778
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.453
Kill them all.

779
01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:29.533
Secure the gate. hold strong!

780
01:16:52.583 --> 01:16:55.541
Master. we've wiped out
our greatest enemy today.

781
01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:57.790
Please allow me to
return your hairpin now.

782
01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:00.375
Hm.

783
01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:03.039
I allowed your sister to take this

784
01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:05.699
to assassinate that daoist.

785
01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.332
I never thought she'd
steal another's powers

786
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.365
or turn into a giant snake.

787
01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:13.329
Master. you have the wrong
idea. she really tried to...

788
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:18.415
The daoist is gone. so I no
longer have any use for this.

789
01:17:20.833 --> 01:17:21.833
Why. master?

790
01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:26.492
The daoist did such cruel things to us.

791
01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:29.864
But one day. it was clear to me.

792
01:17:30.042 --> 01:17:31.828
anything he tried to master...

793
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.659
- Sister.
- I could too.

794
01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.949
- Run.
- If he could take it.

795
01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:37.912
then I can take your essence just as well!

796
01:17:38.083 --> 01:17:40.620
Sister!

797
01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:02.949
Master!

798
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Blanca!

799
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.940
It's fortunate that you have newly

800
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.241
gained strength. little demons.

801
01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:14.658
It's excellent fuel for my own.

802
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.788
I'm glad I had the
foresight to lend it to you.

803
01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:23.121
All that is shared flows to the source.

804
01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:27.453
It all returns to me!

805
01:20:04.292 --> 01:20:05.748
Blanca.

806
01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:06.917
Xuan.

807
01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:10.158
She drained all of the power I had left.

808
01:20:13.167 --> 01:20:14.998
Guess you can't push me away again.

809
01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:37.869
Blanca!

810
01:20:56.125 --> 01:20:57.125
Watch out!

811
01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:07.708
Blanca!

812
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:12.366
Wait. the woman and the net.

813
01:21:13.667 --> 01:21:16.329
Constellations.

814
01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:19.244
There's the heart. the ghost.

815
01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:21.533
southwest horn. chariot. wing.

816
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:28.456
So the door of life is...

817
01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:31.458
Over there!

818
01:21:58.708 --> 01:21:59.748
What are we waiting for?

819
01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:02.036
We have to hurry and save xuan.

820
01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:04.290
We can't go. they're demons. right?

821
01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.165
Yeah. and we just saw that
the girl in white is too.

822
01:22:08.917 --> 01:22:10.032
It's still xuan though!

823
01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:12.620
He was once. not now.

824
01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:14.472
That's right. we could've all just died.

825
01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:16.954
I tell ya. if we free those
two. it's certain death.

826
01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:18.240
It's just not worth it.

827
01:22:18.417 --> 01:22:21.659
If xuan didn't
save you. you'd be dead now!

828
01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:23.039
Dudou's a demon too!

829
01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:24.208
A dog demon!

830
01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:26.616
And so what. who cares
if we're not like you.

831
01:22:26.792 --> 01:22:29.204
we risked our lives to save you!

832
01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.458
Xuan.

833
01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:46.208
Huh?

834
01:22:57.875 --> 01:23:01.697
All of their souls were drained away.

835
01:23:03.958 --> 01:23:07.450
If we stay. we'll both have our souls

836
01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:09.115
extinguished as well.

837
01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:24.416
Don't worry. the villagers.

838
01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:25.743
they'll save us for sure.

839
01:23:29.583 --> 01:23:31.073
- Xuan.
- Huh?

840
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:35.619
You said on the river that life is short

841
01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:37.077
and sorrows long.

842
01:23:39.167 --> 01:23:43.456
So we should just focus
on the good things.

843
01:23:45.333 --> 01:23:46.698
Remember.

844
01:23:48.292 --> 01:23:51.204
those dandelions and the ferry?

845
01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:53.875
And that tower?

846
01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.414
I can see it all.

847
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.750
You can?

848
01:24:09.292 --> 01:24:10.372
Great.

849
01:24:41.333 --> 01:24:42.539
What's that?

850
01:24:43.417 --> 01:24:44.497
Xuan. listen.

851
01:24:45.667 --> 01:24:47.749
Someone's trying to break through.

852
01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:50.125
Xuan?

853
01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:54.958
Xuan. no.

854
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Xuan!

855
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Xuan!

856
01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.077
You can't!

857
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:08.250
Please. xuan.

858
01:25:10.375 --> 01:25:13.697
Didn't you say that we'd leave together?

859
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:18.117
That we'd set out to the ends of the earth

860
01:25:18.292 --> 01:25:20.123
and see so many places?

861
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:28.750
Don't go!

862
01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:30.583
Don't go!

863
01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:39.866
Please don't. xuan.

864
01:25:40.042 --> 01:25:41.042
Don't go.

865
01:25:53.167 --> 01:25:58.036
D> water's east j

868
01:26:07.167 --> 01:26:11.536
Blanca. whatever happens. I'll be there.

869
01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:14.202
And sorrows long.

870
01:26:14.375 --> 01:26:15.615
The world's full of awful folks

871
01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:17.663
who cares if you've got one?

872
01:26:17.833 --> 01:26:18.993
Blanca!

873
01:26:19.167 --> 01:26:21.704
It won't take long.
D sets behind the hill >

874
01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:22.875
wait for me.

875
01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:25.249
Your fate may be in stone.

876
01:26:25.417 --> 01:26:27.624
Got it let's sing it together.
D rises as it will >

877
01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:28.792
the world's heartless.

878
01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:31.249
our paths different. you might
as well. we've got the time.

879
01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:33.203
But what we have is real though.

880
01:26:45.042 --> 01:26:47.704
D it's a dream

xuan. no.

884
01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:47.125
Xuan!

885
01:28:02.083 --> 01:28:04.074
Do you see xuan?

886
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:05.250
Xuan!

887
01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:07.615
Xuan!

888
01:28:07.792 --> 01:28:09.077
Where are you?

889
01:28:20.833 --> 01:28:24.997
At that last moment. I
managed to save his soul.

890
01:28:25.917 --> 01:28:27.282
He's in the hairpin though.

891
01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:30.291
It cost you dearly.
you were a snake again.

892
01:28:32.167 --> 01:28:34.658
Using what little strength I had left.

893
01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:37.791
I sealed the memories of
what occurred into this.

894
01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:43.450
Today you've unlocked it as last.

895
01:28:49.583 --> 01:28:54.247
Even if I did. immortality
is something I can't reach.

896
01:28:56.083 --> 01:28:57.323
It hasn't freed you?

897
01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:04.115
That second of joy. held for 500 years.

898
01:29:04.292 --> 01:29:05.372
Was it worth it?

899
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:11.493
Even if it cost 1.000
years. it was worth it.

900
01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:23.706
I'll always be with you.

901
01:29:30.875 --> 01:29:32.536
Xuan. where is he?

902
01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:37.034
His soul survived and reincarnated.

903
01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:38.414
it's out there somewhere.

904
01:29:42.167 --> 01:29:43.373
I have to find it.

905
01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:48.494
Whoever he is
now. he's already lived

906
01:29:48.667 --> 01:29:50.828
through so many lifetimes.

907
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.618
Even if you do find him. he
may not be how you remember.

908
01:30:02.583 --> 01:30:04.073
Wherever he is in the world.

909
01:30:05.583 --> 01:30:07.323
whatever he looks like.

910
01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:13.951
whether he remembers me or
not. I have to find him.

911
01:30:17.083 --> 01:30:18.914
