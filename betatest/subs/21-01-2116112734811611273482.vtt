-(Indistinct chattering)
-(Laughter)

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.311

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.884
Bob! Gorgeous.

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:15.928
-(Woman) Yes. Isn't he adorable?
-Ooh.

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:17.513
(Man) Look at that.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:22.935
(Gasps)

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:24.770
(Woman 1) Oh! Bob the cat!

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:27.189
(Woman 2) Look at that.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:29.775
There he is.

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:31.944
There's great demand
for his work right now.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:37.324
(Photographer) This way!
Thank you. sir. Perfect.

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.675

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:17.114
But I would first like to welcome...

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:19.366

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.622

(Man) Well done. There you go.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.213
The story of how these two lost souls
met and saved each other

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:35.049
here on the streets of London

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:38.135

And we are delighted to announce

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.807

Aren't you. James?

00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.270
Which we cannot wait to publish
next August.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.856
(All applauding)

00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:56.904
What are we doing here. mate?

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.864
(All speaking indistinctly)

00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:03.744
So. erm. Mr Bowen. what does
the big day hold in store for you?

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:06.413
Oh. you know.
turkey with the trimmings. I guess.

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:07.539
in front of the TV.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.124
Pigs in blankets for him.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.085
So. nothing special. then?

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.337
Oh. that's pretty special for us.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.256
Of course. I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.634
(Woman) Can I say hello to Bob?

00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:20.552
(James) Oh. Jacqueline Wilson.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.304
Hello. Jacqueline.

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:23.681
-Hi.
-Yeah. of course.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.100
Thank you. Hello. Bob.

00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:29.561
-Love your books.
-Oh. That's so nice.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.939
-Not Bob. obviously. Can't read.
-(Laughs)

00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:33.649
But. erm. yeah.

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.443
I see you're sneaking away.
I don't blame you.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.445
Such a posh invite. Couldn't say no.

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.157
I know. Congratulations. though.
on your new book.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.994
Or should I say commiserations?

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.122
-I recognised the look on your face.
-You did?

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.124
You haven't started it yet. have you?

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.961
Not yet. no.
I can't. erm. settle on a story.

00:04:54.003 --> 00:04:58.632
I know the feeling.
I'm sure you'll get an idea soon.

00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:01.343
They often happen
when you least expect it.

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.971
So. good luck with it. anyway.

00:05:04.013 --> 00:05:05.681
Thank you. Lovely to meet you.

00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:06.974
And you too.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.692
(Woman) Aw. Merry Christmas. Jay!

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.195
(Man 1) Come and get your mulled wine.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.786
(Man 2) Nice cat. mate.

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:33.167
(Man 3) Thank you. Merry Christmas.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.587
(Crowd chattering)

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.269
(Man 4) Ready. ladies and gentlemen?
Here we go.

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.480
-That's it. Like that.
-(Crowd cheering)

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.815
-(Crowd cheering)
-(Woman) Can you believe this man?

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.567
(Man 5) Merry Christmas.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.487
-(Boy) Get off!
-(Man) Get his legs!

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.947
-I haven't done anything. Get off me.
-You're causing a scene.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.492
-Hold him down.
-(Yells) Get off me.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.951
(Boy) I haven't done anything.
You're hurting me. Get off.

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:09.286
(Man) You're causing a scene.
all right? Stay down.

00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:10.329
-Stay down.
-I haven't done anything.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.914
(Man) Stay down.
Or you're gonna hurt yourself.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.792
-Hey! Hey! What's going on?
-Hold him. Hold...

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.043
Why are you holding
him down on the ground like this?

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:18.087
-Does it need three of you. really?
-(Police siren wailing)

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.632
Well. well. well. If it isn't cat boy.

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.301
-Long time no see.
-It's you.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.470
Still your old charming self. I see.

00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:28.347
Tell you what.
you can sling your hook right away.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.848
(Police officer) All right.
what's going on?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.934
Just standard stuff. really. love.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.145
Er. illegal busker. Got a bit punchy.
but we calmed him down.

00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:37.523
-(Boy) What's wrong with you?
-Excuse me. Officer.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.192
-I thought I told you to piss off.
-Do you know this person?

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.152
No. but I'm pretty sure
he wasn't breaking the law.

00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:44.363
Yeah. he was busking over there.
in Camden.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.697
not there
in the Borough of Westminster.

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.740
And?

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.951
And you need a permit
to busk in Westminster.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.078
-You don't need one in Camden.
-Oh.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.831
-All right. phone it in.
-Look. this is stupid.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.208
Can we just charge this guy
and then we can all go home?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.584
Charge him with what?
Playing his guitar?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.169
You knew he was legal. didn't you?

00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.295
(Despatcher) Control.
That's confirmed.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.547
He's right. Let him go.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.590
Let. let him go? Let him go?

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.175
(Boy groans)

00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.052
-(Man) It's unbelievable.
-That's assault.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.888
-I wanna press charges.
-Walk away. Just walk away. Trust me.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.973
(Police officer) Calm down.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.350
-But he's getting away.
-I said calm down.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.018
(Scoffs)

00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:22.526
So what's the story?
Are you Harry Potter's lawyer?

00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.279
-Excuse me? Mm.
-All that legal stuff.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.823
Borough of this and that.
and a magic cat on your shoulder.

00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:29.783
Let's just say
I'm familiar with the law.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.661
It's a pretty chill cat.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.205
-(Purrs)
-(James) Most of the time.

00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:37.082
Yeah.

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.251
Saw him giving the eye
to that dickhead back there.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.545
-Yeah.
-He knows you. doesn't he?

00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.797
Yeah. Ghost of Christmas Past.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:46.425
Him and Bob and me
have a bit of history.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.343
Bob.

00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:52.014
That's one house burger.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.684
-Can I get the bill. please?
-Yes. right away.

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.227
-And a saucer?
-Mm-hm.

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.478
Thank you.

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:05.527
They do serve
something resembling food

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:06.904
at the Christmas shelters. you know.

00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:08.405
That obvious. eh?

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.908
Haven't been to a shelter since this.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:17.122
Stanley knife. Sliced straight through
my sleeping bag.

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.125
Lucky they only took my money belt.

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:21.877
OK.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.090
Have you tried Monmouth Street?

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.510
There's a warm air vent
above the kitchen to that hotel.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.512
You're one of them outreach workers.

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:35.224
No. God squad?

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.892
I used to be in the same boat as you.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.560
I was homeless too.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.229
I ended up on heroin.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.649
Junkies. Hate 'em.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.026
Not as much as they hate themselves.

00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:50.739
So how'd you get clean? Magic cat?

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.617
-He helped me get clean.
-(Purrs)

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.535
learn a few lessons I needed to learn.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.080
Like that.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.415
Fall down seven times. get up eight.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.002
Except sometimes you can't.

00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:06.630
Cos you've got nothing to get up for.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.716
Cos you feel like you're nothing.
got nothing to give.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.969
-I know. I know.
-You don't know anything.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.389
I don't know why I came here.
Just so someone else can preach at me.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.183
That is all anyone does.
especially at this time of year.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.687
I should have just let them
bang me up over Christmas.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.064
Sit down. OK? Finish your food.

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:28.318
All right. Just give me five minutes.
No preaching. cross my heart.

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:30.195
Just a story.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.532
OK? Sit down.

00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:35.909
Five minutes.

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:42.624
It was a few years ago.
After I got clean.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.502
The last Christmas
me and Bob worked on the streets.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.509
(Beeping)

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:56.471
(Sighs)

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.392
(Beeping continues)

00:10:02.144 --> 00:10:03.603
(Sighs)

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.737
(Sighs)

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:15.782
(Calling Bob)

00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:19.536
(Sighs) Yeah. Don't blame you. mate.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.253
(Sighs)

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:30.714
(Beeping)

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.058
-(Miaows)
-(Lighter clicks)

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.000
Not even a please?

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.010
Sorry. mate. Guess we're out. (Blows)

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.865
No. No. no. no. Oi. you.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.701
Stay there. Stay there. OK?

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:43.370
Back before you know it.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:59.052
-(Indistinct chatter)
-(Spray cans hissing)

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.152
(Bell over door chimes)

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.862
Don't let the elephants out.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:21.074
Ah. Where is my good friend Bob?

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.869
He. er. sent me
to fetch his breakfast.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.706
Hmm. I told you he was
the wise one round here.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.419
What time do you close tonight?

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.212
I've gotta top up
my electric after work.

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:35.589
Er. 10:00.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.592
Got a late delivery. Christmas stock.

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:40.760
Another week of that word.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.348
Hmm. Not exactly
my favourite time of year either.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:46.892
(Cash register beeping)

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:52.189
-(Cash register tray dings)
-Oh.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.900
Oh. it's the anniversary.
I'm sorry. Moody.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.443
Ah. it's OK.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.154
(Sighs) Anyway.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.531
Christmas is all right.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.160
We have all to believe
in something. Hmm?

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.913
Christmas. Krishna.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.625
Cricket. (Chuckles)

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.503
I suppose I'm Buddish.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.338
Buddish?

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.674
Yeah. I sort of believe in Buddhism.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.801
Karma. all that kind of stuff.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.845
Ah. Karma.

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.348
What goes around comes around.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:28.391
Like the poor butter maker.

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.769
Why do I feel
one of your stories coming on?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.980
(Chuckles) He was a farmer.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.066
His best customer was a shop owner

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:39.361
who ordered one kilo of butter
every month.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:45.242
In return. he paid the farmer
flour. beans and...

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.914
one kilo of sugar.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:52.791
OK.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.210
One day. the shop owner
weighed the butter.

00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:58.421
but it was only 900 grams. not a kilo.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.257
Ooh. he got very angry.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.634
"I am going to call
the police on you."

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.177
(Both chuckle)

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.804
The farmer. he was polite.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.056
He said he was a poor man.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.016
couldn't afford to buy the weights
for his scales.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:13.019
so he measured the butter
with the only weight he had.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:15.981
The kilo of sugar.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.524
Exactly.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:21.903
Do good. it will be repaid. (Exhales)

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.281
-Do bad...
-Less butter on your bread.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:26.866
(Chuckles)

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:28.827
Here.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.830
-For Bob.
-Aww.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.081
Merry Krishna.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.457
Thank you.

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.722
(Woman) âª Oh. bring us
some figgy pudding

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.473
âª Oh. bring us some figgy pudding

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.851
âª Oh. bring us some figgy pudding

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.228
âª And bring it right here

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.648
âª We wish you a merry Christmas

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.944
âª We wish you a merry Christmas
A merry Christmas and... âª

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.280
Oh. surprise! (Laughs)

00:15:05.322 --> 00:15:07.824
-Bloody hell.
-I used your spare key.

00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:11.286
Do you like it? I thought
you could use some Christmas cheer.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.830
There's a lot of things
I could use right now.

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.499
Like getting my gas
and hot water back on.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.919
Haven't had a shower in three days.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.005
Thought there was
a nasty niff in the air.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.050
(Sighs) Come on. Good boy.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.801
Nan always did this in my family.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:30.388
Bits of wisdom. prayers.
wishes for the New Year.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.974
You write things
you were thankful for in the old one

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.309
and then you just hang them
on the tree.

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.356
"Thank you for James's friendship."

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.524
See? It's not so bad.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.569
"Angels are all around us
if we just know where to look."

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.696
Seriously?

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.409
You really don't like the holidays.
do you. Ebenezer Grinchface?

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:52.661
(James sighs)

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.915
I need to work out what's gonna keep
me and Bob going for the month.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.668
(Sighs. clears throat)

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.005
-(Mutters) Fifteen...
-(Miaows)

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:09.928
(Exhales)

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.723
Go on. then. Grinchface.
Give us the news.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:16.059
I need 200 quid to last the month.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:17.852
What?

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.148
Fifteen to get gas and electric back.
Then four quid a day.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.401
Bus and tube. say 40 quid.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.444
Papers to sell
during the Christmas rush.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.904
Two weeks' food for me and Bob.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.989
-Call that 50 more.
-OK.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:33.451
It's been ages since he's had
a check-up. Gotta see a vet soon.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.995
Still seems a lot.
Especially the heating.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.997
Earth to Bea.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.666
We're in the worst cold snap
for years.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.584
Earth to Grinchface.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.380
Homeless guy came in to us last week
with frostbite. He lost three toes.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.258
I got given this place
for a good reason. you know.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.343
And no one is regretting
giving it to you.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.346
It was a big step.
and they were happy to help.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.348
Hold on.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.398
A friend. Dr Becky.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.317
She's doing a free vet clinic
at the project on Friday.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.360
Bring Bob.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.615
-(Bob miaows)
-(Clattering)

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.160
(James laughs)

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.953
If you two are still speaking.

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:36.222
OK. mate. You stay there. all right?
It's cold out.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.984
No. Bob. Bob. Stay. Stay.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.075
All right. mate.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.828
Come on. then. (Sighs)

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.457
Come on. then. Let's go.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.010
-(Woman) There's your daddy.
-Hey. darling. How'd you get on?

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:17.472
Well. she did very good. but we have
to stop giving her all those treats.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:18.723
OK.

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.475
OK.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.478
A tale of two kitties. eh. Bob?

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.523
If I could afford it.
I would. you know.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.041
(Indistinct announcement over PA)

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.128
-Spare some change?
-No. mate.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.797
-Hey. James.
-Hey.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.924
-Busking in town?
-Maybe later.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.801
-See how the papers go first.
-Ah.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.428
-You've got competition today.
-Yeah.

00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:00.265
Any spare change for fighting poverty?

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.891
-Hey. mate. You got any spare change?
-No.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:05.728
No? You got a nice suit. though.
Any spare change? No?

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:07.856
All right. Bob.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:09.732
Good boy.

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.778
-(Man) Hello. love. you all right?
-OK. Bob.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.363
Get your blanket out.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.658
Here you are. Bob. Good boy.

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.743
(Man) Any spare change?

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.873
All right. mate. There you go.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.129
-Good boy.
-Any spare change would help.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.467
-Big Issue. Big Issue!
-Spare change?

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.679
-They're nice and Christmassy.
-Yeah. I like it.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:43.600
-(James) Give it a try. Help or buy.
-It's getting busy. isn't it?

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.768
-Big Issue. madam?
-Everyone's got a gimmick.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:49.397
Big Issue! Big Issue. sir?

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.940
-Hello. James.
-Hi. Irene.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.233
Hello. Bob.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.570
-Bit hectic today.
-Yeah. nightmare.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.780
-Well. must be off.
-See you.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:58.865
Bye. Bob.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:00.700
Big Issue. Big Issue. madam?

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:03.119
-Big Issue. Big Issue. madam?
-Ah. God bless you. God bless you.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.121
Any spare change. please?
Every little helps.

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.498
-(Snarls)
-Hey. Watch where you're stepping.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.292
Oh. piss off. mate.
I can step where I like.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.460
Just be careful is all I'm saying.

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.128
You shouldn't have
your stupid cat in the way.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.047
-Mate. I'm just trying to work here.
-Well. yeah. So am I.

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:15.882
Right. OK. Idiot.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.677
What'd you say? Huh?
You want some. then. eh?

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.137
-Come on. then. Let's have it.
-Hey. James. no.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.389
Just walk away. OK?
I'm just trying to work here.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.600
-We can't have this out here.
-He just nearly stepped on Bob.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.810
-It shouldn't be in the way.
-I've never heard of that charity.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.812
James. people are watching.
People are watching.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.898
-You should watch yourself. mate.
-(Woman) Can you go?

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.943
-All of them are just scammers.
-I know.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:38.321
Listen. why don't you just come back
and do this tomorrow?

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:41.407
You're not gonna sell anything
anyway. not with this lot round.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.034
-Yeah.
-OK? Sorry.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.329
No. you're probably right.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.289
-This way sir. Yeah.
-(Camera shutters clicking)

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.292
-Yeah. Looking very good.
-Look into the lens. please. sir.

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.837
Oh. What a splendid cat.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:58.007
Ah. (Chuckles)

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.760
-(Bob growls)
-Ah. Sorry. He's a bit hungry.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.597
Ah. Well. I'll tell you what...

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:09.519
Now. you buy her something lovely
to eat tonight. OK?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.770
-Thank you so much.
-Jolly good.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.730
Let's get a photograph. shall we?

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:16.150
-Make it a good one.
-(Woman) Great. Fabulous. Great.

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.236
Right. very good.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.530
Er. well. happy Christmas
to both of you.

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.448
-And you. Thank you.
-(Man) There we are!

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.574
(Man) This way. sir!

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:24.617
(Photographer) Give us
a smile! Lovely.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.085
Mug.

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:45.096
Look at that.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.433
A thousand... something.

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:53.896
(âª Christmas carol playing)

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:07.160
-I'd like to change this. please.
-Sure.

00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:11.581
(Mumbles) Have you
seen one of these before?

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:13.750
It's an Albanian lek.

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:16.252
Well. it's one thousand Albanian lek.

00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:18.504
-Albanian lek.
-Lek.

00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:23.551
Which converts to just over seven...

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.345
seven pounds sterling.

00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:30.016
Er. seven pounds and 55 pence.
to be precise.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:34.103
(Sighs) OK. Yeah. I'll take it.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:36.981
Well. we need our commission.
I'm afraid.

00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:40.318
You see. we have a ten-pound minimum.
I'm sorry.

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:44.322
But you could try
the Albanian embassy. maybe.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.785
-Do you know where it is?
-You could Google it.

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:50.912
Thanks.

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:53.081
I like your cat.

00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:33.538
(Man) I've just explained.
I've already been to four shops.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.540
-They're not selling it anywhere.
-Oh.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.209
-(Man) Some woman.
-(James) Hey. Bloody hell.

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.545
-Are you OK?
-(Man) I'll look in one other shop...

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:42.004
Yes. Yeah.

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:45.550
-Thank you. (Laughs)
-Lunatic.

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:47.844
Look. we can. erm... Down here.

00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:49.971
-I just didn't see him coming.
-No.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:51.681
-Obviously.
-Erm...

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:54.100
-You. er. you hold onto Bob.
-Ooh. Yes.

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:56.853
-OK.
-Hello.

00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:01.649
Some people. eh?

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:04.068
(Grunts) Just don't look
where they're going.

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:06.487
There you are.

00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:09.157
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:10.741
That's OK. Don't thank me. Thank Bob.

00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:13.995
-(Laughs)
-Don't miss a thing. do you. mister?

00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:15.121
What a character you are.

00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.582
sitting there without a care
in the world.

00:24:18.374 --> 00:24:20.334
-OK. can I...
-Yes.

00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:23.671
Come on. then. Bob.
Let's go. Let's go. Bob. Let's go.

00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:25.756
-(Laughs)
-OK.

00:24:25.798 --> 00:24:28.217
Oh. Hang on. I'm sorry. Erm...

00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:31.554
Oh. blast. I never have any cash.

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:34.056
Oh. don't worry. It's fine. honestly.
It's OK.

00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.475
Well. what's your spot? I could pop by

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:39.478
and buy a magazine
or listen to you play.

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:43.107
Er. Covent Garden.
or Angel. outside the tube.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.860
Angel. Of course.

00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:49.655
-OK. Hope you're OK.
-Thank you.

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:55.786
(Guitar playing)

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.124
âª That's just life

00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:03.377
âª I hear that said a lot

00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:07.506
âª That's just life

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:10.968
âª Head down. shot up...

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.803
-Thank you.
-(Woman) Take care.

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:14.639
âª That's just life

00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.515
âª Whose life?

00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:18.351
âª Not mine

00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:24.732
âª Oh. I'll piece it together
I'll make it better

00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:28.778
âª Take what I'm given
and make it bigger... âª

00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:31.614
The cat's had no say about
whether it's out here or not. has it?

00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:33.991
(Animal welfare officer) Well.
he doesn't have to do anything.

00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.326
He's just sat there.

00:25:36.327 --> 00:25:39.705
All I'm saying. love. is that
that cat does not look happy to me.

00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:43.251
Poor little moggy.
I mean. it's freezing out here.

00:25:43.584 --> 00:25:45.962
And imagine being stuck
with a waster like that.

00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:48.839
I mean. if you ask me.
people like that.

00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:50.383
they shouldn't even be allowed
to own a hamster.

00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:54.011
Look. I don't know who you pissed off
to get you transferred to us.

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:56.430
but you stick to the driving
and I'll stick to the animals.

00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:58.266
And. please. don't call me that.

00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:01.560
-All right. Sorry. sweetheart.
-Give me strength.

00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:03.813
-(Dog barks)
-(Man) No! Come here!

00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:05.147
Oi. oi. Here we go.

00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:07.275
-(James) Get him away from my cat.
-(Snarls)

00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:09.235
(Man) Come back here you... Oi. Titan!

00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:11.237
-Hey. can you control your dog?
-You stupid mutt.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:13.489
That's what I'm talking about.
He's endangering that cat.

00:26:13.531 --> 00:26:15.408
-Dragging him out here.
-Fine.

00:26:15.449 --> 00:26:17.493
You're animal welfare. aren't you?
Why don't you do something?

00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:19.662
Fine. We'll pay him
a proper visit later.

00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:21.539
But first let's sort out
this comedian.

00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:24.083
What's the matter with you?

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.674
-(Man 1) Light there. yeah?
-(Woman) Light here?

00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:35.136
(Man 1) It's a bit smudged
there. yeah?

00:26:36.554 --> 00:26:40.016
(Man 2) That's good. man.
Do the side bit here.

00:26:40.224 --> 00:26:42.226
Here you go. Bob. Look.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.770
Hey. look. Food.

00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:49.233
Hey. Bob. what's the matter?
You not hungry?

00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:52.903
Hey. what's the matter? Are you OK?

00:26:53.696 --> 00:26:55.573
-Hey? Are you hurt?
-(Miaows)

00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:58.367
Did that dog do this?

00:26:59.243 --> 00:27:00.453
OK.

00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:03.080
Little bit of cold in there as well.

00:27:04.248 --> 00:27:06.292
Gonna get a bit of this in. (Chuckles)

00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:08.919
Yeah.

00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:13.341
It's gonna be nice. Bob.
Yeah. Nice bubbles.

00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:16.135
-Nice. Nice bit of water.
-(Growls)

00:27:16.177 --> 00:27:18.179
(Chuckles) Get you all clean.
Look at that. Right.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.558
OK. Let's get this up here.

00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:26.187
And then... You gonna come in?

00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:28.314
Come on. Come on. Bob.

00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:31.275
Sorry. mate. You haven't got a choice.
You gotta do this.

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:33.402
Can't let that get infected.
Come on. Bob.

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:37.114
Come on. Bob. There you go. Good boy.

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:39.408
See? Not so bad. is it?

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.495
There you go. Good boy.

00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:47.208
Good boy. There you are.
Now you like it. Well done. Bob.

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:49.752
Here. look.

00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:52.588
There you go. Bob. Good boy.
(Laughs) Good boy.

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.592
OK. take you out.

00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:59.261
There you go. (Laughs) Good boy.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.764
Let's get you wrapped up in a towel.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.315
(Man) Yeah. just checking me socials.

00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:15.069
Oh. I like the jumper.

00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:18.656
Wow. Grinchface found
a sense of humour. Hello. handsome.

00:28:18.948 --> 00:28:20.533
I thought I'd take you up
on the offer.

00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:22.618
-The vet. It's today. right?
-What vet?

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.412
-What?
-No. I'm just kidding.

00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:26.622
It is today. Right over there.

00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.458
-You setting up for Christmas dinner?
-Yeah.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.837
We're expecting about 60.
Some telly. board games...

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.380
Ah. I love a bit of Monopoly.

00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:37.049
Well. you know what they say.
"All property is theft."

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.385
I'll leave you to it.
Come find me later.

00:28:39.427 --> 00:28:40.553
OK.

00:28:40.594 --> 00:28:42.680
(Whimpers)

00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:55.609
(Clucking)

00:28:56.527 --> 00:28:58.988
No. leave the chicken alone.
Don't look at the chicken.

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:02.032
-OK. who's next?
-(Dog barks)

00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:06.245
So. this is the famous Bob.

00:29:06.287 --> 00:29:08.831
-I've heard a lot about you.
-All good. I hope.

00:29:08.873 --> 00:29:10.166
Yeah. Yeah. all good.

00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:11.834
So. how's he doing?

00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:14.712
Actually. he got
a bit of a scratch yesterday.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:16.380
Erm. a dog went for him.

00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:18.591
I don't know if it was that
or he got caught trying to get away.

00:29:18.632 --> 00:29:19.925
Just back here.

00:29:20.593 --> 00:29:22.761
Erm. I didn't notice it
till I got home.

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.973
-Let's have a look.
-(Bob whines)

00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:28.893
-It's OK. mate. You're OK.
-Ooh. Yeah. I see.

00:29:29.143 --> 00:29:31.770
Yeah. it's not much. but you're right
to come and get it looked at.

00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:33.772
There's always a danger of infection.

00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:35.483
All right. well.
why don't you leave him with me?

00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:38.194
-Erm... I'll be ten minutes.
-OK.

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:40.154
You be good. (Chuckles)

00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.907
(Dr Becky whispers)
I'll take care of you. Bob.

00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:02.176
-Need a hand?
-That'd be good. yeah.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.271
What's that saying?

00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:18.108
"Christmas isn't a season.
It's a feeling."

00:30:19.527 --> 00:30:21.946
I shouldn't fall for it. really.
but I do.

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:24.448
Every year.

00:30:28.118 --> 00:30:29.703
Go on. then.
I can tell you're dying to.

00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:33.123
No. it's fine.
Whatever you're feeling. It's cool.

00:30:41.507 --> 00:30:45.261
I blame Nan. She lived for Christmas.

00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:47.805
Started soaking
her plum pudding in brandy in August.

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:48.889
Hmm.

00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:52.017
Decorations up
the day after Bonfire Night.

00:30:53.727 --> 00:30:56.021
Felt sorry for me. I think.
Being fostered.

00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:59.149
Had to give me twice the Christmas
normal kids got. (Chuckles)

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:01.360
I don't know.

00:31:02.444 --> 00:31:05.197
Maybe it's in my DNA.
revering the ancestors and all.

00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:11.412
Whatever form your family takes.

00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:13.914
that's what Christmas is about.
I think.

00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:16.208
It's important.

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:20.588
Bit different for you. then?

00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:26.427
I woke up one Christmas morning
in a psychiatric ward.

00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:28.053
(Beeping)

00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:29.555
Didn't know where I was.

00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:32.683
Doctor standing over me
with a needle...

00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:36.353
of God knows what. Then...

00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:39.648
zoning out again.

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:43.360
How old were you?

00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:48.365
Six. Seven.

00:31:56.248 --> 00:32:00.836
Tested me for schizophrenia. bipolar.

00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:07.051
That's it. then?
No other Christmas memories?

00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:11.388
I remember hearing my dad's voice
on the phone one year.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.599
(Man speaking indistinctly over phone)

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:16.018
(James) From the other side
of the world.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.938
Wishing he was in the next room.

00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:24.818
But he wasn't.

00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:30.240
(Sighs)

00:32:30.532 --> 00:32:34.453
Look at that. It's one of
the richest places on the planet.

00:32:36.038 --> 00:32:37.373
Someone's down there right now

00:32:37.414 --> 00:32:40.000
blowing two grand on a bottle of wine.

00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:43.629
Yeah. and I'll send home
a family of five

00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:46.465
with macaroni and tinned fruit
to last them a week.

00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:48.759
Go figure.

00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:53.806
Doesn't add up.
It's like some of us are invisible.

00:32:55.057 --> 00:32:56.684
No. they know we're here.

00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:00.854
-Why else puts spikes on doorways?
-Mm.

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:03.691
They just want us out of sight.

00:33:07.069 --> 00:33:08.112
Yeah.

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:17.037
-I should. erm...
-Yeah.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.671
Right. Well. I have cleaned him up

00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:28.507
and I've given him
an injection of antibiotic.

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:30.634
He might be sore for a day or two.

00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:33.053
but other than that
he's in really good nick.

00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:36.265
-Hear that. Bob? High five.
-Mm-hm.

00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:37.433
Five.

00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:39.893
-High five. Thanks a lot.
-(Laughs)

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:42.563
Come on. then. mister.
OK. come on. then. On we go.

00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:46.734
-Good boy. Thank you very much.
-Pleasure.

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:54.074
It's gonna be a good day today. Bob.
I can feel it.

00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:59.830
-Aww.
-(Laughs) All right.

00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:03.292
-Ah. it's Bob!
-That is Bob.

00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:05.878
Ah.

00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:09.882
-Hi!
-Ah.

00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:19.308
James.

00:34:20.768 --> 00:34:22.019
James.

00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:24.396
James. (Breathing heavily)

00:34:24.438 --> 00:34:26.690
-There you are.
-Hi.

00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:28.776
Guess what else I found for Bob.

00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:30.569
-Oh. Irene. really. you don't have to.
-No.

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:35.574
Oh. Irene. That's. erm...

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:41.121
Who'd like to hear
some Christmas carols. Bob style?

00:34:41.163 --> 00:34:42.581
(Crowd cheering) Yeah!

00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:45.501
(Guitar playing)

00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:51.757
âª Bobbing through the snow
In a one-cat open sleigh

00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:55.761
âª Down the streets we go
Miaowing all the way

00:34:55.803 --> 00:34:56.845
âª Miaow. miaow. miaow

00:34:56.887 --> 00:35:01.183
âª Bells on Bobtails ring
Making spirits bright

00:35:01.558 --> 00:35:05.562
âª Oh. what fun it is
To sing a Bobsleigh song tonight

00:35:06.188 --> 00:35:10.734
âª Jingle Bob. jingle Bob
Jingle all the way

00:35:11.068 --> 00:35:13.320
âª Oh. what fun it is to ride
In a one-cat open sleigh. Hey!

00:35:13.362 --> 00:35:15.197
(Woman) There you are. Bob.

00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:19.993
âª Jingle Bob. jingle Bob
Jingle all the way

00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:24.456
âª Oh. what fun it is to ride
In a one-cat open sleigh âª

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:27.626
-(Crowd cheering)
-Thank you.

00:35:27.668 --> 00:35:30.796
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:35:30.838 --> 00:35:32.756
-Hey. Bob. Thanks a lot.
-There you are.

00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:34.466
-High five?
-I think he's clever.

00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:38.095
-Good boy. That's a good boy.
-(Crowd) Aww!

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.973
Excuse me. mate. Sorry. mate.

00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:43.934
Are you gonna be here
day after tomorrow?

00:35:44.518 --> 00:35:45.978
-I can be. yeah.
-Right.

00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:48.146
I've got a big party
of Asian tourists coming in.

00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:49.606
They'd love you lot. Good money.

00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:51.984
Pose for a few photos. a few songs.
What do you think?

00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:54.236
Yeah. that would be amazing.
What time?

00:35:54.528 --> 00:35:56.029
-Midday?
-OK.

00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:58.699
-Life saver. Good man. See you then.
-All right. No worries.

00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.037
(Laughs)

00:36:12.713 --> 00:36:14.506
I know. I know.

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.967
Might have spent a little too much.

00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.846
-But it was a great day.
-(Coins jingling)

00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:23.181
Look at that.

00:36:24.725 --> 00:36:26.184
We're almost halfway there already.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:27.978
And...

00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:32.316
there's more coming.

00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:48.665
(Exhales)

00:36:50.334 --> 00:36:51.668
See this. Bob?

00:36:53.337 --> 00:36:55.505
That was you and me
when we were on our own.

00:36:57.758 --> 00:36:58.967
And this...

00:37:01.053 --> 00:37:02.471
is us together.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:07.142
(Grunts and exhales)

00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:30.165
âª Explains a thing or two

00:37:30.207 --> 00:37:34.336
âª Like when I'm here
I don't feel like I'm in the room

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.798
âª Maybe it ain't normal

00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:42.135
âª To wanna be anywhere else soon

00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:48.141
âª Maybe I ain't as crazy as I think

00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:53.814
âª And everybody's twisted
In different ways

00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:57.234
(Woman) All right. Here you are.

00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:02.823
âª Someday I'll learn
To love my twists and turns

00:38:02.864 --> 00:38:08.078
âª And everything
That makes me who I am

00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:11.790
âª I'll be a better man âª

00:38:11.832 --> 00:38:13.166
(Girl laughs) Look at the cat.

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:15.585
-Thank you very much.
-That's all right.

00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:20.882
Good afternoon.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.429
I'm Animal Welfare Officer Davies.
This is my colleague. Mr Booth.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.764
We wanted to chat to you
about a couple of concerns.

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:30.225
-What sort of concerns?
-Ooh. I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:38:30.267 --> 00:38:32.602
Just wanna make sure
he's happy. healthy.

00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:34.896
Yeah. course he is. Look at him.

00:38:35.397 --> 00:38:37.024
-What's his name?
-Er. Bob.

00:38:37.983 --> 00:38:39.526
-Bob. Nice to meet you.
-Bob.

00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:41.069
If it's OK.
I'd like to take a look at him.

00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.363
-maybe take a couple of photos?
-Yep.

00:38:43.405 --> 00:38:44.823
Shall I take him to the van. yeah?

00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:46.700
-(Bob growls)
-Leave it. Leon.

00:38:46.742 --> 00:38:48.243
(Bob snarls)

00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:51.288
-Bob. Bob. no.
-It's OK. Bob.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:54.374
-Just gotta be slow.
-Hey. that's OK.

00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:56.418
(Purrs)

00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:01.631
(Miaows)

00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:05.052
Ah. he had an injection there
the other day.

00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:07.304
-He might be a bit sore.
-Injection?

00:39:07.804 --> 00:39:10.724
Yeah. he had a little scratch.
I don't know what from.

00:39:10.766 --> 00:39:12.934
But the vet just wanted to give him
some antibiotics

00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:14.686
just to make sure
it didn't get infected.

00:39:14.728 --> 00:39:17.105
-You got the paperwork for that?
-Yeah. at home.

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:18.774
I can send it on to you.

00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:20.650
Yeah. Here are my details.

00:39:21.068 --> 00:39:23.528
-Can I get yours as well?
-Er. yeah.

00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:25.947
Is Bob microchipped?

00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:29.117
Er. yeah. under my name. James Bowen.

00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:31.119
Sorry. I've just gotta turn this on.

00:39:31.161 --> 00:39:33.914
You need to keep that on
in case we need you.

00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:36.958
Is there anyone else we could talk
to. someone that knows you and Bob?

00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:40.003
Er. my friend Bea. She works
at a charity on Upper Street.

00:39:40.045 --> 00:39:41.880
I can give you her number. Hang on.

00:39:41.922 --> 00:39:45.509
(Camera shutter clicking)

00:39:47.177 --> 00:39:50.388
-Is there anything else I can do or...
-You could get a haircut.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.431
(Ruth) Ah.

00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:57.521
Maybe write a statement.
Er. how long you've had Bob.

00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:59.106
What his life is like.
That sort of thing.

00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:03.735
-Just in case.
-In case of what?

00:40:03.777 --> 00:40:07.280
Well. might get referred
up to the authorities. see.

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:09.157
Might need a court to decide

00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:12.077
whether you're fit enough
to keep him or not.

00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:14.371
In case I'm good enough to keep?

00:40:14.663 --> 00:40:16.498
Of course I can keep...
You can't take him away from me.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.250
No. no. That's where
you're wrong. sunshine. See. we can.

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:19.876
-Hey. Let's... let's... Hey!
-If it's in the cat's best interest...

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:20.961
-Don't touch me.
-...we can.

00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.754
-Calm down. Calm down.
-I didn't touch you.

00:40:22.796 --> 00:40:24.840
-Both of you calm down. please.
-He's completely fine.

00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.175
Listen. let's not get ahead
of ourselves. Both of you.

00:40:27.217 --> 00:40:29.970
(All arguing indistinctly)

00:40:35.225 --> 00:40:37.018
Bea. you gotta help me.

00:40:37.394 --> 00:40:39.855
Someone's gonna call you about Bob.
Animal welfare.

00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:42.732
I think her name's Ruth.
Bloke she's with is a total prick.

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:45.110
And. er. I don't know.
I gave them your number.

00:40:45.152 --> 00:40:46.403
I said you could vouch for us.

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:50.115
I don't know if someone targeted us
or if they reported me or...

00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:52.200
I don't know. Who'd...

00:40:54.536 --> 00:40:57.038
-What's the matter?
-Why is it always about you. James?

00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:01.126
What's happened?

00:41:02.252 --> 00:41:03.545
Look around you.

00:41:05.005 --> 00:41:07.507
Break-in last night.
They took everything.

00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:11.344
All of our food. telly.
computers. bedding.

00:41:12.596 --> 00:41:13.930
Everything they could.

00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:16.057
I mean. who the hell
steals from a project

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:17.434
for people who've got nothing?

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:19.936
Can you get more stuff?

00:41:20.854 --> 00:41:24.482
With what. James? Shirt buttons?

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:28.570
We haven't got any money.

00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:31.531
Christmas Day's not happening.

00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:37.412
Bea. Bea.

00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:39.915
(Sighs)

00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:54.930
(James) Is there anything else
I can do?

00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:58.225
(Ruth) Maybe write a statement.
How long you've had Bob.

00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:00.518
What his life is like.
That sort of thing.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.979
(Indistinct chatter on TV)

00:42:51.695 --> 00:42:55.490
Lovely. Now. like every chef. I need
to have a little bit of refreshment.

00:42:56.283 --> 00:43:00.245
The chocolate chips will sort of just
evenly distribute themselves.

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:13.174
(Bob miaows)

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.765
Right. Bob. Come on. then. Bob.

00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:23.601
Now. let's go.

00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:26.479
Good boy. OK.

00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:32.068
OK. come on. then.
Out we go. This way.

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:36.072
Let's go. This way. Good boy.

00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:43.163
(Beeps)

00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:56.092
All right. mate. What do you need?

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:58.511
-No. I'm good.
-Come on. I know you.

00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:00.430
-You like the good stuff.
-I said no.

00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:03.725
-When did you turn into such a prick?
-Are you gonna piss off?

00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:05.643
Or what?

00:44:08.021 --> 00:44:09.439
-(Bob miaows)
-Bob.

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:11.983
-Hey. get off!
-Give me the bag.

00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:14.152
-Give me the bag.
-Get off!

00:44:14.527 --> 00:44:16.488
-Get off!
-(Grunts)

00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:17.781
(Pants)

00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:19.657
(Groans)

00:44:21.034 --> 00:44:23.078
(Groaning)

00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:25.121
Are you OK?

00:44:26.373 --> 00:44:27.540
You all right?

00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:30.418
(Exhales)

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.380
Oh. (Sighs)

00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:41.096
Come on. mate.

00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:45.350
Maybe we can still do some pics.
Come on.

00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:49.312
(Sighs)

00:44:56.403 --> 00:44:57.737
Come in. guys. Sit down.

00:45:00.657 --> 00:45:04.828
I've just got an email
asking me to comment on this.

00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:09.249
Apparently someone sent it
to the local news station.

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.127
-Calm down.
-I'm working here with my cat. OK?

00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:14.379
(Indistinct chattering)

00:45:14.421 --> 00:45:16.631
(Ruth) Can we not. can we not do this?

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.634
(Sighs) Look. this isn't
what it looks like.

00:45:19.676 --> 00:45:21.136
It is exactly what it looks like.

00:45:21.177 --> 00:45:23.179
It's exactly
the sort of brainless behaviour

00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:25.682
that got you transferred here
in the first place.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:30.019
So. I'm gonna tell you
exactly what happens now.

00:45:30.562 --> 00:45:32.981
Ruth. talk to the TV company.

00:45:33.565 --> 00:45:36.192
Make a "no comment" comment.

00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:39.779
We don't discuss ongoing inquiries.
blah. blah. blah.

00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:42.031
-Right.
-And find witnesses.

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:44.534
Anyone who can tell us what the RSPCA
will need to know.

00:45:44.576 --> 00:45:46.161
if we pass it up to them.

00:45:46.536 --> 00:45:48.538
-Is...
-Bob.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.166
Is Bob in a safe home?

00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:54.252
Separated from other animals?
You know the drill.

00:45:54.294 --> 00:45:56.421
Oh. I've had some joy
already there. boss.

00:45:56.463 --> 00:45:59.382
Spoke to housing.
Mr Bowen's in assisted accommodation.

00:45:59.716 --> 00:46:01.885
Keeps it tidy. no other animals.

00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.303
Is the animal healthy?

00:46:03.678 --> 00:46:05.889
I need to check out his story
on taking it to the vet.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.223
but he seemed OK.

00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:11.644
OK. Well. keep talking to people.
And remember the law.

00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:16.399
Is Bob free to display. and I quote.
"normal behaviour patterns"?

00:46:18.318 --> 00:46:20.069
And as for you. stay out of it.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.863
(Sighs) You might be right
on this one.

00:46:21.905 --> 00:46:23.323
but I can't afford to be wrong.

00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:26.534
I'm not gonna be plastered
all over the papers.

00:46:26.576 --> 00:46:30.163
Cruella de Muswell Hill.
It's not happening.

00:46:30.205 --> 00:46:31.581
(Phone rings)

00:46:31.623 --> 00:46:32.790
If a guy who works on the street

00:46:32.832 --> 00:46:35.502
is being separated from his cat
at Christmas.

00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:37.795
it's got to be done
by the book. Got it?

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:39.714
(Ruth and Leon) Yes. boss.

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:41.799
Yes.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:43.593
(Tour guide) Hello.

00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:46.137
-Here we are. Is that you. yeah?
-(Tourist) Hello.

00:46:46.179 --> 00:46:48.681
Excellent. On you pop.
Nice one. Hello.

00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:51.726
(Tourist) Thank you. Hello.
Thank you for a good trip.

00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:54.646
There we go. That's you.
In you go. Did you have fun?

00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:57.232
-See the sights. yeah? (Laughs)
-So stupid.

00:47:05.198 --> 00:47:06.241
See ya.

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:19.170
-Yes. mate. that's the one over there.
-That's the one over there.

00:47:19.212 --> 00:47:20.505
-Yeah.
-(Man) Yeah.

00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:25.718
-Yeah. all right. Righto.
-(Engine starting)

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.685
(James) There you go.

00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:40.900
(Beeping)

00:47:41.401 --> 00:47:43.611
(Exhaling)

00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:48.866
Oh. no. No. no. no.

00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:51.327
Idiot.

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:54.330
Stupid.

00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:57.834
(Sighs)

00:48:05.717 --> 00:48:06.884
(Sighs)

00:48:15.977 --> 00:48:17.645
That's gone as well.

00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:21.107
(Sighs)

00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:28.239
I'll be right back.

00:48:31.993 --> 00:48:34.412
-(Bell over door chimes)
-Don't let the elephants out.

00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:38.207
Hi. Moody.
Twenty on the electric. please.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.294
Big freeze coming in from Greenland.

00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:43.630
Ah. great. When?

00:48:44.047 --> 00:48:47.508
End of the week. I think.
Best tune in to the radio.

00:48:48.134 --> 00:48:49.135
Thanks.

00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:52.597
Er... There you are.

00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:59.228
Do you have any tape?
My guitar's bust.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:00.438
Hmm.

00:49:01.314 --> 00:49:03.149
Here. Use mine.

00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:04.901
Oh. Thank you.

00:49:12.408 --> 00:49:13.910
(Beeps)

00:49:21.709 --> 00:49:24.212
-Bob. no! Ah!
-(Bob miaows)

00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:26.339
Bob! What have you...

00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:30.718
Stinks.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:39.644
Thank you.

00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:47.610
Excuse me. ma'am. Five-minute warning.

00:49:47.652 --> 00:49:49.862
-Calm down.
-I'm working here with my cat.

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:52.365
(Ruth) We are conducting
a routine investigation.

00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:54.409
but we're also appealing
to the public for help.

00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:59.080
Anyone who knows the man and the cat
in the video or the photograph.

00:49:59.122 --> 00:50:00.665
please get in touch...

00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:03.751
-Ma'am. five minutes.
-Yes. Sorry. darling. Thank you.

00:50:03.793 --> 00:50:05.962
...so that we can resolve
where the cat should be.

00:50:06.379 --> 00:50:08.297
(Mobile dialling)

00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:16.848
(Man on radio) And they say there's
a cold front coming in this weekend

00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:18.224
just in time for Christmas.

00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:20.393
-Might even get a bit of snow.
-Brilliant.

00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:23.521
Could be a white Christmas this year.
How do we feel about that?

00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:25.523
Hey. it's what
we're dreaming about. right?

00:50:25.565 --> 00:50:27.608
You're listening
to the sounds of the season.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.486
Traffic and weather.
together on drive time.

00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:33.072
-(Radio stops)
-Are you coming. mate?

00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:34.741
No?

00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:37.618
I'd stay there too if I could.

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:40.496
See you later. monster.

00:50:44.834 --> 00:50:46.961
(Spray cans rattling and hissing)

00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:51.632
(Indistinct chatter)

00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:06.397
(Man) Next batch!

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:10.276
Where shall I put this. Sarah?
Over there?

00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:11.778
Just back there.

00:51:12.945 --> 00:51:16.449
Sorry. Excuse me. I'm looking
for a Miss Chan. Bea Chan.

00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.451
-She's just over there.
-Thank you.

00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:22.455
It looks pretty full-on.

00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:26.709
Yeah. it was hard enough.
but we just got burgled as well.

00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.503
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:30.755
It's gonna be a long winter.

00:51:30.963 --> 00:51:32.673
Then I'll be as quick as I can.

00:51:33.716 --> 00:51:36.594
So. Bea. how long have you known
Mr Bowen and Bob?

00:51:36.636 --> 00:51:38.596
Nine months. maybe ten.

00:51:39.222 --> 00:51:41.432
I go round to James's flat
fairly regularly.

00:51:41.474 --> 00:51:45.186
I see. Is it true that Bob
was recently seen by a vet here?

00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:48.981
-Yeah. Dr Becky.
-Bob was injured somehow?

00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:50.441
It was just a scratch.

00:51:50.483 --> 00:51:54.362
James brought Bob in first thing.
Becky fixed him right up.

00:51:55.822 --> 00:51:58.658
-Do you want her number?
-Yes. please.

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.869
Erm. so you've known them
almost a year.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.623
Is there anything in Bob's behaviour
that struck you during that time?

00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:06.874
In what way?

00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:09.877
Well. it's not normal for a cat
to be out on the streets most days.

00:52:09.919 --> 00:52:12.839
Bob was a stray. That's where
he lived till he teamed up with James.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.049
Uh. I didn't know that.

00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:17.760
But some might say
spending his days with James.

00:52:17.802 --> 00:52:20.638
it's not exactly a suitable
environment. not normal behaviour.

00:52:22.598 --> 00:52:24.892
You know cats. Obviously.

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.770
-Lost mine in the summer.
-Hm.

00:52:28.104 --> 00:52:30.815
Dexter. He was a real star.

00:52:30.857 --> 00:52:33.067
But. so. yes. I'd say so.

00:52:33.442 --> 00:52:35.111
Pretty independent creatures.

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:36.737
Not gonna do anything
they don't wanna do.

00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:38.781
-Oh. definitely not.
-(Chuckles)

00:52:38.823 --> 00:52:42.660
So every day before he leaves home.
James gives Bob the choice.

00:52:42.702 --> 00:52:46.205
to stay at home in the warm alone
or go out with him.

00:52:46.873 --> 00:52:48.791
And every day. well. almost every day.

00:52:49.125 --> 00:52:50.459
Bob goes with him.

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:52.211
And what about James?

00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:56.299
Is he... Is his home life stable?

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.137
James is no saint.
but he's taken big steps.

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:04.640
And Bob's given him responsibility.
not something he's had before.

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:08.436
Two musketeers.
All for one. one for all.

00:53:08.644 --> 00:53:11.522
When James went cold turkey.
Bob never left him for a minute.

00:53:12.315 --> 00:53:14.066
Was he using when he had Bob?

00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:17.570
He was on the programme. Methadone.

00:53:18.487 --> 00:53:20.531
Bob gave him the strength
to get clean.

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.283
(Writing)

00:53:22.325 --> 00:53:26.412
If you were to split them up.
it doesn't bear thinking about.

00:53:26.996 --> 00:53:29.832
I don't wanna keep you.
You've been a great help.

00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:31.542
Thanks.

00:53:34.837 --> 00:53:38.758
You're not really thinking about
taking Bob away from him. are you?

00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:41.135
We need to do what's best for Bob.

00:53:41.802 --> 00:53:44.096
It's not only up to me. Sorry.

00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:50.645
âª Cold side of the bed

00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:53.022
âª When I wake

00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:55.691
âª Forgot I was alone

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.027
âª Forgot I was alone

00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:00.821
âª Whose eyes see the words

00:54:01.447 --> 00:54:03.491
âª I don't say âª

00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:08.329
-(Coin clinking)
-Happy Christmas.

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:13.250
(Strums notes)

00:54:13.292 --> 00:54:15.169
Hi. How you doing?

00:54:17.922 --> 00:54:21.509
âª You're coming back to me

00:54:23.219 --> 00:54:25.763
âª You're coming... âª

00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:33.312
This is ridiculous.

00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:38.067
(Sighs)

00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:47.994
(Guitar playing)

00:54:49.537 --> 00:54:52.248
âª Cold side of the bed

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.500
âª When I wake

00:54:54.917 --> 00:54:57.086
âª Forgot I was alone

00:54:57.128 --> 00:54:59.922
âª Whose eyes see the words

00:54:59.964 --> 00:55:02.008
âª I don't say... âª

00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:04.301
(Man) Oh. come on. I'm thirsty.

00:55:04.677 --> 00:55:07.263
(Laughs) My God. I just don't.

00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:10.641
I just don't. Hey. mate.

00:55:10.683 --> 00:55:13.227
We're off for a wee Christmas pint.
Want to join us?

00:55:16.564 --> 00:55:18.065
(Exhales) Come on. you two.

00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.110
Peace on earth.
goodwill to men and all that.

00:55:21.152 --> 00:55:22.570
-Hmph.
-(Sighs)

00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:25.990
Hey. first pint's on me.
Come on. before he defrosts.

00:55:26.032 --> 00:55:27.616
-OK.
-Good man.

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:30.911
-Er. not great.
-Tell us all about it.

00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:33.289
Thanks. Dave.

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.874
(Man) See you later. Cheers.
Merry Christmas.

00:55:34.915 --> 00:55:37.168
Do you think I'd sell more papers
if I had a cat?

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.920
-Erm. I don't think so.
-Sorry.

00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:41.672
-(Woman) All right.
-Sorry.

00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.799
Listen. suits are your thing.
Look at you.

00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:45.968
-Look at the effort that you put in.
-Sorry.

00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:50.181
I mean. you could get
a bunny outfit for Easter.

00:55:50.222 --> 00:55:53.059
-Sorry.
-Love heart for Valentine's.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.228
Er. Pete. watch you don't melt.
sitting by that fire there.

00:55:57.563 --> 00:55:59.732
Cos he's a snowman.

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.943
Here. I've got a good one for you.

00:56:02.985 --> 00:56:05.071
What do you call a snowman
who works at a bakery?

00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:09.575
-A baker. (Laughs)
-It's funny.

00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:12.536
-Hm.
-Wow. Tough crowd.

00:56:12.912 --> 00:56:15.623
(Mumbles) It's funny.
It's funny. (Exhales)

00:56:21.462 --> 00:56:25.091
All right. let's hear it.
You got a problem with me?

00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:27.009
I don't know. Do I?

00:56:27.927 --> 00:56:29.678
You will have
if you don't spit it out.

00:56:31.347 --> 00:56:34.517
I know it was you who shopped me
to the animal welfare people.

00:56:35.768 --> 00:56:36.977
What?

00:56:37.812 --> 00:56:40.648
I saw you the other day
near Covent Garden tube.

00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:44.068
Yeah. you and your mate
in the council van. pointing at us.

00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:46.904
Why are you helping them
spy on me and Bob?

00:56:47.446 --> 00:56:48.447
Spying?

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:50.699
On your cat?

00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:53.744
Why would I be spying on your cat?

00:56:53.786 --> 00:56:55.287
I don't know. You tell me.

00:56:55.704 --> 00:56:58.874
(Scoffs) White van?

00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:01.252
James Street?

00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:03.212
That was Danny.

00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:07.007
He had some work for me.
School had frozen pipes.

00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:09.051
Wanted me to thaw 'em out.
Picked me up from there.

00:57:10.469 --> 00:57:11.679
Look.

00:57:12.555 --> 00:57:14.056
I didn't know you were there.

00:57:14.974 --> 00:57:16.475
Hardly worth it. is it?

00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.271
-(Laughing)
-(Exhales)

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.439
Fifteen quid.

00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:31.448
So. tell me. how did you get the cat?

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.783
(James chuckles)

00:57:33.659 --> 00:57:35.244
I found him in my flat.

00:57:36.412 --> 00:57:40.249
He was a stray.
He wouldn't leave me alone.

00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:41.876
(Both chuckle)

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:44.044
Jammy sod.

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:46.755
Won't deny he pulls in the punters.

00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:49.216
I didn't mean that.

00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:53.596
I couldn't care what you make.
You're lucky to have him.

00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:54.722
Mm-hmm.

00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:58.601
When you look after someone. it gives
you purpose. it gives you meaning.

00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:02.021
It makes you a better person.

00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:09.570
I've got a little girl.

00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:12.364
Maisie.

00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:17.203
Not so little any more. (Laughs)

00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:23.584
And a junked-up teenager
in a Ford Fiesta...

00:58:25.294 --> 00:58:26.295
(Exhales)

00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:30.007
Took me nine months
to walk again. so...

00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:33.594
I don't miss much.

00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.847
-Don't miss her mother. (Laughs)
-(Chuckles)

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:42.811
I miss Maisie. though.

00:58:47.775 --> 00:58:50.194
So... So where is she now?

00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:51.862
Maisie?

00:58:52.988 --> 00:58:56.158
West London. She's got a kid.

00:58:56.825 --> 00:58:58.035
Never met him.

00:58:59.745 --> 00:59:01.580
I wonder if he might
look like me. you know.

00:59:02.623 --> 00:59:04.959
-If he's lucky.
-(Laughs)

00:59:06.752 --> 00:59:07.920
Nah.

00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:11.340
She don't need me in her life.

00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:18.764
You're inside there... somewhere.

00:59:31.235 --> 00:59:32.903
(Exclaims) That's me done.

00:59:36.198 --> 00:59:37.199
See you around.

00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:52.256
(Mick) Lucky to have him.

00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:55.384
When you look after someone. it gives
you purpose. it gives you meaning.

00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:58.470
It makes you a better person.

01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:45.184
(Ruth sighs)

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:01.033
(Door opens)

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.495
(Door closes)

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:09.500
Hey. Bob.
Guess who I've just been out with?

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:13.253
Mick. Yeah. Of all people.

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:17.007
Nasty Mick. Mick the spy.

01:01:17.508 --> 01:01:19.426
Except he's not a spy after all.

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:23.305
Bob. Come on. mate.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.140
Must be hungry.
Come and get your dinner.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.272
Bob? Bob.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.568
Bob.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:38.737
Mate. are you OK?

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:40.531
Bob.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:44.743
(Exhales) Come on.

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:46.203
Erm.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.914
Come on.
pull yourself together. Think.

01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:08.267
-(Dialling)
-(Line ringing)

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.103
This is Dr Becky
at the Green Veterinary Centre.

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.604
Please leave a message after the tone.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.732
-(Beeps)
-Dr Becky. it's Bea's friend. James.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:18.735
Erm. it's Bob. my cat. He's sick.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.654
Really sick.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.197
Call me. please.

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:39.840
(Bell over door chimes)

01:02:39.882 --> 01:02:42.468
-Don't let the elephants...
-You gotta help me.

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.223
(Moody) Is he eating? Drinking?

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.433
Nothing.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.645
Let's put a bowl of water by his head.

01:02:54.021 --> 01:02:55.272
And we should keep him warm.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.784
(Water pouring)

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.630
-Did you write these?
-Some.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.549
My friend Bea's idea.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.221
Hmm. (Chuckles)

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.431
Should never have let him come out
in this weather.

01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:32.226
Wouldn't have animal welfare
on my case.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.560
Animal welfare?

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:35.270
Erm...

01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:43.362
They're threatening to take Bob away.

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:46.657
(Sighs)

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:49.201
Maybe they should.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.463
(Exhales)

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.591
I don't know how you did it with Mo.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:09.221
Just sitting there. waiting.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.518
Well. from the outside
it looks very different.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:18.897
You just deal with it.
It becomes your reality.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.569
How do you go on?

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:26.613
(Exhales)

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:33.495
There were three pilgrims
on a journey to a holy place.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.373
Each had suffered great sadness.

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:40.252
Each was looking for peace.
a way ahead.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:43.171
Each had two sacks.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.882
one on his back. the other
round the neck at his front.

01:04:47.843 --> 01:04:51.138
The first man
filled the sack on his back

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:52.681
with all the good things in his life.

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:55.892
Like your tree.
Happy thoughts. memories.

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:57.269
OK.

01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:01.231
At the front.
he kept all the bad things.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.234
His sadness. guilt. Bad memories.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:08.530
Because he. he wanted to think
about them. Make sense of them.

01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:10.657
Even though there was none to be made.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:15.245
Because of this.
he didn't make much progress.

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:16.913
He soon gave up the journey.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:18.415
I had a feeling he would.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.043
Now. the second man.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.712
(Clears throat) He carried
the good things at the front.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.589
He liked to show them off.

01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:30.510
He kept the bad things on his back.
even though they weighed heavily.

01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:35.265
His journey was slow as well.
He too gave up.

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.392
The third one got it right.
I'm betting.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:38.435
No.

01:05:38.894 --> 01:05:41.104
He also carried the good things
at the front.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:44.566
but to him they were an inspiration.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:46.735
Like... (Exclaims)

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.988
sails on a ship. moving him faster.

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:53.158
And he didn't carry anything
on his back?

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.910
Yes. he did.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.537
But he cut a hole in that sack.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:02.209
so all the bad things
slowly dropped onto the road.

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:03.877
Hmm.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.424
-And he reached the holy place?
-And found a new way forward.

01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:14.596
So which one was you?

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.517
(Laughs)

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.604
I have been all three.

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:28.360
But now I just carry my good memories
of Mo and let them inspire me.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.613
And the bad?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.577
Mm. That took a while.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.623
But now I understand...

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:48.380
the greatest act of love I showed Mo
was in letting him go.

01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:50.507
To a better place.

01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:55.011
So. the memories...

01:06:57.806 --> 01:07:00.934
the beeping of that machine.
the tubes. the wires.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.812
(Sighs) the signing of those forms.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.732
I was free to let them go too.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:13.447
You must not let your future
be weighed down by your past.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.907
You will get to where you need to go.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.120
But what about him?

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.959
(Moody) Maybe he will be
a part of that journey.

01:07:27.127 --> 01:07:28.378
But if not.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:32.632
you have already proved
your love a hundred times over.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:41.933
(Sighs) I had better go.
It's already Christmas Eve.

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:47.022
(Exhales) Busy day ahead. Let me know
if there's anything I can do. Hmm?

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.347
(Indistinct whispering)

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.228
(James) Bob.

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:10.188
Bob.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.440
Bob.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.193
Bob!

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:21.449
(Mick) He'll be in here... somewhere.

01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:25.954
Always.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.708
The greatest act of love

01:09:29.958 --> 01:09:31.793
I showed Mo...

01:09:33.253 --> 01:09:35.422
(Echoing) was in letting him go.

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:40.844
(Bob miaows)

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:54.441
Now. who's a good boy?

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:57.861
Good boy. Bob.

01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:12.626
(Breathes heavily)

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.214
(Objects clattering)

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:23.094
Bob.

01:10:37.192 --> 01:10:38.818
(Purrs)

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:42.739
It's a stomach thing. probably.
It's not unusual for cats.

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:45.617
Has he eaten anything he shouldn't
in the past 48 hours?

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.036
Yeah. Erm...

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:51.206
Some chicken.
Some old food from the fridge.

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.875
-It had all gone off.
-Did he vomit?

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:55.335
Yeah. lots.

01:10:55.377 --> 01:10:57.295
That's good.
That's nature taking its course.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.548
And the rest will have just
worked its way through his system.

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.801
He'll be all right now.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.636
(James sighs)

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.846
He doesn't deserve to live like this.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.391
Freezing all the time. Getting sick.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.395
-It's not good enough.
-What are you talking about. James?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.483
What happens when a cat
gets taken in by animal welfare?

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:22.988
Do they have those smart cat kennels.
like. they're well looked after?

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.031
I suppose.

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:26.825
What are you babbling on about?

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.453
You've had a shock. but Bob's fine.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:31.705
Yeah. she's right.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.042
Take time together at Christmas
and Bob will be his old self again.

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:39.212
You'll soon be back
into the old routine.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:43.258
Yeah. well.
that's the problem. isn't it?

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:13.538
(Typing)

01:12:18.585 --> 01:12:19.586
(Slurps)

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.180
(Line ringing)

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:37.103
Hi. This is James. Well. James' phone.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:39.314
Please leave a message after the beep.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:42.150
(Recording tone beeping)

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.408
(Dialling)

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.162
(Phone rings)

01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:57.624
(Supervisor) I don't want
to hear any more.

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:59.167
I think the cat should be separated.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:02.253
You've reached the voicemail
for Ruth Davies. animal welfare.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.047
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

01:13:04.089 --> 01:13:05.131
(Beeps)

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:06.549
(James) Hi. Ruth. This is James Bowen.

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:10.762
(Sighs) I've come
to a decision about Bob

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.306
and I need to talk to you.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:33.118
-Hey.
-(Purrs)

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.911
Hey. hey.

01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:36.079
What about him?

01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:40.500
(Moody) You must not let your future
be weighed down by your past.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:48.258
You have already proved your love
a hundred times over.

01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:51.636
(Purrs)

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:58.393
-Come on. then. mate. Good boy. Bob.
-(Miaows)

01:14:08.987 --> 01:14:10.280
Come on. then. mate.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.095
That's the guy.

01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:18.514
(Telephone ringing)

01:15:31.319 --> 01:15:32.779
Platform one.
down the stairs to the right.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.572
-Great. Thank you.
-No worries.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:36.950
James. I haven't seen you in days.

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:38.868
I just came to wish you
a happy Christmas.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:40.870
Aww. thank you so much.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:44.207
Oh. Hold on there. now.
I have some stuff for you too.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.834
People came by. dropping these off.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.254
-It's all for us?
-Mm-hm.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.882
Wow. Thank you.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.176
-Come on. Bob.
-Happy Christmas.

01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:07.188
(Irene) James!

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.315
James.

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:12.193
Where have you two been hiding?

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:13.987
I've been looking all over.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:16.197
-I got you a card.
-Ah.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.866
How sweet of you.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:21.411
Not surprised you've been lying low.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:23.621
with all that council nonsense
as well.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:25.748
Council nonsense?

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:28.960
Here.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:31.796
-Oh! Thank you.
-(Laughs)

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.340
-Aren't you going to open it?
-Yeah.

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.592
(Laughs)

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:40.596
Oh. Irene. that's too kind.

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:44.142
Look. Bob. Bob. look. Your own bed.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:47.186
I don't know what to say.
I feel awful. This is. erm...

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:51.149
You really have no idea. do you?

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:54.986
-See?
-There he is.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:58.948
-Merry Christmas. James.
-Thank you.

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:01.409
-It's all right.
-It's really kind of you.

01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:02.493
(Woman) Merry Christmas. James.

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:03.995
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:05.163
(Man 1) Merry Christmas. James.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.581
(Man 2) Merry Christmas.
Bob and James.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.291
Merry Christmas. my love.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.585
-Merry Christmas.
-(James) Where have you all come from?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.295
-(Crowd laughs)
-Thank you.

01:17:12.337 --> 01:17:14.630
Wow. Thank you.

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:16.591
-Happy Christmas.
-Thank you so much.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.510
-I don't know what to say.
-Happy Christmas. James.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:22.472
All right. mate.
Got a little surprise for you.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:25.058
-This is for Bob.
-(Crowd exclaiming)

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:27.810
And that is panda from China.

01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:29.437
Thank you so much.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.815
-Look. Bob. Look.
-(Woman) Doesn't he look lovely?

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:34.275
(James) What you do think?
You like it?

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.777
-It's very kind of you.
-Right. follow me.

01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:38.988
Thank you.

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:40.740
James.

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:43.201
Mick.

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:49.290
This is my daughter. Maisie.
and this is my grandson. Michael.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.418
Wow. Michael. look at you.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.049
That thing you said to me in the pub.
you know. made me think. and. er...

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:01.761
Here we are.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.015
Thanks.

01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:12.939
(Car doors close)

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.738
(Crowd chattering)

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.032
Over my dead body.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:26.494
-Let me handle this.
-Fine.

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:30.331
If you could all just give me
a moment. just to speak to James.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.709
Yeah.

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:37.505
-Can you keep hold of Bob?
-Yes. Yes. of course.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:40.675
You'll be all right. Bob.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.595
You really should
switch your phone on.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.139
Might have avoided all this.

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:49.100
It's been a difficult few days.

01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:50.435
For all of us.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:55.314
Anyhow. we've been speaking
to people. evaluating your case.

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:56.941
So have I. and. erm...

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.529
-I think I've decided that...
-Wait.

01:19:03.281 --> 01:19:04.282
Do you know what these are?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.412
Letters. notes. cards. emails...

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:12.874
"I'd just lost my husband of 40 years.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.834
"The curtains were still drawn
from the funeral.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:17.712
"But when James let me
spend a few minutes with Bob.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.047
"it gave me a reason
to draw back the curtains.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.384
"You could say they've let the light
back into my life."

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:28.639
There's an online petition too.
800 signatures in less than 24 hours.

01:19:29.307 --> 01:19:30.683
What? Who...

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:34.729
Er. under the name MoodyMo12?

01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:38.649
(Laughs)

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:42.236
That's. that's all amazing.
but. erm...

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:45.740
I know you'll look after him.

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:49.619
and. erm. I know it's for the best.

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.413
James. No.

01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:54.999
You don't understand.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:58.002
You belong together.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.546
We're not looking after him. You are.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.801
I... I don't know what to say.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:07.303
(Ruth) There's something else.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.640
A charity. Inspirational Animals.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.476
Uh. they work with therapy animals.

01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:15.186
They visit people in hospitals.

01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:18.147
They want you and Bob
to be paid ambassadors.

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:20.566
What?

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.110
-Really?
-(Laughs)

01:20:23.945 --> 01:20:25.029
What?

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.032
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:31.786
Might come in handy
when Bob visits the hospitals.

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:35.248
Thank you.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.707
Think you're so bloody clever.
don't you?

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:40.044
Oh. I've got...

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:43.214
For all you've done.

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:47.718
James. Did I miss anything?

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.264
I get to keep him.

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:53.099
You get to keep him.

01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:55.643
(Crowd cheering)

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:03.234
(âª Choir singing)

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:05.820
âª Mother and child

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:12.994
âª Holy infant so tender and mild

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:20.042
âª Sleep in heavenly peace

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:25.172
âª Sleep in heavenly peace âª

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.258
(Cheering and applause)

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.176
See? I told you.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.846
The butter maker.
You reap what you sow.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.681
-Except you left out a bit.
-Did I?

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.434
Sometimes you don't even know
you've got seeds to sow.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.102
Well. we all have those.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.147
Like the miserly king. who...

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.648
-Moody.
-(Chuckles)

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:44.066
Thank you. Charles.

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:47.862
Look. Look. look.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:51.157
Oh. my Lord. It's Arabella.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:53.034
It's the cook from the television.

01:21:54.744 --> 01:21:56.662
She's only second cousin
to the flipping queen.

01:21:57.288 --> 01:22:00.082
Well. quite the fan club.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:04.670
Mr Bowen. I couldn't let Christmas
pass without repaying your kindness.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:12.178
And if there's anything I can ever do
for you and Bob. any time...

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.347
-(Chuckles)
-Thank you.

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:15.389
(Laughs)

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.685
(Exclaims. laughs)

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:20.811
Hey.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.438
(Bea laughs)

01:22:23.022 --> 01:22:24.023
(Sighs)

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:28.444
-Merry Christmas. (Laughs)
-Happy Christmas.

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:30.363
-(Church bell ringing)
-(Man) Merry Christmas.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:31.864
Look. Bob. Snow.

01:22:31.906 --> 01:22:33.783
(Woman) Happy Christmas.

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.963
(Beeping)

01:22:54.387 --> 01:22:56.764
Bob. Try a bit of this.

01:22:57.765 --> 01:22:59.809
-Good boy.
-See you soon. Yeah. bye.

01:23:01.519 --> 01:23:02.812
He's almost back.

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:04.897
Yeah? Hey.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.191
(Door closes)

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:10.194
-Something smells good.
-Ben.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.738
-How did it go? Yeah?
-Amazing.

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.907
Could have sold 'em all.
but I kept one back for you.

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:18.452
-Wow. Look at that.
-Best-selling issue of the year.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.079
I've gotta show him. There he is.

01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:21.747
-Look at this. mate.
-Hi. Ben.

01:23:21.789 --> 01:23:23.749
-How you doing?
-Look. Cover star.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:26.460
Hey. look. What do you think?

01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:28.796
Look. Bob? Do you like it?

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:33.801
I'm gonna put it up here. OK?
Pride of place on the mantelpiece.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:37.012
-Right. drinks. Drinks.
-(Bea) Drinks.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.557
-Cheers. guys.
-Cheers.

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:41.475
-To Christmas.
-Oh! Quick. It's starting.

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:42.560
Oh.

01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:50.359
This year once again
we are spending Christmas Day

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:53.237
at the splendid Upper Street Project.

01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:57.074
A charity which strives
to spread some seasonal cheer

01:23:57.116 --> 01:24:00.244
to those who may be struggling
to make ends meet.

01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:02.163
Hm. She's an angel.

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.831
So. what do we have for you today?

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:06.709
After the savoury. always some sweet.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.753
Now. let's see if these are ready.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:14.133
Ah. Perfect. Golden brown.

01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:19.680
Now. these treats would grace
any Christmas table.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.099
Especially these.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:25.686
which I've made in honour
of a very special friend of mine.

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:30.441
without whom I may never have known
of this quite remarkable place.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:34.069
Bob. look. You're on TV.

01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:37.031
Happy Christmas. Bob.

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:39.992
Now. turkey...

01:24:40.034 --> 01:24:41.285
(James) He's been eating all morning.

01:24:41.327 --> 01:24:42.703
He's had a couple
of pigs in blankets. hasn't he?

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:44.789
(Bea) He doesn't seem
to be too interested.

01:24:45.164 --> 01:24:46.415
Thank you.

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:47.833
Mm.

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:50.169
Me and Bob were thinking
we might play charades later.

01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:51.712
-What do you think?
-Yeah.

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:52.755
We should start thinking of some.

01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:54.465
I don't know how I can ever thank you.

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:56.091
You don't need to thank me.

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.510
I've started work on the new book.

01:24:57.802 --> 01:24:59.553
If I hadn't met you.
I'd never have thought of it.

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:01.889
-Thought of what?
-What to write.

01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:05.476
Actually. I've got
a little gift for you.

01:25:05.518 --> 01:25:07.812
-(Sighs)
-Happy Christmas.

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:15.069
(Exclaims)

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:19.490
Ah. mate. Ah. this is so cool.

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:20.741
It's from me and Bob.

01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:23.702
-Thank you.
-It's all right.

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:24.870
(Both exhale)

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.081
(Strums notes)

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:37.007
I didn't know what to get you.
and then I remembered your nan's tree

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.010
and the messages about Christmas

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:42.012
and the feeling it gave you and...

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.974
(Chuckles) The Little Book of Bob.

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:46.517
Oh. it's beautiful.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.353
Yeah. it is.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:56.694
(Both chuckle)

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:01.991
What have you got in here?

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:03.659
(Plucking strings)

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.246
(Purrs)

01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:08.956
-(James) Yeah.
-(Laughs)

01:26:13.127 --> 01:26:14.962
(Indistinct chatter)

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:22.011
(Inaudible conversation)

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.321
(Song playing)

01:28:48.032 --> 01:28:50.993
âª A crowd can be quite lonely

01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:54.747
âª And the cold. it ain't great

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:58.834
âª Lights can be misleading

01:28:58.876 --> 01:29:02.087
âª They ain't showing me the way

01:29:03.714 --> 01:29:07.009
âª London town. it shuts right down

01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.887
âª When the snowflakes hit the floor

01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:14.600
âª Christmas maybe ain't for me

01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:17.895
âª I'll show it to the door

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:21.815
âª Whiteboard in the station

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:25.903
âª Is giving sound advice

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.740
âª Patience is rewarded

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:33.368
âª You don't have to tell me twice

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:37.790
âª I'll patiently be waiting

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:41.126
âª For you to take that tinsel down

01:29:42.211 --> 01:29:45.631
