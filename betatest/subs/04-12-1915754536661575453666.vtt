DIONYSOS FILMS PRESENTS

2
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.104
A MIIA TERVO FILM

3
00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:49.800
Fuck.

4
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.482
Thanks.

5
00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:13.574
Isn't it great we talked
before things got serious?

6
00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:17.787
I'll push it myself!

7
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.188
Dad.

8
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:09.607
Dad.

9
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.359
Dad.

10
00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:34.006
Well. well.

11
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.301
Repossessor Kinnunen.

12
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.470
Yes?

13
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.514
We need to take a few photos
for the web.

14
00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:44.350
What web?

15
00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:48.229
We informed you about
the eviction months ago.

16
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:49.813
Dad!

17
00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:54.318
Dad! -We need to make
some room for the photos.

18
00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.363
Move him.

19
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.749
Stop staring at me. dickhead.

20
00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:20.052
Dad! Turn it down!

21
00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:23.806
Dad!

22
00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:32.064
Dad? Why didn't you tell me?

23
00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:34.942
Seriously.

24
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.698
We have one week to empty the place.

25
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.242
Come and try this.

26
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:47.371
It was very cheap.

27
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.707
My Pumpernickel.

28
00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:52.626
A copying machine.
For your workplace.

29
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.753
Modems.

30
00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:57.548
This one's damn nice.

31
00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.592
A sauna in a bag.

32
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:10.978
Mom would have been
sixty tomorrow.

33
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.400
We should take flowers.

34
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.531
Surely you have a fiver for flowers.

35
00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:42.468
Let's go ice fishing.

36
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.957
Okay. let's go.

37
00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.716
Nice colours.

38
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.512
I don't need to sit.

39
00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:31.266
How many 90-day rehab periods
can one person get?

40
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.896
Clever girl. -How many times
has he been here? 34. 35?

41
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.816
- That's my clever girl.
- That's right.

42
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.068
Are you coming?

43
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.728
Don't touch that!

44
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:19.935
I was wondering
where our sleeping bags are.

45
00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.521
- Sleeping bags?
- Yes. we need two.

46
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.941
- No one's coming here.
- I'll find a place for them.

47
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.569
- I'll call the neighbours.
- No. you won't!

48
00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:31.446
You'll have a good reason
to fix our guest room.

49
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.826
- He could be a criminal!
- Come and see for yourself.

50
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:00.809
Must be a basketball player...

51
00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:05.105
- He is not coming here.
- Okay...

52
00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:20.078
- How's Antti?
- What do you mean Antti?

53
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:22.497
Why don't you ask how I'm doing?

54
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:27.169
As if my life only revolved
around men. Excuse me...

55
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:33.258
He calls me his sweetheart
and says that he loves me.

56
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:39.264
Decent people want to love you
and call you a sweetheart.

57
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.350
Or sweetie pie.

58
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:45.437
- Joni calls me a sweetie pie.
- Yuck. You are disgusting.

59
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.089
It's a different routine
than last week.

60
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:20.389
You've made progress.

61
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.393
Oh. shit!

62
00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.651
- Shit. it hurts.
- Goddamn.

63
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:47.666
Do you still go
and talk to somebody?

64
00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:50.502
Yeah. I do.

65
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.547
Last time we made
a relationship chart.

66
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.507
Mine was pretty empty.

67
00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.220
Before that we did
a treasure map of life.

68
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:03.390
- Fucking hell...
- Don't sniff those here!

69
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.602
I heard that you can earn
good money -

70
00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.313
by sending panties to japan.

71
00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:13.900
Maybe try the social security centre?
They help homeless people.

72
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.902
I'm not homeless.

73
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:21.032
Or am I? Am I homeless?

74
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:50.687
Is she Sari Keinänen?
The one whose father killed himself.

75
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.522
In the pine forest?

76
00:12:52.606 --> 00:12:56.026
No. that was Hannu Karjalainen.

77
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.696
That's not her.
Sari moved to Norway.

78
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.575
I heard you get whale pens
from Norway's social security centre.

79
00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.745
Sari doesn't need whale pens.

80
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.082
She got a car and a house
after living there for three months.

81
00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:15.545
- Nobody gets a house in three months.
- She did.

82
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:19.674
She does colonics there.
That pays pretty damn well.

83
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.385
What's a colonic?

84
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:28.058
I'm not sure if I'll rob
a store or a bank.

85
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.019
but I'm gonna free these slaves
from their shackles.

86
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:35.440
No! -Women. stand up
against oppression!

87
00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:38.151
Stand up and run to freedom!

88
00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:43.949
Why dance for these old.
horny wankers?

89
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.744
These slimy bastards
can't tell us girls -

90
00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:50.121
what we can or cannot do!

91
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.207
It's not your fucking job!

92
00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:58.713
You can't throw my friend out.
She didn't do anything!

93
00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:06.054
Careful.

94
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.725
What's taking so long?

95
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:13.144
Lean against that wall.

96
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:18.149
Someone's wanking in there.

97
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.950
I know. We can do colonics. too.

98
00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.577
In Norway.

99
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.873
- Excuse me. Could you move a bit?
- Sure.

100
00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:36.877
I can't. I've got Joni.

101
00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.257
I don't want to flush
anyone's ass with a hose.

102
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.467
Let's take Joni with us.

103
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:48.054
My battery's dead.
Can I borrow your phone?

104
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.932
Thank you. Thank you.

105
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:55.687
- What's Joni's last name?
- Tiuraniemi.

106
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:55.705
What? How can you even suggest that?

107
00:15:55.789 --> 00:16:00.043
- It's not that...
- It's a crime and it's exploitation!

108
00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.759
Maybe he really falls in love.

109
00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:11.346
What a happy coincidence.
just when he needs asylum.

110
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.515
Why can't we just live normally?

111
00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.643
Yeah. normally.
with a normal guest room.

112
00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:21.022
With functioning plumbing.
That's okay with me.

113
00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:26.027
Or we could have
a normal anniversary.

114
00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:30.949
- What anniversary?
- Of when we first met.

115
00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.995
When we first met... Oh no!

116
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.290
I'm sorry. Juha. I totally forgot.

117
00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:42.544
- I'm sorry.
- You've been such a busybody.

118
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.004
Congratulations.

119
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:56.349
And now you give him the keys.

120
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.488
- What's the matter now?
- Nothing.

121
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.576
I thought I'd move to Norway.

122
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:23.580
You know. that head of yours
moves with you.

123
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.543
Yeah...

124
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.623
6.80 euros.

125
00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:27.018
Hey! There's 20 cents missing!

126
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:31.814
20 cents!

127
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:36.694
Jope. relax. I'll pay.

128
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:25.928
Didn't even thank me.

129
00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:41.527
- Hey. seriously!
- Wait a sec.

130
00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:44.072
Does he have to be here every night?

131
00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:48.409
- Do you have to be here every night?
- Stop it!

132
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:58.419
I found a possible place for myself.

133
00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:03.466
I could assist this old lady.

134
00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:12.392
You just want to get rid of me. too.

135
00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:16.062
Yes I do.

136
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:25.613
What are you doing?

137
00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:29.534
Stop it!

138
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.924
Liisa is in good shape.

139
00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:48.302
But we'd all feel safer -

140
00:23:48.386 --> 00:23:50.471
if there was
someone else in the house as well.

141
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:52.348
To babysit me?

142
00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:56.811
Don't start again.
What kind of situation do you...

143
00:23:57.937 --> 00:24:00.481
Aurora. have in your life?

144
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:04.402
My situation's... a bit diverse.

145
00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:06.320
Do you have schooling in nursing?

146
00:24:06.404 --> 00:24:09.532
I'm a qualified nail technician.

147
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:12.076
And I almost finished high school.

148
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.497
You have excellent grades
in your report.

149
00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.916
How long are you willing to commit?

150
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.461
I'm going to Norway in a month.

151
00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:24.547
I heard that they pay well
for colonics.

152
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.135
And you'll go to your
house in Fuengirlo...? Yes.

153
00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:31.220
We'll go to Fuengirola.

154
00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:35.349
We'll start fixing our swimming pool
once we get there.

155
00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:38.478
Merja wants an infinity edge.

156
00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:41.314
Arto. control your ass.

157
00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:44.275
Sit or walk.
your ass will always talk.

158
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:46.777
Time to move. then.

159
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:50.823
- Don't you follow me.
- Liisa is getting a bit...

160
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:53.910
You talk as if I wasn't here.

161
00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:57.580
I want this girl.
Arto will draw up the papers.

162
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.756
Put on your safety belt.

163
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:19.227
You're late.

164
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.648
- I took care of your client.
- I'm sorry.

165
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:28.277
And Aurora. this is illegal.

166
00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:31.239
I could take you to court.

167
00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:37.537
You don't take a quick loan
in somebody else's name!

168
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.915
And book 3.500 euro flights
to Norway -

169
00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:43.584
for us and Miss Joni.

170
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:47.964
You're not seriously thinking of
becoming an ass flusher. are you?

171
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:51.384
People just talk
and promise things -

172
00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:55.096
when they are drunk.

173
00:25:55.179 --> 00:25:57.974
I thought I'd actually
do something about it.

174
00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:00.226
You should be grateful.

175
00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:03.062
You need help.

176
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:12.947
Thank you.

177
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.534
You can't continue this work
if your neck is always sore.

178
00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:19.620
So how the fuck
are you going to pay for these?

179
00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:26.586
Bergen is beautiful.

180
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:32.758
Hi. Jompsuli. my man.

181
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:42.435
Who will take care of me
when I move away?

182
00:26:43.603 --> 00:26:46.355
I really do love you.

183
00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:50.943
Who will make food for me?
Massage me?

184
00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:55.239
If you want to eat.

185
00:26:55.323 --> 00:26:58.618
my charity work for today is done.

186
00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:01.329
So pay UP-

187
00:27:01.412 --> 00:27:06.334
Why are you always so angry?
- I'm not angry with you.

188
00:27:07.168 --> 00:27:08.628
It just pisses me off -

189
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:11.881
to always see you
so plastered in here.

190
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:15.551
Don't tell my mum.

191
00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:53.547
- Jope. this guy proposed to me.
- Like they all do.

192
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:06.977
Aurora. your potatoes.

193
00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:17.655
Thanks. jompsuli.
for taking care of me.

194
00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:19.657
- Good night.
- Good night.

195
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.993
Bye!

196
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.394
You can leave your things there.

197
00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:20.736
This is our sauna department.

198
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.073
You have your own entrance
and bathroom.

199
00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.701
The swimming pool is for
Merja's use only... or ours.

200
00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:29.829
Can I swim there or not?

201
00:30:29.954 --> 00:30:33.374
At least not with your clothes on.
A bad joke.

202
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:36.252
- Why would I have my clothes on?
- You can't go there.

203
00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:40.089
The library.

204
00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:43.717
Food is delivered by
a home help service.

205
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.680
Liisa sometimes goes over the top.

206
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:52.935
One of your tasks is to
put the brakes on her crazy ideas.

207
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:55.145
I'll brake then.

208
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.465
- You really know how to sing.
- Yes. I do.

209
00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:27.636
Show me how much it costs.

210
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:30.973
Stop that.

211
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.934
Azar. come down.

212
00:32:57.017 --> 00:33:00.062
Thank you. You know the rules.

213
00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:32.261
- Could you go and play a little more?
- No. daddy.

214
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:36.056
Please. Thank you.

215
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.445
- What the hell?
- What?

216
00:37:18.528 --> 00:37:20.530
Who are they?

217
00:37:20.614 --> 00:37:24.284
We've made a deal.
I help them. they pay me.

218
00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:28.705
- Then I can pay for the flights.
- How were you planning on helping them?

219
00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:33.585
- We're looking for a wife for Darian.
- Are you serious?

220
00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:38.799
- What's in there?
- I can't see anything.

221
00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:41.385
- No?
- No.

222
00:37:42.803 --> 00:37:46.515
- Your horny eye is twitching.
- No it isn't!

223
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.433
I swear I won't bang him.

224
00:37:48.517 --> 00:37:51.144
You so want to know
how big his Johnson is.

225
00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:54.273
"Johnson" is an international term.
Sshh!

226
00:38:10.289 --> 00:38:13.959
This is just like in last spring
when you adopted the squirrel.

227
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:16.628
It's not the same at all.

228
00:38:16.712 --> 00:38:20.173
It shat everywhere
and ate the electric wires.

229
00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:25.053
You can clear the dishes!

230
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:04.259
Behave yourself.

231
00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:34.206
Juha! Okay. I'm leaving now.

232
00:39:41.505 --> 00:39:44.466
I have always wanted
lights like these.

233
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:45.884
Me too.

234
00:40:02.275 --> 00:40:05.404
Well. well...

235
00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:03.587
A real Saudi prince!

236
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:07.591
Darian just came to Finland.

237
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:11.136
I'm also a refugee.
Tell the Hussein here -

238
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:14.848
that I was born
in Karelia by Lake Ladoga.

239
00:41:20.896 --> 00:41:23.231
I just remembered a song -

240
00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:25.942
my Ma sang when she was baking pies.

241
00:41:26.026 --> 00:41:29.070
I could sing it to you.
Tell him I'm gonna sing.

242
00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:35.994
Sit. sit.

243
00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:39.789
<i>My fanny is going wild
jumping like a loony.</i>

244
00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:43.668
<i>From floor to ceiling
And with a feeling.</i>

245
00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:47.631
<i>My pussy went to St. Petersburg
My slit to the city.</i>

246
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:52.802
<i>There. like a happy bird.
My fanny burst into laughter.</i>

247
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:58.099
<i>Now it's wide open
jeering like an oven.</i>

248
00:42:20.497 --> 00:42:25.335
Why is he so serious? We used to
sing and laugh all our sorrows away -

249
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.630
whatever the cause.

250
00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:30.715
Ask José if he can sing.

251
00:42:36.096 --> 00:42:40.392
Tell José it helps.

252
00:42:40.475 --> 00:42:42.769
Maybe he needs encouragement.

253
00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:45.480
Take Karelia balsam
from the cupboard -

254
00:42:45.564 --> 00:42:47.941
and turn that machine down.

255
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:52.445
Will do.

256
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.323
Here we go.

257
00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:58.743
Cheers.

258
00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:15.260
Sing away.

259
00:43:21.683 --> 00:43:25.937
<i>Listen to the "reed flute"</i>

260
00:43:26.479 --> 00:43:29.274
<i>that tells its story</i>

261
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:34.029
<i>and laments its separation.</i>

262
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:39.576
<i>When I was cut</i>

263
00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:43.371
<i>from the field of reeds</i>

264
00:43:44.164 --> 00:43:49.294
<i>my sigh made men and women weep.</i>

265
00:43:50.295 --> 00:43:53.548
<i>My yearning makes me</i>

266
00:43:53.632 --> 00:43:56.968
<i>want to tear my heart open.</i>

267
00:43:57.052 --> 00:44:03.099
<i>He who comes separated
from his origin</i>

268
00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:12.184
<i>keeps searching for
the day of reunion.</i>

269
00:44:22.077 --> 00:44:26.581
What a terrible weeping song.
my dear son.

270
00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:33.630
It made him feel better.

271
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.887
One's pie is like one's pussy.

272
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.598
- An old saying.
- I'm not translating that.

273
00:44:43.682 --> 00:44:45.308
Don't.

274
00:44:45.392 --> 00:44:49.104
I've got to find Darian a wife.
And a suit that fits.

275
00:44:49.396 --> 00:44:52.732
A wife?

276
00:44:54.943 --> 00:44:56.611
I see.

277
00:44:57.529 --> 00:45:00.990
Listen. My friend Tuulikki
is having a hard time.

278
00:45:01.074 --> 00:45:04.202
She has to
constantly explain to her clan -

279
00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:07.330
that she has a girlfriend.
or a granny friend.

280
00:45:07.414 --> 00:45:09.541
Those old hags should
keep their mouths shut.

281
00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:12.836
I did team gymnastics with her.

282
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:16.965
Go and fetch clothes
from Jorma's wardrobe.

283
00:45:38.111 --> 00:45:39.946
I like your leather jacket.

284
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.995
I think I'll take a little nap.

285
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:51.207
Good. then you have enough energy
on the wedding night.

286
00:46:34.667 --> 00:46:38.505
He didn't kill the old lady.

287
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:49.742
Oopsie! My back is in a jam again.
Help me.

288
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:06.009
Azar. let's go.

289
00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:12.223
- No. clad!
- What are you doing?

290
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.063
Good night.

291
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:48.152
- Hello.
- Hello there.

292
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:07.130
Let the boy keep his
swimming trunks on if he wants to.

293
00:50:13.678 --> 00:50:18.391
It may seem a bit odd.
We sit here naked -

294
00:50:18.474 --> 00:50:21.269
and he may have
never even seen a sauna.

295
00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:25.023
When in Rome. do as the Romans do.

296
00:50:59.766 --> 00:51:05.980
I've got... very...
hairy... balls.

297
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:09.919
- Pumpernickel.
- Here you are.

298
00:52:10.002 --> 00:52:12.630
Thank you. What is this?

299
00:52:13.339 --> 00:52:14.882
A loaf of bread.

300
00:52:17.135 --> 00:52:19.971
- Did you bake this?
- I helped.

301
00:52:20.096 --> 00:52:22.390
Tasted it a bit on the way.

302
00:52:35.194 --> 00:52:37.864
No. I can't bring you
Esko's homemade wine.

303
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.541
You won't fit through there.

304
00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.548
- Bring me one Long Drink.
- No. I won't.

305
00:53:01.012 --> 00:53:03.472
- Have some dessert.
- Thanks.

306
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:28.539
<i>At night in a bus.</i>

307
00:53:30.917 --> 00:53:34.795
<i>One tired passenger.</i>

308
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.761
<i>He looks out a frosted window.</i>

309
00:53:41.844 --> 00:53:44.847
<i>As the landscape changes.</i>

310
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:49.727
<i>He counts the oncoming cars.</i>

311
00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:55.274
<i>As bus stops flash by.</i>

312
00:53:57.235 --> 00:54:05.235
<i>Knowing that any of
them Could have been.</i>

313
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:09.622
<i>The right one.</i>

314
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:17.421
<i>There were announcements
at the station.</i>

315
00:54:18.381 --> 00:54:22.885
<i>Like an invitation
you can't escape.</i>

316
00:54:26.264 --> 00:54:29.850
<i>There are things.</i>

317
00:54:31.644 --> 00:54:35.773
<i>That are hurtful and difficult.</i>

318
00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:43.155
<i>Talking won't help you
get over them.</i>

319
00:55:04.176 --> 00:55:07.054
Take him with us.

320
00:55:12.852 --> 00:55:17.732
- Liisa. We're gonna have an after-party.
- A what?

321
00:55:17.815 --> 00:55:20.318
- An after-party.
- Good.

322
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:39.814
Wanna see what King Crab does?

323
00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:41.941
It goes to the Swedish crab fest.

324
00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:47.983
Aurora!

325
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:55.032
We found this one
at the gas station.

326
00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:56.867
Oh. shit!

327
00:58:59.203 --> 00:59:03.082
- Are you all right?
- I went to get...

328
00:59:03.165 --> 00:59:06.252
What was it again? Sour milk?

329
00:59:06.335 --> 00:59:10.673
- My old brain doesn't remember.
- Let's go inside.

330
00:59:13.467 --> 00:59:18.055
Whose fancy house is this?

331
00:59:22.685 --> 00:59:25.145
Keep the blanket out of my nose.

332
00:59:25.396 --> 00:59:27.565
Keep it out of my nose.

333
01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:34.084
- Hi. Jorma. This is Dorian.
- Darian.

334
01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:36.003
I'm Kari.

335
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.965
He came straight from a warzone.
Very traumatized.

336
01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:42.551
I'm trying to keep him alive.

337
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.625
<i>I am Wolfgang.</i>

338
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:46.383
<i>Why did you burn Lapland?</i>

339
01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:50.387
<i>What are you doing
in my leather pants?</i>

340
01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:15.370
Blanket in my nose.

341
01:05:16.622 --> 01:05:18.498
I'll fix it.

342
01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.846
Oh. fuck!

343
01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:53.844
- Who was that?
- Just this guy called Wolfgang.

344
01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:57.347
He test drives Porsches in Muonio.

345
01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:02.102
I can't handle
any strange stuff right now.

346
01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.982
Oh. shit!

347
01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:39.097
I'm all right.

348
01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:24.304
<i>Life smiles like a herring
in a pint of sour milk.</i>

349
01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.749
<i>She's a true hat maker.</i>

350
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:46.005
Remove me from between the pages.
I'm not a subject.

351
01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:53.138
I'm so tired.

352
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.725
Azar!

353
01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:11.197
Azar. what happened?

354
01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.992
I miss my mother.

355
01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:17.078
You miss your mother?

356
01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:21.166
So do I.

357
01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:23.418
You scared me.

358
01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:38.266
Wow! A deodorant.

359
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.981
A 150-litre garbage bag?

360
01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:49.694
<i>A woman's independence
and freedom must not be violated.</i>

361
01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:52.739
<i>Can't you do something about this?</i>

362
01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:55.325
<i>I could recommend Martta.</i>

363
01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:59.245
<i>Lukas Kroderus from judicial district
called and asked for a trainee.</i>

364
01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.873
<i>He is on leave and the clerk is ill.</i>

365
01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.667
<i>And you haven't said anything.</i>

366
01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:07.921
<i>I didn't know
that you're interested in law.</i>

367
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:22.352
- You want something?
- A pack of cigarettes.

368
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.743
Up and groaning already. I see.
Tuuli Aurora Ruikka?

369
01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:10.788
- Could you remove this?
- Just a second.

370
01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:13.750
You were brought in at 7.34 a.m.

371
01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:16.002
Blood alcohol content... Heavens!

372
01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:19.255
Gastric lavage.
four stitches to the right calf -

373
01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:20.798
eight to the right side.

374
01:19:20.882 --> 01:19:23.843
Fortunately your forehead and head
didn't need stitches.

375
01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.846
A frostbite in
the little toe of your left leg.

376
01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:29.307
Patient aggressive and paranoid.

377
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:33.895
Given sedatives and movement
restricted with limb restraints.

378
01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:36.481
No signs of a sexual assault.

379
01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:40.943
Need for psychiatric care to be
checked when the patient wakes up.

380
01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.196
Who should we call?

381
01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:47.700
A boyfriend. girlfriend.
father. mother. aunt?

382
01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:51.913
Okay.
When you were brought here -

383
01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:56.751
you shouted for someone
called Darian.

384
01:19:56.834 --> 01:20:00.713
We can't help you with love affairs.
but with substance abuse we can.

385
01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:03.758
I haven't got a problem.

386
01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:07.887
Could you give me my phone
from my pocket?

387
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.430
Of course.

388
01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:18.231
In lab experiments. even rats have
become alcoholics. Squirrels. too.

389
01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:22.068
Why else would they eat
overripe berries from trees?

390
01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:26.614
I haven't got a problem.
Thank you very much.

391
01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.758
Fuck my life!

392
01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:47.969
This isn't your first time here.

393
01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:50.513
Having occasional
problems with drinking -

394
01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.765
doesn't mean
you have a drinking problem.

395
01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:56.060
At times when I'm having fun.
I go a bit overboard.

396
01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:58.938
Well. did you have fun?

397
01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:02.859
My ex-husband joined this group.

398
01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:05.945
He's been completely sober
for seven yea rs.

399
01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:09.156
Here's the number
if you want to call them someday.

400
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:14.161
I'm not gonna go and cry
in some shitty alkies' group.

401
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.472
I'll go to the cafeteria.

402
01:21:55.745 --> 01:21:58.414
Good heavens. Pumpernickel.

403
01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.754
- I brought you a Christmas present.
- Thank you.

404
01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.223
<i>Le ban ban. le croissant.</i>

405
01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:39.200
Oh. you're having a private moment.

406
01:24:40.034 --> 01:24:41.911
Here you are.

407
01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:48.459
Is she coming to the party
after the wedding?

408
01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:57.259
Aurora. Aurora!

409
01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:01.931
Why are you prowling about.
wrapped in that blanket?

410
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.146
You are all mixed-up. clear child.
I'll open the door.

411
01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:29.500
I didn't expect you here
until tomorrow.

412
01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:48.060
Kinky. Please!

413
01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:52.898
Why should I ever speak to you again?

414
01:25:53.399 --> 01:25:57.444
I don't remember
what I said or did yesterday.

415
01:25:57.528 --> 01:25:59.780
- You hit me. for instance.
- Really?

416
01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:01.532
Yes.

417
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:05.244
Then you screamed that I don't
understand life at all.

418
01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:09.665
That I should lose someone
close to me before I understood.

419
01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:15.880
I'm sorry. -Why do I always
expect you to act all normal?

420
01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:21.635
And you insisted on singing
Mariah Carey's Without You.

421
01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:26.223
Am I like a typhoon -

422
01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:30.686
hurricane or some other
chaotic phenomenon?

423
01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:35.357
You're more
like a flame-thrower on rails.

424
01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:38.027
And you just might have
a drinking problem.

425
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:42.573
Problems with drinking doesn't mean
you have a drinking problem.

426
01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:45.159
So what does it mean. then?

427
01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.967
Fucking hell!

428
01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:11.954
Okay.

429
01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:16.166
Do I have leftovers
from today's menu here?

430
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.878
- No. I have felted those.
- You mean these ornaments?

431
01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:24.383
Yes. -I use these
whenever they fit my clothes.

432
01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:27.261
I have a sample here -

433
01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:30.472
of the things
I'm going to send to japan.

434
01:28:30.556 --> 01:28:34.852
- You're head is a bit big.
- I don't know if I'll wear this.

435
01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:38.397
- What the hell are you doing?
- Me?

436
01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.899
- Are you going through his things?
- I...

437
01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:44.445
- No. I just had to check...
- Check what?

438
01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:46.905
If he has grounds...

439
01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.368
Did you know?

440
01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:54.538
Yes. I did.

441
01:28:56.373 --> 01:28:58.500
Why didn't you tell me?

442
01:28:58.584 --> 01:29:02.880
You know about my
confidentiality agreement.

443
01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.234
We have macaroni casserole.

444
01:31:37.868 --> 01:31:41.371
Juha. I was wondering
if they should take that.

445
01:31:41.455 --> 01:31:44.791
That piece of shit?
It doesn't even start.

446
01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:11.587
There.
Gate 2. and your seat is 25C.

447
01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:16.008
I'll go to the tax free.

448
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:19.595
- Kinky.
- What?

449
01:33:22.139 --> 01:33:24.766
Don't tell me you're not coming.

450
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.643
I'm sorry.

451
01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:33.066
Should I have "I'm sorry"
tattooed on my forehead next?

452
01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:49.458
You don't have to.

453
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:54.379
I wouldn't have had the courage
to book the tickets myself.

454
01:34:29.414 --> 01:34:31.124
Welcome.

455
01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:35.337
I'll read the start of chapter five.
and the first step.

456
01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:41.009
Then you can just listen.
or speak if you want to.

457
01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:53.540
What the fuck. Ulla?
Who the fuck is this?

458
01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:57.919
This is Ping. Aurora.
Ping is a political dissident.

459
01:36:59.981 --> 01:37:02.192
Pull the choke out.

460
01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:48.632
Have you seen this man?

461
01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:51.718
What the hell? What...?

462
01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:53.470
Oh shit!

463
01:38:54.638 --> 01:38:57.974
This... man.

464
01:39:00.477 --> 01:39:03.355
Kalle. have you seen this guy?

465
01:39:03.438 --> 01:39:05.982
I haven't seen anyone.

466
01:39:06.066 --> 01:39:10.987
- I'm sorry. we haven't seen him.
- Thank you.
