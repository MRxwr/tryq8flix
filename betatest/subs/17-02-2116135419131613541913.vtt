00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:46.258
(All characters. locations. organizations. religions. )

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:48.898
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:52.497
(We made sure the child actors who appear in this episode...)

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:55.238
(were safe and well taken care of throughout the shoot.)

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:59.637
(Episode 6)

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:31.366
You used your brain. but not well enough.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.495
We're experts...

00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:35.935
on luring and tailing.

00:01:46.146 --> 00:01:49.575
You came all this way. We should put an end to each other.

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:52.286
If you take me down...

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.226
(Restricted area)

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.626
You can enter here.

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:06.295
Everything about you is in here.

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:10.236
Who you are. Where you're from.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.066
That's why you're here. isn't it?

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:14.506
That's it?

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:16.775
Everything about me is in there?

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.946
You must've thought too highly of yourself.

00:03:24.135 --> 00:03:26.346
That's all you can ever do.

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:57.566
Get ready to treat him.

00:04:58.705 --> 00:04:59.736
Let's just leave him.

00:04:59.806 --> 00:05:01.075
We need to treat him first.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.705
He has the ability to cure himself.

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:05.275
- Let's see how well that works. - But still...

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.645
We need to conduct a performance test anyway.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:09.645
Let's use this opportunity to check how well he can...

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:11.616
regenerate or recuperate himself.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:15.416
I'm glad he came here in that state.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.256
This is going to save us from having to conduct another test.

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.986
As soon as we check his performance.

00:05:19.056 --> 00:05:20.756
we'll have to take him apart for mass production.

00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.825
So I want you to have all the production lines ready.

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:25.426
And record the entire process of his recovery.

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:26.866
I need to report this to the higher-ups.

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.645
Before you take Z-0 apart.

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:48.416
I want you to make several clones of his somatic cells.

00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:50.085
Pardon?

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:52.256
In this day and age. it's easy to clone people.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:55.155
Well. it's not that hard to do.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:57.765
Do it without telling anyone.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.796
"Without telling anyone"?

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:01.436
Let's just keep it...

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:03.335
between the two of us.

00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:06.306
Why are you suddenly asking me to do this?

00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:10.075
What do you think will happen if our research gets exposed?

00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:13.176
All the researchers in this lab...

00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:16.316
will end up in prison. You know that. right?

00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:21.856
But that won't happen as long as we keep it confidential.

00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:24.926
Once the experiment ends and we start mass producing.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.356
all the researchers in this lab will go missing.

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:34.796
But I'm sure you'd like to stay alive.

00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:56.856
Are you okay?

00:07:02.796 --> 00:07:04.225
Is it over now?

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:06.765
No.

00:07:09.035 --> 00:07:10.666
This is just the beginning.

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:16.376
It's going to turn into a war.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.816
Captain. why are you doing this?

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:23.916
You need to give her time to grieve.

00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:26.816
And to be honest. something really could've happened.

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.215
I want you to stay here.

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:30.556
Don't let anyone inside. and don't record anything.

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:33.556
What's going on?

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:34.756
I don't think...

00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:38.895
she should've come to our team.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.575
Captain. what's going on?

00:07:58.345 --> 00:07:59.486
It's nice and quiet. isn't it?

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:01.455
I need to ask you something.

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:03.256
I purposely didn't call before I came here.

00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:05.426
I think those guys know my whereabouts.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.426
Really?

00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:09.225
Last time. they even tailed me.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:11.696
Is that so?

00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:17.035
Where's Zi O?

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:20.236
Why are you acting startled?

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:23.975
Why are you asking me?

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:26.606
You know what will happen to you if you help a criminal hide. right?

00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:28.946
Yes. I know. I won't get severely punished.

00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:30.316
This is no time for jokes.

00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:34.916
I heard a fire recently broke out at Euicheon Church.

00:08:35.585 --> 00:08:37.556
The church didn't call 911.

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:40.186
But they still had to check if it was arson or an accident.

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:42.725
Apparently. the nun testified...

00:08:43.825 --> 00:08:47.265
that a detective named Ha Gu Reum and a guy named Zi O came together.

00:08:48.936 --> 00:08:52.106
We'll start investigating what you've been up to.

00:08:54.465 --> 00:08:55.635
But for now. where's Zi O?

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:07.585
Do you want me to handcuff you first?

00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:15.125
You're treating me like a criminal.

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.355
Are you scared?

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:18.296
How about I handcuff myself first?

00:09:28.536 --> 00:09:29.536
Let's begin.

00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:09.245
Zi O. it's me.

00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:12.016
Do you remember me?

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:15.686
Don't you remember me?

00:10:28.965 --> 00:10:30.335
It's okay. Zi O.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.005
You're home.

00:10:36.705 --> 00:10:38.245
This is your home.

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:40.375
Cut the nonsense.

00:10:46.786 --> 00:10:47.816
Zi O.

00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:51.526
I'm sorry I left you alone for such a long time.

00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:54.186
You must've been extremely lonely.

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:55.455
Who are you?

00:10:58.095 --> 00:10:59.965
I thought I had lost you for good.

00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:01.365
Who are you?

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.575
I'm...

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.016
your father.

00:11:29.056 --> 00:11:30.696
You're my son.

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.566
Shouldn't we tie him up?

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.176
- That's what he's doing. - Where?

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.646
Do you really think...

00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:49.916
you can tie him by force and take him to the lab?

00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:53.386
He's not hugging him because he loves him.

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.316
He's just doing that to keep him here.

00:11:55.386 --> 00:11:57.115
He's probably confusing him...

00:11:57.156 --> 00:11:58.725
by telling him he's his father.

00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:01.656
I must say. Professor Ryu is truly evil.

00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:06.166
Do you want a cup of water?

00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:08.465
You punk.

00:12:08.835 --> 00:12:10.365
You seem frustrated. That's all.

00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:11.666
You hid a criminal.

00:12:11.666 --> 00:12:13.605
let him escape. and obstructed a police officer.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.536
"Obstructed a police officer"? No.

00:12:16.676 --> 00:12:19.646
I was the only officer on duty at the time.

00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:23.516
I can't exactly "obstruct" myself. can I?

00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:26.146
In a broad sense. it's considered obstruction of justice.

00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:30.286
Since when did we see such a big picture and make big moves?

00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:32.056
What about the Act on the Performance of Duties by Police?

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:34.125
That shouldn't be a concern...

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.196
because I went to the church upon receiving the tip.

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:39.225
but Zi O escaped.

00:12:39.266 --> 00:12:41.365
But the nun said you two came in together.

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:44.365
Who do you trust more? Her or me?

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.505
Should I cross-examine the two of you?

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:52.906
Instead of suggesting a cross-examination.

00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:57.776
shouldn't you be understanding and just let it go?

00:12:58.585 --> 00:13:00.215
You need to be protective of your own.

00:13:00.286 --> 00:13:02.386
This is why we can never beat the prosecution.

00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:05.625
When it comes to protecting our own. we're number one.

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:06.725
The prosecution can't beat us.

00:13:08.156 --> 00:13:09.825
- Then uncuff me? - Where is Zi O?

00:13:09.896 --> 00:13:11.766
- I don't know. - Where are you hiding him?

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:15.296
You said it was no longer our case. We handed it over.

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:20.465
I really don't know where he is.

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:25.646
Do you want some beef bone soup?

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:27.146
- No. thanks. - Just have some.

00:13:27.845 --> 00:13:30.416
Criminals always have beef bone soup here.

00:13:39.825 --> 00:13:41.355
What will you do now. Captain?

00:13:43.995 --> 00:13:45.526
She's the youngest one on the team.

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:49.196
Order her a bowl of beef bone soup and come with me.

00:13:50.636 --> 00:13:51.636
Sorry?

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.705
You're my father?

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:56.936
Why do you say that? How can you be my father?

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.176
You must resent me a lot.

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:02.875
I don't have parents.

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:04.985
I grew up in a children's home. and I...

00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:10.255
You don't remember anything. right?

00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:13.585
But that doesn't change the fact that I am your father.

00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:17.595
Having no recollection doesn't mean the person doesn't exist.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:22.835
This man is the key to finding your lost memories.

00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:24.735
"Ryu Jeung Kwon"?

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.205
Do you know a man named Ryu Jeung Kwon?

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:30.835
I sure do.

00:14:30.906 --> 00:14:32.845
Can I meet him? I want to meet him.

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:35.115
He's the only person I can trust.

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:37.475
I won't trust anyone else until I talk to him in person.

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:41.755
You are talking to him now.

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.985
I'm Ryu Jeung Kwon.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.896
I guess you've forgotten your father's name.

00:14:59.906 --> 00:15:02.105
I'm sure you have many questions for me.

00:15:02.176 --> 00:15:03.705
"Why did you abandon me?"

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.276
"Why didn't you come looking for me sooner?"

00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:08.816
"Why did you almost get me killed while trying to catch me?"

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.245
"Why am I different?"

00:15:11.316 --> 00:15:14.115
"Am I a monster?"

00:15:16.455 --> 00:15:18.056
But such questions are all meaningless.

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:21.696
"Does he love me?"

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.566
That's the only question that matters.

00:15:27.725 --> 00:15:29.566
All my life.

00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:33.465
I've loved no one but you.

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:37.335
You're the only person I ever loved.

00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:42.975
That is why I'm not asking you any questions.

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.446
Why you left me...

00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:51.926
and why you abandoned your own father.

00:15:56.196 --> 00:15:59.365
Because I will always love you no matter what your answers are.

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:20.215
Do you think he's here?

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:22.186
He can't be.

00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:23.585
Then why are we here?

00:16:24.156 --> 00:16:25.355
Just in case he's here.

00:16:25.426 --> 00:16:26.556
Goodness.

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.026
Hey. the door.

00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:47.906
He's not here.

00:16:48.615 --> 00:16:51.375
Obviously. she wouldn't hide him here.

00:16:58.386 --> 00:16:59.426
Hey.

00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:02.955
This doesn't look like Gu Reum's hair.

00:17:04.325 --> 00:17:05.965
Are your eyes like a microscope?

00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:08.896
Let's go. Let's not snoop around.

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.715
Come on! Where are you going?

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:26.386
Goodness.

00:17:27.286 --> 00:17:30.755
Is he a piece of paper? There's no way he's behind that thing.

00:17:36.495 --> 00:17:37.896
What is all this?

00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:39.826
- Take a photo of this. - Okay.

00:17:41.366 --> 00:17:42.735
What has she been up to?

00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:57.975
I don't remember anything.

00:17:58.045 --> 00:18:00.715
I do recall bits and pieces. but I don't know what they mean.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:06.656
You must've produced a large amount of electricity without realizing it.

00:18:06.725 --> 00:18:08.995
and your body couldn't handle it.

00:18:09.696 --> 00:18:12.126
When that happens. your cells burn and die.

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:15.196
Your memory cells too.

00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:17.836
So you were left...

00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:21.035
only with the strongest cells and deepest memories.

00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:24.275
Then how come I don't remember anything about you?

00:18:24.535 --> 00:18:27.346
If you are really my father. I should have some memories of you.

00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:31.576
Let's eat.

00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:38.086
Do I have a mother?

00:18:42.055 --> 00:18:43.156
Yes. you do.

00:18:45.265 --> 00:18:46.396
Where is she?

00:18:46.596 --> 00:18:47.795
She's no longer around.

00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:48.995
Is she dead?

00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:51.295
She left.

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:52.866
Because of me?

00:18:59.846 --> 00:19:02.745
Some people experience static shocks more often than others do.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.715
It happens when you take your clothes off or grab a handle.

00:19:05.785 --> 00:19:07.745
It makes you jump.

00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:10.985
For those who have it worse. their laptops and phones...

00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:13.326
break very often.

00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:16.225
In your case. it was quite serious.

00:19:18.495 --> 00:19:21.295
That's why I brought you here and started treating you.

00:19:21.366 --> 00:19:22.565
So it was because of me.

00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:34.805
Why did I leave?

00:19:36.616 --> 00:19:37.676
That wasn't your fault.

00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:39.446
Then whose fault was it?

00:19:40.416 --> 00:19:41.515
Ha Young Jae.

00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:43.055
Ha Young Jae?

00:19:44.086 --> 00:19:46.126
Was her name Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum?

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.856
He always showed me photos of his daughter and bragged about her.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:01.705
What happened to him?

00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:04.576
He started a fire at the lab and ran away with you.

00:20:05.545 --> 00:20:08.275
You followed him without resisting at all.

00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:09.446
Get him!

00:20:21.485 --> 00:20:23.356
He tried to sell you.

00:20:23.426 --> 00:20:24.926
Why would he sell me?

00:20:26.765 --> 00:20:28.326
Because you're special.

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:31.795
Many scientists wanted to do experiments on you.

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.106
What happened after that?

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.465
You know the rest.

00:20:35.676 --> 00:20:37.906
I heard you met his daughter.

00:20:41.045 --> 00:20:43.416
So did I... Did I kill him?

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:50.686
You certainly have the ability to kill others. whoever that may be.

00:20:51.455 --> 00:20:54.186
Even if you actually killed someone. it wouldn't be strange at all.

00:20:56.926 --> 00:20:57.995
So it was me.

00:20:58.596 --> 00:20:59.965
No. not Ha Young Jae.

00:21:01.065 --> 00:21:02.836
You were fond of him.

00:21:02.936 --> 00:21:05.666
"I'll show you the sky and what the rain sounds like."

00:21:05.735 --> 00:21:07.465
"Let's go see the rainbow together."

00:21:07.535 --> 00:21:09.636
He said stuff like that to keep you under his thumb.

00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:14.775
You'd never kill someone you're fond of.

00:21:15.005 --> 00:21:16.616
Then who killed him?

00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:20.715
Time's up.

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:24.285
- So what do you think? - His recovery rate...

00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:26.886
is 10 times higher than the human average.

00:21:29.196 --> 00:21:30.295
Nice.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.846
I'll tell you everything later.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:49.346
I asked you who killed him.

00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:50.846
Time's up.

00:21:50.916 --> 00:21:54.086
What do you mean? Just tell me who killed him.

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:57.656
Remember this.

00:21:58.555 --> 00:21:59.985
You must find the answer on your own.

00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:01.126
The answer to what?

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:03.626
The way humans are now... Is that what we ought to be?

00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:08.765
Will we be the last mankind on this planet?

00:22:10.866 --> 00:22:13.035
There are 2 questions. but there's only 1 answer.

00:22:14.606 --> 00:22:16.136
It may be difficult. but fight it...

00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:20.705
until you come up with the answer.

00:22:37.126 --> 00:22:38.126
What is that?

00:22:43.436 --> 00:22:44.465
Who are you?

00:22:55.846 --> 00:22:56.876
Who...

00:22:57.745 --> 00:22:59.015
Who are you?

00:23:00.985 --> 00:23:03.555
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:27.076
It hurts...

00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:44.156
He's incredible.

00:23:45.326 --> 00:23:47.065
That's enough to take down an elephant.

00:24:17.135 --> 00:24:19.266
Take him to the experiment room and prep him.

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:20.605
Let's go.

00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:22.805
You did the right thing.

00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:25.645
You fed your son a meal. You did your part as a dad.

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:28.176
He didn't eat a single bite.

00:24:28.776 --> 00:24:30.716
You set the table for him. That's enough.

00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:32.115
You can't spoon-feed him.

00:24:33.815 --> 00:24:36.256
Being emotional isn't our specialty.

00:24:36.815 --> 00:24:37.855
Let's go.

00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:19.865
You didn't eat.

00:25:26.936 --> 00:25:29.105
- What is it? - Look first.

00:25:45.216 --> 00:25:46.325
Any questions?

00:25:48.385 --> 00:25:49.696
Then let me.

00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:52.966
Who are you?

00:25:56.535 --> 00:25:57.966
Given the timing.

00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:01.305
you must have gone without a warrant.

00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:04.436
You trespassed into private property.

00:26:06.006 --> 00:26:07.105
That's not my question.

00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:11.516
It's a special crime to trespass into a home at night.

00:26:11.615 --> 00:26:12.916
That's not it either.

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:14.486
Who are you?

00:26:17.585 --> 00:26:19.085
I'm Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum.

00:26:19.385 --> 00:26:20.656
Are you looking for your parents?

00:26:25.456 --> 00:26:26.996
It's nice seeing you well behaved.

00:26:29.795 --> 00:26:31.365
Come with me. Let's grab a drink.

00:27:05.466 --> 00:27:08.506
Who drinks like that anymore? How unrefined.

00:27:23.986 --> 00:27:25.216
About 20 years ago.

00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:27.885
I was on this case.

00:27:29.395 --> 00:27:30.696
The husband went missing.

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.295
All that was found at home was blood.

00:27:34.325 --> 00:27:36.436
It was a classic murder and dismemberment.

00:27:37.496 --> 00:27:39.065
It was obvious the wife did it.

00:27:41.466 --> 00:27:43.976
The husband and wife were both in their mid-20s.

00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:45.236
They were a young couple.

00:27:46.805 --> 00:27:48.746
All we needed was one piece of evidence.

00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:51.976
That was all we needed.

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:54.516
But we couldn't find it.

00:27:55.016 --> 00:27:57.315
- What evidence? - The body.

00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:01.726
I worked on that case for over 10 years.

00:28:02.426 --> 00:28:04.196
I searched for him every chance I had.

00:28:04.926 --> 00:28:06.895
Sometimes. I felt bad not working when I was on vacation...

00:28:07.466 --> 00:28:08.825
and came back to work early.

00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:13.105
"Wait until I find him. You're done for once I do."

00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:18.406
I couldn't tell whether I was investigating...

00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:21.006
or being stubborn.

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.145
Did you know the victim?

00:28:24.375 --> 00:28:26.186
I wouldn't have been called a psycho if I had.

00:28:27.145 --> 00:28:29.045
He had nothing to do with me.

00:28:29.815 --> 00:28:30.956
Then why?

00:28:31.986 --> 00:28:33.486
Everyone has a case they can't let go of.

00:28:34.585 --> 00:28:35.656
Am I wrong?

00:28:37.295 --> 00:28:38.895
Do you know what I thought later?

00:28:39.266 --> 00:28:41.196
"I wish the statute of limitations would expire quickly."

00:28:41.795 --> 00:28:43.365
It's useless even if I obsess over it.

00:28:43.736 --> 00:28:45.736
so I wanted an excuse to end the investigation.

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.135
Since I couldn't end it.

00:28:49.476 --> 00:28:51.575
I wanted it to end and be beyond my control.

00:28:52.976 --> 00:28:54.006
Right?

00:28:55.406 --> 00:28:56.746
I could relax then.

00:28:56.815 --> 00:28:58.645
It must have expired by now.

00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:01.216
It did. A long time ago.

00:29:02.315 --> 00:29:03.585
Are you relaxed now?

00:29:04.516 --> 00:29:05.615
What do you think?

00:29:06.785 --> 00:29:07.956
No way.

00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:11.156
I'm totally relaxed. I don't have to investigate anymore.

00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:13.595
I wonder why I did that back then.

00:29:14.426 --> 00:29:15.895
Why did you do that back then?

00:29:19.736 --> 00:29:22.506
That's you in the picture. isn't it? That kid.

00:29:24.676 --> 00:29:27.045
- Yes. - And your parents went missing.

00:29:27.305 --> 00:29:28.906
Did you see the case file?

00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:30.375
How long have you been investigating?

00:29:33.186 --> 00:29:35.516
- For nine years. - How is Zi O involved?

00:29:36.815 --> 00:29:37.815
I don't know.

00:29:37.885 --> 00:29:39.656
Then why was his personnel file there?

00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:42.355
Is he a suspect?

00:29:43.526 --> 00:29:44.926
I don't know yet.

00:29:45.696 --> 00:29:47.295
Be it murder or a missing persons case.

00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:49.266
the statute of limitations has expired.

00:29:49.535 --> 00:29:50.696
I know...

00:29:53.135 --> 00:29:55.736
that I can't punish the killer even if I catch him.

00:29:58.135 --> 00:29:59.406
But Captain.

00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:02.716
Isn't the statute of limitations such a joke?

00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:07.216
They're saying you can arrest them only within a few years.

00:30:07.516 --> 00:30:09.516
Even if someone you love dies.

00:30:09.585 --> 00:30:10.756
they want you...

00:30:11.986 --> 00:30:13.956
to be angry for only a few years.

00:30:14.385 --> 00:30:17.256
That's the law. So stop it.

00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:21.065
If you promise to stop.

00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:22.526
I won't file a report.

00:30:26.565 --> 00:30:28.006
I can't promise that.

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:30.436
With that one case. I destroyed myself.

00:30:30.506 --> 00:30:31.635
Don't you do that too.

00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:35.976
Promise to stop.

00:30:46.325 --> 00:30:47.385
Gu Reum.

00:30:49.026 --> 00:30:50.295
Let them go.

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:54.226
Let your mom and dad go.

00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:56.635
Let the culprit go.

00:30:57.766 --> 00:31:00.236
Let go of the times that you're holding onto.

00:31:00.936 --> 00:31:02.305
That's the only way you can live.

00:31:45.776 --> 00:31:47.016
Okay.

00:31:49.456 --> 00:31:50.885
I'll let them inspect me.

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:52.785
It could end your career as a police officer.

00:31:53.026 --> 00:31:55.055
Even if I must quit and start a private investigation agency.

00:31:57.095 --> 00:31:58.696
I will keep investigating the case.

00:32:00.926 --> 00:32:02.026
You're too stubborn.

00:32:05.065 --> 00:32:06.436
What should I do. then?

00:32:07.506 --> 00:32:08.805
You've done all you could.

00:32:12.406 --> 00:32:13.706
I don't expect you to do anything else.

00:32:27.226 --> 00:32:29.526
I don't care what you've been up to. I know nothing about it.

00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:32.726
The same goes for you going to the church with him.

00:32:33.325 --> 00:32:34.365
And...

00:32:37.266 --> 00:32:38.696
I'll delete all of these photos too.

00:32:39.936 --> 00:32:42.875
But from now on. no matter what you do.

00:32:43.335 --> 00:32:44.736
don't get caught.

00:32:44.805 --> 00:32:46.105
If you do. I can't protect you.

00:32:51.176 --> 00:32:52.216
Okay?

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:01.456
(Male. around age 10. blue light?)

00:33:11.295 --> 00:33:13.966
(Professor Oh Jong Hwan at NFS. deceased)

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:26.186
Where are you now?

00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:28.285
Zi O...

00:34:23.306 --> 00:34:25.676
How long has it been since the three of us last gathered like this?

00:34:26.006 --> 00:34:27.105
It's definitely been a while.

00:34:27.506 --> 00:34:29.815
The happy news made this possible.

00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:32.475
So how's our child doing?

00:34:35.545 --> 00:34:37.286
We've finished the first round of tests.

00:34:38.216 --> 00:34:40.056
but should I say it's looking a little messy?

00:34:40.355 --> 00:34:42.256
There are a lot of impurities in his body.

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:44.426
Had he never left. we would've taken good care of him.

00:34:44.495 --> 00:34:46.395
He's been wandering around like a stray dog.

00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:47.596
Can we clean him up?

00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:49.395
We'll give him a shock...

00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:51.565
and burn all the weak cells.

00:34:51.665 --> 00:34:54.205
When his body is only filled with healthy cells and nothing else.

00:34:54.536 --> 00:34:57.406
we'll begin cloning his cells.

00:34:58.276 --> 00:34:59.475
Those cells...

00:35:00.475 --> 00:35:03.015
will become the Angel's sons and stand at our altar.

00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:05.645
When the Almighty's sons are here... 10 million believers?

00:35:06.986 --> 00:35:08.045
Easy-peasy.

00:35:10.116 --> 00:35:12.256
But to do that. we'll need surrogate mothers.

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:13.725
Can that be arranged?

00:35:15.926 --> 00:35:18.495
That is not humans' work.

00:35:19.895 --> 00:35:21.725
Our faith will make it happen.

00:35:24.596 --> 00:35:26.466
We'll count on you. then.

00:35:26.536 --> 00:35:28.036
I look forward to hearing some good news.

00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:31.536
Please take good care of our child.

00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:35.846
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:35:47.085 --> 00:35:49.225
First. we'll see how much stronger his cells can be.

00:35:49.286 --> 00:35:51.056
We'll apply shocks to the point that...

00:35:51.125 --> 00:35:52.355
he can't physically handle it.

00:35:52.426 --> 00:35:54.495
so be ready to do CPR right away if a cardiac arrest occurs.

00:35:54.895 --> 00:35:56.966
We must keep him alive no matter what.

00:35:57.795 --> 00:35:59.966
As soon as we confirm that his cells can further evolve. we'll check...

00:36:00.036 --> 00:36:02.236
his immune and antibody response again. so get ready.

00:36:02.565 --> 00:36:03.935
- Yes. sir. - Yes. sir.

00:36:19.386 --> 00:36:21.926
You'll kill Z-0 after his cells are cloned. right?

00:36:22.185 --> 00:36:23.256
Yes. that's the plan.

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:25.495
He's hard to manage. so he may cause trouble down the road.

00:36:25.556 --> 00:36:27.426
I want you to also kill everyone at the lab.

00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:29.866
Does that include Director Ryu?

00:36:30.065 --> 00:36:31.596
They are our divine children.

00:36:31.795 --> 00:36:34.136
I don't want rumors that a mere scientist created them.

00:36:37.506 --> 00:36:39.806
So you want me to get rid of everyone who's involved.

00:36:40.946 --> 00:36:42.105
Shall I die too. then?

00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:51.585
We'll enjoy the glorious era together.

00:37:02.795 --> 00:37:04.765
That evil witch...

00:37:39.096 --> 00:37:41.866
You'll be in a lot of pain for the next few weeks.

00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:43.036
What are you doing to me?

00:37:44.105 --> 00:37:45.176
Why are you doing this?

00:37:45.176 --> 00:37:46.946
Son. do you remember what I told you?

00:37:48.406 --> 00:37:49.846
You are not my father.

00:37:50.515 --> 00:37:52.216
Even if it's true. I don't need a father like you.

00:37:55.645 --> 00:37:57.015
But I need you.

00:38:03.426 --> 00:38:04.656
We're ready.

00:38:05.156 --> 00:38:06.995
I'll kill you all.

00:38:11.495 --> 00:38:12.536
Sir.

00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:19.406
Turn it up.

00:38:47.335 --> 00:38:49.105
It stopped just before it hit 1kV.

00:38:52.335 --> 00:38:53.506
Well done. Zi O.

00:38:55.076 --> 00:38:56.346
Let's go up just a little higher.

00:38:56.406 --> 00:38:58.116
Stop. What are you doing?

00:38:58.176 --> 00:39:00.685
We're trying to find out how much voltage you can withstand.

00:39:01.415 --> 00:39:03.355
Because the maximum amount you can withstand...

00:39:03.486 --> 00:39:05.756
equals the amount of electricity you can generate.

00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:07.185
Why are you doing this to me?

00:39:07.725 --> 00:39:08.786
Let's move it up to 2kV.

00:39:11.556 --> 00:39:12.556
Stop!

00:40:11.986 --> 00:40:13.486
You are my father.

00:40:15.185 --> 00:40:16.486
You're just like me.

00:40:17.256 --> 00:40:18.895
A monster.

00:40:21.765 --> 00:40:23.565
You must know about the experiments Pavlov conducted.

00:40:24.435 --> 00:40:26.835
He rang the bell every time he fed his dogs.

00:40:26.906 --> 00:40:29.935
Later on. the dogs started salivating at the sound of the bell.

00:40:30.176 --> 00:40:32.935
Most people know that story.

00:40:33.346 --> 00:40:35.745
But what people don't know is that he had taps drilled...

00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:38.815
into the sides of the dogs' mouths so the saliva could be collected.

00:40:39.815 --> 00:40:41.245
And even if people knew.

00:40:41.315 --> 00:40:44.415
no one would call Pavlov a monster.

00:40:58.866 --> 00:41:01.605
Those poor animals have rashes all over.

00:41:01.665 --> 00:41:03.265
and some even go blind.

00:41:03.736 --> 00:41:06.036
But they're never given any antibiotics...

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:09.475
or painkillers until they die.

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:12.176
Because they need to see the effects of the tests.

00:41:12.245 --> 00:41:15.846
I don't think we humans have the right to do that to animals.

00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:19.415
We may have no such right. but we have the power to do it.

00:41:51.056 --> 00:41:52.185
What are you doing?

00:41:52.585 --> 00:41:55.185
Well... The pictures from before.

00:41:55.855 --> 00:41:57.256
I sent them to you too.

00:42:02.866 --> 00:42:03.866
What?

00:42:15.846 --> 00:42:16.846
I saw them.

00:42:17.276 --> 00:42:19.515
- I sent them to Gu Reum too. - What did she say?

00:42:19.576 --> 00:42:21.415
What else? She says to report her.

00:42:21.486 --> 00:42:25.116
I knew it. We taught her right.

00:42:25.355 --> 00:42:27.526
Someone from Violent Crimes should have guts like that.

00:42:27.585 --> 00:42:29.926
Will she be the only one being investigated?

00:42:30.196 --> 00:42:32.256
It's our case. We'll all be investigated.

00:42:33.466 --> 00:42:34.795
Why is this our case?

00:42:34.866 --> 00:42:36.395
Not that. Zi O.

00:42:40.036 --> 00:42:42.105
Darn it. Captain.

00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:45.006
Why couldn't you persuade her? Now we'll be dragged in too.

We have no choice.

00:42:54.245 --> 00:42:56.486
Wait. Yes. we do.

00:42:57.185 --> 00:42:58.286
Think about it.

00:42:58.685 --> 00:43:01.685

00:43:02.056 --> 00:43:04.725

00:43:12.335 --> 00:43:14.105
Of course. we should.

00:43:14.506 --> 00:43:16.975
No. We know how it is.

00:43:17.036 --> 00:43:18.975
Nothing is tougher than keeping your mouth shut.

00:43:19.036 --> 00:43:20.705

00:43:23.145 --> 00:43:24.815
You just have to be careful.

00:43:26.176 --> 00:43:27.915
Then delete all of those pictures.

00:43:28.346 --> 00:43:29.786
Okay. I'll delete them.

00:43:30.355 --> 00:43:31.355

00:43:31.415 --> 00:43:32.986

00:43:45.065 --> 00:43:46.395
Thank you.

You don't know what they look like or the license plate number right?

00:43:50.306 --> 00:43:54.276
It was the same people from the subway station.

00:43:55.045 --> 00:43:56.076
What?

00:43:57.045 --> 00:44:00.486
I looked up the car. but it was unregistered.

00:44:01.346 --> 00:44:04.486
Those punks. They're pros.

00:44:04.556 --> 00:44:07.926
They're pros and I feel like they're a part of an organization.

00:44:08.486 --> 00:44:11.156
I think they hacked my engine control unit...

00:44:11.196 --> 00:44:13.426
and made my car stop.

00:44:14.395 --> 00:44:16.395
I kind of want this case.

00:44:17.065 --> 00:44:19.335
- There's something there. - Right?

00:44:19.395 --> 00:44:21.306
I told you it was strange from the get-go.

00:44:22.406 --> 00:44:23.806
Want to join me?

00:44:23.906 --> 00:44:26.406

Can you keep a secret?

It's a secret investigation because it's a secret.

00:44:47.895 --> 00:44:50.895
You can't tell anyone. not even Captain.

00:44:50.966 --> 00:44:52.596
Okay. fine.

but there was insufficient evidence no law on the matter.

00:47:17.676 --> 00:47:20.846

(Electricity costs)

00:51:29.268 --> 00:51:30.878
This is the electricity bill.

00:51:32.038 --> 00:51:34.779
How large a building would consume this much power?

00:51:34.848 --> 00:51:36.848
This is quite high.

00:51:36.909 --> 00:51:38.648
If it's a single building.

00:51:38.719 --> 00:51:40.648
I'd say about 20 to 30 stories.

00:51:40.719 --> 00:51:43.018
What if it's 2 buildings. 2-stories each?

00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:45.889
It must have an underground refrigerator or something.

00:51:46.418 --> 00:51:48.558
It's possible if it's a meat processing company.

00:51:49.128 --> 00:51:51.458
I can give you details if you submit a request.

00:51:52.498 --> 00:51:54.799
It's okay. That's plenty.

00:51:55.569 --> 00:51:56.598
Thank you.

00:52:02.639 --> 00:52:03.739
What about security?

00:52:03.808 --> 00:52:05.208
We called in everyone...

00:52:05.279 --> 00:52:06.878
and stationed them throughout inside.

00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:08.478
This is the last day.

00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:10.609
If he explodes just before he dies. we're finished.

00:52:11.148 --> 00:52:13.478
We must subdue him early on. You may kill him.

00:52:14.078 --> 00:52:15.348
Just one more day. okay?

00:52:16.819 --> 00:52:17.889
Sir.

00:52:19.518 --> 00:52:21.228
Are we really killing Z-0 today?

00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:22.989
Yes.

00:52:23.058 --> 00:52:24.958
What about what you promised me?

00:52:25.159 --> 00:52:27.199
Promise? What promise?

00:52:28.168 --> 00:52:30.069
That you'd give me his arm.

00:52:31.239 --> 00:52:32.268
I did?

00:52:35.538 --> 00:52:36.808
That's right.

00:52:38.938 --> 00:52:40.538
I'll talk to the director.

00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:42.449
Will just talking to him make it happen?

00:52:42.708 --> 00:52:43.748
I'm sure it will.

00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:47.348
Just do your job right today.

00:53:00.699 --> 00:53:01.828
Do it.

00:53:03.429 --> 00:53:04.839
Take it all the way.

00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:07.268
I'm done.

00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:11.078
I extracted the LUCA cells.

00:53:11.478 --> 00:53:14.909
We created embryos of your clones.

00:53:16.308 --> 00:53:18.679
We'll breed them properly...

00:53:19.018 --> 00:53:20.648
so they don't end up like you.

00:53:21.188 --> 00:53:23.089
I was wrong.

00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:28.558
If people like you are humans.

00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:33.228
then I should've lived as a monster.

00:53:36.469 --> 00:53:37.998
You'll die today.

00:53:39.139 --> 00:53:42.308
With one injection. you'll go painlessly to paradise.

00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:43.969
Try and kill me.

00:53:45.609 --> 00:53:46.779
I won't die.

00:53:49.148 --> 00:53:50.648
I'll stay alive...

00:53:51.748 --> 00:53:53.679
and kill you all.

00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:56.619
Nice.

00:53:58.259 --> 00:53:59.319
I like that.

00:54:00.389 --> 00:54:02.429
- We're ready. - Okay.

00:54:19.978 --> 00:54:21.348
We took only the best cells...

00:54:21.409 --> 00:54:23.378
and created only the best embryos.

00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:26.418
In two weeks. once we implant them into the surrogates. it'll be over.

00:54:27.788 --> 00:54:29.288
You mean. that's when it'll start.

00:54:30.188 --> 00:54:32.659
What about him? Are we killing him today?

00:54:33.319 --> 00:54:35.728
We extracted everything we need. He's useless to us.

00:54:35.828 --> 00:54:38.159
He's too difficult to deal with. so we should discard him.

00:54:42.998 --> 00:54:46.299
The more I look at him. the more I see he has my eyes.

00:54:58.549 --> 00:55:01.248
Hello. We meet again.

00:55:01.819 --> 00:55:02.989
What is it this time?

00:55:04.219 --> 00:55:05.319
Is this everything?

00:55:07.018 --> 00:55:08.029
Pardon?

00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:10.359
Is it just the first and second floors?

00:55:11.659 --> 00:55:14.199
- Why do you ask? - I'm going to look around.

00:55:18.139 --> 00:55:19.699
What is it?

00:55:20.139 --> 00:55:21.339
Do you have a warrant?

00:55:22.009 --> 00:55:23.739
Do you have a freezer?

00:55:27.748 --> 00:55:28.748
Pardon?

00:55:32.978 --> 00:55:34.619
This building's electricity bill is similar...

00:55:34.648 --> 00:55:36.648
to that of a 20 to 30 story building.

00:55:37.449 --> 00:55:39.489
At this size and with so few employees.

00:55:40.058 --> 00:55:41.828
how is that possible?

00:55:44.288 --> 00:55:45.558
Do you have a warrant?

00:55:50.228 --> 00:55:52.139
They're bringing it now.

00:55:52.538 --> 00:55:54.668
All 17 members of my team are rushing here now.

00:55:55.909 --> 00:55:57.708
- I need to go home... - Take me to the basement.

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:00.839
Let me meet the person in charge.

00:56:04.348 --> 00:56:05.848
We have no basement.

00:56:07.018 --> 00:56:08.089
Look around if you want.

00:56:11.518 --> 00:56:13.458
Your eyes look scared.

00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:17.058
Okay. I'll find it myself.

00:56:25.969 --> 00:56:28.308
It won't hurt since it's very strong.

00:56:38.848 --> 00:56:39.949
Okay.

00:56:42.449 --> 00:56:43.648
I've got you.

00:56:50.759 --> 00:56:51.828
You jerk.

00:56:55.268 --> 00:56:56.299
Talk.

00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:58.239
Where's the door to the basement?

00:56:59.668 --> 00:57:00.739
You rat.

00:57:02.409 --> 00:57:04.369
Talk. or you die.

00:57:04.438 --> 00:57:05.538
Tell me.

00:57:08.478 --> 00:57:09.609
Tell me!

00:57:10.478 --> 00:57:11.549
You rat.

00:57:16.848 --> 00:57:17.989
I'll do it.

00:57:19.188 --> 00:57:20.188
No. sir.

00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:22.728
He's my son.

00:57:24.828 --> 00:57:26.299
If anyone kills him. it'll be me.

00:57:28.699 --> 00:57:30.398
Let me say goodbye.

00:57:31.098 --> 00:57:32.168
Yes. sir.

00:57:33.639 --> 00:57:34.938
They're waiting outside.

00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:37.038
Dispose of him right away.

00:58:07.038 --> 00:58:09.808
I was born with seven fingers.

00:58:10.239 --> 00:58:12.779
I was teased a lot ever since I was a child.

00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:15.909
I got surgery and had them removed when I was in middle school.

00:58:18.049 --> 00:58:19.978
but my hand became paralyzed as a result.

00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:24.719
I had seven perfectly fine fingers. which only a very few people...

00:58:25.688 --> 00:58:28.128
in the entire world had.

00:58:28.889 --> 00:58:32.128
But just because it was different from others.

00:58:32.199 --> 00:58:34.328
I forfeited my superiority.

00:58:43.569 --> 00:58:46.609
I know how difficult a life you've had.

00:58:47.878 --> 00:58:48.909
However.

00:58:50.449 --> 00:58:52.219
pain wasn't holding onto you.

00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:55.788
You were latching onto pain. Just like I did.

00:58:58.688 --> 00:59:00.288
You're superior to everyone.

00:59:00.688 --> 00:59:01.688
You...

00:59:02.628 --> 00:59:05.299
are proof that I was superior.

00:59:05.828 --> 00:59:07.799
Stop babbling and kill me.

00:59:08.529 --> 00:59:10.699
Why do you try to take the easy route?

00:59:11.128 --> 00:59:12.668
Don't you have any reason to live?

00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:17.369
If I don't die.

00:59:18.409 --> 00:59:20.739
- I'll go to you. - What are you talking about?

00:59:20.839 --> 00:59:22.409
I'll stay alive and find you.

00:59:23.078 --> 00:59:25.648
Even if I don't remember you. I'll still find you.

00:59:29.148 --> 00:59:30.219
Live.

00:59:32.188 --> 00:59:33.458
You must live.

00:59:34.628 --> 00:59:35.788
Live...

00:59:36.728 --> 00:59:38.558
and find the answer to that question.

00:59:41.898 --> 00:59:44.498
The elevator is at the end of the hall on the right.

00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:48.109
Run away.

01:00:30.078 --> 01:00:31.348
Who are you?

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.619
Who are you?

01:00:35.449 --> 01:00:36.719
Who are you?

01:00:42.089 --> 01:00:43.188
I'm your father.

01:00:45.498 --> 01:00:46.859
You're my son.

01:00:49.929 --> 01:00:51.438
Goodbye. Zi O.

01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:33.179
What is this?

01:01:34.978 --> 01:01:36.808
This is your land of endless torment.

01:01:40.418 --> 01:01:41.449
Get her!

01:02:14.179 --> 01:02:15.688
Good work.

01:02:17.148 --> 01:02:18.788
Act One is finally over.

01:02:19.089 --> 01:02:20.518
Please do your best in Act Two as well.

01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:21.759
Thank you.

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:23.989
Did he...

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:25.859
die?

01:02:28.898 --> 01:02:31.799
A regular person would've died instantly. but for him.

01:02:33.098 --> 01:02:34.938
it'll take about a minute.

01:02:35.409 --> 01:02:37.909
Gosh. I feel kind of sad.

01:02:39.679 --> 01:02:41.078
I'm his mom after all.

01:03:11.578 --> 01:03:13.978
What's this? What's going on?

01:03:14.279 --> 01:03:15.348
Call them!

01:03:33.699 --> 01:03:34.728
What is that?

01:04:01.759 --> 01:04:02.828
Take them outside.

01:04:03.159 --> 01:04:04.228
This way.

01:05:21.438 --> 01:05:22.438
Hey.

01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:25.208
Leave your arm.

01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:28.248
That arm is mine!

01:06:00.279 --> 01:06:01.409
Where's Ryu Jeung Kwon?

01:06:01.478 --> 01:06:02.708
I don't know.

01:07:10.048 --> 01:07:11.508
Ryu Jeung Kwon!

01:07:44.209 --> 01:07:46.218
(L.U.C.A.: The Beginning)

01:07:46.718 --> 01:07:48.548
Catch him quickly. He's a murderer.

01:07:48.619 --> 01:07:50.518
Doesn't it seem like the media is guiding the investigation?

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.888
So? Will you do as the media says?

01:07:53.088 --> 01:07:54.959
I'll tie up the loose ends.

01:07:55.188 --> 01:07:56.428
Work for me from now on.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.999
I'll give you something you want.

01:07:59.058 --> 01:08:02.029
Human Tech wasn't the target. Ryu Jeung Kwon was.

01:08:02.098 --> 01:08:03.669
Name. Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum.

01:08:03.728 --> 01:08:05.569
The police disclosed a photo...

01:08:07.398 --> 01:08:08.808
Are you looking for Z-0?

01:08:08.869 --> 01:08:10.468
I'll kill them.

01:08:11.909 --> 01:08:13.138
Please help me.
