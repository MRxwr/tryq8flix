[gentle haunting music]

[man speaks indistinctly]

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:50.066
- And?
- It's the storyteller.

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:54.331
- So. I'm at this uh. total
hole in the wall. right?

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:56.594
With uh some. some
trash band playing.

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.814
that I don't know.
disappeared after the 90s.

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:01.512
I don't even know
what someone like Gia

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.125
was doing at a show like
this. but. there she was

00:02:05.212 --> 00:02:08.258
standing in the middle
of this giant mosh pit.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:09.129
- I have no idea.

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:14.351
- So I remember looking
down at her thinking.

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:15.700
"Who is this chick?"

00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:18.573
Right? Total girl of my dreams.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.010
And then. the music
starts playing. Right?

00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:24.013
And all these dudes.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.362
mohawks. tattoos.
[phone buzzing]

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.930
I mean. I. I was afraid of 'em.

00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:30.585
They start to jump in
all over the place and.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.937
and. and. like. doing
their mosh thing. right?

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:37.505
So. so I figured. well. why not?

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:41.552
I uh. wrapped one leg
around Gia's foot.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.901
Boom. Down she goes.

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:44.947
[group chuckles]
- No.

00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:46.253
- [Shane] Yeah. her
sandal goes flying

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.819
halfway across the room.

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:49.473
- Oh. I felt like the whole
room was looking at me.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.216
I wanted to stand up. but I
sprained my ankle in the fall.

00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:57.699
So. Shane here spends the
whole night apologizing to me

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:00.528
in the ER. and then went back
to the club to find my shoe.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.619
- That kinda sounds
like Cinderella.

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:06.360
Oh.

00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:10.190
- I knocked her down and then
um. she became my wife. Huh?

00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:11.887
- That's better than
knocking her up.

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:12.757
- Sweetheart.

00:03:14.672 --> 00:03:17.588
To the most perfect
couple we know.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:19.068
- Oh. cheers.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:20.025
- We are absolutely
thrilled to be here

00:03:20.112 --> 00:03:21.940
to celebrate with you two.

00:03:22.027 --> 00:03:25.683
To 13 years. and
many. many more.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.208
- Thank you. my dear.
- Thank you. [glasses clink]

00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:30.906
[Gia coughing]

[gentle piano music]

00:04:09.118 --> 00:04:10.075
- Sorry I'm late.

00:04:10.162 --> 00:04:11.425
- Oh. hey pal.

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:12.991
Hi.

00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:13.818
- [Isaac] Great to see
you. congratulations.

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:14.906
- Thank you.

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.474
Oh. perfect.

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.259
- Look at that. Uh.
I gotta catch up.

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:21.913
So I'll take a. I'll take a
double bourbon neat. please.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.784
- Wow. Look at that.

00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.264
- [Isaac] Yeah.

00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.961
- [Beverly] You're not
gonna eat anything?

00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:27.049
- Uh no. I'm probably just
gonna get something on the road.

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:28.746
I won't stay long.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.358
Unfortunately. it's uh. it's
it's been one of those days.

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.924
- Do I even wanna know?

00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:34.317
- [Isaac] No. but I'm
gonna tell ya anyways.

00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:35.840
- Course you are.
- Mm.

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:37.625
- Um. unfortunately.
all of our exit signs.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.409
looks like they
were hung backwards.

00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:41.498
So we're gonna be delayed
at least another week. Sam.

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.195
- [Shane] Oh. dammit.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.414
That's the new contractor?

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.981
- [Isaac] Yeah. that's the one.

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:48.200
- [Shane] [sighs] Did
you bring the papers?

00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:51.378
- I knew I forgot something.

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.554
I'm. sorry pal. Um. when.
when are you guys leaving?

00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:55.120
- [Shane] Early.
Just email them.

00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:56.470
- Done.

00:04:56.557 --> 00:04:59.211
- Uh-huh. No more
shop talk. guys.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.736
This is a celebration. okay?

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.346
Right. Gia? Come on.

00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:05.783
- Forgive me.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.132
You know what? You
guys are right.

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.265
This is a celebration
to you two.

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:10.135
- Aw.
- Yeah.

00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:11.876
Happy anniversary.

00:05:11.963 --> 00:05:13.008
- [Shane] Thank you.

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:14.096
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.103
- Look at that. See Isaac.
that's all you need.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.412
You gotta find yourself a good
woman and just settle down.

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.632
- Right. You know. Beverly.
where are my manners?

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.201
But unfortunately. I only
have eyes for one woman.

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:34.464
And sadly. she's taken.

00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:37.162
[Beverly laughs]

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:38.207
I love ya. Sam.
- Okay.

00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:39.600
- You've got a beautiful wife.

00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:41.123
- Okay. Thank you.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.080
- [Shane] Oh. you are
smooth. aren't you?

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.081
- He is very smooth.

00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:45.170
Listen. seriously.

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:47.521
I am making sure that you
are not going to be bothered

00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:52.482
with any business-related
fiascos while you're gone.

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.356
- But. don't forget. it's gonna
be a mess when you get back.

00:05:56.443 --> 00:05:57.922
So. get some rest.

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.447
- [Beverly] [laughs]
Yeah. lots of rest.

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:05.365
[cars humming]

00:06:18.247 --> 00:06:19.335
- Why'd you come?

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:23.731
[Isaac sighs]

00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:25.210
- I was invited.

00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:26.516
- What if Shane had
seen you texting me?

00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:27.387
- Let him.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:32.392
- We can't do this
anymore. I told you this.

00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:36.265
- You haven't even
opened it yet.

00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:37.614
When are you gonna tell him?

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.399
- That's not your problem.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.228
- You've made it my problem.

00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:45.230
- Well. he's my husband.

00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:47.015
- Of course he is.

00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:48.451
- Then there's
nothing else to say.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.459
[Gia breathes deeply]

00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:57.242
- If you need me.

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:58.374
- I don't.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:02.639
- You did.

00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:23.355
[birds chirping]

00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:37.761
- Hello.

00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:39.154
- Mr. and Mrs. Gallo?

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:40.808
- Yes. that's us.
You must be Helen.

00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:42.026
- I am. Yes. sir.

00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:43.071
Come right on in.

00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:43.854
- Hey. go ahead babe.

00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:44.812
- [Gia] Oh.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.383
- This house has been showcased

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.996
in all the best Southern
Living magazines.

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.739
My late husband put a
lotta pride in this home.

00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:00.175
He designed it himself.

00:08:00.262 --> 00:08:02.917
A sort of utopia.
he liked to call it.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.573
The stubborn thing.
he built it by hand.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.055
So. it was several years
before we could call it a home.

00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:14.189
- Sounds like a lot of
blood. sweat. and tears.

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:16.496
- Mostly sweat. [laughs]

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.280
There was some blood.

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:20.282
The tears were all mine.

00:08:21.892 --> 00:08:24.329
[chuckles] You'll be
staying in the master suite.

00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:25.417
- Oh great.

00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:27.507
Go ahead. hun.

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.947
- [Helen] Now. I
wouldn't be a good host

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:35.776
if I didn't tell you
about the ghost matter.

00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:37.473
- Ghost?

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.911
- Decades before there were
any houses built on this lake.

00:08:40.998 --> 00:08:44.785
the land was owned by a Dr.
Arnold and his wife Devorah.

00:08:44.872 --> 00:08:46.874
They built a huge estate here.

00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.658
And this is where they
spent their summers.

00:08:48.745 --> 00:08:50.094
[tense music]

00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:51.443
[cell phone buzzes]
Elaborate parties.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.010
all the rage.

00:08:53.097 --> 00:08:55.186
And this went sour.

00:08:55.273 --> 00:08:57.319
She found out that Dr.
Arnold and her sister

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.756
were gettin' all cozy.

00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:03.020
The poor soul lost her mind.

00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:05.936
She shot him. strung
him up in the attic.

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:08.025
and burned the
place to the ground.

00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:13.770
This house was built on
that original structure.

00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:17.818
- Okay. So we're staying
on a haunted lake.

00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:20.777
- Oh. I can assure you
that if any of the spirits

00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:22.344
do come out of hiding.

00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:25.521
that Dr. Arnold is the
perfect Southern gentleman.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.742
But Devorah. not so much.

00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:32.746
But she's a woman scorned.
so we don't like to judge.

00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:35.618
- What happened to her sister?

00:09:36.488 --> 00:09:37.359
- Good question.

00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:40.492
I guess you'll have
to ask Devorah.

00:09:43.887 --> 00:09:46.411
Now. if you need anything.
and I mean anything.

00:09:46.498 --> 00:09:47.935
don't hesitate to
knock on my door.

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:50.198
I'm just downstairs
off the living room.

00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:51.547
- Thank you. Helen.

00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:53.418
I'm sure everything
will be perfect.

00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:54.898
- Uh. you're staying here too?

00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:56.552
- Oh yes.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.902
I have my own suite with
a kitchen and a bathroom.

00:09:58.989 --> 00:10:01.339
So. you won't hear me.

00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:03.167
I'll be like a nun in compline.

00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:07.737
- Well um. like I
said. thank you. Helen.

00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:10.871
I'm sure everything will be
just perfect. Right. babe?

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.048
- [Helen] Well if this storm
holds off. I'll believe it.

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:16.224
- Is there a storm coming?

00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:17.355
- I just say what I hear.

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:22.578
- Who knows? Maybe we'll
get lucky. [chuckles]

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:24.319
- [Helen] I like
the way you think.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.539
- Hey. thanks Helen. again.

00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:31.935
Babe. that was crazy. huh?

00:10:32.022 --> 00:10:33.415
- Did you know she
was gonna be here too?

00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:35.809
- Ah. no. I must've missed that.

00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:38.028
Oh. she's not gonna
get in the way.

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:38.855
Plus.

00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:43.251
when she hears how loud you get.

00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:44.121
[Gia laughs]

00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:44.948
When I...

00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:48.299
[Shane moans]
- Oh. stop.

00:10:48.386 --> 00:10:49.300
- Baby.
- That's not me.

00:10:49.387 --> 00:10:50.258
Oh.

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.738
- Oh. there's only you.

00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:55.176
- Mm. You must be talking
about somebody else.

00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:56.873
- No. There's only you.

00:10:58.701 --> 00:10:59.702

00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:58.349
- Not now?

00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.655
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:01.788
Mm.

00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:09.796
Just uh. trying to find
something positive.

00:24:11.798 --> 00:24:16.411
- Well. not everything works
out the way we expect it to

00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:17.456
all the time. you know?

00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:22.112
- What does that mean?

00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:23.549
- Well. you know. I mean.

00:24:23.636 --> 00:24:25.246
things don't
magically get better

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:28.989
just because you're so good at
pretending everything's okay.

00:24:31.295 --> 00:24:32.209
- Well [clears throat].

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.909
be nice to at least get a
little credit for trying.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.050
I wish you'd just
talk to me. you know?

00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:48.487
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:53.666
- Um.

00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:57.452
Do you ever think of her?

00:24:59.323 --> 00:25:00.063
- Who?

00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:06.113
- I mean [sighs]. did she do
things that I wouldn't do?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.332
Is. is that. is that
why you [sighs].

00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:10.247
why you did it in
the first place?

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.424
- This is what's going?

00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:16.340
Have you been waiting for
the worst possible moment

00:25:16.427 --> 00:25:18.429
to bring this up. huh?

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:21.041
- You just asked me
what I was thinking.

00:25:21.128 --> 00:25:22.477
And then you belittle me for it.

00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:24.523
- Who's belittling you?

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.048
- [Gia] Why can't you just
answer the question. Shane?

00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:31.530
- Nothing happened. Okay?

00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:36.230
- You know. there's. there's
consequences for your actions.

00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:38.319
And when you're
with someone else--

00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:42.236
- Yeah. and I told you a
hundred times. nothing happened.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.284
- Why can't you just tell me
the truth so we can move on?

00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:49.809
- You know. I'm not gonna. I'm
not gonna admit to something.

00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:51.811
Gia. that's all in your head.

00:25:51.898 --> 00:25:53.160
- All in my head?

00:25:53.247 --> 00:25:54.901
It's all in my
head. and I'm crazy?

00:25:54.988 --> 00:25:56.555
I'm making all of this up?

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.035
Were there others. Shane?

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.211
- This is unbelievable.

00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:04.388
I. I don't believe this.

00:26:06.477 --> 00:26:07.522
- Were there others. Shane?

00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:08.523
- Oh.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.393
- Shane.

00:26:17.314 --> 00:26:20.274
[slow somber music]

00:26:44.037 --> 00:26:47.388
[generated clapping]

00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:50.217
- Take you on a journey to
the small but charming town

00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:52.741
of York. South Carolina.

00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:56.919
where the souls of the
dead still seek their rest.

00:26:57.006 --> 00:26:59.922
Join us. as we wander
through the haunted hallways

00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:02.098
and eerie streets on
another episode of.

00:27:03.709 --> 00:27:06.363
And then that's when boom.
cue carnival-type music.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.887
We got the strobe
light effect coming on.

00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:09.236
the title blow on the screen.

00:27:09.323 --> 00:27:10.933
It's gonna be the whole thing.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.892
Mom. get that. make
that mirror disappear.

00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:14.415
So what do guys think?

00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:15.372
- [Shane] Wow.

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:16.722
- Huh? Eh. huh?
- Okay.

00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:19.420
[Shane chuckles]

00:27:19.507 --> 00:27:21.422
- You asked what I did.

00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:24.251
- Which. which. so.
so you're like a--

00:27:24.338 --> 00:27:25.556
- Paranormal investigator.

00:27:26.732 --> 00:27:28.298
I have a show.

00:27:28.385 --> 00:27:29.996
[Shane laughs]

00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.780
- On TV?

00:27:31.867 --> 00:27:34.478
- [Jedi] Well. it's on the web.
but the fan base is growing.

00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.264
- You know. Gia's an actress.

00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:38.178
- [Jedi] Ah.

00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:39.483
- You're an actress?

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:40.397
- It's really.
it's just a hobby.

00:27:40.484 --> 00:27:41.398
- Oh. come on. honey.

00:27:41.485 --> 00:27:42.530
Go ahead and tell 'em

00:27:42.617 --> 00:27:43.531
what you've been in.
- No.

00:27:43.618 --> 00:27:45.620
[scary swishing]

00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:46.490
Stop it.

00:27:46.577 --> 00:27:47.622
- But I'm no actor.

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:49.232
It's just me.

00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:53.672
- So you just. you
know. chase ghosts?

00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:55.674
- I prefer the term.
contacting the dead.

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:01.462
I'm serious. if I got a drink
for every skeptic I met.

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:02.942
[Jedi whistles]

00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:04.770
- Listen. I. you know I
just like to believe in

00:28:04.857 --> 00:28:06.510
what's in front of me.

00:28:06.597 --> 00:28:08.469
- Just because you can't see
something in front of you

00:28:08.556 --> 00:28:10.079
doesn't mean it's not there.

00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:11.690
- Come on.

00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:13.996
I mean. there's no audience
now. right? It's just us.

00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:16.912
You. you can honestly
look me in the eye

00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:19.523
and tell me that you've
caught something supernatural?

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.657
- Hey Shane. guess what? I've
caught something supernatural.

00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:24.790
- Have you ever
seen anything here?

00:28:24.877 --> 00:28:27.401
- Are you kidding me?
Growing up by the lake?

00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:29.664
The water's like a catalyst
for the paranormal.

00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:31.884
I. I. you never know
what's gonna show up.

00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:34.625
- So why do you do it if
you're gonna get hurt?

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.802
- The possibility
of the unknown.

00:28:36.889 --> 00:28:38.412
You know. there's an
energy all around us.

00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:39.369
even though we can't see it.

00:28:40.414 --> 00:28:41.850
You know. lessons we could learn

00:28:41.937 --> 00:28:44.548
from people who've lived
and died way before us.

00:28:44.635 --> 00:28:46.725
an insight on places
way beyond this realm.

00:28:49.379 --> 00:28:50.772
- I don't know.

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:52.295
I think you need to leave
the past in the past.

00:28:52.382 --> 00:28:55.211
You know. just don't
mess with that stuff.

00:28:55.298 --> 00:28:58.214
- [Jedi] Perhaps. maybe.
Maybe. perhaps. anyway.

00:28:59.868 --> 00:29:03.132
For me though. it's
the closest I can get

00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:07.397
to feeling something bigger
than my own existence.

00:29:09.182 --> 00:29:12.751
[gentle mysterious music]

00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:24.763
[scary booming]

00:29:26.068 --> 00:29:27.635
- What are you doing?

00:29:27.722 --> 00:29:30.943
- Reducing my life
span by 11 minutes.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.727
Maybe yours by six.

00:29:34.424 --> 00:29:36.078
- You can't smoke in this house.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.602
- What the hell?

00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.389
- I didn't need
you to come here.

00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:43.782
- Right.

00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:45.566
- How do you think
this is helping?

00:29:45.653 --> 00:29:48.961
- Oh. Gia and Shane
lived happily ever after.

00:29:49.048 --> 00:29:49.788
The end.

00:29:51.224 --> 00:29:54.227
- I'm not gonna play
your sick little games.

00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:58.231
- Hm. what's the
matter. baby girl?

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.758
Did he hurt you?

00:30:03.845 --> 00:30:06.369
Oh. there it is.

00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:10.809
That ocean of insecurity
you wear behind your eyes.

00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:14.638
Ready to drown you every time
someone speaks the truth.

00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:17.293
- I need you to leave.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.686
- Mm.

00:30:18.773 --> 00:30:21.036
- I need you just to go.

00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:23.778
- Hell no. we aren't finished.

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:27.782
[deep somber music]

00:30:36.747 --> 00:30:38.575
I warned you about
letting them in.

00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:42.449
[deep somber music]

00:30:46.322 --> 00:30:48.847
[Gia gasping]

00:30:56.637 --> 00:30:59.596
[deep somber music]

00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:06.821
[bandage ripping]

00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:12.044
[Gia gasps lightly]

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:15.612
[scary swishing]

00:31:15.699 --> 00:31:19.312
[tense suspenseful music]

00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:39.723
- Hey.
[Gia gasps]

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.856
Sh. sh. sh. It's just
me. it's just me.

00:31:41.943 --> 00:31:42.857
- [Shane] Geez. All right. man.

00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:45.207
What the hell? Are you okay?

00:31:45.294 --> 00:31:46.817
- Yeah. I'm. I'm. I'm good.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:47.775
Uh. you know.

00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:50.604
Hey. you didn't
tell me this place

00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:52.562
was all the way out in
the country. [laughs]

00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:55.391
I mean. god. I have some papers
that Sam needs you to sign.

00:31:55.478 --> 00:31:58.655
And uh. you know. I. I.
I hit some black ice.

00:31:58.742 --> 00:31:59.830
car slid right into a tree.

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.267
- Jesus.

00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:02.224
- I. I. I tried to send
'em to you via email.

00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:03.704
but I couldn't get a signal.

00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:05.575
I mean. wifi was spotty.
Must've been the storm.

00:32:05.662 --> 00:32:07.142
- Yeah.

00:32:07.229 --> 00:32:09.101
And this client. man.
every step of the way.

00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:11.277
Uh. where's the car now?

00:32:11.364 --> 00:32:14.584
- I mean. god only knows. bud.

00:32:14.671 --> 00:32:15.672
I had to walk the
rest of the way.

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:17.500
I don't know. half a mile.

00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:18.719
- Jesus.

00:32:18.806 --> 00:32:19.676
- We're just glad you're okay.

00:32:19.763 --> 00:32:20.895
- Yeah. 'member you wanted me

00:32:20.982 --> 00:32:22.679
to go back out in that earlier.

00:32:24.464 --> 00:32:26.422
- Looks like we're gonna
have a full house tonight.

00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:27.858
- No. no. no. please.

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:30.426
I. I. I couldn't
impose any. I insist.

00:32:30.513 --> 00:32:32.994
- Uh. well. I'm sure Mr.
and Mrs. Gallo won't mind.

00:32:33.081 --> 00:32:34.909
- Yes. we insist.
- I mean--

00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:36.084
- We're not gonna let
you get back out in that.

00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:37.781
You're here now.

00:32:37.868 --> 00:32:41.133
- And. even if not. I mean.
you're way out in the country.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.527
as you say. and I'm sure
Jedediah has some clothes

00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:45.572
that you could wear.

00:32:46.747 --> 00:32:48.357
Nobody's goin' anywhere tonight.

00:32:52.144 --> 00:32:53.841
- Welcome.

00:32:53.928 --> 00:32:54.885
- He's a. he's a
little weird. [laughs]

00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:56.844
- Yeah. you said it.

00:32:59.412 --> 00:33:00.891
- You look great. Gia.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:01.675
- Thank you.

00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:02.589
- Doesn't she?

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.070
- Shane.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.990
[Shane sighs]

00:33:12.077 --> 00:33:13.339
We shouldn't have come here.

00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:15.819
- Can you just take a breath?

00:33:15.906 --> 00:33:16.690
[zipper scratches]

00:33:16.777 --> 00:33:17.604
- We need to leave.

00:33:22.087 --> 00:33:23.784
Are you listening to me. Shane?

00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:26.526
- Yes. yes. I heard you.
- I just. I just wanna leave.

00:33:26.613 --> 00:33:28.223
I just wanna go home.

00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:30.878
- Gia.

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.885
Why don't you just
talk to me. huh?

00:33:38.886 --> 00:33:40.105
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:43.804
[gentle music]

00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:44.848
I'm sorry.

00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:47.373
[gentle music]

00:33:48.939 --> 00:33:49.984
I am.

00:33:50.071 --> 00:33:52.639
[gentle music]

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.688
Do you remember

00:34:01.387 --> 00:34:03.519
when I first gave you this?

00:34:06.522 --> 00:34:07.262
- Yes.

00:34:10.135 --> 00:34:14.878
- Do you know that I
never ever regret it?

00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:18.360
- No?

00:34:20.928 --> 00:34:22.408
Not once?

00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:24.018
- No.

00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:26.325
[Gia laughs]

00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:29.067
- Well.

00:34:30.677 --> 00:34:35.377
I would think after
13 years of marriage.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.253
that you'd find some way
to be honest with me.

00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:45.779
[deep somber music]

00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:04.145
- Pre-wedding jitters?

00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:07.844
- Is what it's called?

00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:13.111
- Well. it's natural to feel
nervous or unsure of yourself

00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:15.635
when you're about to make
a major life decision.

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:19.856
- I just don't wanna
disappoint him.

00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:24.034
- [Dr. Marcum] What makes you
think you'll disappoint him?

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.733
- I'm afraid I won't
be who I need to be.

00:35:28.343 --> 00:35:29.779
- Who do you need to be?

00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:34.610
- The person he
fell in love with?

00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:37.135
- Describe her to me.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.487
- I mean. just Gia.

00:35:43.489 --> 00:35:47.014
She's happy. optimistic.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.061
Just the right
amount of confidence.

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.367
but not too self-assured.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.632
She has enough vulnerability
to let him know

00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:58.025
that she still needs him.

00:36:00.332 --> 00:36:03.030
- You refer to Gia
in a third person.

00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:10.037
It almost sounds like you see
her as completely different

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.474
from yourself.

00:36:12.561 --> 00:36:13.214
- Why would I do that?

00:36:15.042 --> 00:36:18.045
- Because you're afraid to let
Shane see who you really are.

00:36:20.917 --> 00:36:23.877
- Is this version of
yourself that you present

00:36:23.964 --> 00:36:25.618
to your patients. the
real you. Dr. Marcum?

00:36:27.097 --> 00:36:31.972
Or do you change to
make us feel safe?

00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:38.587
Do you ever drop your guard
or let your flaws show?

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.808
Exactly.

00:36:41.895 --> 00:36:45.725
Because if you did. if you
would show us that you're human.

00:36:45.812 --> 00:36:46.943
maybe even a little bit crazy.

00:36:48.423 --> 00:36:50.208
then you'd just be
like the rest of us.

00:36:50.295 --> 00:36:51.644
and we wouldn't trust you.

00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:57.954
- Do you think that this
version will sustain itself

00:36:58.041 --> 00:36:59.173
when times get tough?

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.570
- Love changes a person.

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.616
You can't love someone as
much as we love each other

00:37:07.703 --> 00:37:10.097
and not have it transform you.

00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:12.621
- Okay.

00:37:14.057 --> 00:37:15.407
- Maybe you've
never been in love.

00:37:16.886 --> 00:37:18.105
Maybe that's why
you can't understand

00:37:18.192 --> 00:37:19.976
power that it gives a person.

00:37:22.631 --> 00:37:24.242
- Or the power
that it takes away?

00:37:30.987 --> 00:37:31.771
Time's up.

00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:43.957
[knocking at door]

00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:46.481
- Can I come in?

00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:51.660
- [laughs] Of course.
You don't have to ask.

00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:07.110
- So. did you really come
to bring Shane papers?

00:38:12.986 --> 00:38:16.076
Isaac. I'm. I'm really
trying to be nice

00:38:16.163 --> 00:38:19.819
and I appreciate everything
that you've done. but--

00:38:22.082 --> 00:38:23.213
- Do you?

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.128
- Of course I do.

00:38:25.215 --> 00:38:26.608
But none of that matters now.

00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:28.610
It can't.

00:38:29.742 --> 00:38:33.093
- Hm. Did you bring it with you?

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.313
[Gia sighs]

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.141
I'm trying to help you here.
Why can't you see that?

00:38:38.228 --> 00:38:40.143
- I see what I'm meant to see.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.188
- Hm.

00:38:41.275 --> 00:38:43.973
[slow somber music]

00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:47.237
We both know he's
no good for you.

00:38:48.064 --> 00:38:48.848
But.

00:38:51.024 --> 00:38:52.504
maybe that's how you like it.

00:38:52.591 --> 00:38:55.507
- Who the hell are
you to tell me?

00:38:55.594 --> 00:38:56.899
- I'm the one to tell you

00:38:56.986 --> 00:38:58.292
that everything
that you need to see

00:38:58.379 --> 00:38:59.685
is right in front of you.

00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:02.470
You know. you say
it doesn't matter.

00:39:02.557 --> 00:39:04.472
but you brought the
envelope with you anyways.

00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:12.959
- If I open the envelope.
and no matter what's inside.

00:39:14.003 --> 00:39:15.222
you have to leave me alone.

00:39:17.224 --> 00:39:20.706
What do you hope to
get from all of this?

00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:26.189
- Gia. what I hope to
get and what I expect

00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:28.278
are two very different things.

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:32.500
- I can't.

00:39:32.587 --> 00:39:33.371
I can't.

00:39:34.894 --> 00:39:38.288
[Isaac breathes deeply]

00:39:40.856 --> 00:39:41.944
- Yeah. okay.

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:47.385
[gentle somber music]

00:39:49.169 --> 00:39:50.344
How long have I known you. Gia?

00:39:51.824 --> 00:39:53.695
- You were Shane's
friend first. Isaac.

00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:56.394
- Yeah.

00:39:59.005 --> 00:40:00.180
Just because you seem
to have forgotten

00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:01.486
what he put you through.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:06.534
doesn't mean that I can.

00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:09.015
It doesn't mean that I will.

00:40:10.582 --> 00:40:13.759
[gentle somber music]

00:40:21.201 --> 00:40:22.811
- [Gia] I have to go.

00:40:23.899 --> 00:40:26.336
[Isaac sighs]

00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:29.296
[door clicks shut]

00:40:30.253 --> 00:40:31.472
[Isaac sighs]

00:40:31.559 --> 00:40:33.779
- [Shane] Shane need Jane.

00:40:35.737 --> 00:40:38.436
[laughs] Baby. Mm.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.438
- Oh.

00:40:41.264 --> 00:40:42.788
Shane.

00:40:42.875 --> 00:40:43.571
- [Shane] Oh yeah. I think
you missed a little spot

00:40:43.658 --> 00:40:44.442
right there. and--

00:40:44.529 --> 00:40:45.355
- Okay. Okay. okay.

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.792
You gotta stop.

00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:48.228
Shane. stop.

00:40:48.315 --> 00:40:51.318
Remember. they told us
we need to wait a week.

00:40:52.928 --> 00:40:55.235
If this is gonna work.
we have to wait. Okay?

00:40:55.322 --> 00:40:56.236
We agreed to this.

00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:58.412
- No. no. no. no. You agreed.

00:40:58.499 --> 00:41:00.109
honey. just--
- No.

00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:02.721
- Why? I just don't know how
much more of this I can take.

00:41:03.678 --> 00:41:05.158
[Shane sighs heavily]

00:41:05.245 --> 00:41:05.985
- Why are you getting
so worked up about it?

00:41:06.072 --> 00:41:07.334
We agreed to this.

00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:08.291
If we want the
treatments to work--

00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:09.641
- I. I don't need some doctor

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.254
telling me how. where. and when
I can make love to my wife.

00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:16.996
- Of course. because it's
all about you. Shane.

00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:25.526
- Look.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.660
It doesn't have to be this way.

00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.010
- What do you mean?

00:41:33.795 --> 00:41:35.101
- We can explore other options.

00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:36.581
You need to see this. Sit here.

00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:40.846
Look. that could be our
child. Right there. honey.

00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:42.195
- No.
- Look at--

00:41:42.282 --> 00:41:44.371
- No. Shane. we
talked about this.

00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:45.851
- Well. I'm sorry
but that ship sailed

00:41:45.938 --> 00:41:48.462
the moment we heard
the word infertile.

00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:49.855
- Oh.

00:41:49.942 --> 00:41:52.510
[deep somber music]

00:41:52.597 --> 00:41:53.859
Oh.
- That wasn't cool.

00:41:53.946 --> 00:41:55.556
- No. No. it wasn't cool.

00:41:55.643 --> 00:41:56.905
It wasn't cool.

00:41:59.995 --> 00:42:02.432
Just. just one more time.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.260
- You think that--
- I know it's gonna work.

00:42:04.347 --> 00:42:06.001
Just. just one more--
- Oh. that's what we said

00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:09.048
last time and the time before
that and the time before that.

00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:09.962
[Gia sighs]

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:11.746
- You just wanna hurt me.

00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:14.183
- No. I don't wanna hurt you.
honey. That's the whole point.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.533
I just don't wanna sit here

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.447
and watch you hurt
yourself anymore.

00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:20.233
You have to face reality.

00:42:22.278 --> 00:42:26.065
There's. there's no
shame in that. honey.

00:42:26.152 --> 00:42:27.632
- How would you know?

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:29.111
How would you know?
You're never here.

00:42:29.198 --> 00:42:31.461
How would you know
there's no shame in that?

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.768
You don't know what I feel.
You don't know what I want.

00:42:33.855 --> 00:42:35.640
- It's just not worth it.

00:42:35.727 --> 00:42:37.685
- It's not worth it?

00:42:37.772 --> 00:42:40.122
It's worth it to me.
Doesn't that matter?

00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:45.171
You know. I'm
really sorry. Shane.

00:42:45.258 --> 00:42:47.260
that I'm not the woman
you thought I was.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.568
I can find someone else
who'll do this for me

00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:52.178
if you're not
willing to do this.

00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:55.398
[slow haunting music]

00:43:04.538 --> 00:43:09.543
- Wow.

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:11.545
- Shane.

00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:12.415
- No.

00:43:13.982 --> 00:43:15.418
- Where are you going. Shane?

00:43:15.505 --> 00:43:16.463
- [Shane] I don't know.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.334
- Where are you going?

I. I didn't see you here.

Are you okay?

00:43:59.593 --> 00:44:00.550
- What?

00:44:05.338 --> 00:44:06.382
What're you doing?

00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:10.125
Helen?

00:44:10.212 --> 00:44:12.475
- Is it your husband?

00:44:12.562 --> 00:44:15.043
- I don't. I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.610
- I see a darkness. a.

00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:20.614
I don't know if it's yours or.

00:44:23.095 --> 00:44:24.400
somebody else's.

- [Mom] Where you gonna go?

00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:29.667
- [Dad] Away from you.

00:44:29.754 --> 00:44:31.712
- So it's my fault
that you hurt her?

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:33.888
- You're delusional.
- Daddy.

00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:35.498
- Oh. good. Look.
see what you did?

00:44:35.585 --> 00:44:37.457
The kid heard you.

00:44:37.544 --> 00:44:39.241
- Move. before I move you.

00:44:41.766 --> 00:44:43.332
- Please don't leave me here.

- It's all right. little one.

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.427
I'd take you with me if I could.

00:44:53.865 --> 00:44:54.866
You take care of you.

00:45:00.175 --> 00:45:02.438
- I'm gonna tell everyone.

00:45:02.525 --> 00:45:04.614
Everyone's gonna know
what you did to her.

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:07.617
Do you hear me?

00:45:09.358 --> 00:45:11.665
I'm gonna tell
everybody what you did.

00:45:11.752 --> 00:45:12.971
- You need help.

00:45:13.058 --> 00:45:15.451
If not for yourself. for her.

00:45:15.538 --> 00:45:17.497
- Don't you talk about my kid.

00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:19.978
What do you know about her?

[slow tense music]

00:45:26.288 --> 00:45:28.421
You see what you've done?

00:45:28.508 --> 00:45:29.683
I didn't do it. You did it.

00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:33.687
Think you're hot stuff?

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.258
What are you looking at?

00:45:39.345 --> 00:45:42.522
[slow haunting music]

00:45:50.269 --> 00:45:51.183
You did this.

00:45:52.358 --> 00:45:55.187
[slow tense music]

00:45:56.928 --> 00:45:58.668
You ruined everything.

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:04.196
- Please give me my giraffe
back. Mommy. I need her.

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:09.767
Give her back. please.

00:46:11.812 --> 00:46:14.510
[Mom laughing]

00:46:18.471 --> 00:46:20.778
- [Mom] You ruined everything.

00:46:24.433 --> 00:46:28.263
You've ruined my life. [cries]

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.527
[slow haunting music]

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.758
- [Gia] Eventually.
everything ends.

00:47:30.282 --> 00:47:31.022
- Now out.

00:47:32.632 --> 00:47:36.157
There you go. Yes.

00:47:36.244 --> 00:47:40.379
Now. you said. "I need her."

00:47:41.902 --> 00:47:44.862
And you said. "Eventually
everything ends."

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:46.733
- I don't know.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.430
- It's. that's okay.

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.390
We've done enough for today.

00:47:57.265 --> 00:47:59.702
- Is there something
wrong with me?

00:47:59.789 --> 00:48:01.748
- I think that we
made tons of progress.

00:48:03.358 --> 00:48:06.709
and we're going to have you
feeling back to yourself

00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:07.580
in no time.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.366
- I don't know who that is.

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:17.851
[slow haunting music]

00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:30.995
- How long have
you been up here?

00:48:35.869 --> 00:48:37.697
Who did this to you?

00:48:44.008 --> 00:48:44.965
What did he do to you?

00:48:45.052 --> 00:48:46.924
- He didn't do this to me.

00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:49.970
[slow somber music]

00:48:57.064 --> 00:48:59.675
[scary music]

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:01.721
- [Gia] No!

00:49:02.765 --> 00:49:05.246
No. no. [crying]

00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:07.509
- Gia honey. it's me. Huh?

00:49:08.989 --> 00:49:11.949
[tense eerie music]

00:49:14.386 --> 00:49:15.953
- She just started shaking.

00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:18.651
Then she went down.

00:49:18.738 --> 00:49:19.347
- You okay?

00:49:20.566 --> 00:49:21.828
Come on. let's--
- What happened?

00:49:21.915 --> 00:49:23.177
- Let's get you back
to bed. Come on.

00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:28.226
[Gia groans]

00:49:28.313 --> 00:49:30.793
[Gia crying]

00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:40.673
Do you want. you
wanna talk about it?

00:49:42.936 --> 00:49:44.590
- I don't wanna shut my eyes.

00:49:47.854 --> 00:49:49.812
- [sighs] You don't have to.

00:49:49.899 --> 00:49:52.424
[Gia crying]

00:50:15.882 --> 00:50:19.016
[gentle tense music]

00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:26.980
[Gia crying]
[gentle somber music]

00:50:50.134 --> 00:50:53.224
- We haven't seen a storm
this bad since hurricane Amy.

00:50:53.311 --> 00:50:56.227
The city has decided to
call in the National Guard.

00:50:56.314 --> 00:50:59.360
As crews work round the
clock repairing bridges.

00:50:59.447 --> 00:51:02.102
ice and damaged trees
have caused power outages

00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:03.712
throughout the area

00:51:03.799 --> 00:51:04.626
and surrounding counties.
- It's the end of the world.

00:51:04.713 --> 00:51:06.454
- We're all gonna die.

00:51:09.936 --> 00:51:11.285
- I feel like I'm
losing my mind.

00:51:12.373 --> 00:51:13.722
I need you to tell me.

00:51:15.246 --> 00:51:16.029
- Yeah.

00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:19.815
- What's in the envelope?

00:51:21.295 --> 00:51:24.168
If you know he's cheating.
just say something.

00:51:24.255 --> 00:51:25.560
- Gia. I'm starting to think

00:51:25.647 --> 00:51:26.605
that it wouldn't
even matter anymore.

00:51:26.692 --> 00:51:28.346
- Of course it would.

00:51:29.564 --> 00:51:30.826
- What are you afraid of?

00:51:31.914 --> 00:51:33.002
Look. I try.

00:51:34.961 --> 00:51:36.397
I try to be supportive

00:51:36.484 --> 00:51:37.355
but it just starts to feel
like a waste of my time.

00:51:37.442 --> 00:51:39.052
- I'm not those other women.

00:51:39.139 --> 00:51:40.619
- You haven't even
opened the envelope yet.

00:51:40.706 --> 00:51:42.273
so I'm starting to believe
like maybe you are.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.884
- [sighs] It's gone too far.

00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:47.060
- What scares you the most. huh?

00:51:47.147 --> 00:51:48.757
The fact that you
lost control or maybe.

00:51:48.844 --> 00:51:50.063
maybe you just believe.

00:51:51.673 --> 00:51:53.284
maybe it's because you've
just become an empty vessel

00:51:53.371 --> 00:51:55.808
for everyone just to fill you
up with whatever they want.

00:51:57.288 --> 00:51:59.942
- Is that what you think
I am. an empty vessel?

00:52:02.075 --> 00:52:05.209
- [Isaac] Gia. do you
honestly even care

00:52:05.296 --> 00:52:06.079
what I think of you?

00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:09.387
- Why do I feel like
the bad guy here?

00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:13.478
[bacon sizzling]

00:52:15.828 --> 00:52:17.786
Oh. it smells great in here.

00:52:17.873 --> 00:52:18.961
- Mrs. Gallo.

00:52:19.048 --> 00:52:21.399
Um. I hope you're hungry.

00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:27.056
[bacon sizzling]
[light jazz vocal music]

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.101
- Well. you outdid yourself.

00:52:28.188 --> 00:52:29.711
Do you need any help at all?

00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:31.670
- No. No. I'm fine.

00:52:31.757 --> 00:52:32.540
Sit down.

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:37.502
- Yeah um. I wanted
to ask you something.

00:52:39.112 --> 00:52:40.592
- Yes?

00:52:40.679 --> 00:52:42.985
- You. you said
something last night.

00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:44.117
Do you remember?

00:52:45.466 --> 00:52:46.772
- I don't know.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:49.514
What did I say?

00:52:49.601 --> 00:52:51.951
- Um. no. nevermind.

00:52:52.038 --> 00:52:55.215
Uh. are you sure
you don't need help?

00:52:55.302 --> 00:52:56.695
If you just tell me
where the dishes are.

00:52:56.782 --> 00:52:59.001
I'd be happy to set
the table for you. or.

00:52:59.088 --> 00:53:01.700
[Helen laughs]

00:53:07.923 --> 00:53:08.707
Yeah.

00:53:11.275 --> 00:53:13.146
[Helen laughs]

00:53:13.233 --> 00:53:15.540
- Marriage is like
a fabrication.

00:53:15.627 --> 00:53:18.020
You know. like a false
sense of security.

00:53:18.107 --> 00:53:20.240
Like. you know. you. you
vow to be with somebody

00:53:20.327 --> 00:53:21.850
the rest of your life.

00:53:21.937 --> 00:53:24.070
And it's like. boom. off
the market. problem solved.

00:53:24.157 --> 00:53:25.506
Okay?

00:53:25.593 --> 00:53:27.726
But then. you know.
what happens when

00:53:27.813 --> 00:53:30.207
someone wants to be
with somebody else?

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:34.950
You know. is. is
marriage gonna stop that?

00:53:35.037 --> 00:53:36.996
- [Shane] Uh. it's
called commitment.

00:53:37.083 --> 00:53:38.650
- Commitment can only
blanket natural tendencies

00:53:38.737 --> 00:53:40.042
for so long.

00:53:40.129 --> 00:53:42.784
Entering a contract with
another human being.

00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:46.484
you know. basically. "Now we
belong to each other forever."

00:53:46.571 --> 00:53:48.007
Like. you know. basically.
no matter what happens.

00:53:48.094 --> 00:53:49.443
Yeah. no thanks.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.488
- [clears throat]
Yeah. I don't think

00:53:50.575 --> 00:53:52.229
that's exactly what it means.

00:53:53.708 --> 00:53:56.363
- I used to date
this girl. Tatiana.

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.060
She was a taphophiliac.

00:53:59.584 --> 00:54:01.281
hardcore into hanging
out at cemeteries.

00:54:01.368 --> 00:54:04.763
Anyway. she uh. she wanted
me to commit to her.

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:05.590
and I almost did.

00:54:07.156 --> 00:54:10.682
But then I realized that
she had been lying to me

00:54:10.769 --> 00:54:11.509
the whole time.

00:54:13.032 --> 00:54:14.860
She wasn't into
hanging out at graves.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.254
She was dead.

00:54:19.212 --> 00:54:20.213
She had no other choice.

00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:24.826
But as humans we're
constantly evolving.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.961
Like the person you
vow to be with now.

00:54:29.048 --> 00:54:31.572
may not be the person
you eventually get.

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.274
- Wow. Does your mother
know you're this cynical?

00:54:40.102 --> 00:54:41.495
- Sounds like you've been hurt.

00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:45.238
- I swear. this one's psychic.

00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:47.893
But hey. like. you guys.
what has it been 13 years?

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.764
I mean. you gotta be
doing something right.

00:55:09.044 --> 00:55:09.828
- Honey?

00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:14.572
Gia. I'm home.

00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:20.578
[bag and keys thud]

00:55:22.667 --> 00:55:23.407
Babe?

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.193
You up here? What're you doing?

00:55:30.849 --> 00:55:32.894
[tense music]

00:55:32.981 --> 00:55:35.593
Gi. you up here?

00:55:38.117 --> 00:55:42.164
Gigi. you up here. baby?

00:55:44.732 --> 00:55:45.516
Hey.

00:55:48.301 --> 00:55:49.346
Hi sexy.

00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:54.307
I missed you.

00:55:56.178 --> 00:55:57.310
What're you doin'?

00:55:57.397 --> 00:55:59.834
- [Gia] Hi. I missed you.

00:56:01.096 --> 00:56:02.010
Why haven't you called me?

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.666
I. I wish your body
was next to mine

00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:07.189
right now.
- You went through my email?

00:56:07.276 --> 00:56:09.148
- [Gia] You're so special to me.

00:56:09.235 --> 00:56:11.803
- You went through my
emails? This is work.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:13.892
- [Gia] [laughs] This is work?

00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:15.546
- Yes. It's just work.

00:56:15.633 --> 00:56:17.765
We worked on a project
together. babe.

00:56:17.852 --> 00:56:19.376
She worked with us.

00:56:19.463 --> 00:56:23.292
We. we had a few. a few late
nights meals over. yeah--

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.468
- I thought I was--
- With drinks. but that--

00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:25.425
- The actor. Shane.

00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:29.298
- You know what?

00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:30.778
You're not even in the right
head space for this. babe.

00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:32.258
This is not normal.

00:56:32.345 --> 00:56:35.304
Nothing happening. You
have to believe me. okay?

00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:36.915
She's a friend.

00:56:37.002 --> 00:56:37.655
- She's a friend?

00:56:37.742 --> 00:56:39.352
- Yes.

00:56:39.439 --> 00:56:40.658
- All right. you work with
her. or is she a friend. Shane?

00:56:40.745 --> 00:56:41.746
Make your mind up.

00:56:42.921 --> 00:56:44.401
No wonder I can't get pregnant.

00:56:44.488 --> 00:56:48.492
- Oh. semantics. Gia.
please. just stop. Just stop.

00:56:48.579 --> 00:56:50.276
- Have you stopped? Have you?

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:55.107
- Have I stopped what. honey?
I haven't done anything.

00:56:55.194 --> 00:56:55.977
All right?

00:56:57.849 --> 00:56:59.590
You have to believe me. Okay?

00:57:02.897 --> 00:57:05.160
Listen. Listen to me.

00:57:05.247 --> 00:57:06.466
Listen to me.

00:57:06.553 --> 00:57:10.165
Look. nothing happened. Huh?

00:57:12.385 --> 00:57:13.865
Nothing happened.

00:57:15.257 --> 00:57:19.392
I want you.

00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:21.263
Hey. I only ever wanted you.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:22.743
- You disgust me. Shane.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.005
- Disgust you?
- Yes.

00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:25.354
- Disgust you?

00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:25.833
Disgust you?

00:57:27.356 --> 00:57:30.664
You say to me after
all I've done. huh?

00:57:33.624 --> 00:57:35.756
Dammit. Just listen to me.

00:57:38.803 --> 00:57:42.502
- You're hurting me.
Shane. you're hurting me.

00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:48.073
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.554
Honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:57:50.641 --> 00:57:51.293
- For what part?

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.643
- I'm sorry.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:54.340
- What part didn't
you mean. Shane?

00:57:54.427 --> 00:57:57.778
[Shane breathing heavily]

00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:02.043
[lamp shatters]

00:58:05.003 --> 00:58:07.962
[deep somber music]

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.147
[gentle somber music]

00:58:54.356 --> 00:58:57.055
[floor creaks]

00:59:00.624 --> 00:59:03.322
[Shane crying]

00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:13.854
- Ah. I'm sorry. baby.

00:59:15.595 --> 00:59:20.382
Honey. put your hand on me.
please. Tell me you love me.

00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:23.124
Honey.

00:59:24.778 --> 00:59:28.434
Please. I'm sorry. baby.
Tell me you love me.

[Shane moans]

00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.857
- Shane?
- Yes.

01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:02.207
- I have to tell you something.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:03.077
- Gia.

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:12.347
- I've had bad
things happen to me.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:15.524
[Gia crying]

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.613
No. oh no.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:20.442
No.

01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:23.576
What if. what if I
did bad things to you?

01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:27.580
- Honey.

01:00:30.757 --> 01:00:33.630
All that matters
is that I love you

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.851
and you love me. right?

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.421
That's all that matters.

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:43.944
- That's not enough.

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:45.380
- Yes. yes. yes.

01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:50.211

[knocking at door]

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:56.914
Hey. I knocked.

01:00:58.393 --> 01:00:59.133
- Hey.

01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.747
[Shane sighs]

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:08.490
- Look. Gia. um. I'm.
I'm. I'm disappointed

01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:11.668
that this anniversary
weekend hasn't worked out

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:12.756
like we'd hoped.

01:01:14.148 --> 01:01:15.106
- I don't blame you.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.592
- I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:29.250
- [sighs] I don't know. Shane.
there just so much stuff.

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.689
I don't know how we're
gonna get past it.

01:01:34.865 --> 01:01:37.432
[Shane sighs]

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:40.697

[Isaac sighs]

01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:00.499
- Yep. Yeah. it's me.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.895
[laughs] That's funny.

01:02:04.982 --> 01:02:07.071
I didn't think I needed your
permission to come out here.

01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:10.378
And clearly. I wasn't
gonna ask for it.

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:14.731
No. she hasn't seen anything.

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:16.515
Why?

01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:21.738
[scoffs] You know. did it
maybe occur to you. Adrian.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.957
that you just might be
wrong about this one?

01:02:26.003 --> 01:02:26.743
All right.

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:29.789
Mm-hmm.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.444
Later.

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:38.189
[Isaac sighs]

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:44.151
April.

01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:46.458
Caitlyn.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.416
Devin.

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:55.032

and Tara. Vanessa. whatever.

[Helen laughs]

01:03:19.665 --> 01:03:20.884
- Doesn't that feel
a little different?

01:03:20.971 --> 01:03:22.581
It's party time.

01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:24.061
Can we do a dip?

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:30.545
- Can I borrow your princess?

01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:33.113
[uptempo jazz music]

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.463
- [Jedi] It's coming. baby.

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:42.514
- Think I'm gonna grab another
drink. Anything for you?

01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:44.168
[all chattering]

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:45.996
You don't wanna dance?

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.304
Did I do that right?
Something like that?

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.089
May I have this dance?

01:03:52.176 --> 01:03:55.266

[vinyl scratches]

01:04:25.165 --> 01:04:26.384
- What happened to it?
[Helen laughs]

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:29.822
- [Isaac] Look
what happened here.

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:31.606
- [Jedi] Very good.

01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:43.531

[uptempo jazz music]

01:05:29.403 --> 01:05:30.752
- Lose something?

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:36.976
So. how long do you think
you can keep this up?

01:05:37.063 --> 01:05:39.326
- [Gia] I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:40.327
- Look at yourself.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.027
You can't even keep your
head straight anymore.

01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:50.033
I guess being good Gia
isn't so perfect after all.

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:54.298
Yep. Walk away.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:55.734
It's always been your thing.

01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:56.865
- What do you want from me?

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.999
- Hey. Who are you talking to?

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.092
Come on.

01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:27.940
- Hey.

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:35.121
- Hey. [laughs]

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:40.474
We need to talk. Okay?

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:42.911
- Okay.

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:46.959
[pills clattering]

01:06:47.046 --> 01:06:48.395
- You haven't been
taking these. huh?

01:06:49.962 --> 01:06:52.051
- You're going through
my things. Shane?

01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:55.054
- How long?

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:57.709
- You don't under--

01:06:57.796 --> 01:06:58.536
- Does your doctor know?

01:06:58.623 --> 01:06:59.276
- I had to.

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:01.017
- Had to?

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.410
Gia you told me your moods are
all over the place. off the--

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:04.846
- My moods?

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.239
- Yeah. I only know
what you tell me.

01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:08.981
- My moods were
fine. Shane. before.

01:07:09.982 --> 01:07:11.027
- Yeah.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.378
That's probably what it is then.

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.553
You know. you're withdrawing.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.902
- Probably what?

01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:17.946
- Probably why
you haven't been--

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.296
- What. myself?

01:07:19.383 --> 01:07:22.603
Uh. or less
difficult? Forgiving?

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:23.909
Understanding?

01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:26.955
- Yeah. I was
gonna say yourself.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:27.826
You nailed it.

01:07:27.913 --> 01:07:29.610
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.004
This could be serious.

01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.049
- This is serious.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:33.919
- Yeah it is.

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:35.573
- It's been serious.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.531
- This whole weekend. I've
been doing nothing but trying.

01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:38.967
this whole messed-up weekend.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.534
Nothing. but trying.

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:41.753
- You've been trying?

01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:45.713
- [Shane] You're
gonna take this.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:50.849
[deep somber music]

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:51.719
- No.

[deep somber music]

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:12.871
[Gia sniffling]

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:17.093
Are you happy now. Shane?

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.225
You wanna check? Look.

01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:26.102
Are you happy?

01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:32.978
[pills thud]

01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:35.459

[Shane sighs]

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.384
- Hey. don't. don't leave.

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:49.951
Please. don't leave.

01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:54.608
- Where am I gonna go. Shane?

01:08:54.695 --> 01:08:57.655
[deep somber music]

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:21.809
Do you mind?

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:36.041
- Do you know why Devorah
killed her husband?

01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:38.870
- You said it was
because she found out

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.176
he was having an affair.

01:09:43.266 --> 01:09:46.660
- Her and Arnold tried for
years to conceive a child.

01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:50.664
But it wasn't God's will.

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:56.279
[sighs] When she found
out that her sister

01:09:56.366 --> 01:09:58.803
was carrying her husband's seed.

01:10:01.022 --> 01:10:04.461
she felt like it was the
ultimate betrayal from God.

01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:12.338
- I thought um. I thought she
didn't hurt the sister. Right?

01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:16.124
- Well she didn't wanna
let the child suffer.

01:10:17.474 --> 01:10:18.518
- [Gia] Oh.

01:10:18.605 --> 01:10:19.345
- But she did.

01:10:22.435 --> 01:10:24.045
She did.

01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:26.047
- What happened to the sister?

01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:28.049
- Well she had the baby.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.749
She raised her without a man.

01:10:34.447 --> 01:10:36.884
But she never quite
got over the fact

01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:38.669
that she betrayed her sister.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:42.760
That she betrayed herself.

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:50.289
Do you even know what
it's like to be conceived

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:51.334
by the flesh?

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:59.559
- You're her. Right?

01:10:59.646 --> 01:11:00.168
- Yes.

01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:03.259
- You. you're the daughter?

01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:05.217
- Yes.

01:11:09.395 --> 01:11:14.270
I'm returning to the
place where it all began.

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:23.844
That is my penance. [sighs]

01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:28.893
and my absolution.

01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:33.071

[door clicks shut]

01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:33.958
- Shane?

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.486
- Someone must have
left the door unlocked.

01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:45.883
Oh. Now that is so not like you.

01:12:47.319 --> 01:12:50.888
Something I would
do. but not Gia.

01:12:52.106 --> 01:12:54.108
- My husband's right outside.

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:56.154
- Let me talk to him.

01:12:56.241 --> 01:12:58.243
- [Gia] Why are you doing this?

01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.375
- You're kidding.

01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:06.033
Look. when I was around.
nobody got into your head.

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:09.515
- I wanted a family.

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:14.912
- Yeah. Yep. we
were a family. okay?

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:18.742
We. we took care of one another.

01:13:20.308 --> 01:13:23.529
- Well. the scars tell
a different story.

01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:29.100
- Yeah. I showed you
another way. Okay?

01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:30.884
- [Gia] Doesn't matter.

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:34.192
I mean. this isn't real.

01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:35.062
- No?

01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:39.371
[water splashes]
[Gia gasps]

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.808
You think you can run? Huh?

01:13:43.331 --> 01:13:47.248
Just wake up and what.
just change who you are?

01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:48.989
Didn't you learn anything
from your mother?

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:52.340
You know. I watched
you let them in.

01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:58.434
Mm-hmm. Let them hurt you
over and over and over again.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.264
Like you just had no
control over anything.

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:05.658
- No one. no one believed me.

01:14:05.745 --> 01:14:06.746
- I believed you.

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.620
- Tell me what to do.

01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:13.536
- Okay.

01:14:16.408 --> 01:14:17.191
You were wrong.

01:14:18.584 --> 01:14:20.020
Nothing ever ends.

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:25.243
Sure. sure. the memories
can fade. but you know what?

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:27.550
The imprint is still there.

01:14:27.637 --> 01:14:31.249
This little fairy
tale you've created.

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:33.686
yeah. it's never
going to be yours.

01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:36.472
- Maybe it can be.

01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:39.518
[slow somber music]

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.740
- Just. go back.

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:46.917
- What if I can't go back?

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:52.226
- [scoffs] Hey. may
as well take 'em now.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.927
[gentle somber music]

01:14:58.058 --> 01:14:59.451
- [Shane] What a circus.

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:00.496
- Huh. yeah.

01:15:03.194 --> 01:15:05.675
One hell of a night. huh?

01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:10.680
- Remind me just to buy jewelry
next year. huh? [chuckles]

01:15:11.463 --> 01:15:11.681
- Yeah so.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.423
how is Gia?

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.255
- Question of the night.

01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:22.126
- Yeah.

01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:28.741
Some guys just don't know
how lucky they really are.

01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:36.401
- Luck. has nothing
to do with it.

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:43.800
Do you know. man. I spent my
whole life trying to make this.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.892
trying to make this girl happy.

01:15:50.154 --> 01:15:51.024
- Yeah.
- You know?

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:53.157
What did it get me?

01:15:55.507 --> 01:15:58.075
All she wants to see
is the bad. You know?

01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:02.470
What's up with that?

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.606
- I wouldn't know.

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:11.349
I'm one of the good guys.

01:16:13.873 --> 01:16:14.918
[both laugh]

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:16.920
- One of the good guys.

01:16:17.007 --> 01:16:18.661
[both laugh]

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:19.531
Jesus.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.320
Hit me.

01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:27.800
- Let's fill up.

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:30.324
Coming in.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:41.771
[Gia breathes deeply]

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.085
[Gia groans]

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.132
- [Woman On Phone] Mrs.
Gallo. you still there?

01:16:55.219 --> 01:16:56.786
- Yes. I'm still here.

01:16:56.873 --> 01:16:58.439
- [Woman On Phone]
Yeah uh. I'm sorry.

01:16:58.526 --> 01:17:00.267
but Shane's not in the office.

01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:01.617
Did you try and call him?

01:17:01.704 --> 01:17:03.488
- Yes. I tried calling him.

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:06.622
He said he was in a meeting.

01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:11.583
- [Woman On Phone] Okay.
Do you want me to check?

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:12.453
- Yes.

01:17:14.586 --> 01:17:15.892
- [Woman On Phone] Yeah.
I'm not seeing a meeting.

01:17:15.979 --> 01:17:19.547
Uh. maybe. maybe he went
out to dinner. maybe--

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.246
[phone thuds]

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:26.467
[Gia breathes deeply]

01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:30.733
[Gia moaning in pain]

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:39.829
[water splashing]
[Gia breathing heavily]

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:42.745
[deep tense music]

01:17:45.312 --> 01:17:47.575
[Gia crying]

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:56.628
[deep tense music]

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.240
- You think he deserves to know?

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.547
- You miscarried.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:05.202
Don't you think that that's
something he should know?

01:18:05.289 --> 01:18:07.030
- It wasn't even a baby.

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:09.815
- An embryonic
pregnancy. I know.

01:18:09.902 --> 01:18:13.558
which sometimes
happens during IVF.

01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:15.952
But it's not something that
you should have to deal with

01:18:16.039 --> 01:18:17.649
on your own.

01:18:17.736 --> 01:18:20.173
- Well. he should've thought
of that before he lied to me.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:23.829
- I know how important it
was for you to have a baby.

01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:27.528
And I'm concerned that if
you don't address this--

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:31.054
- I just don't wanna bring a
baby into this world anymore.

01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:34.231
[tense somber music]

01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:48.724
[eerie suspenseful music]

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:14.184
[Gia coughing]

01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:18.231
[tense somber music]

01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:41.994
Um. we weren't actively trying.

01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:44.605
And I thought you said
without the injections that--

01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:48.696
- [Woman On Phone] Yeah
um. and you know. and it's.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.220
it's kind of a
miracle because this.

01:19:50.307 --> 01:19:52.526
I can tell you that I've
never done a phone call

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.006
like this before.

01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:55.791
Working here all
these years. I mean.

01:19:55.878 --> 01:19:57.444
you're actually
gonna have a baby.

01:19:57.531 --> 01:19:59.185
Um [clears throat]. you okay?

01:19:59.272 --> 01:20:00.621
Like. this is a
good thing. right?

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:02.972
- Oh. no. this is a great thing.

01:20:03.059 --> 01:20:06.802
This is a great thing. um.

01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:13.069
No. thank you. I'm sorry.
I know this is weird.

01:20:13.156 --> 01:20:14.679
I'm sorry. I just
didn't expect that.

01:20:14.766 --> 01:20:16.420
and it's very exciting and.

01:20:18.074 --> 01:20:21.773
you just gave me the best
news of my life. thank you.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:22.643
Thank you.

01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:24.732
Bye.

01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:28.780
[tense somber music]

01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:38.790
Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:41.619
Wow. Look at you.

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:43.664
This is a pleasant surprise.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:46.058
How are you?

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.581
- I'm good. I'm good.

01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:53.500
- Um. Shane's at the
uh. at the other site.

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.328
- Yeah. no. I. I know.

01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:56.939
Um. it happened.

01:21:00.638 --> 01:21:01.769
- It?

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.598
What happened?
- It happened.

01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:07.775
- Oh. it happened.

01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:09.995
Congratulations.

01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:10.866
- Yeah.

01:21:10.953 --> 01:21:12.345
- What about Shane?

01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:13.869
- I'm telling him tonight.

01:21:16.784 --> 01:21:19.700
- Good. Uh. can I get
you a drink of water?

01:21:19.787 --> 01:21:20.745
Please have a seat.

01:21:20.832 --> 01:21:22.747
- Um. okay.

01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:30.711
- Wasn't going to
give this to you.

01:21:32.496 --> 01:21:34.150
But I suppose
considering the news.

01:21:36.804 --> 01:21:39.111
now is about uh. as
good a time as any.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.245
Here.

01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:43.899
- I thought you said you
didn't find anything.

01:21:45.204 --> 01:21:46.814
- Gia. open it.

01:21:48.468 --> 01:21:49.208
Open it.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:49.992
- I can't.

01:21:51.384 --> 01:21:52.124
I can't.

01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:56.824
- Dammit.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:57.651
Really?

01:21:59.001 --> 01:21:59.740
Really?

01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:03.266
- Whatever's in there. it
doesn't matter anymore.

01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:04.789
I mean. that's the past. right?

01:22:06.312 --> 01:22:07.835
- Well. I think you might
wanna reconsider that.

01:22:10.751 --> 01:22:12.536
- Are you jealous. Isaac?

01:22:12.623 --> 01:22:14.538
I mean. I know we got close.
[Isaac laughing]

01:22:14.625 --> 01:22:16.583
- Yes. uh. close.

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:17.280
That's what you call it?

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:18.716
Close?
- Yeah.

01:22:18.803 --> 01:22:20.718
- [Isaac] That's all
we were was just close?

01:22:20.805 --> 01:22:21.762
- That's it.

01:22:21.849 --> 01:22:22.894
- I see.

01:22:24.809 --> 01:22:26.158
- Is it bad?

01:22:26.245 --> 01:22:27.594
Is it. is it really bad?

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:31.642
- I suppose that depends on
what you're hoping to find.

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:35.515
[Gia sighs]

01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:38.040
Look um. it was
great to see you.

01:22:39.563 --> 01:22:41.130
But. if you don't mind.

01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:45.395
I have some places
I need to go to.

01:22:45.482 --> 01:22:46.222
- Sure.

01:22:51.618 --> 01:22:54.404
[deep tense music]

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:15.642
[car humming]

01:24:08.652 --> 01:24:10.697
[footsteps clicking]

01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:11.568
- Hey.

01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:14.658
- [Gia] Hey.

01:24:14.745 --> 01:24:15.398
- You're home late.

01:24:16.399 --> 01:24:17.922
- [Gia] I had an audition.

01:24:18.009 --> 01:24:19.924
- Ah.

01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:20.838
How'd it go?

01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:22.057
- I. I don't know yet.

01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:28.541
- So. I think that I
have the perfect thing

01:24:28.628 --> 01:24:31.762
to take your mind off of it.

01:24:31.849 --> 01:24:36.767
What would you think
of a weekend away?

01:24:37.942 --> 01:24:39.291
- For what?

01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:41.076
- Um. our anniversary?

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:42.860
You know?

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:46.907
I mean with everything
that's been going on.

01:24:46.994 --> 01:24:49.171
I just think. you know.
we. we deserve it.

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:50.737
You deserve it.

01:24:50.824 --> 01:24:54.480
"Shane. did I tell you
that you're just like.

01:24:54.567 --> 01:24:55.916
the best husband ever?

01:24:56.003 --> 01:24:58.919
You're almost like
magical?" [chuckles]

01:24:59.006 --> 01:25:00.399
- No. it. that's great.

01:25:00.486 --> 01:25:04.099
That's. that sounds.
that sounds great.

01:25:04.186 --> 01:25:07.580
- Well good. because I. I
booked it. and I can't wait.

01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:14.283
- Yeah. so um. is there
anything else you wanna tell me?

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.545
- [Shane] Like what?

01:25:15.632 --> 01:25:17.938
[scary music]

01:25:18.025 --> 01:25:20.550
[Gia crying]

01:25:39.612 --> 01:25:41.701
- Your fault. you did
this. you ran him off

01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.138
just like the others.

01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:46.706
- You need help. If not
for yourself. for her.

01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:49.056
- [Mom] You ruined my life.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:51.015
I hate you. You ruin everything.

01:25:51.102 --> 01:25:54.061
[static buzzing]

01:25:56.107 --> 01:25:57.935
- [Shane] Does your doctor know?

01:25:58.022 --> 01:26:00.851
Gia. you told me your moods
are all over the place.

01:26:00.938 --> 01:26:03.941
[tense eerie music]

01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:10.339
[Gia crying]

01:26:10.426 --> 01:26:12.689
- [Mom] Everyone's gonna
know what you did to her.

01:26:12.776 --> 01:26:14.647
Do you hear me?

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:17.259
I'm gonna tell
everybody what you did.

01:26:17.346 --> 01:26:18.129
- Dr. Marcum?

01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:22.612
[tense somber music]

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.181
[Gia crying]

01:26:33.275 --> 01:26:34.885
- [Shane] Well. good news.

01:26:36.365 --> 01:26:38.236
The road should be
clearing by morning.

01:26:44.503 --> 01:26:47.114
[Shane sighs]

01:26:54.861 --> 01:26:56.123
- When did you first realize?

01:26:57.255 --> 01:26:57.908
- Realize what?

01:26:59.431 --> 01:27:01.216
- That I wasn't who
you thought I'd be.

01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:05.002
- I'm not sure I understand.

01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:06.221
- [Gia] You do. Shane.

01:27:10.137 --> 01:27:10.921
- Gia.

01:27:20.626 --> 01:27:23.238
Gia. hasn't this weekend
been hard enough?

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:40.211
[Shane sighs]

01:27:40.298 --> 01:27:41.081
Look.

01:27:46.217 --> 01:27:47.610
Everything was fine.

01:27:49.525 --> 01:27:53.746
And the company had me travel
and you didn't take it well.

01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:02.059
I thought maybe at first
you were just acting out.

01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:05.062
You know. as a way
to keep me around.

01:28:07.151 --> 01:28:08.718
But I had no choice.

01:28:10.241 --> 01:28:11.111
I had to go.

01:28:11.198 --> 01:28:12.765
So. I left.

01:28:19.337 --> 01:28:21.121
Every time I came
back. I don't know.

01:28:23.994 --> 01:28:24.777
There was.

01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:28.128
there was something different.

01:28:31.262 --> 01:28:33.438
I thought maybe at
first you were just mad.

01:28:33.525 --> 01:28:36.267
You know. and you'd snap
out of it and adjust.

01:28:36.354 --> 01:28:39.009
You said you'd been seeing
a doctor. doing work.

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:41.141
Then we thought.

01:28:44.884 --> 01:28:47.191
[scoffs] then we thought
having a child [laughs].

01:28:51.282 --> 01:28:52.762
someone to keep you company.

01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:56.156
I tried.

01:28:59.769 --> 01:29:00.422
We tried.

01:29:02.772 --> 01:29:06.036
But it just. just
distanced us further.

01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:12.303
Whatever light you had on
when we were first together.

01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:14.566
it just started to go out.

01:29:14.653 --> 01:29:16.133
I didn't wanna see it.

01:29:19.789 --> 01:29:21.921
I didn't wanna think
that I was the cause.

01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:28.275
Gia. every. every marriage
has their share of problems.

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.799
you know. so I thought
ours would just--

01:29:29.886 --> 01:29:31.148
- Work itself out?

01:29:31.235 --> 01:29:34.238
[slow somber music]

01:29:37.241 --> 01:29:38.851
- One night I came home and.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:43.943
you just were.

01:29:47.294 --> 01:29:49.471
you were acting different.

01:29:53.344 --> 01:29:55.477
I thought you were
preparing for some role.

01:30:00.133 --> 01:30:03.615
It didn't stop.
You were into it.

01:30:03.702 --> 01:30:05.095
- I'm so sorry.

01:30:06.009 --> 01:30:07.271
- [Shane] No.

01:30:07.358 --> 01:30:08.664
- I was so difficult
to live with.

01:30:10.143 --> 01:30:12.407
And because of that
you don't think

01:30:12.494 --> 01:30:15.018
I'm worth telling
the truth to. Shane.

01:30:15.105 --> 01:30:18.413
- Of course you are. I
should have addressed it.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.763
- How can you look
at me in my eyes

01:30:22.242 --> 01:30:25.420
and tell me that you.
you saw me day after day

01:30:26.856 --> 01:30:29.772
just destroying myself.
just falling apart.

01:30:29.859 --> 01:30:32.339
and you did nothing.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:35.255
- That's not--
- You took advantage of it.

01:30:35.342 --> 01:30:37.519
And I know. Shane. I know.

01:30:37.606 --> 01:30:40.870
in my heart I've known that
there was another woman.

01:30:40.957 --> 01:30:45.265
and you. you can't even
tell the truth to that.

01:30:45.352 --> 01:30:46.397
And it hurts.

01:30:48.051 --> 01:30:49.487
It hurts me.

01:30:49.574 --> 01:30:50.314
- Well.

01:30:51.358 --> 01:30:54.318
[slow somber music]

01:31:12.249 --> 01:31:15.034
[Isaac sniffling]

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:23.652
[slow somber music]

01:31:28.308 --> 01:31:32.399
[Isaac sighs and sniffles]

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.490
[slow somber music]

01:31:38.318 --> 01:31:40.756
[Isaac crying]

01:31:47.676 --> 01:31:51.244
[Isaac breathing heavily]

01:32:03.909 --> 01:32:06.869
[Gia moans lightly]

01:32:18.445 --> 01:32:21.840
[static buzzing]

01:32:21.927 --> 01:32:24.495
- [Gia] Who are you?

01:32:24.582 --> 01:32:25.844
- You know who I am.

01:32:28.891 --> 01:32:30.066
[Gia gasps]

01:32:30.153 --> 01:32:32.024
Do not leave me here.

01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:33.896
- [Gia] Let go of me.

01:32:33.983 --> 01:32:36.376
Let go of me. I don't
know who you are.

01:32:36.463 --> 01:32:39.554
[Gia breathing heavily]

01:32:51.522 --> 01:32:54.133
- Gotta admit. Jedi. your mom
makes a mean cup of coffee.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:56.832
- Ah. thanks man. Mean.
I've had it forever.

01:32:56.919 --> 01:32:58.311
- Well. it's. it's special.

01:32:58.398 --> 01:32:59.748
- Yeah. How's your head?

01:32:59.835 --> 01:33:01.924
- Uh. well. thanks.
I'll survive.

01:33:02.011 --> 01:33:04.317
- Can I get ya some
more coffee? Any cream?

01:33:04.404 --> 01:33:05.362
- Uh. no Helen. thank you.

01:33:05.449 --> 01:33:06.189
- I'm fine.

01:33:06.276 --> 01:33:06.885
- Good morning.

01:33:06.972 --> 01:33:08.626
- Hey. what's up?

01:33:08.713 --> 01:33:10.541
- Mr. Gallo. come and have a
bite before you hit the road.

01:33:10.628 --> 01:33:13.544
- Uh. is Gia here?

01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:15.502
- No. I haven't seen her yet.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:16.373
- She took off.

01:33:17.417 --> 01:33:18.897
- Where'd she take off to?

01:33:18.984 --> 01:33:21.987
- Well. I like to wake
up early to meditate

01:33:22.074 --> 01:33:23.423
down by the lake--
- Wait. she what?

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:24.773
- And. yeah. and I
saw her down there.

01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.296
and she was trying
to start the car.

01:33:26.383 --> 01:33:27.079
I think the battery's
dead from the cold.

01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:27.950
- Jesus.

01:33:28.037 --> 01:33:29.516
- I helped her start it.

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:30.909
and then I told her to
check out my web show.

01:33:30.996 --> 01:33:32.563
She said she would
when she got back.

01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:35.784
- Wait. wait. so you're saying
my wife left with our car?

01:33:35.871 --> 01:33:36.741
- Yeah. that's about it.

01:33:36.828 --> 01:33:37.873
- What. what car'd she take?

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.309
- Um. the one that worked.

01:33:40.876 --> 01:33:41.833
- Is there. is there
somewhere I can get reception

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.226
in this house?

01:33:45.837 --> 01:33:49.275
Gia. Hey. it's me. hon.

01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:53.932
Listen. I. I. I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

01:33:54.019 --> 01:33:55.934
Can you just please
give me a call back?

01:33:56.935 --> 01:33:57.675
All right?

01:34:00.199 --> 01:34:01.940
[phone ringing]

01:34:02.027 --> 01:34:03.463
Gia?

01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:06.249
- [Beverly] No. it's
Beverly. Sam said you called.

01:34:06.336 --> 01:34:08.860
- Yeah. Have you heard from Gia?

01:34:08.947 --> 01:34:11.297
- [Beverly] No. Why.
what's going on?

01:34:11.384 --> 01:34:13.952
Last we thought. you guys
were enjoying yourselves.

01:34:14.039 --> 01:34:15.301
- Oh god. it's.

01:34:16.999 --> 01:34:18.565
it's been a nightmare.

01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:21.220
She left this morning. and
uh. no one's heard from her.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.789
And. Isaac's here.
he's helping out.

01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:27.574
- [Beverly] Isaac? What's
he doing out there?

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.620
- Um. well. he
delivered those papers

01:34:29.707 --> 01:34:31.666
that Sam needed me to sign.

01:34:31.753 --> 01:34:34.625
- [Beverly] Papers. uh.
no sir. Not from Sam. no.

01:34:34.712 --> 01:34:36.192
I put the fear of God in him

01:34:36.279 --> 01:34:38.760
about bothering you guys
while you were away. and...

01:34:45.549 --> 01:34:48.508
[Isaac sighs]

01:34:48.595 --> 01:34:49.379
- Anything?

01:34:51.642 --> 01:34:52.904
- No. nothing.

01:34:52.991 --> 01:34:54.645
- Um. all right.

01:34:54.732 --> 01:34:56.038
I'm gonna go grab my
car and drive around.

01:34:56.125 --> 01:34:57.517
see if I can find her.

01:34:57.604 --> 01:34:58.997
- Thought you said
you crashed your car?

01:34:59.868 --> 01:35:00.520
- Yeah.

01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:01.696
- Hey. Isaac.

01:35:03.523 --> 01:35:04.916
What're you here for?

01:35:05.003 --> 01:35:06.657
- I told you that.

01:35:06.744 --> 01:35:09.181
- No. what are you. what are
you really here for. man?

01:35:09.268 --> 01:35:10.139
- Protecting her.

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:13.098
- Protect who? From what?

01:35:17.624 --> 01:35:20.018
- Look Shane. I could've
made this all go away.

01:35:20.105 --> 01:35:22.760
Her worries. her
questions. everything.

01:35:22.847 --> 01:35:25.023
All I had to do is show her
that she was right about you.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:30.855
- So you're saying you have
evidence to tear us apart.

01:35:32.161 --> 01:35:33.902
That's what you want. right?

01:35:33.989 --> 01:35:35.033
- Yeah.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.688
- So why didn't you do it then?

01:35:37.775 --> 01:35:40.822
- 'Cause you and I both know
that if she knew the truth.

01:35:40.909 --> 01:35:42.127
she probably
wouldn't survive it.

01:35:42.214 --> 01:35:43.476
- I think you underestimate Gia.

01:35:43.563 --> 01:35:45.130
- Oh yeah?

01:35:45.217 --> 01:35:47.611
So I assume that you
admitted that you someone

01:35:47.698 --> 01:35:49.352
the night that she was
home all by herself.

01:35:49.439 --> 01:35:50.353
bleeding out in the bathroom--

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.702
- You better stop right there.

01:35:51.789 --> 01:35:54.052
- Or what? What's gonna happen?

01:35:54.139 --> 01:35:55.488
Huh?

01:35:55.575 --> 01:35:56.533
I know you're worried.

01:35:57.926 --> 01:35:59.405
I'd be worried out
of my mind too.

01:35:59.492 --> 01:36:01.407
especially with a
new baby and all.

01:36:01.494 --> 01:36:04.715
[deep tense music]

01:36:04.802 --> 01:36:05.760
Oh.

01:36:05.847 --> 01:36:06.630
- What?

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:08.545
What baby?

01:36:09.589 --> 01:36:10.590
- I let out the surprise.

01:36:11.635 --> 01:36:12.418
- Gia's pregnant?

01:36:13.855 --> 01:36:15.639
- I thought she
would've told you.

01:36:15.726 --> 01:36:18.076
[tense music]

01:36:19.512 --> 01:36:21.340
- How do you know that?

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:23.690
- It's mine. man.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:24.866
- You and her?

01:36:26.606 --> 01:36:27.520
- She just wanted to be loved.

01:36:27.607 --> 01:36:29.218
[Shane grunting]

01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:31.176
Get off me! Get off me!

01:36:32.438 --> 01:36:33.222
Huh?

01:36:34.832 --> 01:36:36.616
You don't deserve her!

01:36:37.661 --> 01:36:39.097
Be a man.

01:36:39.184 --> 01:36:41.708
[tense music]

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:44.581
[Shane yells]

01:36:44.668 --> 01:36:47.976
[dramatic music]

01:36:48.063 --> 01:36:50.761
[gentle music]

01:36:53.068 --> 01:36:55.244
- [Hostage] You came back.

01:36:56.462 --> 01:36:57.681
- But I don't wanna be here.

01:36:59.683 --> 01:37:01.903
- [Hostage] Neither did I.

01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:04.862
- What was I suppose to do?

01:37:04.949 --> 01:37:06.124
I didn't know.

01:37:07.909 --> 01:37:09.780
- Maybe you wanted me to hurt.

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:13.349
- [Gia] No. I wanted love.

01:37:13.436 --> 01:37:14.785
- Did you find it?

01:37:16.395 --> 01:37:17.179
Love?

01:37:19.398 --> 01:37:20.269
Look at me.

01:37:23.011 --> 01:37:25.013
Look at what she's
made you do to me.

01:37:26.101 --> 01:37:27.667
- [Mom] You've ruined my life.

01:37:27.754 --> 01:37:29.495
I hate you. You ruin everything.

01:37:29.582 --> 01:37:31.019
I hate you.

01:37:31.106 --> 01:37:33.586
I wish you were never
born. I hate you.

01:37:33.673 --> 01:37:34.587
You ruined my life.
- Stop.

01:37:34.674 --> 01:37:36.285
Stop. stop.

01:37:36.372 --> 01:37:37.634
- [Mom] I wish you
were never born.

01:37:37.721 --> 01:37:40.463
[Gia crying]

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:41.768
- You know you believed her.

01:37:43.031 --> 01:37:44.554
[Gia crying]

01:37:44.641 --> 01:37:46.773
- [Mom] I hate you. I
wish you were never born.

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:49.820
[Gia crying]

01:37:49.907 --> 01:37:53.389
- You didn't even give
me a chance. [crying]

01:37:55.391 --> 01:37:57.872
[Gia crying]

01:38:03.703 --> 01:38:05.531
Do you know who I am?

01:38:07.794 --> 01:38:08.578
- Yeah.

01:38:10.101 --> 01:38:11.059
You tell me.

01:38:13.975 --> 01:38:16.673
- Dr. Marcum. Dr.
Marcum. is Gia inside?

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.153
- [Dr. Marcum] Yes. And
you'll leave her be.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.806
- Like hell I will.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:23.854
- Isaac. Don't you forget
how well I know you too.

01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:25.421
You think she's weak.

01:38:27.379 --> 01:38:28.598
That she'll need you.

01:38:28.685 --> 01:38:29.816
- She came to me.

01:38:31.862 --> 01:38:34.082
- There's something
different about this one.

01:38:35.953 --> 01:38:36.432
- How so?

01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:42.699
- Unlike any one of us. we
become who we need to be.

01:38:42.786 --> 01:38:43.961
depending on the situation.

01:38:45.484 --> 01:38:48.923
But now Gia can't see
herself as she truly is.

01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:51.012
- But I. I know her.

01:38:53.014 --> 01:38:54.363
I know Gia. she's.

01:38:55.842 --> 01:38:57.366
she's not crazy.

01:38:57.453 --> 01:38:58.889
- I didn't say she's crazy.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.590
[sighs] I just hope that

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:10.161
she'll be able to
accept everything
that's happened to her.

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:16.037
All that she is. that she'll
become who she is at her core.

01:39:17.516 --> 01:39:19.910
- And who might
that be. Dr. Marcum?

01:39:19.997 --> 01:39:22.957
[tense scary music]

01:39:25.089 --> 01:39:28.571
- That's what you're
gonna help me figure out.

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:32.705
That is. if you still want to.

01:39:32.792 --> 01:39:35.099
[tense suspenseful music]

01:39:35.186 --> 01:39:36.927
- How do I know
she's gonna be safe?

01:39:37.014 --> 01:39:40.626
- Oh. we should have dealt
with these codependency issues

01:39:40.713 --> 01:39:41.888
when you were my patient.

01:39:41.976 --> 01:39:42.759
- Excuse me?

01:39:44.369 --> 01:39:45.501
- Oh. that should be Shane.

01:39:47.024 --> 01:39:49.592
- Wait. wait. you told
him that she's here too?

01:39:49.679 --> 01:39:51.072
- Don't look so shocked.

01:39:51.159 --> 01:39:52.682
He is her emergency contact.

01:39:54.075 --> 01:39:55.641
- You really enjoy
this. don't you?

01:39:55.728 --> 01:39:57.339
Manipulating people.
using their secrets

01:39:57.426 --> 01:39:59.645
to fulfill some need in your
own pathetic little life.

01:39:59.732 --> 01:40:01.256
- Oh. just as you do. honey.

01:40:02.909 --> 01:40:03.736
- [Shane] Where is she?

01:40:03.823 --> 01:40:04.607
- Hey.

01:40:04.694 --> 01:40:07.784
[tense somber music]

01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:10.917
[eerie music]

01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:14.617
- Gia. honey. what are
you doing? Just drop it.

01:40:15.661 --> 01:40:16.706
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:40:18.186 --> 01:40:19.883
- Do something. Do
something. will you?

01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:22.712
- Gia. what do you want?

01:40:22.799 --> 01:40:25.976
- You have no idea the
hell she put me through.

01:40:26.063 --> 01:40:27.499
- [Dr. Marcum] Amber.

01:40:27.586 --> 01:40:28.805
- I know about the baby.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.939
It's okay. I'm not mad.

01:40:34.289 --> 01:40:35.899
- I'm scared.

01:40:35.986 --> 01:40:37.292
- It's what you wanted.

01:40:37.379 --> 01:40:39.294
- You've heard your turn.

01:40:39.381 --> 01:40:41.948
- Gia. I've been
with you all along.

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:44.603
Please. I can take you away.

01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:45.952
- But I'm good at being Gia.

01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:49.913
- None of this was
supposed to be yours.

01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:52.524
- What is it you told me?

01:40:53.917 --> 01:40:56.659
Eventually everything ends.

01:40:56.746 --> 01:40:59.749
You. you're. you're
in control now.

01:40:59.836 --> 01:41:01.272
What do you want?

01:41:02.708 --> 01:41:06.973
You said it again. "I need her."

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:08.410
- Yes.

01:41:08.497 --> 01:41:09.672
- Who is her?

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:12.849
- My friend.

01:41:12.936 --> 01:41:14.894
- What does she
do when she comes?

01:41:15.765 --> 01:41:16.722
- She helps me.

01:41:16.809 --> 01:41:17.941
- How?

01:41:18.028 --> 01:41:19.856
- She protects me.

01:41:19.943 --> 01:41:21.640
- Does she have a name?

01:41:21.727 --> 01:41:24.382
[haunting music]

01:41:28.125 --> 01:41:29.953
So who are these other women?

01:41:30.954 --> 01:41:34.044
- Parts of me. of who I was.

01:41:35.001 --> 01:41:37.091
But they're outside of me.

01:41:37.178 --> 01:41:40.006
I can talk to them
and touch them.

01:41:41.225 --> 01:41:42.661
Yet. they're inside of me too.

01:41:44.272 --> 01:41:46.143
- [Dr. Marcum] And when
you're on the medication?

01:41:49.625 --> 01:41:51.627
- It's like they're sleeping.

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:57.023
- So do you think
it would be helpful

01:41:57.111 --> 01:41:58.329
to let your husband
know about this?

01:41:58.416 --> 01:42:00.984
- No. He needs Gia.

01:42:02.028 --> 01:42:02.812
We both do.

01:42:03.987 --> 01:42:07.251
You like me like
this. Don't you?

01:42:07.338 --> 01:42:08.948
- [Isaac] Yeah. I do.

01:42:09.035 --> 01:42:13.127
- Do you think that this ideal
version will sustain itself

01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.390
when times get tough?

01:42:15.477 --> 01:42:18.088

[hostage crying]

01:42:26.879 --> 01:42:28.751
- You did what you had to do.

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:33.147
Please. please. let
me have a chance.

01:42:38.935 --> 01:42:43.896
- She's gone and
left me an orphan.

01:42:48.684 --> 01:42:51.077
[Gia sighs]

01:42:53.428 --> 01:42:54.864
- You're still holding back.

01:42:57.606 --> 01:42:58.955
That's the thing
about this business.

01:42:59.042 --> 01:43:00.783
you can be whatever
you wanna be.

01:43:02.219 --> 01:43:03.307
I don't know.

01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:08.094
With you. I. I'm
still seeing Gia.

01:43:09.922 --> 01:43:11.141
- I. I don't know
what to tell you.

01:43:11.228 --> 01:43:14.013
I'm doing what I
learned in class.

01:43:15.014 --> 01:43:17.539
- Just stop.

01:43:21.238 --> 01:43:25.068
Just lose control
for one moment?

01:43:27.984 --> 01:43:29.115
Stop putting things on.

01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:36.166
And start being.

01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:41.476
Let's try something different.

01:43:41.563 --> 01:43:44.522
[Gia clears throat]

01:43:59.058 --> 01:44:02.497
- Do you know why you're
sitting in a chair?

01:44:02.584 --> 01:44:04.673
It's because you're weak.

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.762
It's because you
have no confidence.

01:44:06.849 --> 01:44:08.981
It's because you
have no strength.

01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:11.288
It's because I'm
better than you.

01:44:11.375 --> 01:44:14.160
It's because you
have so much fear.

01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:18.121
It's because you have
so much to be afraid of.

01:44:18.208 --> 01:44:18.643
- Freeze.

01:44:20.341 --> 01:44:25.041
Gia. ask yourself. is this
the character you wanna be?

01:44:28.523 --> 01:44:30.089
We can end the scene right now.

01:44:30.176 --> 01:44:33.963
and this is the narrative
you chose to leave us with.

01:44:35.530 --> 01:44:38.097
Or you can choose to
change that narrative.

01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:42.276
This is your scene. not Joe's.

01:44:43.886 --> 01:44:45.540
So it's in your hands.

[gentle somber music]

01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:09.259

[Gia laughs]

01:45:19.138 --> 01:45:22.316
[gentle somber music]

01:45:25.275 --> 01:45:26.276
It's not your fault.
