00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.148
Hello.

2
00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.734
Can we interest you
in some cookies?

3
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:48.020
I'd be delighted.

4
00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:52.503
I will take two boxes.

5
00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:56.463
For Frank.

6
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:03.079
Here you go.

7
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.128
Well. aren't you the most
adorable little girl

8
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:09.258
I've ever seen.

9
00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:15.004
Are you all right?

10
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.875
Yes. darling.

11
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:18.006
You can run along now.

12
00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:47.138
You sure as hell
picked the wrong house.

13
00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:51.535
All right.

14
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:30.661
You want some water.
something to eat?

15
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:32.402
I can have somebody
get you something.

16
00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:39.364
You a God-fearing man. Buddy?

17
00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.807
I ain't been to church.

18
00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.264
It can be a hard commitment trying
to make ends meet. what

19
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.422
with a newborn baby. right?

20
00:04:52.553 --> 00:04:55.338
Yeah.

21
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.734
I wasn't very religious myself
growing up. but.

22
00:04:59.864 --> 00:05:02.040
this job has shown me some
things... things that.

23
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.260
I can't erase from my mind.

24
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:08.873
And they've been burned
into my soul forever.

25
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:12.703
I have to admit there have been
some moments when I wasn't

26
00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:15.271
sure I'd be able
to go on. but then

27
00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:19.449
my faith carries me through.

28
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.409
You ever have moments like that?

29
00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.844
You feel like right now
might be one of those moments?

30
00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:30.939
Well. sure am sorry about this.

31
00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.873
I mean. breaking and entering.
that's one thing.

32
00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:33.985
But murder?

33
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:36.640
Damn. that is a
whole other story.

34
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:40.078
And I hate to tell you
that all signs clearly point

35
00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:41.340
to you being the murderer.

36
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:47.738
I want you to help me
understand your side.

37
00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:57.444
Take your time. deep breaths
and all. and tell me what happened.

38
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.543
Give me just a minute
of your time. sir.

39
00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:11.545
Now. remember I
said profit margins

40
00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:12.870
were growing last week. right?

41
00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:15.853
Well. they didn't stop.

42
00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:17.681
Look at this.

43
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:22.164
Success story. after
success story. after success story.

44
00:06:22.294 --> 00:06:24.471
I mean. the list goes on. man.

45
00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:26.341
It's... it's... it's...
Guaranteed money.

46
00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:31.260
Look. what does the Lord say?

47
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.783
You reap what you sow.

48
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:34.437
Right?

49
00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.003
You sow one of this. I'm telling
you. man. you will reap.

50
00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:39.616
You know.
that's... that's... that's the truth.

51
00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:41.270
I... look. I gotta go.

52
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.943
You... you give me a call
if you. change your mind?

53
00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:43.446
All right?

54
00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.230
OK.

55
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:46.361
Hey. baby.

56
00:06:48.756 --> 00:06:50.801
Hey.

57
00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:52.934
You all right?

58
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.418
She is coughing
again this morning.

59
00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:00.855
We need to get her
to a doctor soon.

60
00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:01.985
Yeah. we will.

61
00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:05.945
May have to wait till
after the storm. though.

62
00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:09.733
I got some good
things in the works.

63
00:07:09.864 --> 00:07:12.910
Buddy. we've talked about this.

64
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:14.912
I believe in you.
and I know things

65
00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:16.281
are going to come
through eventually.

66
00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:18.307
but we need money now.

67
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.396
I know.

68
00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:21.876
You're right.

69
00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:23.530
I saw a sign out front.

70
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.314
They need bussers.

71
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.510
I'll do manual labor myself if
I can get a sitter for Emily...

72
00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:28.230
No.

73
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.100
Absolutely not.

74
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.101
No. no.

75
00:07:30.232 --> 00:07:31.494
I'm gonna take care of it.

76
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.670
Now. Frank called today
about a fencing job.

77
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.674
I guess I got requested.
so l'll go down and see if I

78
00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.461
can get some cash up front. or.

79
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:42.591
OK.

80
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.747
Listen. I've been thinking.

81
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:53.211
It's been intense lately.

82
00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:54.517
A bit stressful.

83
00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:00.784
I was just thinking maybe
we let your sister watch Emily

84
00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:03.570
for a weekend. and.
you know. we have

85
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.355
just a little one-on-one time.

86
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.357
Seriously?

87
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.663
It's been six months.

88
00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:14.798
I know. I'm sorry.

89
00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:18.715
And I know you've been patient.

90
00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:23.241
Since the baby. I
just don't feel sexy.

91
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.161
Just give me a bit more time.

92
00:08:33.904 --> 00:08:35.776
All right.

93
00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:52.008
Hey. there.

94
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.098
I'm here about the fence.

95
00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:02.605
Look. somebody called
and requested I come.

96
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:03.891
Buddy.

97
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.901
What happened?

98
00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:15.206
Can you fix it?

99
00:09:15.337 --> 00:09:16.773
It shouldn't be a problem.

100
00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:18.514
Today.

101
00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.492
Well. today was just supposed
to be the estimate.

102
00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:22.605
You know. we got a
hurricane coming.

103
00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.215
It's just a piece of fence.

104
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.913
It's not even 1 o'clock yet.

105
00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:28.002
You got plenty of time.

106
00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:30.178
I'll make it worth your while.

107
00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:33.355
Worth my while?

108
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:34.485
What you thinking?

109
00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:38.969
There he is.
mister negotiator all of a sudden.

110
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.144
What's it gonna cost me?

111
00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:44.584
Let's see.

112
00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:46.760
You gotta replace
this whole part.

113
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.763
so. I mean. that's probably.
what. seven feet?

114
00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:52.592
So that's about 10
bucks a post. tax.

115
00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:54.028
you're looking at around 100.

116
00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:58.641
So all in. I'd say.
200 would be safe.

117
00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:06.040
Well. you get it done the
day. I'll give you 250.

118
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.997
300?

119
00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:07.911
240. final offer.

120
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:09.042
Deal.

121
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.523
I want it done today.

122
00:10:11.654 --> 00:10:13.917
Where were you stationed?

123
00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:17.921
1st Battalion 10th Marines.
Camp Lejeune. North Carolina.

124
00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.052
Gunslingers. right?

125
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.103
How'd you know that?

126
00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:27.234
Navy man.

127
00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:28.758
Just got back.

128
00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:30.586
Well. I'll be damned.

129
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:32.762
Yeah. I know they call
y'all squids. but you

130
00:10:32.893 --> 00:10:36.418
look more like a tadpole to me.

131
00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:38.507
What do they call
you Marines again?

132
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.858
If you call me a jarhead.
you watch what happens.

133
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:50.301
I'm just fucking with you.

134
00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:51.432
Get to work.

135
00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:06.883
The way you wear your hat.

136
00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:11.714
The way you sip your tea.

137
00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:13.977
The memory of all that.

138
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:25.685
No. they can't take
that away from me.

139
00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:29.123
The way you smile just beams.

140
00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:34.128
The way you sing off-key.

141
00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:43.659
The way you haunt my dreams.

142
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.533
No. they can't take
that away from me.

143
00:11:53.451 --> 00:11:54.757
Happy anniversary. baby.

144
00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:08.510
What are you doing?

145
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.165
What's it look like?

146
00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:13.776
All these years.
I still don't mean that much to you.

147
00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.343
Shit.

148
00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:17.519
Baby doll.

149
00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:19.173
I don't want to hear it!

150
00:12:19.303 --> 00:12:22.045
I messed up.

151
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:27.137
To think I put this on for you.

152
00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:34.057
I apologize. OK?

153
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:35.188
I don't want it.

154
00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:42.326
I love you the same.
so much. every day.

155
00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:45.765
I don't know why one day has to
be more important than all

156
00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:47.549
the rest of them.

157
00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:54.948
Because it is the day our
love merged and was forever united.

158
00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:58.995
I don't know why every
year I think maybe...

159
00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:02.694
Maybe this year Walter will come
to a deeper understanding.

160
00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:04.131
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:07.308
I don't know what
else I can say or do.

162
00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:10.659
Why don't you do what
a man's supposed to do.

163
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.531
And what is that exactly?

164
00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:16.099
Paint the house.

165
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.972
Mow the lawn.

166
00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:23.411
Make love to me like
a real man instead

167
00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:25.892
of sitting on your lazy
ass and getting drunk all day.

168
00:13:42.473 --> 00:13:48.305
Now. you push me
once. I can let it go.

169
00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:52.483
Push me twice. I might react.

170
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:58.707
Do it.

171
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.404
Go on.

172
00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:03.451
Hurt me. Walter.

173
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:06.019
Hurt me real bad.

174
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.934
Let's see if you got the balls.

175
00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:20.468
I knew it.

176
00:14:20.598 --> 00:14:22.905
You simply lack what it
takes to follow through.

177
00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:05.861
And in local news.

178
00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:08.168
another teenager has
been reported missing.

179
00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:12.085
16-year-old Jeff Goudet was
last seen wearing a black tracksuit

180
00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:13.651
with white stripes.

181
00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:15.348
Members of the
public should contact.

182
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.481
Detective Jones of the
Sheriff's Department

183
00:15:17.612 --> 00:15:19.570
if they have any information.

184
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.357
And now over to Jessica
for updates on the hurricane.

185
00:15:23.487 --> 00:15:24.967
As you can see. Hurricane Jody

186
00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:27.448
is now a Category 3
storm out in the Gulf.

187
00:15:27.578 --> 00:15:29.493
But models expect
it to gain strength

188
00:15:29.624 --> 00:15:30.930
before it makes landfall.

189
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.958
You look like you're
about to pass out.

190
00:16:02.222 --> 00:16:04.354
No. ma'am. I'm... I'm good.

192
00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:06.966
Who you calling ma'am?

193
00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:09.664
I'm very sorry... Missus...

194
00:16:09.794 --> 00:16:13.798
Fancy. short for
Francine Mae Franklin.

195
00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:15.844
Your name?

196
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.715
Buddy.

197
00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:19.239
It's a pleasure to meet you.

198
00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:25.113
You want some?

199
00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:31.859
Iced tea.

200
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:36.560
Yeah.

201
00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:38.345
Yeah. that sounds
nice. actually.

202
00:16:42.218 --> 00:16:44.351
Seems kind of down
to try and fix a fence

203
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:46.198
right before a hurricane
comes. but that's

204
00:16:46.222 --> 00:16:47.832
my idiot husband for you.

205
00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.051
It's all right.

206
00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:51.271
I... I like to
finish what I start.

207
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:55.101
You live far from here?

208
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:56.711
On the other side of town.

209
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:59.105
I can make it home if I hurry.

210
00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:02.978
I always loved the
calm before a storm.

211
00:17:03.109 --> 00:17:04.109
Birds are smart.

212
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.026
Why's that?

213
00:17:10.725 --> 00:17:13.075
They leave before it arrives.

214
00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:14.337
They can sense the danger.

215
00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:19.951
Well. thank you very much.

216
00:17:20.082 --> 00:17:22.780
I should probably
get back to it.

217
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:23.911
You're very welcome.

218
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.532
Shit!

219
00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:37.534
Are you OK?

220
00:17:37.665 --> 00:17:38.665
Yeah.

221
00:17:38.753 --> 00:17:40.885
Yes. ma'am. I'm fine. I'm fine.

222
00:17:41.016 --> 00:17:43.540
Come on. let me see.

223
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:44.802
It's all right. I promise.

224
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:46.848
I'm good.

225
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:50.111
Come on inside.

226
00:17:50.156 --> 00:17:51.417
We'll get you all cleaned up.

227
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:52.767
I appreciate that. but I...

228
00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:54.310
I really gotta finish
up here and get home...

229
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:55.334
I'm not asking.

230
00:18:16.573 --> 00:18:20.142
Thanks. but I... I can...
I can do that.

232
00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:21.839
No guest of mine
will not be attended

233
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.711
to by the queen of this house.

234
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:26.235
Are you the queen of this house?

235
00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:27.889
No. I'm not.

236
00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:30.413
Exactly.

237
00:18:30.544 --> 00:18:31.544
Let me see.

238
00:18:40.945 --> 00:18:42.208
All better.

239
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:52.740
What. we good here?

240
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.264
I hurt my hand.

241
00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:56.395
Did you. now?

242
00:19:01.183 --> 00:19:02.618
I'm... I'm try and finish up.

243
00:19:05.492 --> 00:19:08.234
You just can't help
yourself. can you?

244
00:19:08.364 --> 00:19:09.104
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:11.498
Does that bother you?

246
00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:12.934
Doesn't bother me one bit.

247
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.325
Hey. what the hell?

248
00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:48.072
Fucking asshole.

249
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:53.164
Are you fucking kidding me?

250
00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:56.318
What the fuck's the matter with
you. asshole?

251
00:20:56.342 --> 00:20:59.170
There you are.

252
00:21:35.206 --> 00:21:37.165
Hey. I'm...

253
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.166
I'm real sorry. but I
wasn't able to finish.

254
00:21:39.254 --> 00:21:42.562
I can come back early next week. wrap it up.

255
00:21:42.692 --> 00:21:44.172
It's gonna be 100. then.

256
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:48.350
You didn't live up to
your end of the bargain.

257
00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:50.221
Come on. man.

258
00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.503
It started raining out there.

259
00:21:51.527 --> 00:21:52.659
It's not my fault.

260
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:53.897
Looks like the good Lord doesn't

261
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:56.663
want you to make extra money.

262
00:21:56.793 --> 00:21:57.793
That's gotta hurt.

263
00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:04.975
Fine.

264
00:22:05.106 --> 00:22:07.978
Thank you.
for the iced tea and the Band-Aid.

265
00:22:08.109 --> 00:22:09.763
You're very welcome.

266
00:22:09.893 --> 00:22:12.853
How would you like
to stay for dinner?

267
00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:16.073
That's. very kind of you. but. actually.

268
00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:17.834
my... my daughter's a
little under the weather

269
00:22:17.858 --> 00:22:19.598
and my wife's at home
taking care of her.

270
00:22:19.642 --> 00:22:22.558
so I should. you know.
make sure they're all right in the storm.

271
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:23.777
Of course.

272
00:22:23.907 --> 00:22:25.126
You hear that. Walt?

273
00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:27.476
This man actually
cares for his family.

274
00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:30.523
Outstanding.

275
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.773
No. no. no. no. no.

276
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:41.028
Let me get this straight.

277
00:23:41.158 --> 00:23:44.640
You said your truck
wouldn't start.

278
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:51.168
Yeah.

279
00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:53.432
I mean. no.

280
00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:55.695
Is it yes or no?

281
00:23:55.825 --> 00:23:56.825
No.

282
00:23:59.263 --> 00:24:02.789
Had you ever met
the Franklins before that day?

283
00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:04.486
Seen Walt around
town a few times.

284
00:24:04.617 --> 00:24:06.532
Never spoke to him.

285
00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:08.272
OK.

286
00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:12.842
And you robbed a liquor
store with a spray painted BB gun.

287
00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:16.845
Yeah.

288
00:24:21.895 --> 00:24:24.463
My dad needed his booze.
and l wasn't prepared to take

289
00:24:24.593 --> 00:24:26.508
another ass whooping.

290
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:28.399
You ever wonder what you might
have done if the store

291
00:24:28.423 --> 00:24:29.771
clerk had refused your demands?

292
00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:33.645
Never thought about it.

293
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:41.001
Looks like I just hit a nerve.

294
00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:42.306
I didn't mean to.

295
00:24:42.437 --> 00:24:44.003
I'm just trying to
find out if you're

296
00:24:44.047 --> 00:24:47.137
the type of guy who secret likes
hurting other people.

297
00:24:47.268 --> 00:24:50.924
Are you that kind of guy. Buddy?

298
00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:55.798
No. I'm not.

299
00:24:55.929 --> 00:24:58.497
You seem to be forgetting l'm
trying to help you.

300
00:24:58.627 --> 00:25:00.149
But I need you to
help me in return.

301
00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:03.545
Now. if you are a God-fearing man like I am.

302
00:25:03.676 --> 00:25:06.330
you also know that
God can forgive you.

303
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:09.072
The question is.
can you forgive yourself for what you did?

304
00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:16.993
I didn't do anything.

305
00:25:17.124 --> 00:25:18.342
So you went back inside.

306
00:25:30.093 --> 00:25:31.617
What is it. tadpole?

307
00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:33.401
Can't swim?

308
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.272
My... my truck won't start.

309
00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:37.448
If... if I left my equipment
and my truck here.

310
00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:39.015
could I use your car to go home?

311
00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:41.496
I... I gotta check on my family.

312
00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:44.194
What. you think I'll let you
pull some backdoor trade

313
00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:46.283
and leave me with a
beat-up truck while

314
00:25:46.414 --> 00:25:48.198
you steal my Mach 1 Mustang?

315
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.638
Backdoor trade. man?

316
00:25:52.768 --> 00:25:55.554
You... you best get comfy.

317
00:25:55.684 --> 00:25:57.338
Look. I... I gotta call my wife.

319
00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:59.819
Can I use your phone?

320
00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:00.949
Be my guest.

321
00:26:23.886 --> 00:26:24.757
Hello?

322
00:26:24.887 --> 00:26:25.453
Hey. babe.

323
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:25.975
Hey. it's me.

324
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:26.715
Hey.

325
00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:27.586
Where are you?

326
00:26:27.716 --> 00:26:30.197
I've been worried sick.

327
00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:30.937
I got stuck at my job.

328
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:33.200
I... What do you
mean you got stuck?

330
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.724
I know. I'm sorry.

331
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:42.862
It's not my fault.
I tried to finish. and it started raining.

332
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.255
The truck was stalling.

333
00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:47.431
Damn it. Buddy.

334
00:26:47.562 --> 00:26:49.540
You shouldn't have waited so
long to try and leave.

335
00:26:49.564 --> 00:26:51.871
Now you can't even call a cab.

336
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:53.350
Yeah. I can't leave.

337
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.790
How's Emily?

338
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.227
She's still coughing.

339
00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:06.233
Missing you.

340
00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:09.976
Listen. stay away from the
windows. you know.

341
00:27:10.106 --> 00:27:11.151
It shouldn't be too bad.

342
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:13.893
I'll be home as soon as I can.

343
00:27:17.897 --> 00:27:20.029
Great.

344
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.682
You just stay there nice and cozy
at some stranger's house.

345
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:25.644
We'll be fine on our own.

346
00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:31.736
If you'd like to make a call...
Love you.

348
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:38.395
Happiness?

349
00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:40.354
Come on. have some wine. relax.

350
00:27:40.484 --> 00:27:43.009
I... I don't really drink.

351
00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:44.706
We got a hurricane coming.

352
00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:46.273
What else are you gonna do?

353
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.281
All right.

354
00:27:54.411 --> 00:27:55.804
Semper Fi.

355
00:28:27.923 --> 00:28:28.923
How's the meatloaf?

356
00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:32.448
Really great.

357
00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:45.549
So how'd you two meet?

358
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.336
You don't want to
hear about any of that.

359
00:28:49.466 --> 00:28:52.339
We met shortly after
Walt came back from Nam.

360
00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:58.824
I was singing in a
club in New Orleans...

361
00:28:58.954 --> 00:29:00.564
Jazz singer.

362
00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:03.350
Walt came in to watch.

363
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:09.138
He was an alluring mix
of strength and courage. hope.

364
00:29:18.495 --> 00:29:21.977
How times have changed.

365
00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:23.282
Where'd you meet your wife?

366
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:30.551
Well. we. met in sixth grade.

367
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:33.902
And I... I knew right
then she was the one.

368
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.645
Got married when we
graduated high school.

369
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.603
That's beautiful.

370
00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.431
What's so beautiful about it?

371
00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:44.347
The poor bastard's only gonna
sleep with one woman

372
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:47.046
for the rest of his
life. if he doesn't get

373
00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:48.830
divorced before he turns 30.

374
00:30:01.234 --> 00:30:02.757
How long have you
two been married?

375
00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:04.672
15 years tonight.

376
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:10.330
But we've known each
other way. way. way longer.

377
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.898
It seems like a lifetime.

378
00:30:13.028 --> 00:30:14.421
Multiple lifetimes.

379
00:30:19.643 --> 00:30:24.344
Buddy. how would
you like a mint julep?

380
00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:26.999
It's my great-grandmother's recipe.

381
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:28.129
Sounds great.

382
00:30:40.664 --> 00:30:45.060
Looks like it's just me and you.

383
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:46.714
You a football fan?

384
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:49.195
More a baseball guy.

385
00:30:49.325 --> 00:30:50.413
Eh.

386
00:30:50.544 --> 00:30:53.808
Makes sense you
like a soft sport.

387
00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:56.942
You know. ever since the
NFL strike. it's been nothing

388
00:30:57.072 --> 00:31:00.206
but lies and deception.

389
00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:04.210
You... you... you know
about deception. don't you?

390
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.733
Not sure I follow.

391
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:08.823
I mean. I can tell
you're having problems at home.

392
00:31:08.954 --> 00:31:11.782
An example. when
was the last time you

393
00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:16.744
had your. cock. sucked?

394
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:17.876
Excuse me?

395
00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:19.006
That long?

396
00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:20.530
Egad.

397
00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:22.010
You know what else I can tell?

398
00:31:23.577 --> 00:31:24.970
What's that?

399
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.667
I can tell you
want to fuck my wife.

400
00:31:26.797 --> 00:31:27.797
What?

401
00:31:28.147 --> 00:31:29.975
What'd I miss?

402
00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:33.239
Buddy here was just telling
me how lonely he is.

403
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:35.850
Appears he and his
wife haven't been able to spend

404
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:37.547
any quality time together.

405
00:31:37.678 --> 00:31:38.897
I never said that.

406
00:31:39.027 --> 00:31:40.352
That woman must
be out of her mind

407
00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:42.137
if she doesn't know how
to take care of you.

408
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:44.685
Yeah.

409
00:31:44.815 --> 00:31:46.426
She treats me fine.

410
00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:51.126
You are a smart. fine.
well-spoken young man.

411
00:31:51.257 --> 00:31:53.215
If she can't see that.
then shame on her.

412
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:01.397
How's that julep taste?

413
00:32:04.313 --> 00:32:05.749
It's really nice.

414
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:24.551
I'm go check on Walt.

415
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.874
There are still no updates tonight

416
00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:46.965
on the disappearance of local
teenager Jeff Goudet.

417
00:32:47.095 --> 00:32:51.099
who is the fourth local teenager
to go missing recently.

418
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.797
So far the Sheriff's
Department have no leads

419
00:32:53.928 --> 00:32:56.104
on any of the missing
children and no reason

420
00:32:56.235 --> 00:32:59.716
to believe that these
cases are linked.

421
00:32:59.847 --> 00:33:03.111
Stay tuned to Grand Isle News for
updates on all local news.

422
00:33:03.242 --> 00:33:04.591
And now. the weather.

423
00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:10.989
How about I give you
a tour of the house?

424
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:11.859
It's all right.

425
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.253
I... I was just gonna...

426
00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:17.778
This is obviously
Walter's favorite room.

427
00:33:17.908 --> 00:33:22.217
This house has been in
my family for over 150 years.

428
00:33:22.348 --> 00:33:26.047
My great-great-grandfather
was a big time real estate man.

429
00:33:26.178 --> 00:33:29.181
My grandparents
loved this house.

430
00:33:29.311 --> 00:33:34.273
Sometimes I think I can
feel their presence.

431
00:33:34.403 --> 00:33:36.710
In here we used
to entertain over

432
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.844
half the city throwing
parties like you wouldn't believe.

433
00:33:40.975 --> 00:33:43.934
Not anymore.

434
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:48.635
Well. you already
know the kitchen.

435
00:33:48.765 --> 00:33:49.765
What's in here?

436
00:34:00.168 --> 00:34:01.474
Bad things. Buddy.

437
00:34:05.608 --> 00:34:06.914
Real bad things.

438
00:34:11.962 --> 00:34:13.312
I'm just messing with you.

439
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:16.160
That just leads down
to the basement.

440
00:34:16.184 --> 00:34:19.492
There's nothing down
there but storage.

441
00:34:19.622 --> 00:34:21.450
Come on. let's go upstairs.

442
00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:42.775
This is my favorite
room in the house.

443
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.172
Come on in.

444
00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:49.652
You can have a seat here.

445
00:34:49.783 --> 00:34:51.176
Oof!

446
00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:53.613
I'm change into something
more comfortable.

447
00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:05.146
Despite all the rain coming down.
it is still so damn hot.

448
00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:30.171
Is it true that your
wife don't treat you right?

449
00:35:30.302 --> 00:35:31.085
No.

450
00:35:31.216 --> 00:35:32.260
No. she's... she's good.

451
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:36.045
It's... you know. it's just...
Just what?

453
00:35:40.268 --> 00:35:45.621
I... just... It...
since Emily...

455
00:35:45.752 --> 00:35:48.015
Connected like we used to.

456
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:51.540
You know. it just...
Just built up distance.

457
00:35:51.671 --> 00:35:55.153
Well. I understand how
a child changes everything.

458
00:35:58.112 --> 00:36:01.376
Ever since I was a little girl.
I have always wanted

459
00:36:01.507 --> 00:36:06.207
a huge family of my very own.

460
00:36:06.338 --> 00:36:08.556
Do you and...
and Walter have... Have kids?

462
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:15.564
The Lord didn't
grant me the ability.

463
00:36:15.695 --> 00:36:21.875
I can't have one... Medically.

465
00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:25.226
I see.

466
00:36:25.357 --> 00:36:26.749
There are always other measures.

467
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:31.535
Walter and I have had to
make some hard choices.

468
00:36:36.803 --> 00:36:39.632
Does your wife have a job?

469
00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:40.894
No.

470
00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:43.201
Just the yougin'.

471
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:46.378
It's so unfortunate she doesn't
realize what she has.

472
00:36:46.508 --> 00:36:48.031
We'll figure it out.

473
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.341
Without the sweet touch
of love. we ain't got nothing.

474
00:36:57.824 --> 00:37:01.480
Have you ever been
with another woman?

475
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:02.828
Well. that's a bit personal.

476
00:37:06.572 --> 00:37:09.618
Well. then. let me
rephrase the question.

477
00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:12.230
Have you ever been
with an older woman?

478
00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:18.627
Have you ever
fantasized about it?

479
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:24.720
I've never been
with a younger man.

480
00:37:24.851 --> 00:37:27.984
Never had the opportunity.

481
00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:31.640
But I have fantasized
about it many times.

482
00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:37.211
You know what I do to
myself when I fantasize?

483
00:37:40.127 --> 00:37:41.259
I could probably guess.

484
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.134
Can I tell you my
young boy fantasy?

485
00:37:50.093 --> 00:37:51.093
If you'd like.

486
00:37:53.793 --> 00:37:59.146
Well. he walks me
into a luscious garden

487
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:00.277
filled with flowers.

488
00:38:02.758 --> 00:38:07.197
And then he kisses me
real soft-like on the lips.

489
00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:13.813
Then he kisses my neck.
and then my breast. and then my stomach.

490
00:38:16.772 --> 00:38:20.559
Then he's down on his knees
right in front of me.

491
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:27.522
And then he starts
kissing my thighs.

492
00:38:36.009 --> 00:38:38.403
Should I keep going?

493
00:38:46.498 --> 00:38:48.848
OK.

494
00:38:48.978 --> 00:38:54.810
And then he opens my legs.

495
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:57.770
I... I...

497
00:40:32.168 --> 00:40:34.649
He's gone.

498
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.346
You're crazy.

499
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:38.697
Residents are advised to stay indoors

500
00:40:38.827 --> 00:40:40.699
and away from any windows.

501
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:43.484
We have received reports that
many roads and bridges

502
00:40:43.615 --> 00:40:45.355
are completely flooded.

503
00:40:45.486 --> 00:40:47.749
The governor has declared a
state of emergency.

504
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.795
and the National Guard
has been dispatched

505
00:40:49.925 --> 00:40:53.929
to assist local officials
with rescue and recovery procedures.

506
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.323
The Sheriff's Office has asked
residents to remain...

507
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:11.703
Hey.

508
00:42:16.272 --> 00:42:17.272
What's up?

509
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:33.768
I thought we might get
a drink. have a little talk.

510
00:42:47.477 --> 00:42:48.477
Come on up.

511
00:42:52.047 --> 00:42:53.571
Why don't you take a seat?

512
00:42:57.183 --> 00:42:58.183
That one.

513
00:43:15.723 --> 00:43:23.723
You ever... you ever
think about your own death?

514
00:43:24.645 --> 00:43:25.645
Not lately.

515
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:31.217
I think about mine every day.

516
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:36.048
It forces me to have gratitude.

517
00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:40.139
That's something you
don't know about.

518
00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:43.533
I'm grateful.

519
00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:47.059
You've got a beautiful
young wife and daughter at home.

520
00:43:47.189 --> 00:43:48.669
and you're messing it all up.

521
00:43:51.759 --> 00:43:55.154
Besides. people only
know gratitude when they're faced

522
00:43:55.284 --> 00:43:58.505
with life and death choices.

523
00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:02.074
That's the real
tragedy of life...

524
00:44:02.204 --> 00:44:03.204
Unappreciation.

525
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.475
So what'd you see
on the USS Stark?

526
00:44:16.523 --> 00:44:19.091
How'd you know I
was on that ship?

527
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:23.182
You think I'd just
invite anybody into my home?

528
00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:25.575
Y'all watched it on the news.

529
00:44:25.706 --> 00:44:28.970
You saw some shit. didn't you.
Mr. Action Jackson?

530
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:44.377
My career in Nam began
and ended when I was 17.

531
00:44:47.032 --> 00:44:49.251
Bullshit. that's the reason.

532
00:44:49.382 --> 00:44:54.082
I caught shrapnel in my
left knee from friendly fire.

533
00:44:56.955 --> 00:44:59.261
I was all set to go out
on my first mission.

534
00:44:59.392 --> 00:45:01.611
and some jackass boot
wasn't paying attention

535
00:45:01.742 --> 00:45:04.876
and let his grenade
go off during a drill.

536
00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:08.444
And I was the
only motherfucker who got hurt.

537
00:45:12.318 --> 00:45:14.407
Everybody else went out
on mission the next day.

538
00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:17.105
and I got sent home.

539
00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:17.932
I protested.

540
00:45:18.063 --> 00:45:20.892
I asked to go back.

541
00:45:21.022 --> 00:45:23.982
They weren't having it.

542
00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:26.636
That sucks.

543
00:45:26.767 --> 00:45:34.253
Two weeks later.
my entire squad.

544
00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:40.563
every single one of them.
got killed on mission

545
00:45:40.694 --> 00:45:41.694
just south of Da Nang.

546
00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:51.661
And I should have
been there with them.

547
00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:56.623
I should have died with them.

548
00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:59.147
Go out in a blaze of bullets.

549
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:03.890
Pow!

550
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:10.854
So what'd you see?

551
00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:16.948
Well...

552
00:46:17.078 --> 00:46:18.752
Are you gonna tell me
like we're old friends.

553
00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:20.536
or am I gonna have to
force it out of you?

554
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.560
Come on.

555
00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:26.784
Like you saw on the news.

556
00:46:30.222 --> 00:46:34.095
On 17th May.
Iraqi bomber dropped a couple missiles.

557
00:46:34.226 --> 00:46:40.362
and it penetrated the hull.
ignited the fuel lines.

558
00:46:40.493 --> 00:46:46.412
and it spread
quickly throughout.

559
00:46:49.545 --> 00:46:53.158
37 dead. including
my buddy Carl.

560
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:02.820
I tried to help him.
but... but... it...

561
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:08.738
His body burned
beyond recognition.

562
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:19.140
What did the United
States military offer

563
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:22.013
you in return for your service?

564
00:47:22.143 --> 00:47:24.015
Nothing.

565
00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:26.756
Jack shit.

566
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:29.890
They told us we were
the important ones

567
00:47:30.021 --> 00:47:34.199
when they shipped us off to war.
made us feel like somebody.

568
00:47:34.329 --> 00:47:37.985
And then when were turned. they spat on us

569
00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:41.467
and called us scumbag filth.

570
00:47:41.597 --> 00:47:47.908
This entire system is programmed
for the American youth

571
00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:52.304
to die so that the
blubbery old Washington

572
00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:55.960
fat cats can stay rich.

573
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.397
That's all right.

574
00:47:58.527 --> 00:48:01.139
That's OK.

575
00:48:01.269 --> 00:48:08.059
'Cause this here. me and
you. this is destiny.

576
00:48:11.236 --> 00:48:12.236
Why's that?

577
00:48:23.204 --> 00:48:30.342
$20.000.

578
00:48:30.472 --> 00:48:34.041
Why are you showing it to me?

579
00:48:34.172 --> 00:48:36.261
It's what I'm gonna
pay you to kill my wife.

580
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:48.577
You got a weird
sense of humor. man.

581
00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:54.540
Six months ago she was diagnosed

582
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.977
with terminal blood
cancer. and there

583
00:48:57.108 --> 00:49:00.894
ain't no coming back from that.

584
00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:03.114
She's about to
start suffering real

585
00:49:03.244 --> 00:49:04.724
bad like you wouldn't believe.

586
00:49:04.854 --> 00:49:08.206
And I... I just...

587
00:49:08.336 --> 00:49:10.556
I'd do it myself. but I
haven't got the heart.

588
00:49:14.386 --> 00:49:15.953
I'll make it real easy for you.

589
00:49:20.566 --> 00:49:24.396
Son. you just cover
her mouth with it.

590
00:49:24.526 --> 00:49:25.875
and she'll be gone in minutes.

591
00:49:26.006 --> 00:49:30.228
You just.

592
00:49:30.358 --> 00:49:35.929
$20.000 would take care
of all your problems.

593
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:40.064
including your sick kid.

594
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:44.677
$20.000 would set up
your future real nice.

595
00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:47.462
It'd make your old
lady real happy.

596
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.600
Please.

597
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:56.036
Please.

598
00:49:56.167 --> 00:50:00.127
I just... I can't bear
to watch her suffer.

599
00:50:00.258 --> 00:50:01.432
I love her too damn much...

600
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:07.569
Even though she does
drive me insane.

601
00:50:13.575 --> 00:50:14.575
Insane.

602
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.715
I know you got this in you.

603
00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:24.586
I've been watching you.

604
00:50:28.112 --> 00:50:33.204
Let us do something
for each other the way

605
00:50:33.334 --> 00:50:39.384
the military didn't.
soldier to soldier.

606
00:50:39.514 --> 00:50:47.514
$20.000 all yours.

607
00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:55.181
All right.

608
00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:04.539
She won't feel a thing.

609
00:51:53.240 --> 00:52:01.240
Southern trees bear strange fruit.

610
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:11.998
Blood on the leaves
and blood at the root.

611
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:21.573
Black bodies swinging
in the Southern breeze.

612
00:52:25.446 --> 00:52:32.236
Strange fruit hanging
from the poplar trees.

613
00:52:41.984 --> 00:52:45.249
Ever heard of this song?

614
00:52:45.379 --> 00:52:48.730
"Strange Fruit." Billie Holiday.

615
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:51.559
This song was banned for
its racial provocation

616
00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.171
against lynching.

617
00:52:54.301 --> 00:52:56.564
Ironically. it was
written by a white man.

618
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.008
You gonna just stand
there like a tree in the woods?

619
00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.321
Fine.

620
00:53:14.452 --> 00:53:15.452
Suit yourself.

621
00:53:27.073 --> 00:53:28.466
You see this?

622
00:53:28.596 --> 00:53:32.209
When I was a little girl.
if I so much as sneezed

623
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:35.124
at the dinner table.
my mama would pick up her fork

624
00:53:35.255 --> 00:53:36.256
and stab me with it.

625
00:53:40.391 --> 00:53:42.044
We all had messed-up childhoods.

626
00:53:45.439 --> 00:53:48.573
What was yours like?

627
00:53:48.703 --> 00:53:49.530
Doesn't matter.

628
00:53:49.661 --> 00:53:52.316
Of course it matters.

629
00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:54.056
Why?

630
00:53:54.187 --> 00:53:55.449
'Cause I want to know.

631
00:53:58.887 --> 00:54:02.021
But why do you care?

632
00:54:02.151 --> 00:54:05.633
'Cause I can see your sadness.

633
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.553
I ain't sad.

634
00:54:12.684 --> 00:54:13.728
Yeah?

635
00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:14.859
Yeah.

636
00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:19.125
I wouldn't judge you if you was.

637
00:54:28.526 --> 00:54:30.484
There ain't much to say.

638
00:54:30.615 --> 00:54:33.531
No.

639
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:35.489
Tell me about your mama.

640
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:45.064
She died in a boating
accident when I was six.

641
00:54:47.153 --> 00:54:48.415
And your daddy?

642
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:54.682
My dad blamed us for it.

643
00:54:54.813 --> 00:54:59.513
He drank himself into a coma...
Literally.

645
00:54:59.644 --> 00:55:00.818
He's still in the hospital.

646
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.954
Yeah.

647
00:55:06.085 --> 00:55:07.085
Not much to say.

648
00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:16.964
What about you?

649
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.361
Why are you so sad?

650
00:55:25.887 --> 00:55:26.887
I won't bore you.

651
00:55:30.283 --> 00:55:32.677
There ain't enough
whiskey in the world

652
00:55:32.807 --> 00:55:34.374
to relieve my sadness.

653
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:52.392
I'm sorry about your parents.

654
00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:53.523
Don't be.

655
00:55:57.266 --> 00:55:58.266
It is what it is.

656
00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:18.375
With her husband in
the next room thinking

657
00:56:18.505 --> 00:56:20.899
you were gonna kill her.

658
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:24.468
You expect me to believe you
didn't commit murder?

659
00:56:24.598 --> 00:56:27.035
With morals like that?

660
00:56:27.166 --> 00:56:28.646
I know.

661
00:56:28.776 --> 00:56:31.692
The stupid shit I
done in my life.

662
00:56:31.823 --> 00:56:33.651
All right. I get that.

663
00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:35.783
But it'd been six months
since my wife and I...

664
00:56:40.048 --> 00:56:46.794
And Fancy... she's
crazy. all right.

665
00:56:46.925 --> 00:56:50.668
but she is sexier than hell.

666
00:56:50.798 --> 00:56:53.018
She softened me up with
all that emotional shit.

667
00:56:53.148 --> 00:56:57.892
and I guess I just always had
a taste for danger.

668
00:56:59.024 --> 00:56:59.764
That's not dangerous. son.

669
00:56:59.894 --> 00:57:01.766
That's a death wish.

670
00:57:01.896 --> 00:57:04.899
I felt bad for her.

671
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:07.815
'Cause of her illness?

672
00:57:07.946 --> 00:57:10.862
No. it was something else.

673
00:57:10.992 --> 00:57:18.992
Like she. has this hole in
her. and she can't fill it.

674
00:57:21.786 --> 00:57:23.396
Just let it go.

675
00:57:23.527 --> 00:57:26.225
You let it go. you set yourself free
from this wicked burden

676
00:57:26.355 --> 00:57:29.924
of guilt and shame you
got locked up inside.

677
00:57:30.055 --> 00:57:31.796
It's OK.

678
00:57:31.926 --> 00:57:33.972
Let it go.

679
00:57:34.102 --> 00:57:37.497
I didn't do anything.

680
00:57:37.628 --> 00:57:39.891
You want to go on lying to
yourself over and over

681
00:57:40.021 --> 00:57:41.108
again. that's fine by me.

682
00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:42.371
I got all day.

683
00:57:42.502 --> 00:57:44.504
You don't get it.

684
00:57:44.635 --> 00:57:45.960
At this point. I was
just trying to figure

685
00:57:45.984 --> 00:57:47.986
out a way to survive the night.

686
00:57:48.116 --> 00:57:51.250
Just how'd you do that?

687
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.557
Hitting up against each other.

688
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:29.941
What do we have here?

689
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:32.944
It's... you're not...

690
00:58:33.074 --> 00:58:36.425
You're not. like...
Like. sick. right?

691
00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:37.862
Sick?

692
00:58:37.992 --> 00:58:41.387
Yeah. like... Like blood cancer?

694
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:43.041
No.

695
00:58:43.171 --> 00:58:46.392
Now. why would you say that?

696
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:50.091
What the hell did he tell you?

697
00:58:50.222 --> 00:58:52.006
He asked me to kill you.

698
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.240
Thank you for telling me.

699
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:09.894
I'm gonna take care of this.

700
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.290
If he finds out that I talked to
you. he might...

701
00:59:15.421 --> 00:59:19.643
No. no. no. no. I'm
not gonna say a word.

702
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:21.732
I know how Walter works.

703
00:59:21.862 --> 00:59:23.124
He's got a lot of guns.

704
00:59:23.255 --> 00:59:24.429
You gonna have to trust me.

705
01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:06.994
Walt?

706
01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:09.518
Yeah?

707
01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.998
Can we talk?

708
01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:17.048
What's up?

709
01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:20.051
I think you and I need to come to
a new place of understanding

710
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.181
with each other.

711
01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:25.839
What does that mean?

712
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.537
Well. that means we're
living in the past.

713
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:31.234
Now we've got all this anger and
resentment with each other.

714
01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:40.288
You love me.

715
01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:41.419
I truly believe that.

716
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:46.817
Let's just try and
let all that go.

717
01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:54.607
How?

718
01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:55.738
Forgiveness.

719
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.614
Forgiveness?

720
01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:04.878
I've been hard on you.

721
01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:09.578
And I just don't have the energy
to fight anymore. baby.

722
01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:11.536
You and I. we get so
angry. we start saying

723
01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.060
things we don't really mean.

724
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:15.759
Yeah.

725
01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.848
Yeah. I guess so.

726
01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:20.546
I'm tired. baby.

727
01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:24.768
I can't keep up with all
this wretched bitterness anymore.

728
01:01:24.898 --> 01:01:26.639
I want things to be
the way they were.

729
01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:35.126
Me too.

730
01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:38.651
I got nothing but love for
you. my beautiful man.

731
01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:52.709
You see that shit?

732
01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:54.145
Did you see that shit?

733
01:01:57.757 --> 01:02:01.021
This is your fault.
See what you did?

734
01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:02.849
You made me hit a woman.

735
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.722
'Cause you couldn't
finish the job.

736
01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:08.420
Well. you're gonna
finish it now.

737
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:09.421
Come on.

738
01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:10.030
All right.

739
01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:10.944
OK.

740
01:02:11.075 --> 01:02:12.206
Where's that poison?

741
01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.488
I still got it.
It's right in my pocket.

742
01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:14.382
What the fuck are
you waiting for?

743
01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:15.862
Take it out.

744
01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:16.993
Open it up.

745
01:02:17.081 --> 01:02:17.777
OK.

746
01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:20.475
Pour it on the rag.

747
01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:21.955
Pour it on the rag!

748
01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.526
Cover her mouth with it.

749
01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.286
You just told her a second
ago you loved her.

750
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:30.659
Cover her mouth.

751
01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.618
You've been married
for 15 years. man.

752
01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.141
Think about that.

753
01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:36.404
Cover her mouth!

754
01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.852
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

755
01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:49.982
Yes.

756
01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:56.833
You kicked my ass.

757
01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:57.963
Worthy warrior.

758
01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:03.230
Shoot me.

759
01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:05.319
Slay me.

760
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:06.450
I'm ready.

761
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.631
That ain't gonna
happen. jarhead.

762
01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:19.856
You all right?

763
01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:22.206
My head's pounding.

764
01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:25.470
Yeah. well. you're safe now.

765
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.300
Just take it easy.

766
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:31.998
Look. I think I'd rather be in
a hurricane than this shit.

767
01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:33.217
so. where are the keys?

768
01:04:33.347 --> 01:04:34.696
Take me with you.

769
01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.873
I can't stay either.

770
01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:38.135
Please.

771
01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:39.787
Let's just go
somewhere. you and me.

772
01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.356
You two gonna run off together?

773
01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:46.056
Go ahead and take her.

774
01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:49.320
She's all yours.

775
01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:52.584
But I'll tell you this.

776
01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:59.025
She got a dark side...
Darker than hell.

778
01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:00.766
Shut your mouth.

779
01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.638
If you love him so much.
why don't you tell him?

780
01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:05.249
What's he talking about?

781
01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.380
Nothing.

782
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:09.253
I bet he'd just love to hear all

783
01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:11.908
about your dirty little secret.

784
01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.043
What's he going on about?

785
01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:17.739
Nothing. honey.

786
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.306
Just help me up.

787
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.357
What are you doing?

788
01:05:26.487 --> 01:05:31.231
Just take me right here.
right here in front of him.

789
01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:33.320
Let's make that son
of a bitch squirm.

790
01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:40.066
I'll look him right in
the eyes while you make me cum.

791
01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:42.068
No. no. no.

792
01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:42.764
Stop.

793
01:05:42.895 --> 01:05:44.505
He's a monster.

794
01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:45.942
You know that. you've seen it.

795
01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:49.162
You cannot leave
me here with him.

796
01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:51.599
I'm taking an even 200
for the fence. asshole.

797
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.297
You didn't finish it.

798
01:05:53.427 --> 01:05:57.083
Yeah. well. I
figured I earned it

799
01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.519
putting up with your bullshit.

800
01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:04.134
Hey. soldier.

801
01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:09.487
You better kill me now.
or I'll be coming for you.

802
01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:11.489
That's a promise.

803
01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:14.883
You and your whole family.

804
01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:23.501
Where are the car keys?

805
01:06:23.631 --> 01:06:24.415
They're right here.

806
01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:25.545
I got 'em.

807
01:06:29.898 --> 01:06:30.725
Ready?

808
01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:32.684
Yeah.

809
01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:36.122
Before you two love
birds escape reality together.

810
01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:38.429
there's something you
should know. Buddy.

811
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:41.693
You like dangerous
things. don't you?

812
01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.477
Have a look in our basement.

813
01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:47.786
You're gonna love it.

814
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:53.270
What's down there?

815
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.055
You're gonna love it!

816
01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:58.318
Yeah!

817
01:06:58.449 --> 01:06:59.450
Let's just go.

818
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.756
No.

819
01:07:01.887 --> 01:07:04.455
Keys are right
here in my pocket.

820
01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:06.326
Come and get 'em.

821
01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:10.722
See for yourself what kind
of woman you want to hook up with.

822
01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:13.638
You think I got a dark side.

823
01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:18.121
You have no idea.

824
01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:22.560
God damn you.

825
01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:32.048
Listen to me. do
not go down there.

826
01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:33.745
Why not?

827
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:36.313
There are things
down there that...

828
01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:38.271
Please.

829
01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:40.360
Don't let him toy with
your mind like this.

830
01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:44.060
You're smarter than that.

831
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.627
What are you hiding?

832
01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:49.152
Nothing.

833
01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:52.155
Now. come on...
You let go of me.

835
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:15.481
Yeah!

836
01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:38.984
Did you get that little fuck?

837
01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.247
That little shit weasel fuck.

838
01:08:41.378 --> 01:08:42.944
This is all your fault.

839
01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:44.642
My fault?

840
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:46.663
You're the one who kept
running your mouth about secrets.

841
01:08:46.687 --> 01:08:49.342
Yeah.

842
01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:53.216
Did you have to stab me so hard?

843
01:08:53.346 --> 01:08:54.912
He didn't go in the
basement. did he?

844
01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:56.262
No.

845
01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:58.786
All right. light...
Light some candles.

846
01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:30.166
You OK?

847
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:37.173
What did they do to you?

848
01:09:37.303 --> 01:09:38.609
What... what's... what's...

849
01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:47.574
What's that?

850
01:09:58.672 --> 01:10:02.589
Help me.

851
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.025
Yeah. I will.

852
01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.027
I promise you I will.

853
01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:11.903
How long you been in here?

854
01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.033
Days.

855
01:10:17.604 --> 01:10:18.997
What?

856
01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:19.998
What. now?

857
01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:21.434
What... what is it?

858
01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:29.442
There's more of us.

859
01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:28.849
Keep an eye on the front door.

860
01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:11.283
Fight back!

861
01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:01.306
I want to talk to a lawyer.

862
01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.743
I want... I...
I want my phone call.

864
01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:05.963
What you think
this is. New York?

865
01:14:06.093 --> 01:14:07.704
DC?

866
01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:11.708
You're in Grand Isle. son.

867
01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:15.625
We don't subscribe to
that big city nonsense.

868
01:14:15.755 --> 01:14:16.755
I'm sorry. your honor.

869
01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:18.062
Yeah. well. the power's out.

870
01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:19.474
It seemed our poor
little suspect.

871
01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:21.805
he just couldn't
make his phone call.

872
01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:26.418
He was just a boy with a
family you ripped him away from.

873
01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.726
I didn't... will you...
Will you just send an officer

874
01:14:29.856 --> 01:14:31.467
to check out that basement?

875
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.687
You will find some
crazy. horrendous shit.

876
01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:36.254
I put my life on it.

877
01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:38.232
And why are you so fascinated
with that basement?

878
01:14:38.256 --> 01:14:40.432
The way they were
talking about it.

879
01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:43.391
Who puts three bolt locks on
abasement door. has a kid hooked

880
01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:46.090
up to an IV clutching a
rag with... with Chinese

881
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.179
or... or Japanese letters on it?

882
01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:50.486
All right. now you're
just making shit up.

883
01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:52.488
You know what?

884
01:14:52.618 --> 01:14:53.880
I've been patient.

885
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.273
I've been kind.

886
01:14:55.403 --> 01:14:56.666
But I'm done.

887
01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:06.676
Here's my take on it. you
little lying. little motherfucker.

888
01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:11.158
While you were in service.
you developed a taste for violence.

889
01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:12.072
You came home.

890
01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:13.073
You found you a girl.

891
01:15:13.204 --> 01:15:14.684
You had a kid.

892
01:15:14.814 --> 01:15:17.774
But that domestic life wasn't
what you'd hoped for.

893
01:15:17.904 --> 01:15:22.518
Then you bumped into
an ex-Marine who pissed you off.

894
01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:25.477
You boned his wife.
and then you killed

895
01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:27.847
a teenager who just happened to
be in the wrong place

896
01:15:27.871 --> 01:15:28.871
at the wrong time.

897
01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:34.791
I know I'm right.

898
01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:44.365
As I see it.
there ain't nothing in the way of you

899
01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:48.587
frying in the electric chair.

900
01:15:48.718 --> 01:15:51.068
I'm innocent.

901
01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:56.552
You gonna confess your sins to
me. one way or another.

902
01:15:58.945 --> 01:15:59.990
What?

903
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120
His wife is here.

904
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:07.824
Well. let's show her in.

905
01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:08.781
In here?

906
01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.566
Sure. why not?

907
01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:12.456
Sure she gonna want to
have a chance to give

908
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.524
him a piece of her mind.

909
01:16:23.927 --> 01:16:25.276
Yeah.

910
01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:26.798
Come in and talk
to your husband.

911
01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:30.846
Find out what he's been up to.

912
01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:45.165
How'd you find me?

913
01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:48.995
I called the police when
you didn't come home.

914
01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:51.389
What in the hell
happened to you?

915
01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:58.831
Some kid's dead. and
they think I did it.

916
01:16:58.962 --> 01:17:01.704
You?

917
01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:02.834
Up for murder?

918
01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:09.102
I didn't do it.

919
01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:10.495
I swear.

920
01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:11.452
You have to believe me.

921
01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.846
I mean. you know me.

922
01:17:13.977 --> 01:17:16.501
I don't know what to believe.

923
01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.939
What are they telling me about
some woman named Fancy?

924
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:22.638
Buddy. do you know her?

925
01:17:25.423 --> 01:17:26.423
Do you know her?

926
01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:33.300
Why did that officer
tell me you...

927
01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:37.870
You had an affair with her?

928
01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.656
Baby.

929
01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:48.707
What is happening. Buddy?

930
01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:56.193
I love you. and.
I'll explain all this. all right?

931
01:17:56.323 --> 01:17:58.412
I promise.

932
01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:00.980
Bit right now you gotta
help me get out of here.

933
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:02.852
They're gonna kill
me. for Christ's sake.

934
01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.162
If I may. sir. I...

935
01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:11.469
I think he may be
on to something.

936
01:18:11.599 --> 01:18:12.688
What you talking about?

937
01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:14.733
It's probably nothing. but. I

938
01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:17.475
remember seeing a
newspaper headline

939
01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:23.176
with a picture of a
teenage girl. Monica Fujima.

940
01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:28.181
She was wearing a red silk
dress with Japanese writing on it.

941
01:18:28.312 --> 01:18:30.575
She's still missing. sir.

942
01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.447
Son of a bitch.

943
01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:34.971
Bring that file with you.

944
01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:38.365
Lisa.

945
01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:40.280
Lisa. wait.

946
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.629
Is this what you saw?

947
01:18:45.285 --> 01:18:46.460
Yeah.

948
01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:50.247
You're 1.000% sure?

949
01:18:50.377 --> 01:18:51.682
Get Judge Warren on the phone.

950
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:52.878
We're gonna need
a search warrant.

951
01:18:52.902 --> 01:18:54.033
Can I go home?

952
01:18:54.164 --> 01:18:55.164
Not just yet.

953
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:53.526
Good day. officers.

954
01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:54.920
What can I do for you?

955
01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.053
This here's a search warrant.

956
01:19:57.183 --> 01:19:58.639
We have reason to believe that you might be

957
01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.796
performing illegal activities.

958
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:03.624
Illegal activities?

959
01:20:03.755 --> 01:20:05.713
What happened to your face?

960
01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.150
I tell you.

961
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.240
It was... power went out
during the hurricane.

962
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:13.199
Tripped over the stairs.
landed right on my face.

963
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.766
Cut my hand on a broken window.

964
01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:16.246
It was a rough night.

965
01:20:16.376 --> 01:20:17.116
But. please. by all means.
come... come on in.

966
01:20:17.247 --> 01:20:18.247
Have a look.

967
01:20:24.341 --> 01:20:26.125
All right. go ahead
and search the place.

968
01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:28.693
Officer Gregg and I will keep
the Franklins company.

969
01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.827
I... I believe you might
know my wife. Fancy.

970
01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:32.957
Good morning. officers.

971
01:20:42.968 --> 01:20:44.840
Now. can I offer
you some ice tea?

972
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:50.410
No. ma'am.
but we appreciate your hospitality.

973
01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:52.151
I don't imagine
bourbon's appropriate.

974
01:21:58.391 --> 01:21:59.784
Keep an eye on them.

975
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.239
Get me out of here!

976
01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:07.808
It's over.

977
01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:08.939
We gotta run.

978
01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.420
We're not leaving this house.

979
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:12.137
You almost had to
run off with that boy.

980
01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:14.076
Now all of a sudden
you want to stay?

981
01:23:14.206 --> 01:23:14.946
That was then.

982
01:23:15.077 --> 01:23:16.252
You want to go to jail?

983
01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:17.253
Is that what you want?

984
01:23:17.383 --> 01:23:18.994
No. but...

985
01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:22.954
You are not dragging me
into this twisted shit of yours.

986
01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:24.912
I wanted to expand our family.

987
01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:26.392
This is on you.

988
01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:28.481
Officer. my cat is
stuck up in the tree.

989
01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:30.440
Would you shoot him down for me?

990
01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:31.789
What?

991
01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:33.332
I said my cat is
stuck up in a tree.

992
01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:35.532
Would you shoot him down for me?

993
01:23:52.723 --> 01:23:55.117
Walter!

994
01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:56.814
Walter!

995
01:23:56.944 --> 01:23:58.772
Walter. no!

996
01:23:58.903 --> 01:23:59.903
No!

997
01:24:04.952 --> 01:24:05.431
No!

998
01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:06.562
No!

999
01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:20.532
God dammit.

1000
01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:30.542
You can go.

1001
01:24:34.852 --> 01:24:36.114
What'd you find?

1002
01:24:40.379 --> 01:24:41.641
Well. come on.

1003
01:24:41.772 --> 01:24:43.165
It's my info that got you there.

1004
01:24:43.295 --> 01:24:45.382
The least you could do
is tell me what you found.

1005
01:24:47.734 --> 01:24:49.084
A nightmare.

1006
01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:56.482
Go on home.

1007
01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:18.896
What are you doing?

1008
01:25:19.026 --> 01:25:21.377
Going to my sister's.

1009
01:25:21.507 --> 01:25:22.919
Come on. now. let's
talk about this...

1010
01:25:22.943 --> 01:25:25.685
Don't call me.

1011
01:25:25.816 --> 01:25:27.470
Lisa. please don't.

1012
01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:39.308
It's been two weeks since
Grand Isle suffered

1013
01:25:39.438 --> 01:25:42.441
the area's worst
hurricane in 17 years.

1014
01:25:42.572 --> 01:25:45.270
with millions of dollars
in damage caused to businesses

1015
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:47.403
and countless homes destroyed.

1016
01:25:47.533 --> 01:25:49.753
Some people are still
unaccounted for.

1017
01:25:49.883 --> 01:25:52.103
but emergency services
are doing their best

1018
01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:54.671
to reach those in need.

1019
01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:56.673
And in other news.
the manhunt continues

1020
01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:58.849
for Walter Franklin.
the main suspect

1021
01:25:58.979 --> 01:26:01.417
accused of the recent
teenage abductions.

1022
01:27:33.813 --> 01:27:36.207
How are you holding up. Buddy?

1023
01:27:36.338 --> 01:27:38.383
Miss my girls.

1024
01:27:38.514 --> 01:27:39.514
Time heals all wounds.

1025
01:27:45.477 --> 01:27:47.000
Yeah. that is what they've said.

1026
01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:57.010
Tadpole.

1027
01:27:57.141 --> 01:27:58.141
Call the cops.

1028
01:28:02.015 --> 01:28:04.496
How you feeling. Buddy?

1029
01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:05.627
You excited?

1030
01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.459
Feeling a bit on the
other side of that.

1031
01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:15.899
Been thinking about
your own death?

1032
01:28:16.029 --> 01:28:17.030
Sure have.

1033
01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:19.511
Outstanding. soldier.

1034
01:28:19.642 --> 01:28:23.385
What conclusions have you drawn?

1035
01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:25.188
Every day away from
my wife and my child

1036
01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:28.781
is its own sort of hell.

1037
01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:33.133
Kind of like waking
up every morning

1038
01:28:33.264 --> 01:28:35.614
knowing if you were overseas
with your squad.

1039
01:28:35.745 --> 01:28:39.836
maybe you could have
helped save them?

1040
01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:44.362
Walter. I understand what you're

1041
01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:46.669
going through. all right?

1042
01:28:46.799 --> 01:28:49.454
Tell me. how do you relate?

1043
01:28:49.585 --> 01:28:50.779
Don't do this now. all right?

1044
01:28:50.803 --> 01:28:51.500
Let her go.

1045
01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:53.110
No. no. no. no. no.

1046
01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.634
You exposed our little secret.

1047
01:28:55.765 --> 01:28:58.202
Now it's your turn.

1048
01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.378
I don't have any secrets.

1049
01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:02.815
Fuck!

1050
01:29:02.946 --> 01:29:04.643
Something on that
ship. wasn't it?

1051
01:29:17.177 --> 01:29:20.833
I said I tried to
help out my friend Carl.

1052
01:29:24.663 --> 01:29:25.663
That was a lie.

1053
01:29:29.929 --> 01:29:34.934
I saw him burning
up on the ground.

1054
01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:36.675
writhing around. and... and...

1055
01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:45.770
I ran.

1056
01:29:50.254 --> 01:29:53.475
Well. you actually got tested
and proved to yourself

1057
01:29:53.605 --> 01:29:54.998
that you're a coward.

1058
01:29:55.128 --> 01:29:56.128
Shit.

1059
01:29:58.436 --> 01:30:03.310
Just when I thought we might have
had something in common.

1060
01:30:03.441 --> 01:30:04.441
I guess not.

1061
01:30:13.843 --> 01:30:15.584
All right. get
over here. tadpole.

1062
01:30:19.457 --> 01:30:20.457
Come on.

1063
01:30:39.216 --> 01:30:44.264
Hey. Walt. What
you aiming for here?

1064
01:30:44.395 --> 01:30:45.395
I have a demand.

1065
01:30:48.268 --> 01:30:49.268
Go ahead.

1066
01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:53.448
Where's my baby girl?

1067
01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:55.101
Where's Fancy?

1068
01:30:55.232 --> 01:30:57.713
I want her released.

1069
01:30:57.843 --> 01:31:00.455
They put her in a
locked down mental facility.

1070
01:31:00.585 --> 01:31:02.761
Even if I wanted to.
I couldn't get her released.

1071
01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:14.773
Well. then. you'd
best get ready.

1072
01:31:14.904 --> 01:31:15.992
Shit's about to get ugly.

1073
01:31:16.122 --> 01:31:18.342
Now. hold on. Walter.

1074
01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.562
What would your
fellow Marines say?

1075
01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:21.800
You think they'd condone this?

1076
01:31:21.824 --> 01:31:24.522
Well. fuck yeah. they would.

1077
01:31:24.653 --> 01:31:30.093
This here is a sacrifice
against a system

1078
01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:34.140
that doesn't give a shit about
me or my fellow Marines.

1079
01:31:34.271 --> 01:31:37.840
Hell. we could talk
this out over a beer.

1080
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:40.016
Please let Buddy
and his family go.

1081
01:31:40.146 --> 01:31:42.845
I'm done talking. George.

1082
01:31:42.975 --> 01:31:45.151
And I sure as hell
am done drinking.

1083
01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:03.735
Walter P. Franklin of the 1st
Battalion 10th Marines.

1084
01:32:03.866 --> 01:32:04.866
Walter. don't.

1085
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:07.913
Camp Lejeune. North Carolina.

1086
01:32:08.044 --> 01:32:09.219
Walter. don't do it.

1087
01:32:09.349 --> 01:32:10.829
Gunslingers signing out!

1088
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.960
Walter. no!

1089
01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:14.745
Get down. get down.
get down. get down!

1090
01:33:04.056 --> 01:33:05.056
Hi.

1091
01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.584
Hey.

1092
01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.592
We got a lot of
work on. I get that.

1093
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:23.030
Maybe let's just take things
one day at a time.

1094
01:33:26.035 --> 01:33:27.035
Let me see her.

1095
01:33:41.572 --> 01:33:43.182
Local authorities

1096
01:33:43.313 --> 01:33:46.359
have informed us that Walter
and Fancy Mae Franklin are reported

1097
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:49.232
to have held several
young teens in their basement

1098
01:33:49.362 --> 01:33:52.148
and forced them to have babies
against their will.

1099
01:33:52.278 --> 01:33:53.584
You're the most adorable

1100
01:33:53.715 --> 01:33:55.586
little girl I've ever seen.

1101
01:33:55.717 --> 01:33:57.109
Young girls. both age seven.

1102
01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.503
were found emaciated
and barely alive.

1103
01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.287
Ever since I was a little girl.

1104
01:34:01.418 --> 01:34:04.900
I have always wanted
a huge family.

1105
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:06.510
In these uncertain times.

1106
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.555
we must all be extra vigilant.

1107
01:34:08.686 --> 01:34:12.472
I can't have one... Medically.

1109
01:34:12.603 --> 01:34:14.015
We may think we know our neighbors.

1110
01:34:14.039 --> 01:34:15.867
but maybe we don't.

1111
01:34:18.827 --> 01:34:21.438
There are always other measures.

1112
01:34:57.430 --> 01:35:04.046
Far away. I seek a life of stone

1113
01:35:04.176 --> 01:35:07.484
as they course
through the wilds.

1114
01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:15.448
Take in the smoke
of something new

1115
01:35:15.579 --> 01:35:20.845
that's stones your heart.
your soul. your mind.

1116
01:35:24.022 --> 01:35:32.022
Bank on a lie that always kept you
going. for some reason

1117
01:35:33.902 --> 01:35:38.297
don't work anymore.

1118
01:35:38.428 --> 01:35:44.608
Swim for the shallows to
find yourself drowning.

1119
01:35:44.739 --> 01:35:48.612
stuck in the mud all alone.

1120
01:36:21.688 --> 01:36:29.044
To the touch. you've gone cold.
hold still and brood.

1121
01:36:29.174 --> 01:36:36.007
And your legs
don't work anymore.

1122
01:36:36.138 --> 01:36:41.534
Try to run. forgotten
how to move.

1123
01:36:41.665 --> 01:36:45.495
Still going. going
till you're gone.

1124
01:36:49.673 --> 01:36:57.673
Bank on a lie that always kept you
showing. for some reason

1125
01:36:58.334 --> 01:37:01.554
don't cut it anymore.
