[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.050
SONG: Them crazy-- them crazy--

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.010
The man who's thinking and
worrying about getting hit

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.130
is not gonna have a good
sense of anticipation.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.070
He will in fact get hit.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.140
Gotta be clever. gotta be
smart. and not get hit.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.080
And when you're able to
do this. you're a fighter.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.230
I'm still the fastest. the
most scientific. the greatest

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.180
fighter of all time!

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.020
ANNOUNCER: Muhammad Ali
has won by a knockout.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.170
GEORGE FOREMAN: 45 is
not a death sentence.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.150
We can do anything we wanna do.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.020
ANNOUNCER: It
happened. it happened!

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.120
Lennox Lewis.
I'm coming for you.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.160
Lennox the conqueror?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.180
No. I'm Alexander.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.220
He's no Alexander.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.030
I'm the best ever.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.180
I'm just ferocious.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.080
I want your heart.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.120
I wanna eat his children.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.070
Tell Mike Tyson either
put up or shut up.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.230
This is the heart of
the sweet science.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.020
It's not no street fighting.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.110
He knows what he can eat.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.200
Are we ever going to see.
given all the obstacles. Tyson

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
and Lewis in the ring together?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.220
Mike Tyson has shown he just
doesn't want to fight yet.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
I wouldn't be afraid to
say that Lewis is the best

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.000
fighter on the scene now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.070
Period.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.110
I just come to conquer.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.090
NARRATOR: The
heavyweight champion

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.010
of the world. the most
coveted title in all sports.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:37.000
held by George Foreman. the
strongest. Joe Lewis. the most

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.220
iconic. Rocky Marciano.
the most unbeatable. Mike

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.030
Tyson. the baddest man on
the planet. Muhammad Ali.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.170
the greatest.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.140
Who is this man. this
heavyweight champion

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.050
of the world?

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.010
SONG: We gonna chase those
crazy baldheads out of town.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.030
Chase those crazy
baldheads out of our town.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.210
I and I build a cabin.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.150
I and I plant the corn.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.020
Didn't my people before
me slave for this country.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.020
When music plays.
I feel no pain.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.150
Muhammad Ali said the sweet
science is hit and not get hit.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.210
Lennox is a very measured
and calculating man.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.140
He's like an onion that
you keep peeling back.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.150
and you think. oh. I've got it.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.050
And then. no.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.150
You realize. no. it
goes even further.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.060
His personality is
really like a lion.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.160
He's this big guy.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.110
He's ferocious-looking at
times when he wants to be.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.060
but he's also very gentle.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.150
As the world
heavyweight champion.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.200
you are seen as the most
dangerous man on the planet.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.130
That's what I always
admired about Lennox.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.160
He never showed his
anger in public.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.020
[CHEERING]

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.140
There was something
about him that made

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.070
him unique to other sportsmen.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.070
[SCATTING]

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.100
I just fancy Tyson
for some reason.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.210
A smart man will beat
a strong man any day.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.080
And Lennox Lewis
is a smart fighter.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.130
Lennox Lewis
after three rounds.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.050
Tyson. round four.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.060
We're gonna have
Lewis in five rounds.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.090
And Lewis is gonna get it.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.070
You think Lewis is gonna--

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.230
He's gonna get it.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.220
Everybody that I boxed
had a math problem.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.010
And the math problem was
down for me to solve.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.190
Folks really seem
to pay more attention

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.040
to where he's from than what
he's actually accomplished.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.190
NARRATOR: Being the undisputed
unified heavyweight champ

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.230
meant that Lennox had
the IBF belt. IBO belt.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.230
and the most coveted.
the WBC belt.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.220
claimed before by greats like
Muhammad Ali and Joe Lewis.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.230
How did he make it to
the doorstep of history.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.150
to one of the biggest
heavyweight fights of all time?

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.030
You have to take a look at
his story from the beginning.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.070
Lennox was born in
the impoverished East

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.150
End of London.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.090
He was raised by
his mother. Violet.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.120
who had come to England from
Jamaica to work as a nurse

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.180
in search of a better life.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.030
See. I didn't grow up with
my brothers and sisters.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.110
My mother have 12 of us. so I
grow up with another family.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.060
I don't blame her. because
she couldn't manage us.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.070
12 kids. no husband. you know?

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.160
NARRATOR: Lennox's father
had started a new family

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.110
and was completely
absent from his life.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.080
I met my dad one day.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.070
There was a car outside.
nice-looking car.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.090
And a guy in the car.
and he said. come here.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.100
And I was like looking
at him. like who are you?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.180
He said. I'm your father.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.180
I said. oh.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.110
He said that he wanted
to be in my life.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.200
But his wife was
fighting against me.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.090
so I was like that
kid in the middle.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.230
I just walked back in
the house. and my mom

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.120
said. well. who's that?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.180
And I said. that's my dad.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.120
Then she went out into the
road. and she was arguing bad.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.100
like she was cussing him.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.050
And I was like.
you know. confused.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.180
And when she came back
in. she was upset.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.080
So we really never
talked about it.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.010
And then that was the only time
I kind of remember. you know.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.040
my dad.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.230
NARRATOR: When Lennox
was seven. his mother

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.050
found a better
paying job in Canada

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.100
and had to leave him
behind in London.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.070
She was basically
searching for a new horizon.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.000
a different way of life.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.190
You know. she said she
had a friend in Canada.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.130
She went to visit.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.210
And she was over
there for a while.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.140
and she left me with this
lady named Miss Baker.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.050
For some reason. Miss
Baker was real mean to me.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.070
While I was in bed at
night. she would come over.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.020
I would wake up. look up
my eyes. and I see her.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.150
and her eyes and would
be looking at me.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.120
And it was like.
that would scare me.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.100
And I remember one time I
was going into the bath.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.100
and then she was coming in there
with a belt to try and beat me.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.030
And I remember jumping out
the bath and running past her.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.200
and running outside the house.
and I was outside the house.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.080
and I was nude
outside the house.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.010
And she was going. "oh. come in.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.150
Come on. come on. come inside.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.130
I'm gonna put the belt down."

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.070
"No. I ain't coming back in.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.040
I want people to come
and see you and make

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.180
you embarrassed about that."

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.130
And she was.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.000
She was very
embarrassed about it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.100
Police came and said.
well. what's going on?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.110
And then I remember Miss Baker
being upset. saying. "boy. I

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.030
don't know why your mother don't
call for you and send for you

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.210
and get you out of my house."

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.180
And you know. they
took me away from her

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.170
and put me in this home.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.170
You know. I basically
felt like I was abandoned.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.040
I was out there by myself.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.070
NARRATOR: He ended up passing
through a number of boarding

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.180
schools and getting
kicked out for fighting

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.130
until he finally ended up in
a school for troubled youth.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.120
Lennox most definitely
would have been part of a gang

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.160
and been mixed up in all sorts
of skulduggery at that time.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.140
And it was actually
much better for him

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.140
that he had left
England and went

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.070
to Canada to stay with our mum.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.140
When my mother sent for
me and I took that plane.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.200
we were going through the
airport. and all I could hear

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.030
was my mum's voice.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.210
I didn't hear it for years.
and I heard her voice.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.070
She was like. "there's
my son. there's my son!"

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:24.030
And it was loud. and it was
like music to my ears. you know.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.110
At first. he was
like a bit of a rebel.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.040
PRODUCER: Was he?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.110
Yeah. he used
to get in fights.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.040
and the teacher used
to phone me at work.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.170
and then I'd have to leave
work and come home and get him.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.070
And sometimes I'd meet
him on the way coming

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.050
home with his lunch pail.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.080
So--

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.210
When he first
came to Kitchener.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.010
it was basically
just him and his mom.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.180
Because he was the
new guy on the block.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.200
they tried to pick on
him a little bit. right?

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.150
Because he wasn't
always that big.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.020
You know?

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.040
NARRATOR: By bringing
Lennox to Canada.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.130
Violet had completely changed
the course of his life.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.080
He easily could have become
a victim of police brutality

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.220
on the streets of London.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.020
Racial tensions grew
between the cops

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.060
and the black immigrant
community in the '70s and '80s.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.120
resulting in violent clashes
like the Brixton riots.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.220
But in Canada. when
Lennox got into trouble

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.040
with law enforcement.
they did something

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.100
completely unexpected.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.040
Why don't you go down to the
police club and try out boxing?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.160
Hook McComb. he was a staff
sergeant for the Waterloo

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.110
Regional Police.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.010
My trainer said.
go. I want you

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.110
to move around with this kid.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.090
Bobby Prue was smaller
than me. lighter than me.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.200
and I was bigger than
him and more lankier.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.190
He was dancing
circles around me.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.140
I was swinging away.
trying to hit him.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.220
and I couldn't hit him.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.140
And he hit me in my nose.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.000
I'm like. ah. my eyes
started watering.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The only boxing I knew was
like Muhammad Ali. because we

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.070
used to watch him on TV.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.060
So I pretended I was
Muhammad Ali moving around.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.110
And it was like a game to me.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.220
It was like a game of tag.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.160
That's when I realized
that I enjoyed boxing.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.070
I loved it.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.190
Hook McComb taught me
and Lennox for a long time.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.040
As the years went on and
Arnie came into the picture.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.120
Lennox came down with
a couple of his friends

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.080
to our boxing gym in Kitchener.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.020
He stood out immediately as a
little bigger than the others.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.190
and showed an interest.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.100
And the biggest thing I noticed.
and the most important thing I

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.200
noticed. he listened.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.140
He would look at you and hang
on to every word that you said.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:37.220
So much credit of how Lennox
developed should go to Arnie.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.120
He was a rock.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.120
He was his coach. but he was
also a father figure to him.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.040
They had a relationship that
extended way past boxing.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.090
Arnie was always
there for Lennox.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.020
And kind of turned
into a dad figure.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.160
We went camping together.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.020
We went fishing together.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.170
Lennox and I met when we
were 11. almost 12 years old.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.090
We both played inner city
football here in Kitchener.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.000
Once we played. that's how
we got to know each other.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.030
As we both grew up. 12.
13. through those years

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.160
we became friends.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.060
I knew him from football.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.000
Some of my friends knew
him from basketball.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.080
Other friends knew
him from boxing.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.020
The friendship developed from
there until we ended up here

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.150
at Cameron Heights
as schoolmates

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.200
and teammates on the
same football team at 16.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.190
You got that man.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.100
Come on. mate.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.080
Let's go.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.100
Nah. I can't even
believe you're doing that.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.010
We gotta go.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.040
No way.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.010
They're waiting on us.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.150
No. no.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.200
That's no excuse.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.050
That's his favorite trick.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.190
Every time he's
losing. he walks away.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.070
"We've got some more
important to do."

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.040
To win the championship.
I mean. having Lennox

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.130
made me look like a genius.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.230
It was basically pitch
the ball athletics.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.120
and have Courtney
Shand lead block.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.170
I remember we played in
the finals. the city finals.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.120
We lost to Eastwood
Collegiate 20 to 1.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.080
We're all sitting on the bus.
coming home from the stadium.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.160
Everyone's crying. and
I'm sitting beside him.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.130
and I had my head down.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.140
I was crying.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.070
I look up. and he's just
looking around on the bus.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.180
And I'm like. hey. how
come you're not sad?

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.070
And he said. "because I've
got bigger things to come."

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.010
He worked his way
up through the ranks.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.020
Started getting a little
better and going to tournaments

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.000
in Sully's in Toronto.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.100
And he kept going.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.060
And next thing you know it. he's
a national champion. and then

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.100
the Olympics.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.030
NARRATOR: At Olympic
training camp.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.190
Lennox would meet another
soon to be world champion.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.010
Ladies and gentlemen. the
heavyweight championship

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.150
of the 1981 National
Junior Olympic

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.210
Boxing Championships
from Catskill. New York.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:06.040
15-year-old Mike Tyson.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.090
Bombs away. Jimmy.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.000
Let's watch just carefully.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.110
Because Tyson in the
blue is a bomber.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.220
He's trained by no
other than Cus D'Amato.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.120
Oh. and there it's all over.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.110
First time I ever met Lennox
Lewis was in the Catskills.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.200
He was a real nice guy.
really talked proper.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.220
He was really
enthusiastic about boxing.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.010
The first day he and
Mike sparred. Mike almost

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.000
took his head off.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
The next day they watched
some footage of Joe Frazier

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.100
and Muhammad Ali. the
Thriller in Manila.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.050
Arnie told him. this is
how you have to box Mike.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.040
So he went out. and
he did that. and he

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.180
beat up on Mike that day.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.110
Cus D'Amato stopped the fight
and told them both that day

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.120
you both are ordained to
become world champions.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.070
You both will
dominate the sport.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.120
Cus got pretty friendly with
my mother before she died.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.060
She didn't think I was gonna do
so good in this boxing thing.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.090
She thought it
was all like hype.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.020
I wanted to be successful.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.190
That would be something my
mother would have wanted.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:11.060
Cus. he adopted me. so he's
my father figure. yeah.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.140
That's all I knew
as a father figure.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.180
NARRATOR: Both Tyson and
Lewis had their eyes set

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.210
on winning the '84 Olympics.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.140
Tyson's hopes were diminished
in the Olympic qualifying match.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.100
while Lewis made
the Canadian team

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.190
but eventually ended up
losing in the quarterfinals.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.210
Well. it was a real
bummer. you know?

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.200
We both hung out after he lost
his match to Tyrell Biggs.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.160
and then decided to turn pro.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.050
NARRATOR: Over the
next few years.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.170
Tyson's professional
career took off.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.060
He became the youngest
heavyweight champ in history.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.230
All the while. Lennox was
fighting the amateur circuit

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.220
with the desire
to hone his craft

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.190
and get back to the Olympics.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.010
He was training in
Kitchener with a very good

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.120
friend of mine. Harvey Dean.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.090
His natural ability
to punch was there.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.190
Now we had to work on
the power of punching.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:07.030
I started training with Lennox
at the training center Arnie.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.100
Arnie would come. and
Adrian would come.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.020
And you know. he was
a big talented kid.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.170
a world junior champion.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.110
I'm nervous as usual.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.200
You know. I'm fighting the guy.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.010
I'm a middleweight. and he's
like a heavyweight or something

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.190
and shit.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.010
Lennox and Egerton. they
were sparring together.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.010
They were training
together like brothers.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.020
We got in the ring. we
started-- we rumbled. man.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.090
I came at him with all I--

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.130
I was bringing the fire.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.090
Egerton was good
for Lennox in that

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.050
because of his work ethics and
his tenacity. it pushed Lennox.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.220
You've got a guy now. you're
fighting in the amateurs now.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.190
You're fighting
at a higher level.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:48.030
NARRATOR: In 1988. Lennox would
travel to Seoul. South Korea

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.060
to compete once again and
go for the Olympic gold

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.130
medal for Canada.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.110
He had gone to the
opening ceremony in Seoul

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.200
and left the Canadian delegation
and walked across the field

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.150
to the American
delegation. walked up

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.000
to some American
athletes and said.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.070
"which one's Riddick Bowe?

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:08.220
Show me Riddick Bowe."

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.110
And they had pointed him to
Bowe. and he walked up to Bowe

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.010
and said. "are you Riddick Bowe?

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.080
I'm going to knock you out."

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.150
The first round when he
went out there. I was pissed.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.200
because he wasn't doing nothing.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.010
I was like. what the hell?

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.080
Me and Adrian was jumping up at
the side of the ring. saying.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.150
what the hell are you doing?

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.040
Bowe was beating
him to the punch.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.170
He had a little
bit more urgency.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.170
This has the
makings to be the most

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.230
interesting fight
of the tournament

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.050
or the bomb of the tournament.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.090
I think Lennox got hurt
with that uppercut right

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.080
hand there a moment ago.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.160
It seemed to stun
him momentarily.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.090
Adrian was yelling.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.210
I was yelling.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.140
Right. because we knew.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.130
We knew Lennox had the
ability to beat anybody

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.070
if he puts his mind to fight.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.010
Came in the corner.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.080
I said. Lennox. wake up. man.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.210
He went there. first punch--

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.180
knockout.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.230
COMMENTATOR: Canada's first
gold medal in 56 years.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:11.020
I don't think I have
ever been that proud.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.030
The feeling is
just indescribable.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.160
My dream was to have
an Olympic champion.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.130
Most of the guys within
the past several decades

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.150
who have won the Olympic
heavyweight gold medal

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.130
have gone on to become
the heavyweight champion

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.100
of the world.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.040
And so Lennox had the pedigree.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.040
The only question was.
would he fulfill it?

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.060
Winning the Olympic gold
medal is really a gold ticket

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.220
into the professionals.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.080
So it puts you at
a high standard.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.180
And the standard is. OK.
all the top promoters

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.060
are looking at you.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.110
So at this time.
there was Don King.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.070
He was really focusing on
Mike Tyson at the time.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.000
There was the Duvas.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.220
There was Micky Duff in England.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.030
A lot of different
promoters wanted to sign me.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.170
We actually visited
a couple of them.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.020
And I was like. wow.
everybody sounds so good.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.200
Who do I pick?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.190
And Arnie said. well.
follow your heart.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.050
He said. well. you know.
we're looking at all the offers.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.180
I said. well. it's funny
you should say that.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.090
We've got a guy in England.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.170
Why don't you come
over to England

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.080
and see what we
can do over there?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.070
He flew into Heathrow Airport.
and I met him at the airport

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.110
that morning.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.220
And when he put his hand out.
it was just like a shovel

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.080
coming out to meet me.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.210
And I was like. god.
he's bloody big.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:39.020
Then I thought. you are a
perfect specimen of a fighter.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.180
You know. I decided to go back
to England because I virtually

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.030
could write my own contract.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.050
NARRATOR: Lennox triumphantly
returned home to his birthplace

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.170
to start his professional
career with the most

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.060
brazen promoter
in Britain. a man

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.140
who was hiding a deep secret.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.010
From day one. we
started with this dream

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.100
that we were Britain's first
world heavyweight champion.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.010
or Lennox wants to be
the undisputed world

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.200
heavyweight champion.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.230
And it's my job to
do my best to get

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.020
that fight made for Lennox Lewis
and to guide him in that path.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.060
Lennox's team was quite unique.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.160
It started off first.
it was John Davenport.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.070
John Davenport then
brought in Harold

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.140
knight. who was a fighter
that John had trained.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.140
When I came up to
the training camp.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.060
Lennox actually was sleeping
in one of the cottages.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.120
There was two bedrooms
in one cottage.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.000
and I was in the other bedroom.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.060
So I walked in
the wrong bedroom.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.050
and soon as I walked in. I
see his big old giant stand up

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.100
and everything.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.040
And that was my first
introduction to Lennox Lewis.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.120
His mum Violet was the captain
of the whole training team.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.090
She held the whole
team together.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.090
I start going with
them to the camp.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.210
cause I have to do his
cooking and look after him.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.080
Because he has to eat property.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.060
Well. Mom. she was
the boss of the camp.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.220
to be honest with you.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.180
Mom was definitely the
boss of the camp. not

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.200
only with her cooking. but
she was. how can I say.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.070
fair but firm.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.170
She didn't take no
mess from anyone.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.160
NARRATOR: Lennox
quickly won his first 13

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.080
pro fights and his
first championship.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.230
the European Title.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.180
Lennox and I had disagreements
on where he should come from.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.220
I was adamant he should be
British. because that was

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.170
the market we was aiming at.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.030
Lennox sort of went to Canada.
and he had that accent.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.110
and that might be
a little bit why he

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.020
wasn't taken really seriously.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.090
Lennox obviously had Canadian
roots. Jamaican roots.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.110
and British roots.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.160
So he wanted to be seen
as a man of the world.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.000
I mean. I've done
some stupid things.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.070
I had Lennox dressed in a
top hat and tails with a cane

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.050
and photographs done with him.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.180
I took him to English
football clubs.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.180
He went along with it.
but some of it grudgingly.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.030
I used to get a lot of
shtick from a lot of my friends

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.010
and a lot of Americans
when I came back home

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.090
after one of Lennox's
fights. because they

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.140
didn't accept Lennox.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.150
There was always
early on this perception

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:06.160
that the British
accent made him more

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.190
civilized than the
other characters

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.030
with whom he would
deal in the division.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.170
and he must have a more genteel
background than guys who

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.140
had come off of rough streets.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.200
And of course that was a myth.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.120
NARRATOR: Lennox no doubt grew
up during hard times in London.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.010
but he was fortunate that the
police in Kitchener. Ontario

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.010
treated him like any
other wayward kid

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.010
with potential and not a
threat because of where he was

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.140
born or the color of his skin.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.080
At the beginning of the '90s.
he kept his sights on the prize.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.150
building a team that would help
him rise up through the ranks

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.010
of heavyweight contenders.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.140
At that time I went to
school in London. Ontario.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.130
I wanted to be a fitness
trainer for pro athletes.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.160
End of 1990. he came to me and
said. "look. I need your help.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.000
I need your help.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.020
I'm gonna fight the number
three fighter in the world.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.100
I know I can beat
him if you help me.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.060
but I need to be stronger."

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.060
So we agreed to
train for one fight.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.180
I told him I'd help
him for one fight.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.020
SONG: I and I build a cabin.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.110
I and I plant the corn.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.090
Chase those crazy
baldheads out of our town.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.070
NARRATOR: Lennox surrounded
himself with childhood friends.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.110
including Egerton Marcus.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.170
Lennox. he became--

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.230
that's my brother.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.160
That's my brother.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.090
Because when he's in a fight.
it's like I'm in a fight.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.150
NARRATOR: These familiar
faces. like his old coach

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:54.060
Adrian Teodorescu and Courtney
Shand always had Lennox's back.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.030
but they also kept him grounded.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.210
He always said to me. "you
always have to be honest.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.050
You always have to
tell me how things are.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:08.200
Never tell me it's raining
when it's sunny. because I'm

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.040
going to believe you."

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.150
And one day what he did
to show me. that day he

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.080
told me that we were driving.
he closes his eyes and he says--

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.210
Listen. tell me
which way to turn.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.100
He's driving. and I'm
like. "Lennox. Lennox!

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.050
What are you doing?

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.210
What are you doing?"

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.080
And He's like. "just
tell me what to do.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.050
tell me what to do."

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.030
And he had his eyes shuts tight.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.110
I'm looking at him
like. are you crazy?

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.120
And he goes. "that's the
level of trust I need to have.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.110
That's what I'm giving to
you. and please hold on to it

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.090
dearly."

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.220
Ladies and gentlemen. good
evening and welcome to the Omni

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.100
Arena here in one of America's
greatest sports cities.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.150
Atlanta. Georgia.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.170
Lennox Lewis. he is
Canadian and English.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.000
fighting out of England.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.170
Biggs. of course.
four years ago.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.100
was the star heavyweight
in the Duvas' main event

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.170
stable when he fought
against Mike Tyson in 1987

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.030
in Atlantic City.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.050
The question I have is
whether being an amateur

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.040
could hurt him in the way
it might have hurt Biggs.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.150
NARRATOR: In November of
1991. Lennox got the chance

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:18.140
to write what went wrong in
the '84 Olympics. a rematch

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.130
with the man that beat
him. Tyrell Biggs.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.090
Lewis comes out firing
and lands a right hand.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.220
Lennox Lewis looks like much
the stronger guy physically.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.110
Looks like he can handle
Tyrell on the inside.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.190
Very little head
movement for Lewis.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.200
Could be a problem
later on. particularly

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.140
for a guy who's 6'5.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.080
And down goes Biggs from
the solid right cross.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.020
That's an impressive
victory for Lennox Lewis.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.190
And I'll go in the ring and find
out where he's going from here.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.040
Lennox Lewis is on a
mission. and Tyrell Biggs

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.160
was a stepping stone.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.100
And all I need is a
couple more fights.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.130
and then I'll be in there
against the champion.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.020
All right. Larry. so Lennox
Lewis takes another step

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.050
toward big time
heavyweight contention.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.090
and we're gonna talk
to one of the big time

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.160
heavyweight contenders
of all time right now.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.050
George. if you can hear me. what
did you think of Lennox Lewis?

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.180
I was more than impressed.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.060
He's a great boxer and a
good right hand puncher.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.230
I'll tell you this. I don't
want any parts of him.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.000
NARRATOR: This was a fighter
that the world was not used to.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.120
Articulate. to
himself. contemplative.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.140
not getting into
trouble with the law.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.000
a chess player. a thinker.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.040
And you do some meditation.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.120
Can you tell us about that?

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.140
Yeah. I think
you've got to focus

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.170
on what you have to accomplish.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.190
And you know. I
create my own facade.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:46.020
so it's very important for me to
have an even ground around me.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.190
NARRATOR: This towering
dominant contender

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.010
for the world
heavyweight championship

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.080
was mysteriously different.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.210
To take his career
to the next level.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.090
he decided to replace
John Davenport

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.050
with a more seasoned trainer.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.080
It was like a
complete 180 in terms

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.180
of who he chose as
a coach. because he

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.090
went to every Pepe Correa.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.160
Pepe was flashy.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.230
He liked movement.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.070
He wanted Lennox not to just
stand in the middle of the ring

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.120
and use his pure size.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.170
This guy. when
you talk to him.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.130
he gets right into your face.
and he listens everything.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.170
He hangs on every word that you
say. and he makes it easier.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.130
He makes my job very. very easy.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:26.120
With Pepe coming on was the
evolution of Lennox as a boxer.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.120
Pure boxer. not
just someone that

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.170
could throw punches and
get you because he was big.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.160
but move. be fluid.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.150
We had I think three or
four fights with Pepe.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.040
and they kept getting better.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.070
The big one was when we fought
our Donovan Razor Ruddock.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.070
I think the only fight I was
really worried about for Lennox

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.090
was the Razor Ruddock fight.
because I knew if we'd lost.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.130
that was the end of the
whole road and the ride.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.040
But it was Lennox who calmed
my nerves for that fight.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.120
In my memory. the first of his
fights that we covered on HBO

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.050
was actually Halloween
night 1992 in Earls Court

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.100
in London versus Razor Ruddock.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.080
The battle between Razor
Ruddock and Lennox Lewis

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.120
for the right to fight the
winner of Holyfield-Bowe

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.010
for the Heavyweight
Championship.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.200
an exciting night in London.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.200
I was impressed that
he was so relaxed.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.090
Lennox Lewis can probably be
one of the greatest fighters

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.020
to ever come out
of this country.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.070
And I remember walking away
from the meeting thinking.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:28.090
wow. what a very cool.
self-possessed character he is.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:32.000
I wonder if he knows
something that I don't know.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.110
Not since the days of Bob
Fitzsimmons and the last decade

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.010
of the 19th century has
an English-born fighter

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.140
held the heavyweight crown.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.220
Lewis initiates
the action so far.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.140
He says his plan is
to stick the jab.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.120
stay relaxed. move away from the
left hook. and outbox Ruddock.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.060
Right hand by Lewis.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.050
Ruddock goes down!

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.040
A smashing right cross
with perfect accuracy

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.160
behind the jab.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.150
You cannot do it better.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.020
And the wobbling Razor Ruddock--

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.060
NARRATOR: Many were assuming
that Razor's experience

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.150
and ability to take
a punch would be too

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.040
much for Lennox. who
struck many as just

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040
a pretty boy from England.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.020
Lewis herding Ruddock
with the left hook.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.140
Ruddock in serious trouble as
Lewis pounds him to the canvas.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:32.010
Second knockdown of the fight.
and already Lennox Lewis

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.120
has equalled Mike
Tyson's knockout output

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.110
against Razor Ruddock in both
of the two Tyson-Ruddock fights.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.230
Lennox Lewis is in
total command now.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.230
Can he finish?

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.220
Right hand to the body.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.220
Ruddock in trouble.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.210
Second knockdown of round 2.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.080
We have a great new heavyweight
on the boxing scene.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.190
Lennox Lewis may turn out
to be not only the greatest

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.060
heavyweight in British
history but the greatest

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.180
fighter in European history.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.180
I agree. I agree!

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.060
NARRATOR: By 1992. Ring Magazine
had Lennox Lewis all the way up

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.050
from 9 in 1991 to number
two. behind Riddick Bowe.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.090
the guy he had already beat.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.130
Tyson was gone.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:26.040
And in his place. Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis's

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.140
old Olympic rival.
Riddick big daddy Bowe.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:35.030
began a four year battle for the
top spot in heavyweight boxing.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.190
Yo. bring it on. man.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.180
Yeah. I'm gonna bring it.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.160
He's known for
sucker punching people.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.070
because I've seen
him do it before.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.230
So I made sure I had my
hands close to my face.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.170
ready to block anything
he was coming with.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.000
And I said the
same thing to him.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.100
"I'm gonna knock you out."

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.080
Knock me out.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.180
Knock me out.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.220
NARRATOR: During Bowe's second
title run with all three belts.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.200
he gave up the most coveted
WBC title. the same title

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.130
Muhammad Ali fought for.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.000
He mockingly dropped
it in a trash

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.080
while pressed to defend
it against Lennox.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.150
Some would say maybe he
didn't want to face Lennox.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.000
Some would say
maybe he was afraid

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.210
that Lennox would
kick his ass. just

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.110
like he did in the Olympics.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.030
When Riddick Bowe dumped
the belt in the garbage.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.050
Lennox definitely
was pissed off.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.210
Disrespect.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.020
That's another
reason why I wanted

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.160
to beat his ass in the ring.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.080
NARRATOR: Because of his
recent victory over Ruddock.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.230
Lennox was awarded
the WBC title.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:37.100
becoming the first British
champion in over 100 years.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.200
Lennox had the
belt. but he didn't

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.140
really win it in the ring.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.170
So in his next fight Lennox
had something to prove.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.220
In the very first fight.
Lennox was the champion

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.090
because the belt
was handed to him.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.120
and the opponent was Tony
Tucker. Don King's opponent.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.100
He had this thing
about Don King.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.090
NARRATOR: Don King was
boxing's longest running pimp.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.060
having gone from a
neighborhood numbers

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.070
running bookie to somehow
convincing Muhammad Ali to box

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:08.090
in a charity exhibition to
then promoting Ali in the 1974

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.110
Rumble in the Jungle.
Ali's upset victory

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.030
over George Foreman.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.050
Throughout his life.
Don King proved

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.030
that he was a masterful
manipulator and the game's

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.150
consummate promoter.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.190
In the late '80s
into the '90s. King

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.000
had his hooks into Mike Tyson.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.210
Don King is one of the most
funniest men I've ever known.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.220
He kept saying. "Lennox.
you're the greatest.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.030
You should be with me.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:36.110
You should be with me. come
over to the other side!"

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.050
Here he comes now!

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.120
Greatest heavyweight
champion of all time!

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.040
The baddest man on
planet Earth. the

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.150
meet and greet the heavyweight
champion of the world.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.120
Lennox Lewis!

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.230
Lennox Lewis!

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:55.080
And you think. Don. let's
get down to the business.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.170
I'm not worth of
tying his shoelace.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:01.010
He's standing beside me.
the messiah of boxing.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.160
Yes. Lennox Lewis!

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.040
Once the politics. what he
called polytricks. once them

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.230
polytricks are more
or less smoothed out.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.170
Don King thought Tony
Tucker would beat Lennox.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.110
NARRATOR: King had a
reason to be confident.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.160
Tucker's record was 48 in 1. his
only last being to Mike Tyson.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.160
But after a 12 round slugfest.
Lennox won by decision.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.130
With his title legitimized.
next up he would face

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.140
fellow englishman Frank Bruno.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.100
Great Britain. where prize
fighting finds its roots.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.110
the past 100 years have given
them little reason to cheer.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.150
There's a great tradition
of boxing in this country.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:45.000
Unfortunately we don't have too
many good fighters these days.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.100
And we certainly haven't had
too many good heavyweights.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.070
The last undisputed
British heavyweight champion

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.080
was Bob Fitzsimmons in 1897.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.220
Not until the arrival
of Lennox Lewis in 1992

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.040
would the British be
able to claim another.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.210
But tonight's event takes
on greater significance.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.010
as it marks the first
time in history that two

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.120
englishmen have
battled one another

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.150
for a world heavyweight title.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.060
This guys been slagging
me down ever since he's

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.090
come back from Canada.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.200
I'm going to knock him out.
knock him back to Canada.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.230
I'm gonna knock him out so
hard that he's got to pay

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.070
to come back into the hall.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.160
He said he's gonna
hit you so hard it's

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.060
gonna send you back to Canada.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.050
Not a very nice
thing to say. but--

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.100
Well. he's trying to scare
me. but I can't be faded.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.210
You will be knocked out.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.200
Fight like you will
leave your feet.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.090
We'll put you to sleep.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.200
I mean. bring a pillow
to ringside for you.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.080
Big boy. you going.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.050
And lest you be
confused by that graphic.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.130
keep in mind that Lewis
was awarded the WBC

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:48.050
heavyweight championship by that
governing body after Riddick

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.040
Bowe relinquished it
rather than to fight

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.170
him in a mandatory challenge.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.050
That's why Bruno has
the chance to become

00:34:55.050 --> 00:35:00.060
the first British heavyweight
to win a title in the ring.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.190
No heavyweight has looked better
in the last couple of years

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.230
than Lewis with his
stunning destruction

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:13.050
of Razor Ruddock in 216 seconds
in Earls Court last October.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:17.090
Bruno pounding his fists
together to jack himself up.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.190
Mickey Van calls them
together. and round 1--

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.140
Good right hand by Bruno!

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.140
Bruno has Lewis
in serious trouble.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.020
Let's see if Lennox
knows how to hold on.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.010
Bruno pounding away to the body.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.170
That right hand is one of the
biggest punches Lennox Lewis

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:38.040
has ever taken in his career.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.230
Lewis in trouble in the corner.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.020
And lands a
sensational left hook.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.040
What a comeback by Lewis.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.000
Now let's see if he can finish.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.110
Bruno in serious trouble.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.060
He's got him now.
if he can finish.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.140
Right hand over the top.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.040
It was a left hook
that turned this around

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.170
and a frozen Frank Bruno is
there kicking punishment.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.000
And making Mickey
Van is gonna stop it.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.070
It was a one punch comeback.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:08.030
Lennox Lewis. desperately
behind on the score cards.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.200
produced a
sensational left hook.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.160
NARRATOR: Lennox started
1994 off with a bang.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.190
He defended his title
with an eighth round

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.090
knockout of Phil Jackson.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.050
Pepe and I would
kind of butt heads

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.040
in terms of what
was best for Lennox

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.110
in terms of what he wanted.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.040
Where Davenport would
say to me. "this is what

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.170
I need Lennox to do. do it."

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.190
Pepe would always be
overseeing and overseeing.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:41.080
and I think that started to
rub Lennox the wrong way.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.040
We were in training
camp for the Oliver

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.210
McCall fight in the Catskills.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.080
And I watched Pepe
Correa with Lennox.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.110
And Lennox was sparring.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.090
And he caught one of
the sparring partners

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.080
and wobbled him.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.210
And it was only the first
round or second round.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.160
And Pepe went.
"that's great. champ.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.080
That's great. champ.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.110
We don't need to see no more."

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.200
And I thought. what
the hell's he doing?

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.160
One round of sparring?

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.170
And I sat with Lennox.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.140
And I said. "Lennox. you're
not responding to Pepe.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.090
Please let me sack Pepe."

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.070
I said. I'll help Harold.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.180
I'll help Courtney.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.210
We can get through this.
because you trust them.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.140
I said. and they're
there for you.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.020
Pepe is a cheerleader.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.050
And Lennox went. "Frank.
I can deal with it.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.170
I'll win this fight.
and then we'll sit down.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.010
and we'll sort out Pepe."

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.020
The Atomic Bull. as
Oliver McCall is known.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.200
will exit from his dressing room
and make his way to the ring

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.150
right now.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.210
As you can see. it's the first
championship fight for the man

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.150
promoted by Don King.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.180
It's not unusual for
a fighter of his caliber

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.090
to get a championship shot.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:47.180
What is unusual is that somebody
like that should be required

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.040
to fight for the Heavyweight
Championship by somehow

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.200
mysteriously being ranked
as the top contender.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.070
Record for Lennox
Lewis. 25 wins. no losses.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.170
21 wins by knockout.
including two

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.060
of the three title defenses.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.230
Jim. it looks to me that
Oliver McCall is so emotional.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.030
he's crying.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.000
I had the exact same feeling.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.010
He's trying to screw
up his courage.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.070
but I think he's
wasting energy here.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.000
That's exactly what I said.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.200
So after some unusual moments--

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.010
they seem to crop up in every
heavyweight championship

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.180
fight--

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.080
here we go.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.180
The bull has been known to
have very. very good stamina.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.110
If the first round
is a prototype.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:37.060
so far it's a good
one for Oliver McCall.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.120
Lennox caught McCall with a
good punch in the first round.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.020
And when he came back on
his stool. he sat down.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.080
and Pepe Correa went to him.
"forget everything I've taught.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.120
Just go out and knock him out."

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.130
You're looking good. OK?

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.230
You're fighting a very
intelligent fighter.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.060
You're taking this
next punch away

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.030
from him in the right hand.
- Right.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.120
He shot it twice. and every
time you roll and counter.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.000
You caught him with
it once but you're

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.100
gonna make him quit
throwing it if you keep

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.080
throwing everything at him. OK?

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.050
Lewis threw more left
hands and fewer right

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.150
hands in the first
round than we've

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:12.070
seen him before. Gill. I thought
it was by his own fight plan.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.230
But perhaps that's also
the fight plan of Stewart.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.130
And you know--

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.070
down goes Lewis.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.090
Down goes Lewis.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.190
He caught a short
left hand inside.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:30.180
Six. seven. eight. nine--

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.150
What is this?

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:35.090
The WBC's referee has
stopped this fight

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:40.050
after a count to nine with
Lewis standing in front of him.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.000
And we're gonna
have a riot here.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.100
Jose Guadalupe Garcia stopped
the fight in the second round.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.170
But let's take a look at the
punch that put Lewis down.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.220
That's hardly a
devastating punch.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.180
This is really unusual.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.020
But when you have a
heavyweight championship fight.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.220
the heavyweight
champion should have

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:03.190
a chance to defend his title
almost to the last breath.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.210
It's a strange sport.
Gill. and you see

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.100
strange things all the time.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.110
You don't wanna leap to too
many conclusions too fast.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.000
but you saw the
joy with which Don

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.160
King embraces his
return to a part

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.020
of the heavyweight championship.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.100
It's been a few
years. and he's back.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.160
Returned from almost oblivion.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.070
Back on top again with
a heavyweight champion.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.210
Never count him out.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.020
Are we going to see
you again. Lennox?

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.180
Yes.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.050
I may be down. but I'm not out.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.230
Thank you very much. Lennox.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:37.000
We were all sad coming
back into the hotel room.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.010
you know. with our faces down.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:44.140
He said to us. "why
are we all down?

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.080
We shouldn't be down.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.170
You know. I'm gonna come back.
and I'm gonna beat this guy."

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.110
That morning. about
5:00 in the morning.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.160
both he and Frank
Maloney. they were

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.130
already plotting
how we were gonna

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.030
go back and get the title.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.200
NARRATOR: Lennox
maintained the same core

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.000
team throughout his career.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.230
People like Courtney and
Egerton. who we grew up with.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.020
or like Herald
Knight. who was right

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.170
there at the start of his
career. people that kept him

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.060
grounded.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.210
But at critical points. Lennox
always found a better captain

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.230
to steer the ship.
especially when it

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.010
went through turbulent waters.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.210
After the upset victory
of Oliver McCall. who

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:30.110
better to hire than the
architect of his only loss.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.040
Emanuel Steward?

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.050
Emanuel Steward
was good friends

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:38.020
with one of my first
mentors. John Davenport.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:44.130
So when he came with us.
our team with Lennox Lewis.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.090
I was more happy than
Lennox. because. man.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.030
Steward was like a sage.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.030
He was a guru.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:54.190
Frank Maloney and myself.
after Lennox got knocked out

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:59.100
by Oliver McCall. we literally
pulled Emanuel Steward right

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.210
then and there in the
ring. you're coming

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.130
with us from here on out.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:06.210
NARRATOR: Before engineering
Lennox's only defeat.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.100
Emanuel Steward had
developed a reputation

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.160
for turning good
boxes into champions

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.140
of the highest caliber.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.120
When I first became
involved with Lennox.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.140
Lennox actually was too
tentative and too cautious.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.220
But I've always predicted
that Lennox Lewis would

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.170
be a great heavyweight. was
possibly the best heavyweight

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.200
out there. even when
I was training Evander

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.210
Holyfield and Oliver McCall.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.220
Particularly the fights
where people are questioning

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.040
his toughness. I would say.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.110
Those seem to be the fights
that motivate him the most.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.090
One of the things that made
Emanuel Steward the greatest

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.160
boxing trainer of all
time. in my personal view.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.030
was that he perfectly understood
that every single fighter comes

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.070
from a different incubus.
a different background.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.210
And he wanted to know who
they were. and know what made

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:55.140
them tick. and respond to that.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.200
The first time I actually
met Emanuel Steward.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.140
he said he watched me
boxing. and he thinks

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.050
I have a lot of natural
talent. and he thinks

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.060
I'll be a champion one day.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.220
But he told me that way
when I was an amateur.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.080
And then we picked
him up at the airport.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.070
went out for dinner.
and Lennox. while we

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.050
were having dinner.
started saying "Manny.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.160
tell me how you beat me."

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.230
And he'd get up and
he'd demonstrate.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.230
"I saw you doing this.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.140
This is what we looked for.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.070
We knew this was one
of your tendencies.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.060
and we wanted to lure
you into this position.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.020
We're gonna get in the gym.
and I'm gonna change that.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.060
so you never get caught
with that punch again."

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.160
He said to Lennox. "I
want you in the gym

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.210
tomorrow morning. 9:00."

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.140
The one thing that was
different about Manny.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.110
he got right in the
ring. and he showed you.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.120
I went to meet with
Lennox. and after the meeting

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.010
I had a good feeling.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.190
And we worked out in the gym.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:46.110
There was very good chemistry
between Lennox and I.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.220
And I decided that
I was gonna do it.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:55.000
When Emanuel
took over. I think

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.220
more of the technical
side came out in Lennox.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.070
It was more about
boxing. more about the jab.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.070
more about the uppercut.
the right hook.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.050
He wasn't just a
trainer. a coach. a mentor.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.220
He was a people's person.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.160
He used to take myself.
obviously Lennox Lewis.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.200
and Courtney Shand driving
around town in his candy

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.170
apple Rolls Royce with the white
top. with the white top down.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:27.030
And that personal relationship.
he used to talk with Lennox.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.170
He used to talk with all of us.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.110
We always went to camp
for like almost 12 weeks.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.140
The first week was just.
I want you guys to sleep.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.150
I want you guys
to get some rest.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.110
We're gonna get up.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.110
We're not gonna start
training right away.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.140
Just come in. rest.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.090
You remember Pepe Correa.
who was Lewis's trainer.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.140
fired after Lewis's
loss to Oliver McCall.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:50.120
Tonight. he will work in
Lionel Butler's corner.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.220
Emanuel Steward trained Evander
Holyfield to his upset victory

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.220
over Riddick Bowe.
and then trained

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:03.100
McCall. as we've mentioned.
to his victory over Lewis.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.190
Lewis suddenly doing a lot
of work with the left hand.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.210
And that is relatively new.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.100
Go out there and jump on this.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.190
You gotta jump on him.
hit him in the head.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.010
Keep your right hand up.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:20.070
Your biggest mistake is
your right hand is too low.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:24.020
And that right hand might
be enough to finish it.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.020
And it is.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.230
And the thunder is still there
in Lennox Lewis's right hand.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.000
Lennox Lewis has got
this punching power.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.110
All he needs is a
little more confident.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.020
This guy can rule the
heavyweight division

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.000
for a long time with
that extra reach he has.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.150
Resistance.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.130
There's a lot of it.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:43.010
He's caught here
and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.010
It stopped.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.010
Even before he hit the
floor. Roy [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.070
decided that that was enough.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.100
His were blocked by
Lennox Lewis's arms.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.200
And there's a
monumental uppercut.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.180
This is the best
Lewis we've seen

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.160
in a while. much more measured.
less wild. better footwork.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.210
Much better footwork.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.000
Lane is getting very
close to a stoppage here.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.160
You get that sense.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.080
Now goes Morrison again.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.190
A terrific performance
by Lennox Lewis.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.060
Defensively he kept
that right hand up.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:16.120
so that he completely
neutralized Tommy Morrison's

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.040
outstanding left hook.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.170
You describe for us
how you were different.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.110
or how you felt
different in this fight

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.010
than you have in
some other fights.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.080
Differently Emanuel Steward.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.080
I have to give credit to
Emanuel Steward and the team

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.180
behind me. Courtney Shand.
Harold the Shadow Knight.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.110
They've helped me develop this.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.230
NARRATOR: Lennox beat Tommy
Morrison in brutal fashion.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.150
Meanwhile. Tyson
was out of prison

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.000
and making his own comeback.
winning the WBC belt

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.080
for the second time
after he defeated

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.170
Frank Bruno. who had won it
by beating Oliver McCall.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.160
Every fight brought
us a new objective.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.010
I wanted to know that if
a man's blocking my jab

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.220
and he's learned to
control my job. well.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.020
I've got a right hand.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.220
If he's learned to
control that right hand.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.210
I've got an uppercut hook.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:12.180
For the winner on a split
decision. Lennox Lewis!

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.180
The WBC belt.
what happens now?

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.020
If you don't fight
Lennox Lewis. they're

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.000
either gonna take it away
or something's gonna happen.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.020
I take all challengers.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:19.180
Line them up.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.050
NARRATOR: After
defeating Ray Mercer.

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:25.090
the WBC named Lennox as Tyson's
next mandatory challenge.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.100
But Tyson's handlers
wouldn't agree to a fight

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:31.020
with Lennox. which led to a
rematch with Oliver McCall.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.080
Good combination by Lewis.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.110
Left hook and a right
hand over the top.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.090
Just take your time. son.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.210
Start ripping into the
body a little bit now. OK?

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.060
You're not pushing back any.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.070
You gonna start pushing back.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.120
McCall is doing a very
strange thing here. folks.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.180
He's walking around.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.030
He's wandering
around the ring.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:58.200
He hasn't gone to his corner.
and he's trying to figure out

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.020
what's gone wrong.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.100
Lennox Lewis in an awfully
difficult and awkward position.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.180
Lewis doing what he has to do.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:13.060
You wonder how much longer Mills
Lane will allow this to go.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.030
And that's-- that's gonna be it.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.180
NARRATOR: After avenging his
only loss by defeating Oliver

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:24.020
McCall. Lennox dominated his
next three opponents. all

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.110
of them top 10 contenders.
who many thought

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.070
would give him trouble.

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.230
While Lennox was blazing
through the division.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.170
Mike Tyson was struggling
to defeat his own demons.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.170
What happened here?

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.160
He got bit. I think.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.210
My goodness. he's
got a bloody right ear!

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:47.120
Holyfield bit by a
dirty Mike Tyson.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.070
See. look at him.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.010
You can see it.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.160
You can see it!

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.030
There it is!

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.150
I can't believe what
I'm seeing. fellas.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:56.180
He's signaling that it's over.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.010
I think they've just
about had enough.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.200
Tyson showing desperation and
biting Holyfield two times.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.120
Look out now!

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.210
More fighting in the ring
After the end of the fight.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.100
NARRATOR: With two victories
now over Tyson and Bowe

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.200
out of the picture.
Evander holyfield

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.110
was considered the real deal.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.080
Lennox ranked number two behind
him for three years in a row.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.050
'96. '97. and '98.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.100
That had him burning up inside.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.070
There was only one
way to settle it.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.070
Riddick Bowe didn't
want to fight Lennox.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.220
so Riddick Bowe came to me.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.170
Tyson didn't fight Lennox.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.050
He fought me.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:40.100
Each and every time that
they had an opportunity

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.020
to choose to fight Lennox.
they chose to fight me.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.150
because they thought I
was a lesser opponent.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.190
And I always surprised them.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:54.160
So out of respect. I had
to face him and give him

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.170
the opportunity
that he had given

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.080
me of being the three time
heavyweight champ of the world.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.040
With a victory over
Evander Holyfield.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.200
Lennox Lewis will become maybe
one of the most powerful men

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.140
to ever be in boxing.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.100
This will take you and bring
you into full visualization.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.050
This is your hour.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.010
Before you talk
about Tyson. Tyson

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.000
will be bigger than the event.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.030
No matter if you
win. you don't win.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.200
You know what I mean?

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.230
Holyfield has
diminished that light.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.120
You've got it going in here.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.000
I don't know what it is. but
this is the type of fight

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.100
that's got us all excited.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.040
It broke me out
into a cold sweat.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.160
NARRATOR: The time had come for
Lennox and Evander Holyfield

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.030
to touch gloves.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:49.000
Entire career. two-time
heavyweight champion

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.100
of the world. Olympic
gold medal winner.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.210
it won't mean
anything if he does

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.010
not beat Evander Holyfield.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:56.140
He will just be another kid
with dreadlocks from England.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.180
I got Sean Connery doing the
voiceover on the commercial.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.090
Get out of here.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:02.180
Yeah?

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.120
007. baby!

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.050
And what's it been like the
last few days in New York?

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.000
Countless press
conferences. everybody

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.180
wanting to talk to you?

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.160
You must get fed up with it.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.000
You must want to
get on with it now.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.040
Yeah. definitely.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.060
I've done countless interviews
asking the same questions

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.130
over and over.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:22.180
Now I think these questions need
to be answered with a fight.

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.200
Believe me.
Holyfield gonna put

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.130
something on his hands. man.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.190
Oh. yeah. he gonna
pound on his ass.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:27.130
Come on. man.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.210
He gonna get pounded on. man.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:31.220
We couldn't paint a ticket
in if we were an artist.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.230
It's a sold out fight three
months before the fight.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:37.220
It's the fastest sell-out
in heavyweight history.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.170
in the history of the garden.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.100
And so we have just the
biggest fight. four times

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.150
as big as any event
money-wise in the garden.

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:48.080
So these are some first
in history making events

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.110
that you have with the
Real Deal Holyfield

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:53.160

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.200
Don't even worry.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.030
Don't even worry.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.060
Lenny. you got your jacket?

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:08.200
Yeah.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:15.000
Before you was
born. it was written.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
This is the moment of truth.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.030
Lennox Lewis enters first.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:25.020
He has labored long
and bucked the tide

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.020
of a lot of disrespect on
this side of the Atlantic

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.200
to get to this threshold.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:36.150
As a professional. 34 wins. the
one second round knockout loss

hands of McCall later

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:43.140
avenged. 27 knockouts for
the two-time belt-holder

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.160
from England.

(SINGING) We sing Holy Father.
power and strength to the Lord.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.120
And here we go.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.190
It's the moment you've
all been waiting for.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.120
Only three men
left in the ring.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.110
And we're underway.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:13.210
Holyfield seeming to
slip as Lewis landed

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.090
the first punch of the bout.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:18.090
That goes by the wayside
because Holyfield only

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:22.070
threw 17 punches in round 1.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:25.010
Quiet here at floor
level. where the Holyfield

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:28.080
fans are wondering why
their man doesn't get off.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.210
Raucous noise in the
upper deck. where

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:35.040
the englishmen are enjoying
Lewis's early dominance.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.150
--won't win for
Evander Holyfield.

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:43.120
And he cringes against the ropes
as Lewis lands a right hand.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.230
They're singing upstairs.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.100
They're cheering downstairs.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.140

Even a draw. the
decision is even a draw.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.150
Both champions
retain their belts.

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.220
That's a travesty.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.180
That is. ladies and
gentlemen. a travesty.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.190
an outrage. a highway robbery.

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:21.110
Lennox Lewis has
just been robbed

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.140
of the undisputed heavyweight
championship of the world.

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.200
He won it. and he didn't get it.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.200
You know. that is a shame.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.210
Emanuel Steward. first
give us your impression

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:38.040
of the scoring of the fight.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.120
You know. first of all.
it was a terrible decision.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.090
Anybody can see the fight.

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:43.140
Now. I normally
don't even complain.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.030
even the Thomas Hearns Sugar
Ray Leonard number 2 fight.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.220
But this fight is really
what's hurting boxing.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:52.110
Every time we try to move boxing
forward and make a great fight

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.220
of some type like
this. this kind of crap

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.220
just comes on. where
Evander only won

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.100
three rounds. four at the most.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.060
But nevertheless.
it's called a draw.

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.080
This is what's killing boxing.

I was fucking afraid of that.

A draw?

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.070
You shut his ass down.

Let's talk like
we're champions.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.040
We won the fight.

That's how we're talking
at the press conference.

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.170
Yeah.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.150

If you think that
he lost the fight.

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.230
tell him that you think that.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.100
The judges didn't think it.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.210
And I tell you. he's
ready to do it again.

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:47.090
When you get a man hurt.
you're supposed to finish it.

You don't play chess with it.

Where was that third round?

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.050
That's what I want to know.

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:54.040
What happened in
that third round?

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:55.210
Well. Lennox. you know what?

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.130
Have you ever thought
about when we fight again.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:58.210
I got another chance to do it?

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:04.050
Yes. yes. it ain't over yet!

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.130
Yeah. it's not over.

Regardless of what
people say about him.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.070
Don is a very smart man.

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:22.190
So when Lennox never signed
with Don and beat every fighter.

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:26.090
that more or less incensed
Don a little bit more

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:30.200
to have that little
thing against Lennox.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.080
It seems so unfair that guys
like Don King and Bob Arum

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.180
and these guys are getting
crazy rich off of the blood

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.080
and sweat of these
boxers. and then

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.140
they end up with very little.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.040
Absolutely.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.070
I mean. if you look at
the Holyfield fight.

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.110
Holyfield made $15
million in one fight.

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:49.080
I made 10. and Don King made 10.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.220
But he never
stepped in the ring.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.070
You know what you
guys should have done?

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:54.120

Now after being in
the ring with Holyfield.

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:05.040
we didn't have to really go
back to study tapes and do this.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.010
because Lennox had 12
rounds in his mind.

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.040
And once you've fought
with Lennox once.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.100
once he's in the
ring with you once.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.160
there is no way you're gonna
get him the second time.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.220
We knew. OK. we can't
leave it to the judges.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:20.170
We weren't just gonna
be fighting Holyfield.

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.040
We'll be fighting the judges.

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:02.080
You're shooting him
right. but shoot him low.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.030
Don't shoot him high.

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:06.220

range. and summon the best round

against each other in two

Their heads come
together again.

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:23.010
and Lewis produces some good
in-fighting as he drives

Evander back to the wall.

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:25.130

won't knock down anybody.

Multiple punches for Lewis.

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.200
Holyfield knocked
over. fires the right

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.210
and drives Lewis into the ropes.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:38.200
Lennox goes back to the
body and the uppercut.

Lewis throws more and lands
more in almost every round.

more seconds of fighting.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.210
I think I went through
some trials and tribulations.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:06.160
and enough people were
trying to stop me.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.030

to take it over the Atlantic

clear victory over Holyfield.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.150
Lennox ended the '90s number
one from Ring Magazine

Here he was. Lennox Lewis.
the undisputed greatest.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.150
The year 2000 was
prime time for Lennox.

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.210
He fought Michael
Grant. a 6'7 heavyweight

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:36.060
from Chicago who was even
bigger and seven years younger.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.110
But he kicked his ass
in only two rounds.

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.080
Lennox went back
to England and got

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.060
Botha again in only two rounds.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:53.060
Finally in November. he took
on a real fire hydrant. the guy

was hard to hit

like Tyson. Samoan David Tua.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:00.160
But Lennox showed an ability
to adapt to any style

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.090
and won a decision in 12.

voted Muhammad Ali the sports

with the respect

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:22.170
of being the
undisputed champion.

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.130
Lennox was honored by his
country alongside his greatest

NARRATOR: While Lennox was
at the peak of his career.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.090
Frank struggled to keep a deep
secret hidden from the world.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.100
I've always known
I was very different.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:59.070
From the age of three and four.
I am born in the wrong body.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.130
I could never let
anyone know this.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:01.220
so I would have to fight it.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.060
So all my life I went
through fighting it.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:08.190
Lennox Lewis's career
and my success in boxing

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.060
gave me something
else to focus on.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.110
But eventually there was
a change in the business

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:16.160
management side. and I
thought that this time they

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.020
were losing track of what
Lennox's career was about.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.170
Being heavyweight
champion of the world.

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:23.020
they were now looking
more at commercial sides.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.210
We were gonna fight
in South Africa.

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:28.040
Next thing I know. Lennox has
decided to train in Las Vegas.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.060
because he's in a film
called Ocean's 11.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.190
I was shooting
a movie with Julia

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:36.200
Roberts and George Clooney.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.120
It was good.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.020
It was great.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.210
I was shooting a fight scene.

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:44.170
I shot my particular
little scene for Ocean's 11

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:48.220
with Larry Merchant
on one of the days

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.160
that Lennox was there to
shoot with Wladimir Klitschko.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.120
And we were all
aware that in South

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.180
Africa was a fight
taking place at I

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:04.180
believe 6.000 feet altitude.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:08.130
Hasim Rahman arrived three
weeks before the fight.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.140
I pleaded with Lennox.

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.150
Lennox turned up I think
seven days before the fight.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:18.010
Let's go ahead and jump on our
plans. try and get organized.

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:20.060
We definitely have to get
organized on this. for real.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.120
We're just off to East
London for a quick stop

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.150
for two to three hours.
and then down to Capetown.

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.140
OK.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.090
The heart of the whole matter.
it seems to me at this point.

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:49.170
based on what
everybody's writing

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:54.170
and how everybody sees this.
is. are you taking him lightly?

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:58.050
To me. the definition of that
comes from one question. OK?

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:02.050
If you were fighting Mike Tyson
in Johannesburg on this day--

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:02.200
OK.

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:08.050
You know. I knew that the
altitude might be a problem.

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:11.040
so I came over in time.
so I would feel like I

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.140
would overcome that obstacle.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.160
I'm sure you're
confident of Lennox

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.080
winning on Sunday morning.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.180
What happens next?

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:21.050
What's the scenario with Tyson?

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.040
Tyson is not an issue
until after the Rahman fight.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.050
so we will not discuss
Tyson. but the priority

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.020
is to win the title.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.140
Lennox. I've got to
ask you this question.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.220
With the whole fight
public calling out for what

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.090
could possibly be
one of the biggest

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:36.180
fights in history. Tyson versus
Lewis. how do you stay focused?

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:41.160
How do you stay focused
on Hasim Rahman?

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.060
Well. what people
don't know. Lennox Lewis

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.010
is a true competitor. you know?

01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:48.040
It doesn't matter if you say
let's run down the street.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.080
I have to be first.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:56.140
Ow!

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.230
Perfect.

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:02.140
In this situation. Hasim
Rahman is in front of me.

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.000
and he's an opponent. and
he's trying to get my titles.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.010
and I'm not gonna allow that.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.020
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.220
[CHEERING]

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.050
Lennox Lewis like a big cat.

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:30.030
Rahman. jab. jab. jab. jab.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:34.010
Chases Lewis across the ring.

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.120
With a thunderbolt
from the right hand!

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.210
We got a brand new
heavyweight champion.

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:50.090
and he's from the United States.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:55.180
When we lost to Hasim
Rahman in South Africa.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.050
that was more shock
than anything.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:00.200
I just got on a
plane and came home.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.000
And I knew on that flight
that my days with Lennox

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.110
was numbered.

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:06.060
And it was numbered.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.160
And it unfortunately there.

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:21.230
Lennox Lewis's career
and my success in boxing

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:24.060
gave me something
else to focus on.

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.190
But eventually I
couldn't keep the lid on

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:29.020
any longer. because I
was destroying myself.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.050
And I came across a
counselor on the telephone.

01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.150
I kept saying to the
counselor. I need you

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.090
to tell me I'm not transgender.

01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:37.220
He said. until you come
to terms with yourself.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.200
there's nothing anyone
can do to help you.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.120
And I-- it took me ages to
come to terms with myself.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.130
I attempted suicide.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:48.040
About three days.
four days later. I

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.120
told my oldest daughter.
and she turned to me

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.210
and said. "do you know what?

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:53.080
I'd rather have
my dad in a dress

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.120
than see my dad in a wooden box.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:00.010
So whatever help you need
to find that inner peace.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.020
I'm there for you."

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:06.130
That really said to
me. do you know what?

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:08.180
I've got to let Kellie
come out full time

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:14.210
and be herself.
and put Frank away.

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.170
And Lennox Lewis was
obviously asked the question.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:19.230
and he put out a
fantastic statement.

01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:23.210
"If this makes Frank or makes
her happy. then so be it.

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:25.090
and I'm happy for her."

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:27.130
Which I think helped
the boxing world

01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:31.180
be a little bit more acceptful
than I expected it to be.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.150
We've had a lot of good
times and a lot of fun.

01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:36.020
so it was a little shock.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:40.140
But once again. who
are we to judge anyone?

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:47.090
And Lennox once again. he
took the first step to say.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:52.110
"do what you gotta do. Kellie.
and I accept you for Kellie."

01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:56.190
And that helped me to
accept Kellie for Kellie.

01:08:56.190 --> 01:09:01.170
He showed what a
compassionate and understanding

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.200
human being he was.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.190
NARRATOR: As Frank struggled
with his gender identity.

01:09:06.190 --> 01:09:08.160
Lennox coped with
his loss to Rahman

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.090
by meeting another
one of his heroes.

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:15.200
Nelson Mandela. who offered sage
advice on overcoming adversity.

01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:24.040
It is the nature of sport
that you will have triumphs

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.110
and you will have adversities.

01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:31.210
Legends like Joe Lewis. as you
know. people like Muhammad Ali

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:34.190
have also had a similar fate.

01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:38.210
But he came back twice
and won the title.

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:44.150
And I say to Lennox. he must
not wonder at all if he trains

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:48.170
properly and he uses the
advantage that he has.

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:50.000
that left jab of his.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.050
I didn't know that he's
been watching me all this time

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:58.200
and studying me.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.090
And this is Nelson Mandela.

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.060
So that was a
great thing for me.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.110
just to even know that. wow.
this guy's been watching me.

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:06.210
studying me. knows how I
box. and he can tell me

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:09.090
that I'm gonna go in there and
win the next time I go in there

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:11.140
and fight.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:16.100
We spoke earlier about the
first time I met Lennox Lewis.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.210
And in that very
first meeting. I

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:22.000
remember being
struck by how cool

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.120
he was. how unaffected he
was by the significance

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.200
of that occasion.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.030
The Lennox Lewis that I met
that day before the Ruddock

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:31.120
was the same guy who
did the interview

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.060
with Larry Merchant following
the loss to Hasim Rahman.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.230
Lennox. when all
is said and done.

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.060
did you take him too lightly?

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.150
No. not really.

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:45.020
This is what happens
in heavyweight boxing.

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.190
You get caught with a
good shot. you don't beat

01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.110
the count. they stop the fight.

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.010
Simple as that.

01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.160
But there's always a next time.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.190
You know what I mean?

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:56.090
I can understand how easy it
was for him to not necessarily

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.040
dismiss what happened
in Johannesburg

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.070
but to understand it.
to look at himself

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:03.140
through a certain filter
and say. OK. I did that.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.070
I created the
circumstances for that.

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:09.210
I must learn a lesson from it.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:14.210
And fortunately. I'm big
enough and important enough

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:17.050
that I'll get the
chance at the rematch.

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:22.080
I've got the mountains
to my back in Africa. son.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:31.200
What do you say?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.100
Is it time for the rematch?

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.140
In less than four
months. I'll be ready.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140
I'll be ready.

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:50.170
For most fighters.
and particularly for big

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:55.150
heavyweights. once a guy
has eliminated you with one

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:59.080
colossal shot. it's
very difficult to regain

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.170
the confidence. the
wherewithal. the self-possession

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:04.190
to believe that you're gonna go
in and knock him out instead.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.060
NARRATOR: What do we do
with these rare instances

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.150
when the chance for
redemption is upon us?

01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:16.130
The Rahman rematch was
one of those moments.

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:19.230
but it was about more
than just redemption.

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:22.040
The outcome would determine
whether Lennox would have

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.060
a chance to cement his legacy
in one of the biggest fights

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:29.040
in the history of the sport.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.100
[SHOUTING]

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.100
Or leave behind a
trail of questions

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.050
about what could have been.

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:39.120
There have been times where
he's just been sort of painting

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.070
his opponent and moving
away at the same time.

01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:47.120
but he's throwing some
hard left hands tonight.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.150
Here some jabs.

01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:52.150
That is one stiff jab.

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:58.110
Perhaps Rahman got under
Lewis's skin with the taunting.

01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:01.130
but Lewis got under
his skin with a punch.

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:05.070
He seems for
the moment to have

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:07.090
nullified Rahman's righthand.

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:09.190
Ooh!

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.190
It's over.

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:12.170
Lennox Lewis!

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:17.010
That may turn out to be
Lennox Lewis's most respected

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:19.110
performance ever in the ring.

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.120
Isn't that something?

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.020
When he came back and won his
title back from Hasim Rahman.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.200
that was a really good comeback.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.160
He knocked him
out in four rounds.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.070
To me. that was priceless.

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.220
The first thought that
goes through my mind.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.010
getting ahead of the game.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.030
Listen to the
crowd as they watch

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:40.050
that. is that when
Mike Tyson sees that.

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:43.090
he might not want to
fight Lennox Lewis.

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:44.160
NARRATOR: Having
lost and regained

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.030
his titles in the
same calendar year.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:49.030
Lennox was number one again.

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:55.060
But there was still this
nagging 5'11 225 pound itch.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.130
There was still Mike Tyson.

01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:01.040
Something crossed Cus
D'Amato said when we were

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.010
sparring. "Mike. don't do that.

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:06.130
You're gonna fight
this guy someday."

01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:08.220
Exact words Cus D'Amato said.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.200
So I was thinking. is
this ever gonna happen?

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.060
And you know. it happened.

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.160
Pans back up.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.060
There you go.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.220
Right back.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.120
There you go.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.220
Good fighting.

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.150
I'm trying to get that
combination punch in there.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.080
You did a lot of--

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:30.070
I came across as the
villain. the bad man.

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:32.040
which I didn't mind.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.170
I don't take it personally.

01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:35.070
I like getting
under people's skin.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.180
Defense is impregnable.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.180
And I'm just ferocious.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.140
I want your heart.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.170
I wanna eat his children.

01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:42.110
He said to some
fighter. was it you.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.120
that he wanted to
eat their children?

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.050
Yeah. I was really
disappointed when he said that.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:52.220
but hopefully when we fight.
he's a vegetarian at that time.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.040
This is like in one sense
an ultimate match-up

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.160
between good versus evil.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.210
I look at myself as the good.

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.200
I look at him at evil.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.190
From the moment
we got together

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:08.000
for the press conference.
there was so much tension.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And I remember when
we got to New York

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.220
the night before
the press conference

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.180
and he said. "if Mike
makes one move at me.

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.070
forget all the money.

01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:18.210
I'm not backing down from him.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:21.220
I'm not backing up from him."

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:24.020
All of a sudden.
I seen him take

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.160
his hat off and throw
it on the ground

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.010
and start marching towards me.

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.150
Boom. I was on it.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:33.160
The first three
punches were mine.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.030
and the first bite was his.

01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.110
You're scared now. you ho.

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:41.110
You're scared like a
little white [BLEEP]..

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.000
Right then I knew.
and Lennox knew.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.170
we was gonna beat Mike Tyson.

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:49.070
So that was small little
things that play a big part

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:50.190
of that psychological.

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:52.100
Because if you
remember. Mike was

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.100
always psychologically beating
guys before the fight happened.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.100
You see what I'm saying?

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.020
So it flipped a
little right there.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.050
I remember general sports
reporters would literally

01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:07.120
giggle when I would tell
them that Lennox Lewis had

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.100
enormous advantages over Mike
Tyson. and it was hard for me

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.090
to see how Tyson could ever
possibly overcome them.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:16.230
And because their general
attitude was. you know.

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:20.040
Lennox Lewis is an English
guy who drinks tea.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.130
and Mike Tyson is Mike
Tyson. so obviously

01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:24.210
you're out of your mind. Jim.

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:26.180
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.230
This is clearly going
to be a one sided

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.130
wipe-out in Tyson's favor.

01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.020
That was what they thought
was still happening

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:35.030
in every Mike Tyson fight.

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.180
This is war.

years after sparring

01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:08.010
in the Catskills. the time
had come for these two titans

01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:11.100
to face each other in
one of boxing history's

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.030

to make sure that the gloves
are put on within the rules.

No extra padding. no rough edges
at the seams of the leather.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.220
When they are satisfied.
they sign the gloves.

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:40.000
This is usually a
straightforward process.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.070
but this night was different.

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:45.050

to Lewis's Jamaican heritage.

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:35.150
He is really a man of
three countries. Jamaica.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:37.060
Canada. and Great Britain.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.230

Well. the jab was
a pretty stiff jab.

David Tua made the same mistake.

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:37.190
Mike's supposed to
work on the underjabs.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:40.040
The jabs don't
even have to land.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.030

--hit by Lewis.

Boy. Tyson's got a good chin.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.030
Mike Tyson is being dictated
to by craft. technique.

01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:53.150
professional skill.

01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:56.110
That's what Lewis has
in addition to his size.

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:01.200
He certainly demonstrated some
of the very best of it tonight.

Hugh right hands.

And that's gonna be perhaps
the end of the fight.

Mike to get up from the shot.

out Mike Tyson

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:29.130

of Mike Tyson.

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:40.080
what else could he prove?

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.080
And over the years.
I studied Lennox Lewis.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:50.150
He was if not the most important
certainly one of the most

01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:53.220
important fighters I had
covered to that point

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.050
in my boxing career.

01:21:55.050 --> 01:22:00.110
And I came to the conclusion
that having escaped

01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:05.100
the nightmare of his childhood.
having escaped circumstances

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.080
under which he was taken
away from his mother.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.090
he had run afoul of
difficult circumstances

01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:15.120
on the streets in Canada and
could have destroyed his life

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.110
with a mistake at any moment
up there. and eventually ran

01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:24.230
into a man Arnie Boehm. who
unlike the people who took Mike

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:30.010
Tyson in and from the beginning
saw him as a commodity

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:33.150
to exploit. this
man in Canada who

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:37.220
found Lennox Lewis saw
him as a valuable person

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:40.180
to be supported and redeemed.

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:44.230
And because of the difference
in those two mindsets

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:47.010
and the difference in
those two processes.

01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:49.130
you get the difference
in those two lives.

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:54.230
You get the Lennox Lewis. who
was capable of brushing aside

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:59.020
almost any setback and
continuing to calmly focus

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.170
on his belief in himself. and
his belief in where ultimately

01:23:02.170 --> 01:23:07.050
he could get to. and the
deeply insecure Mike Tyson.

01:23:07.050 --> 01:23:09.110
who always knew
that he was there

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:11.060
to serve someone else's agenda.

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:14.080
Hey. I love you. Mike.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.100
You love me. Mike?

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.080
Love you.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.010
All right.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:20.210
If you piece together those
two threads over a long period

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:22.100
of time. you can see the
difference in the two

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:26.000

to the point of the post

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.170

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:30.060
You said you had to win
this fight to clean up boxing.

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.200
Do you feel you've
accomplished that?

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.020
I went out there and showed
them I'm a pugilist specialist.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.160
I can adapt to any style.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.190
And you know. he showed me
one style that a lot of people

01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:39.090
didn't think I was gonna
be able to deal with.

01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:41.010
but I was able to deal with it.

01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:42.230
A lot of people thought he was
gonna get away from my jab.

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:44.200
but nobody gets
away from my job.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.090
Mike. are you sorry this fight
didn't take place years ago?

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:48.090
It wasn't meant to be.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:51.200
I've known Lennox since
he was 16. 15 years old.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.180
I have mad respect.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.050
Everything I said
was in proposition

01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:56.100
for promoting the fight.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.050
He knows I love
him and his mother.

01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:00.070
And I know that he thinks
I don't have respect

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:03.010
and love him. he's crazy.

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:07.020
NARRATOR: Although Lennox
only had one fight in 2002.

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.080
beating Tyson was enough
to keep him at number one.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.100
You've proven everything.

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.230

take it one day at a time.

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:47.200
NARRATOR: Time goes
by and people change.

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.100
Lennox started to find
that other things in life

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.100
appealed to him.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.210
And he phones me and
told me that he find--

01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:56.170
he met a girl. and that
her name was Violet.

01:24:56.170 --> 01:25:00.110
I ran into him at a
restaurant in New York City.

01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:05.070
I said. wow. for a boxer
he's very handsome.

01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:09.050
When I met Lennox and I
asked him. where do you live?

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:11.190
He says. I live on the planet.

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.220
And then he explained.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:17.010
He says. "well. I was born in
England. I grew up in Canada.

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:19.000
and my parents are Jamaican.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.150
But I identify with the world."

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:24.090
So I found him to be
quite introspective.

01:25:24.090 --> 01:25:27.090
and it led to further
conversations.

01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:31.060
On the way out. I walked
out of the restaurant.

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:34.100
Halfway to the train
station. I turned around

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:38.220
and went back to the restaurant
and interrupted his dinner.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.180
And I just remember
telling him. "I

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.080
really appreciate
how you represent us.

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.110
because you do
represent us well."

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.020
And I walked out and left.

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:50.160
Two years later. to be exact.
we met again in Jamaica.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.120
When that desire
is no longer there

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.130
to get up when
it's cold outside.

01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:01.010
when it's snowing outside. and
it's nice and warm in your bed

01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:04.220
with silk sheets and you have
your fiancee. your future wife

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:09.180
with you. and you don't have
that desire to get up anymore.

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.110
that's when it's
actually time to retire.

01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:17.030
But he wanted to show
that he was the best.

01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:19.050
NARRATOR: For the last
fight of his career.

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:22.010
Lennox took on Ukrainian
Vitali Klitschko.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.210
and successfully defended
his undisputed title

01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:27.110
to the very end.

01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:30.010
Now. as he entered
retirement. Lennox

01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:32.070
finally had a partner
to help balance

01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:35.220
his life outside of the ring.

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:40.040
I think that he
achieved his goals.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.090
He achieved his
legacy to be a world

01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:49.090
champion and the
undisputed world champion.

01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:52.180
Well. he's one of three
to retire with the title.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.160
Not got beat.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:57.060
Retired with the title. and
he went out on his own terms.

01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.100
I think he would have beat
every heavyweight champion.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:03.060
I saw most all of them fighting
and training in the camps.

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.030
Ali and Joe Frazier.
Sonny Liston.

01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:07.170
I've been with all of them.

01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:08.080
Larry Holmes.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.110
Lennox Lewis would
have beat all of them.

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:13.120
He would definitely
have himself established

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.000
as maybe the greatest
heavyweight boxer now.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.150
When he told me
that Violet. that they

01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:23.000
were gonna have their first kid.
something bigger was coming.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.070
Made me think of that moment
when we were kids on the bus.

01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:30.060
and he said. "there's
bigger things to come. man."

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.200
So when he was retiring. that's
what was going through my head.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.220
He retired in February.
and our son was born in June.

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:43.080
I was born in New York.
and I lived in Jamaica

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080
practically my whole life.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.130
His game plan
was always focus on

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.000
boxing. and when
that is finished.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.190
then I focus on my
family. my children.

01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:55.110
and give them the things
that I didn't have.

01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:58.040
which was mainly the stability
of having a mom and a dad.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.160
He really wanted
to break the cycle

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.160
of what he had been through.

01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:08.100
In life. nothing is
really given to you.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.170
You have to earn it.

01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:14.000
From my last daughter.
we got the news

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.090
that she's got trisomy-19.

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:21.010
I didn't realize how
extreme it was until we got

01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:22.230
all the information about it.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:26.220
Most kids with her
condition don't survive.

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:27.200
but she's strong.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.130
She's really strong.

01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:30.210
She's a fighter.

01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:32.210
It's still difficult.
because it's

01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:40.150
like we know kids that have this
condition don't last that long.

01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:42.130
It's one day at a time.

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:43.160
OK. OK.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:52.050
"Float like a butterfly.
sting like a bee."

01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:53.180
Who knows what that is?

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.080
NARRATOR: Building
upon the humanity

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.150
of those who had taught him
how to box. Lennox focused

01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:00.210
on charities that would
help lift young people out

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:04.040
of their trouble by teaching
them to overcome adversities

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.160
through the sport of boxing.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.190
You're sticking your chin out.

01:29:06.190 --> 01:29:08.080
You've got to hide that.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.130
You've got to hide your chin.

01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:12.150
You wanna protect it as
well with your hands.

01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:13.230
At least one of them.

01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:15.190
He is the epitome
of what a world

01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:17.020
champion is supposed to be.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.190
NARRATOR: Of his
41 winning bouts.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:26.130
Lennox's reign with the
WBC belt lasted 16 fights.

01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:35.000
Out of the ring.
Lennox kept his mother.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.060
brother. and childhood friends
like Courtney and Egerton

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.000
around him.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.080
A close-knit family team
that kept him grounded.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.120
But he also gathered a team
of experts from Frank Maloney

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.180
and Harold Knight to one of
the greatest coaches in boxing

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.130
history. Emanuel
Steward. who helped

01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:57.140
him climb to the mountaintop.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.100
He retired as one of only
three heavyweight champions

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.070
in the history of
the sport to have

01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:05.050
beaten every man he
faced alongside Rocky

01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:08.040
Marciano and Muhammad Ali.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:12.090
Who are these men we call
heavyweight champions?

01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:14.030
Why do we look up to them?

01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:16.180
Because they embody all
that's heroic and just?

01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:22.060
Or is it that we
can not look away?

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.030
Who are the real champions?

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:40.140
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.160
SONG: Emancipate yourselves
from mental slavery.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:52.070
None but ourselves
can free our mind.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:54.230
Oh. I've no fear
for atomic energy.

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:57.210
Muhammad Ali. he picked
us before he passed

01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:03.020
to say he wants these two guys.
the guys that fought together.

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:09.120
were foes. put them together.
and make them love each other.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.200
and put me to my resting place.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.090
When me and Lennox
were pallbearers

01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:18.000
for Muhammad Ali's funeral. that
was just a great honor for me.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.150
Does anybody know
who Muhammad Ali is?

01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.140
Yeah.

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:26.000
[CHEERING]

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:32.010
We sparred when we were kids.

01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:33.210
We became very good friends.

01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.210
And when we were young.
Lennox was real tall.

01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:38.000
He was 6'5 when he
was probably 16.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.100
And remember when
you were dancing.

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.170
like how you would dance like?

01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:44.020
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:46.230
He still dances like that.

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:49.100
I do. too. now.

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:53.170
But listen. but
really why it was

01:31:53.170 --> 01:31:57.210
close and meant a lot to me.
because Cus was alive then.

01:31:57.210 --> 01:32:00.050
Arnie was alive then. right?

01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:01.160
No one knew us.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.140
You know. we were just
two guys coming up.

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.120
And then the '80--

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.210
what with the '84 Olympics.

01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:08.020
We lost in '84 in Los Angeles.

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.040
Do you remember when we lost?

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.170
We were just walking
around like two schmucks?

01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:11.070
Shit!

01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:12.150
We went different
ways. but yet

01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:15.010
we ended up in the same place.

01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:18.090
So the friendship. I
believe. was always there.

01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:21.140
And as a result. just
culminated to "we're

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.020
back where we started."

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.180
Look what we did
and we overcame. man?

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.190
That's just the biggest--

01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:28.080
that's the biggest
accomplishment

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.170
that we didn't become
victims to our environments.

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:35.010
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:35.010 --> 01:32:40.100
Because we were statistics
that became specialists.

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.220
And that's why
we're here. really.

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:47.210
Brother. please. just
come up here. please.

01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:50.070
[CHEERING]

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.080
SONG: Let me tell you the
story about Lennox Lewis.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.180
Undefeated. every
chance he never blew it.

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:02.200
Never lost. because he's
the best to ever do it.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.180
Everyone who stepped in
the ring honestly knew it.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.190
Undefeated gold medalist
against the best of them.

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:10.200
He knew his path was
never stressing him.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.210
If you was smart. you
wouldn't mess with him.

01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:16.160
Also a leader. a teacher.
you could progress with him.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:18.140
Mike Tyson couldn't do it.

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.110
Holyfield couldn't prove it.

01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:24.030
People know I was the last true
champion at the boxing ring.

01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:25.070
and I'm stepping in.

01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:28.010
Look. put down the guns.
pick up the gloves.

01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:30.080
Going through so much
pain. we need some gloves.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.110
Gotta show the youth
there is a better way.

01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:35.090
so we can take the
time to educate.

01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:37.200
And put down the guns.
pick up the gloves.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.120
Going through so much
pain. we need some love.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.080
Gotta show the youth
there is a better way.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.160
so we can take the
time to educate.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.140
Now it's for the youth.
stay in the right direction.

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:50.120
Be positive. make love
rather than aggression.

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.090
Nelson Mandela
taught us a lesson.

01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:54.230
Went to the safari. let
Lewis under pressure.

01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:57.170
Before he died. Ali crowned him
and called him the greatest.

01:33:57.170 --> 01:33:59.220
When it comes to helping out.
he don't mind doing favors.

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.050
Just like that. with your
mind you can fight back.

01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:04.080
Have to stay on the right track.
get the picture like IMAX.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.060
The sky's the limit when
you never try to reach it.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:09.120
Whatever you put your mind
to. you can achieve it.

01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:14.010
We need to drop
where you're from.

01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:17.110
and just accept that you
are the undisputed king.

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:18.100
That's just what it is.

01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:21.180
So until somebody
comes and changes

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:24.130
that and breaks that record.
you are still number one.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.210
[INAUDIBLE] still alive.

01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:30.230
That's awesome.

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:31.140
That's great.

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.000
That's great.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.170
So not wanting to lose
really helps me win.

01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:43.030
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.020
Who is the hardest
puncher you ever faced?

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.100
Fuck.

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.030
Probably Lennox Lewis.

01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:55.000
For real?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:55.140
Yeah.

01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:56.230
That motherfucker's
hands was this big.

01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:58.150
One night that motherfucker
grabbed my weed

01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:00.070
and rolled a blunt
with one hand.

01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:02.170
That motherfucker's hand
was this big. one of them.

01:35:02.170 --> 01:35:04.050
Yeah. he's a monster.

01:35:04.050 --> 01:35:06.150
What was it that set
him apart from the others?

01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:08.110
Let Lennox weather the storm?

01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:13.120
Riots that killed 63 people
and injured thousands?

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.080
Yeah. yeah.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:17.040
Don King was boxing's
longest running pimp.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:25.040
I think you got there.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:25.190
Gotta take it.

01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:26.090
Here?

01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:27.200
Yeah.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.150
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:35.110
Some would say. maybe he
didn't want to face Lennox.

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:37.200
Some would say.
maybe he was afraid

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.170
that Lennox would
kick his ass. just

01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:42.010
like he did in the Olympics.

01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:43.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.170
That was awesome.

01:35:44.170 --> 01:35:46.000
I liked that one.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.170
I kind of shocked myself
when that shit came out.

01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:49.110
I saw you getting it.

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.090
I saw you getting it.

01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:51.050
You didn't get that?

01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:53.090
What the fuck. Hugh?

01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:55.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.210
Lennox fucking Lewis.
champion forever.

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.000
Believe it.
