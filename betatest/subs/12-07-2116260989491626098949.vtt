3
00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.891
I've failed
a million times in my life.

4
00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:28.021
I've made a million and one
bad decisions at goruck.

5
00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.656
And if you don't take those failures
and learn something from them

6
00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.699
and apply them to your life...

7
00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.028
Then this was for nothing.

8
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.358
I want to meet the kind of
person that passes this event.

9
00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.819
I want to see that. feel it.
smell it.

10
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.623
look at the person in the eyes
when they pass...

11
00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:30.963
But more important than that
is that everyone who shows up...

12
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.338
I want them to learn something
that makes them a better person.

13
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.313
I was thinking of a
little small snapshot.

14
00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:00.697
You know. it'd be interesting to see that
'cause I've been working with video.

15
00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.369
Wrinkles. Wrinkles.
Got wrinkles already?

16
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.448
Got wrinkles all over the place.
everywhere.

17
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.812
I think the humidity will
take care of this. - Wrinkles.

18
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.997
I think the...
Once we step outside.

19
00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.079
Who's taking...

20
00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:14.085
What? Here. take this through...

21
00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:16.667
Joe. I want to purchase the 34.

22
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.881
All right. let's be...
I'm getting the work done.

23
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.590
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

24
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:27.803
Hey. this is a taste of
what an operator selection is.

25
00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:30.605
- It's compressed.
- It's compressed. condensed timeline

26
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:34.355
but the most poetic thing about this is
it's not that we get to scream and yell

27
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:37.938
and you get to see the dark side of us
as a cadre. not there to encourage you

28
00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:41.992
but we enjoy watching them ride this
mental rollercoaster. "il can't do this.

29
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.819
I got this. I got this.
Ll can't do this."

30
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.906
It's this wave that they ride
throughout the whole event

31
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.913
that's really... that's really the
awesome part from a cadre standpoint

32
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.289
to get to watch.

33
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:55.043
And then when they hit
that bottom

34
00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.944
that's when they are weak... - And
you watch them wrestle. Yeah.

35
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.629
Theyre at their weakest.

36
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.132
It's usually after you've given
them the stronger minds.

37
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.677
you've given them a little bit
of time to think.

38
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:09.512
you watch them start to descend
and then you just

39
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.724
pick up or prey upon their weakness
and then they're sitting by the fire.

40
00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.777
- Yeah.
- You know. Last year. you know. Alex...

41
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:21.402
Alex stavdal was there and five minutes
later he's like. "man. I'm fine.

42
00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.074
I don't know why I quit.”

43
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.948
He's coming back. He might pass.
We'll see. You know.

44
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.558
- Like watch him...
- There's no take-backs.

45
00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.324
- Yeah.
- Someone says. "I'm done. I quit.

46
00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.539
That's it. you know." that's it.
there're no take-backs.

47
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.088
And that's sort of the...

48
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:42.260
That's why we're happy
to have goruck selection exist.

49
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:46.056
not because we want to roll out here
and just yell and scream. right.

50
00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.179
I mean you can describe
someone's actions in you...

51
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.848
- Monster.
- There he comes. stealing the show again.

52
00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:57.935
You can describe someone's actions
in with as much color and detail

53
00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.941
as god gave you the gift
of saying it

54
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.866
however he did. right. you know.
death. destruction. carnage.

55
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.569
but the person is never that.
right.

56
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.827
These people show up for this. I don't
want to show up for this. Do you?

57
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.077
Do you? Nobody does.
Nobody wants to show.

58
00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:19.962
Blayne saw the poi. "He goes.
no. no thanks. I'm good.”

59
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.964
I mean. he looked at and he goes.
"nobody is going to pass this.

60
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.716
It's not humanly possible.”

61
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.672
And then he took a step back.
right.

62
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.475
he says. "of course.
someone's gonna pass it.

63
00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.052
Well. not. of course.
but probably.

64
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.138
And. of course.
it's humanly possible."

65
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.144
And so this question about who
is...

66
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.898
This question about who is physically
ready out of the people that show up.

67
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.605
this is a 48-hour
endurance event.

68
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.440
That's it. right. 48 hours.

69
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.244
So. my take is that
if you pass the pt test.

70
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.205
you are physically capable
of completing this event.

71
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.478
I agree. Period. The end.

72
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.486
We call it selection
really just to pay homage to our roots.

73
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.718
You know we're not trying to
replicate special forces selection

74
00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.137
but we are trying
to pay tribute to it.

75
00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:11.388
And so we want to give these people the
chance to get a taste of what that's like.

76
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.435
I trained really hard

77
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:19.643
but I didn't expect
the... the mental beat down.

78
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.022
I'd like to say
that I could pass selection

79
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.300
but I don't think I can look
all of you right in the eye

80
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:29.193
and say that for sure 'cause it
is a test like I've never seen.

81
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.075
So when we're talking about
condense and special ops selection

82
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:37.125
and how you look at the goruck
selection. all the components are there.

83
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:41.501
And how we line those up and play
those out becomes very interesting.

84
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.000
I'hink we're gonna make
it this year? Yes.

85
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.086
How? Okay. How many?

86
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.843
This is the math part. right.
So 75 sign up. 50 show up.

87
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.141
45 pass the pt test.

88
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:59.098
The welcome party claims
anywhere between 30 and 40

89
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:04.858
and then at the 24-hour Mark
you're somehow down to three Max.

90
00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.064
When it boils down to it.

91
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:11.242
selection is ultimately a 24-hour
endurance event with an extra 24 hours.

92
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.521
Head to the back. take
all instructions and follow on. cadre.

93
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.132
Go ahead and clear it.

94
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.379
Grab all your gear. head to the back. take
all instructions to follow on. cadre.

95
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.681
Hurry up. Move.

96
00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.224
Hurry up. Let's go.

97
00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.706
Take all food and water
out of your rucksack.

98
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.709
You'll hang it by the top with the
carrying handle when I tell you to do so.

99
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.940
Take two steps back.

100
00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.643
Turn now to right.

101
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.023
Strike one.

102
00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.315
Point zero. four-five.

103
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.486
Insufficient amount of weight.
Fix it.

104
00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.159
Take it off.

105
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.786
Class of 015.

106
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.995
Class of 015.
insufficient amount of weight.

107
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.172
One-five. take all
your gear and move to the back

108
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.796
and take on following
instructions to follow on. cadre.

109
00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:12.675
Alright. Any other medications?
Any injuries or illnesses?

110
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.202
And we tell you to take an ors packet
through... - Right and clear.

111
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.968
Move to the back. Take all
instructions to follow on. cadre.

112
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.273
Yes. Take it off.

113
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:37.412
In special forces.
we join that community

114
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.339
because I think a lot of us wanted to
be part of a high-performing team.

115
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:45.629
something elite. there's something
to more than it's just about us.

116
00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.548
In order to have high-performing
teams.

117
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.172
they have to be made up
of high-performing individuals

118
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.969
who are selfless
and committed to the cause.

119
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.812
The selection takes
you back to being an individual.

120
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.398
It makes you look deep
inside yourself.

121
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.449
That's what it boils down to.

122
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.445
You're trying to sort out those
people and determine

123
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.540
who has the gut to pull it out.

124
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:32.300
Everybody out there
says it's a bridge too far.

125
00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:35.003
If you never served.
you can never understand it.

126
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.389
That's a coward's approach.

127
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:43.471
People need to say this is how
you can better understand it.

128
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.941
You have 15 seconds. pack it up.

129
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.319
Hurry up.

130
00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.274
Pick it up and dump it out.

131
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.406
Too slow packing up again.

132
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.489
Pack it up! Too slow!
Pack it up! Too slow!

133
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:07.915
I mean. my mom cried
right in front of me

134
00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:10.042
when I told her
that I was enlisting.

135
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.839
that I'd already enlisted.
in fact.

136
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.885
And she's crying
in our kitchen. saying no.

137
00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:21.934
She didn't understand
anything about the army.

138
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.434
And... and yet. you know.
because I took a step forward

139
00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:31.439
and said. I'm gonna do this. you know.
she became knowledgeable about service

140
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.941
more so than she was before.

141
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.193
And so there's a lot
of Americans out there

142
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:41.449
who want a little slice of knowledge
about what it means and what it takes.

143
00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:46.496
What kind of a human does this
to themselves?

144
00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.922
Five-one. everyone knows that
number now.

145
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.921
Five-0one.

146
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.549
We'll hear that number
until we don't.

147
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.760
That's how this works.

148
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:05.890
The numbers we know are the numbers
that go away. the fastest.

149
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.557
You just sort of say
this isn't for me.

150
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.855
Five-0one...

151
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.900
Missing hats.

152
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.947
Plastic bags. Who's this for?

153
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.708
Whose bags are these?

154
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.454
Here 5053.

155
00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:40.588
Who brought clearly
identifiable great value

156
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.047
plastic bags here?

157
00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:47.973
Get up here five-two.

158
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.267
Why weren't you sure?

159
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.148
I don't know. cadre.
It took a second.

160
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.402
Was it because
they were great value bags

161
00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:01.779
that are gonna fucking break and fall
apart in two fucking seconds anyway?

162
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.237
Shitty fucking value.

163
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.697
Poor decision.

164
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.618
- Stuff them in your ruck.
- Roger.

165
00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:12.828
Hurry up.

166
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:17.131
You know. they start off administrative...
Administrative stressful. right?

167
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.881
Pack your ruck. unpack your ruck.
pack. unpack it again. pack it.

168
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:24.009
And just watching
people sweating.

169
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.467
drenched in sweat just packing
and unpacking their ruck.

170
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.553
you know. it's like
basic training day one. right.

171
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.933
where the people
are just yelling into the face.

172
00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.345
It's done for a purpose. It's done to create
stress and to see what you're gonna do.

173
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.655
You go get that boot.

174
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.543
Get in there. hurry
up one-five. get in there.

175
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.202
Hurry up. one-five. Hurry up.

176
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.158
Hurry up one-five.

177
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.868
Get your. let's go.

178
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.203
- Get it. get it. get it.
- Let's go. one-five. Hurry up.

179
00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.339
One-five. stop real quick.
Stop. Stop.

180
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.797
Look behind you.

181
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.216
Yes. cadre.

182
00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.552
What do you see?

183
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.056
A lot of folks that are done
and I'm not.

184
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.354
Go ahead.

185
00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.420
There are times throughout
selection or any selection.

186
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.685
it's the same in the military.

187
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.425
where there's a very clear and defined
standard like. let's say the pt test.

188
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.064
We're looking
for perfect pushups.

189
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.990
We're looking
for perfect sit-ups.

190
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.615
It's completely objective and
we should expect that of them

191
00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:30.226
because they're coming in fresh.
they had plenty of time to prepare

192
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.491
and those standards are well
published ahead of time.

193
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.956
You understand
that as a candidate

194
00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:40.290
going through that you have
to do 50 pushups.

195
00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:43.343
do 55. do 60.

196
00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:47.889
That's where you're trying to find that
person who has gotten rid of their ego.

197
00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:53.937
they're... they're in the zone and
they understand that it's more about

198
00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.441
an awareness and an
understanding of standards

199
00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.315
and then take those standards
to the next level

200
00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.648
because that's the guy you want
to your right and your left

201
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.949
when you're in a situation
and you need help.

202
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.548
Fall in on your gear.
priorities of work.

203
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.007
Fall in on your gear.
priorities of work.

204
00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:35.391
All the army physical fitness
test is just a baseline standard

205
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:39.190
for us to be able to. um.
judge the participants

206
00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:41.518
on whether or not
they're physically ready.

207
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:45.730
They have to pass the pi test in order
for the event to actually begin.

208
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.067
The standards are very simple. You
have to do 55 pushups in 2 minutes.

209
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:53.030
65 sit-ups in 2 minutes and you have
to run 5 miles in 40 minutes or less.

210
00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.206
What follows is a 12-mile ruck.

211
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:57.653
That 12-mile ruck they have to
do in three and a half hours.

212
00:13:57.712 --> 00:14:03.503
That will be the end of the physical
testing portion of goruck selection.

213
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:09.797
This is the only known that these participants
have about the event before they come.

214
00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:13.099
S50. their level of preparation

215
00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.303
really shows during the pt test.

216
00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:21.312
And it doesn't matter if they have
54 pushups. that's the standard.

217
00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:26.112
We had a number of people actually have
54 pushups and they went home. So...

218
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:31.276
That's all it really is. is just a standard for
us to make sure that they're ready for it.

219
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.858
Yeah. you're
asking the wrong guy for that

220
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.002
because none of us. obviously. showed up
to special forces assessment selection

221
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.426
or Navy seal bud/s
or anything like that

222
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.617
physically unprepared or else we wouldn't
be standing in front of you right now.

223
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.787
So I don't know what's in the head of those
people who don't come physically prepared.

224
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.517
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

225
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.261
Our community.
the special forces community.

226
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.460
when they look at goruck. when they look at us
and when they look at this particular event.

227
00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:46.146
we want them to feel good
about it. to be proud of it

228
00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.603
and to feel that we're
representing the community

229
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.485
and we're representing special
forces as well.

230
00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:05.538
We've put ourselves in a bit of a tough
spot because we can't half-ass it.

231
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.498
We can't fail to meet high standards
if we're gonna call it selection

232
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:12.802
but we're okay with that because we're
also committed to doing right by it.

233
00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.724
I don't really like
goruck selection

234
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:23.763
but it's also the only event
we have

235
00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:27.146
where I consistently tear up
at the end.

236
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.477
To watch the human spirit

237
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:33.155
go on this amazing journey

238
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:39.238
of successes and failures
and ultimately. triumph

239
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.447
is...

240
00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:46.453
A certain way to conjure up
those memories

241
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:50.256
of what the special forces assessment
and selection course was for me.

242
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:59.967
I know all the steps. I know
all the things you have to do.

243
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:04.976
not to gut it out but six
months ago. a year ago.

244
00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:11.194
the commitment. the sacrifice. the dedication
that you had to make as an individual.

245
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.896
To put yourself in that moment.

246
00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:19.361
that specific moment where
you're at your absolute lowest.

247
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:24.783
you're digging really deeply
to figure out what's my why?

248
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:35.092
Why are you still here filling water up?
Hurry up.

249
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.717
Fill up water. fast.
Move out. fast.

250
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.970
Pack your shit up. fast.

251
00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:53.152
Grab your fucking shit and go.

252
00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.734
Whose shit is this?

253
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.946
Pick it up.

254
00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.875
Hey. move out. - Zero-four-six.
get the fuck out of here. Move.

255
00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:11.079
Double-time. go. Go.

256
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.946
Come on three-five.

257
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.962
We are one minute
into the welcome party.

258
00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.298
Only about 40 hours
of goruck selection remain.

259
00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:24.975
And. uh. it looks really
painful already.

260
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:28.646
You had. You don't have it.
You don't have it in you.

261
00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.085
You have quitter
all over your face.

262
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.963
Why are you wasting your time? Why are
you wasting our cadre time? Let's go.

263
00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.477
Squat.

264
00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.733
Just take a step out.

265
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:39.031
Not with your ruck
in the water. you.

266
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.568
Lunge towards the shore.

267
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.541
Hey. we didn't say just drop
and fall. We said lunge.

268
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.586
You got four-six? Let's go.

269
00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:59.510
We want you to lunge your way
to the back...

270
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:04.136
- Get back. Get back over here.
- Get your damn ruck up!

271
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.138
Move!

272
00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.097
Okay.

273
00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:14.100
Nine. eight. seven. six. five. four.
three. two. two. one. get up!

274
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:18.195
Get down! Get down!
Crawl on your belly.

275
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.907
Your legs don't work.
you can crawl.

276
00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.485
When I signed in.
everybody gave me a med sheet

277
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.060
and if you look at the bottom of the med sheet. it
says. "what is your stress level at right now?"

278
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.791
And everybody was either
moderate or severe.

279
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.536
And we hadn't even started yet.

280
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.622
So with us just ensuing
a little bit of chaos.

281
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.048
just prodding and poking
a little bit.

282
00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:41.047
we're building... we're kicking
that little internal gremlin

283
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.754
that's inside of them
and just letting them spin wild.

284
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.932
All right.
Go over to that truck.

285
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.268
Get your ruck off.
Cadre one-two. is he done?

286
00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:59.775
- One-two is out.
- Zero-one-two.

287
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.947
Up!

288
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.970
Three of your buddies realized that
they're not gonna make it all night

289
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.110
and stop the pain
while they could.

290
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.744
We're already down four
from like 30 minutes ago.

291
00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.146
Not only do you have to
be able to do the shift physically.

292
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.879
you gotta be able to master the chaos
as well and endure the unknown.

293
00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:20.299
We get to see them at their weakest
and at their strongest points

294
00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:22.923
and it's a roller coaster all
night just watching these guys

295
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.299
up and down. up and down.
fight that demon.

296
00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:29.179
They kick one demon in the face. another
one pops up and it's all night.

297
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.802
The physical is just
the physical.

298
00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:35.105
You'll see 90 percent of these guys
are in their heads most of the night.

299
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.473
If you get up close and look
in their eyes. you'll see it.

300
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:42.230
This is the performance
you've got and it's not good enough.

301
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.158
You're not meeting the standard.
You're dead last at everything.

302
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.408
You're not moving.
And it is only a matter of time.

303
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.770
The welcome party. you know.
it's the first day of basic training

304
00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:56.035
where the people
are just on you.

305
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.463
You think you're trying your hardest.
Cadre know you're not.

306
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.882
They're pushing you further.
they're yelling at you.

307
00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:07.714
there's mass confusion. it's dark and
you've got mud in the crack of your ass.

308
00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:09.639
It's just bad.

309
00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:13.094
Trample the weak.
hurdle the dead. Let's go.

310
00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.145
Dominate the man
in front of you.

311
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.941
Relax. Relax.

312
00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.839
Rucksacks on your back.
Rucksacks on your back.

313
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.400
- Rucksacks on your back.
- On your back!

314
00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:27.450
But. yet. you're still looking around.
you still have a place to find comfort

315
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:30.824
pecause that candidate over there
is getting a lot of attention.

316
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:36.160
Win or quit? Take your pick.

317
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.164
Either dig deep or stand up.

318
00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.496
That's your two options
right now.

319
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.673
Let's just stand up. come on.
Let's go.

320
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.363
I'll get your ruck for you. let's
go to the truck. Come on. let's go.

321
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:48.675
I'll get your ruck for you.
let's go to the truck. Come on.

322
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.222
- You're done. right?
- Not yet.

323
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.346
You're done?
Then start fucking performing.

324
00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.304
Start winning.

325
00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.725
Does this feel like winning
to you?

326
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:05.734
Who do you usually play against
where this feels like winning?

327
00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:09.283
Don't disrespect everyone
else that's here working.

328
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.452
Don't disrespect
what this is about

329
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.379
because you want to lay in the mud and
pretend like you're not quitting.

330
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:17.453
You're either quitting
or you're working. That's it.

331
00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:20.628
Just drop the log if you're done. man.
It's not that big of a deal.

332
00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:21.999
Just drop it.

333
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.624
It's one thing
if your mind's telling you yes

334
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:28.198
but your body's telling you something totally
different. you better listen to your body.

335
00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:31.201
What's interesting is that some of these
folks. some of them have nothing in the tank

336
00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:34.467
until they are right at the brink and
then suddenly they've got a reserve

337
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:38.931
but we want them to perform the
standard as prescribed all the time.

338
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:42.312
and not just kind of fake the funk and
see if they can sneak their way through

339
00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:44.189
pecause that is not
what this is about.

340
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.612
Give me this hand. Move it over the log.
Hold it there.

341
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.690
What the fuck is wrong with you?

342
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:51.025
This event is about
fucking winning.

343
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.829
Right now. you're getting special
attention because you are fucking losing.

344
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:58.328
You are failing to meet the standard.
That is losing.

345
00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.751
He's quitting. man.
He's quitting.

346
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:02.794
He is quitting.
Three-two is quitting.

347
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.760
Mount it. I don't give two
shits about your cramps. Hurry up.

348
00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:17.352
When you see somebody put every ounce of themself
into it and it's just not gonna be enough

349
00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:21.939
and when you see that realization wash
over their face. it's tough to watch.

350
00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:26.486
Like all you want to do is support them. but
you've got to support the standard as well.

351
00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:30.360
40 more hours
of two standard training.

352
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.191
That's the clock that ticks.

353
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:39.078
Grab the log with your hands
flipping it over there.

354
00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.258
Straight over.

355
00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.678
None of that sideways bullshit
like the last one.

356
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.130
End over end.

357
00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:02.763
Hurry up. this is real.

358
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.646
Aw. fuck.

359
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.326
Look at me.

360
00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:18.623
Look at me.

361
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.624
Open your eyes.

362
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.870
That's the third time
you've fallen.

363
00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:30.916
You're at risk of safety
to yourself and to others.

364
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.304
You're two performance failures
away from being out of here.

365
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:38.286
And before you hurt yourself or anybody
else. I'm gonna let them drop you.

366
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:42.053
Do you understand?

367
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.432
Take your ruck off.

368
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.650
Roll it. roll it.

369
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.084
Rob. are you okay. man?

370
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:08.332
My body broke down.

371
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.922
I let you go as long as I could.
man.

372
00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:14.085
I know you were trying.
all right.

373
00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.794
No shame in that. all right?

374
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:18.096
I don't want you to hurt
yourself or anybody else.

375
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:19.889
Hey. Rob.

376
00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:21.788
Let's get you on your feet.
brother. Awesome job. man.

377
00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:23.222
You got some fire in there.
Come on.

378
00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:24.499
You guys are no fucking
joke. man.

379
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.963
Come on. brother. let's go. Let's
get you up. Come on. Get up.

380
00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:31.352
- Can I go in there?
- Yeah. you can go.

381
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:34.814
It's not rhetorical. I'm
asking. keep moving.

382
00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:37.024
How come everybody else can do
it but you can't?

383
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.407
Three-two.

384
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:42.658
You know that number.
=yeah. I should.

385
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.787
Why should you... - How come
everybody can do this but you can't?

386
00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:47.789
You shouldn't even
have that patch.

387
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.496
Three-two. six-four.
we know these numbers.

388
00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:57.795
Can you hear me?

389
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.428
All right. why can't you do this
but everybody else can?

390
00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:04.677
Huh?

391
00:26:04.772 --> 00:26:07.809
What do you mean you don't know?
That's not an answer.

392
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.106
I want a real answer.

393
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.226
Why can't you do this
but everybody else can?

394
00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:15.316
Keep going.

395
00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:20.276
Why can't you do this
but everybody else can?

396
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.750
On your feet. on your feet. On your
feet. on your feet. Stand up. Stand up.

397
00:26:25.793 --> 00:26:28.660
Come on. come on. just stand up.
Stand up. stand up.

398
00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:31.461
Okay. give me your hand.

399
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:33.902
No. no. put on the ground. put on
the ground. Hey. what's your name?

400
00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:35.882
Lance. Hey.

401
00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.675
=hi. - Garrett.

402
00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:40.379
Hey. seriously... =no...

403
00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:41.805
No qualms. man.

404
00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:48.933
Wow.

405
00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:51.686
Hey. you're a strong motherfucker.
all right? You're strong.

406
00:26:51.777 --> 00:26:54.769
- Hey. there's no... this is all just...
- No. next year. Next year.

407
00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:58.071
All right. Go home. rebuild. no
failure. you're only learning.

408
00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:01.241
Well. your body just gave up
a little bit on you. you know.

409
00:27:03.997 --> 00:27:06.454
Don't... you better hold
your head high. all right?

410
00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:08.703
Absolutely. -
Nice to meet you. bro.

411
00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:10.876
Get up there.

412
00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:23.801
All right. go faster. faster.

413
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:29.897
Get up!

414
00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:34.307
Sprint! Let's go!

415
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.321
Guess what I want you to do?

416
00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:41.273
I want you to put your rucksack
on your back.

417
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:52.243
I tell you to move out.
you're gonna sprint.

418
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:56.376
I tell you to stop. you're
gonna drop and do a pushup.

419
00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:57.902
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

420
00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.041
Go.

421
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.045
Down.

422
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.425
Up. Sprint.

423
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.561
Down.

424
00:28:19.823 --> 00:28:21.108
Up.

425
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.280
Sprint.

426
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:30.914
Down.

427
00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:45.382
Shoulder to shoulder.

428
00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:51.518
Stop losing your life-saving equipment
called your shoes. two-eight.

429
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:53.937
Shoulder to shoulder.

430
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.941
Friday morning. we got sunrise.
we got four left

431
00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:08.948
and the sun's usually a big. big
boost to morale.

432
00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:12.156
Um. that's gonna be somewhat
counterbalanced here

433
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:15.038
by the fact they're getting ready
to have cadre shift change.

434
00:29:15.128 --> 00:29:17.710
And that's not gonna
go well for them. Um...

435
00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:19.817
Those of you who've been
through some of these courses

436
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:22.423
in the military know how this
works. Um...

437
00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:26.010
You've some low moments.
3.4 in the morning

438
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:29.306
when it's really darkest and.
uh.

439
00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:33.853
once that sun starts to come up. we start to
see. you know. we call solar-powered rangers.

440
00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:36.918
They'll feed off that.
And that'll be good for them.

441
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:40.651
But cadre shift change
is never good.

442
00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.819
Pays to be a fucking winner.

443
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:44.771
- Understood?
- Yes. cadre. -Yes. cadre.

444
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.367
Down and back. go.

445
00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:57.075
Not on your knees.

446
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.504
Just came on shift around 7 o'clock.
Uh. we had four.

447
00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:04.378
We had a competition to see
who could finish first.

448
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:09.259
We got four sandbags. three of them
are 80 pounds. one of them 60 pounds.

449
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:12.466
We did a duck walk competition
to see who could get in first.

450
00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:14.472
That person will get
the 60-pound sandbag.

451
00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:18.680
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself and get down.

452
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:22.108
Next time you stand up. you stand up
and hand me your patch and walk off.

453
00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:24.902
Do the exercises we told you to.
Get down.

454
00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:30.029
Once we start the next event. you're
gonna wish you were duck walking.

455
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.598
We made it about halfway
through the duck walk competition

456
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:36.956
and zero-six-zero stood up and
gave us his voluntary withdrawal.

457
00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:38.204
Six-zero is out.

458
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:39.751
So we're down to three.

459
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.278
And. uh. it gets us in this case
it didn't pay to be a winner.

460
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:44.878
everybody's got an 80-pound
sandbag we're filling right now.

461
00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:58.808
Resistance is futile.

462
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:02.712
Don't try with the passive resistance.
We've all seen that trick.

463
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.351
We all know how it works.

464
00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:12.241
Let's go!

465
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.376
Look at that machine.

466
00:31:30.597 --> 00:31:33.179
We're playing a little
bit of mind games with them.

467
00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:37.475
They think that this is about distance down
and back. but this evolution is about time.

468
00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:51.823
Clock's not going to save you.
six-eight.

469
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:55.656
You're married to that sandbag until
you can complete the standard.

470
00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:00.658
Move the sandbag.

471
00:32:02.212 --> 00:32:05.079
And since the candidates
didn't evenly fill their bags.

472
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:07.004
we're gonna evenly distribute
the load.

473
00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:09.583
So you'll see us rotate after
a certain distance is met

474
00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:13.170
or a certain time has passed.
one of each candidate rotate.

475
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.510
And he was just chucking
the shit out of it.

476
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.418
Now you could turn around and watch him struggle
with this next stride he is about to do

477
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:25.979
and you'll see that not all
the sandbags are equal.

478
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:28.606
So we're trying to equal
the pain train across the board.

479
00:32:35.078 --> 00:32:37.660
I mean. I know an sf
selection in a 48-hour period.

480
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:40.363
1 got to eat
probably five to six times

481
00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:43.917
and I got maybe two hours
of sleep a day or three or four.

482
00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:48.122
What this is. is...

483
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:52.459
I mean. it's almost like the
never-ending firefight.

484
00:32:53.597 --> 00:32:56.088
You can't sleep. you can't eat.

485
00:32:56.183 --> 00:33:00.222
Just when you think it got to
its worst point. it gets worse.

486
00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:08.062
This isn't break time.
six-eight.

487
00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:17.026
Not like a outside the military kind
of endurance athlete kind of guy

488
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.365
but I can't think of anything
that has this much time.

489
00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:28.079
and this much physical.
um. mental stress.

490
00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:30.380
I can't think of anything
to tell you the truth.

491
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:39.136
Eight. seven. six. five. four.

492
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:42.844
three. two. one.
performance failure.

493
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:48.641
1 got 99 problems
and you being smoked ain't one.

494
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:51.693
Get on the fucking sandbag
do the standard.

495
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.697
Fucking execute it.

496
00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:00.235
- Is that it?
- I can't pick it up.

497
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.786
You re out. I'm out.

498
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:04.740
This isn't sign-ons.

499
00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:15.633
Trainer. you out?

500
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.210
Oh. man.

501
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:18.511
I can't pick it up.

502
00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:23.304
I know.

503
00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:27.559
This is my second attempt
and I've done other events

504
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:30.641
but selection. to go full out.

505
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:33.939
god bless these guys.

506
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.272
I mean. mentally. yeah.
but I'm just completely smoked

507
00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:40.450
where I couldn't move
the sandbag anymore.

508
00:34:40.537 --> 00:34:42.493
S50. whatever the next evolution
is.

509
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:47.491
seeing how there'll probably be another
one before the. uh. 24-hour Mark.

510
00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:52.336
even if I made it through this.
I don't know.

511
00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:56.708
I mean. once you pass the welcome
party. you just keep moving.

512
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.134
I can't move anymore.

513
00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:02.718
And now there were two.

514
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:08.406
Pick it up. Move it.
Move the weight.

515
00:35:12.027 --> 00:35:15.690
First one back to start point
gets a big old fat break.

516
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.145
Pays to be a winner.

517
00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:21.220
As I finished the tough
one. I was like. what's the next challenge?

518
00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:23.306
Then it was the spartan race. And
then. what's the next challenge?

519
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.743
Then I read about the
goruck challenge

520
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:29.666
as it was
called back then back in 2013.

521
00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:34.668
And I did my first one
in San Diego. July. class 690.

522
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:40.260
It was an amazing life-changing experience
and I got hooked on it ever since.

523
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.686
I said face him. two-eight.

524
00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:53.607
This isn't do whatever
the fuck you want. Face him.

525
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.308
Look him in the eye.

526
00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:56.813
Only one of you
is gonna be here.

527
00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:05.944
Selection is an anti-goruck
event

528
00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:09.577
because goruck is supposed to be
team building

529
00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:13.126
and selection is a different
beast.

530
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:14.899
- He's right. you're wrong.
- 90.

531
00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:17.084
.- Up.

532
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:24.325
Just lock them out.

533
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.964
- Up!
- Ninety.

534
00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:29.222
Oh wait. see. he's not wrong.
You're wrong again.

535
00:36:29.312 --> 00:36:32.224
Can't do it.
Can't even lock your arms out.

536
00:36:32.315 --> 00:36:34.475
So much for how far you
can push your body. three-five.

537
00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:36.562
So much for how perfect you are.
three-five.

538
00:36:36.653 --> 00:36:38.773
You know. you have to make
some sort of plan to start.

539
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:42.071
so it's like. okay. make it to the
first sunrise at Friday. right.

540
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:45.491
and then there's so few people
like you can manage it from there.

541
00:36:52.669 --> 00:36:56.412
I said. well. here it is sunlight.
right. and I was happy in my head

542
00:36:56.506 --> 00:37:00.749
but at the same time it was like.
uh-oh. this is as far as I planned.

543
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:10.050
Mark klemm was just
physically dominating.

544
00:37:10.145 --> 00:37:13.512
He picked the perfect point
to take off.

545
00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:16.043
What's the probability you
think that you finish goruck selection?

546
00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.147
A 100%.

547
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:20.480
I finished selection
the day I signed up for it.

548
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:24.051
You're that cocky about this.

549
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.157
I'm not. I trained my balls off.

550
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:31.530
Not cocky at all.

551
00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:35.041
It was very much like dominating.
It pays to be a winner.

552
00:37:35.128 --> 00:37:36.959
They say that over and over

553
00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:40.038
and it sounds maybe silly
but it pays to be a winner.

554
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:47.887
Just my own doubts combined
with the cadre there.

555
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:51.432
I mean they're amazing at fishing and they
dig and dig until they find the right spot

556
00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:53.601
and then. right.
they just harp on that.

557
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:56.350
It's just like. okay. I'm not
gonna make it. right. that's it.

558
00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:00.354
Garrett picked me up.

559
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.965
Jason took my ruck and it's just
like. man. that was a terrible idea.

560
00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:05.822
You come out of that fog and
immediately know you made a mistake.

561
00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:11.154
had plenty more energy and it was just a...
It was just a bad choice in that moment.

562
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.081
Put your rucksack on your back.

563
00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:18.049
- Put it on your back now! Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

564
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:21.417
What are you doing?
Put your rucksack on your back.

565
00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:23.123
Turn around three-five.

566
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:36.682
The sandbag toss.
Proceed towards the water. Go.

567
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:43.005
Viking loves this one.
Look at that one.

568
00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:44.949
Look at that fucking...
He's a warrior right now.

569
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:49.066
That's it. I'll just Chuck it.

570
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.240
You think
you're gonna pass this event?

571
00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.700
There's a good chance

572
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.951
but...

573
00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.669
It all depends on what happens
in the next 24 hours

574
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:03.167
because I know
it's gonna get hard.

575
00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:05.528
He is fucking eating your... he
is eating your manna and getting stronger.

576
00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:07.838
The shark smells
your blood in the water.

577
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:10.157
He is getting fucking stronger
by the second. - Right shoulder.

578
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:13.661
Yeah. of course. it's gonna depend on
what happens in the next 24 hours...

579
00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:19.730
But what's gonna go on inside your
head when it gets a lot worse?

580
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:21.022
Uh...

581
00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:24.733
I'm not sure.

582
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:26.607
It's a... there's a...

583
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.069
A lot of pain...

584
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.275
But. uh...

585
00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.612
I just need to push forward.

586
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.480
Man. he's already into the next evolution.
you haven't even got to the water yet.

587
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:54.465
Six-two is a fucking warrior and you're sitting
here sipping water like a fucking Sally.

588
00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:14.237
I let's go. iwo-eight.

589
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.682
It's very apparent who was
bearing their burden of the weight.

590
00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:19.072
Very apparent now.
Just had to divvy things up.

591
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.964
It's only 40 pounds. we've been
pretty fucking generous. I think.

592
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:29.166
Right shoulder.

593
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:32.759
Pretty fair. guys.

594
00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:35.839
Let you take a fucking break when
you met the standard earlier.

595
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:37.140
Pays to be a winner.

596
00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:40.309
Pays to meet the standard.

597
00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:47.518
Six-two's doing really well. we're
not focused on him at all right now.

598
00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:51.150
We're basically saying. "hey. you're doing
really well." we'll build his ego up.

599
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.950
you know. because we're looking to create
a distance between two-eight and six-two.

600
00:40:56.037 --> 00:40:58.244
that's the... that's the
methodology.

601
00:40:58.331 --> 00:41:00.697
So the creation of distance.

602
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:05.081
it's the same reason why a lion picks on
the slow zebra. why pick on the fast one.

603
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.332
The fast one will become slow
eventually.

604
00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:09.584
And so. right now six-two
is crushing it.

605
00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:14.215
We'll just shatter him with praise
because we want. praise of sorts

606
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:19.425
because we want that
to get into two-eight's head.

607
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:21.055
It's pretty much that simple.

608
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.397
Why is this so much easier
for him than for you?

609
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:28.837
He must've prepared it.

610
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:30.476
Did he train harder?

611
00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:33.859
Did he do better
or he's just tougher?

612
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.053
It's 'cause he's a
winner and he had 420 calories.

613
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:38.113
Or is it because
he's a fucking winner?

614
00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:45.659
So let's talk about your
evolution from last year to this year.

615
00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:51.673
Are you in a much different
space? What happened?

616
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:56.378
Uh. it was just total failure. so I just... there
was no way I was gonna let that happen again.

617
00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:59.305
So. uh. I pushed out
over the past year.

618
00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:01.599
Uh. I started training
even earlier.

619
00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:05.770
I got strong over the winter then tried
to lean out a bit to get faster.

620
00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:10.317
I went even further with
the same thing I did last year

621
00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:12.314
but started even further back

622
00:42:12.405 --> 00:42:17.365
with. uh. no coffee. no caffeine.
no booze. no happiness.

623
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:24.080
Six-two. go sit. go.
go sit down and drink water.

624
00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:25.907
Rucksack down.

625
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:28.872
Rucksack up.

626
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:34.499
Rucksack up all the way.

627
00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:38.169
Pays to be a winner. iwo-eight.

628
00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:42.974
I'd work out
12... 12 to 13 times a week.

629
00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:48.897
1 carry a 60-pound ruck. uh. I work in the
city and I go client to client to client.

630
00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:51.941
So I carry a 60-pound
ruck every day.

631
00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:54.144
Uh. it's...

632
00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:58.151
It... it adds up just... just going
to the subway. going to work.

633
00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.824
coming back from the subway.
coming back from work.

634
00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:04.370
uh. I usually put in
about 2.8 miles just there.

635
00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:06.118
uh. and that's not if I.

636
00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:10.522
you know. travel around to a bunch of client
sites throughout the day that mileage goes up.

637
00:43:10.546 --> 00:43:13.906
Look what it looks like. stand up.
two-eight. look what it looks like to win.

638
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:17.254
That's what it looks like. That's
what the standard looks like.

639
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:19.757
That's what happens
when you meet the standard.

640
00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:23.214
This is what happens when you don't.
Rucksack above your head.

641
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:27.473
What's the probability that
you pass goruck selection this year?

642
00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:28.769
100%.

643
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:41.858
In three words or less. what's
going on in your mind right now?

644
00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:58.943
Now. we're gonna ask that same question
to two-eight. We're gonna see what he says.

645
00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:03.254
Everybody has a physical point
where they're gonna just fall out

646
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:06.091
but it's well past what your
mind thinks you can do.

647
00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:08.722
as long as you let your mind
believe you can do more.

648
00:44:11.524 --> 00:44:13.560
Where you at. two-eight.
let's go!

649
00:44:17.947 --> 00:44:20.984
Right now. at this point.
we're just keeping them moving

650
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:26.035
because what we know is coming up in the next
hour after this is gonna be extremely physical.

651
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:29.330
So right now we're just keeping
them engaged without smoking them.

652
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.659
They still got a very wet full
rucksack on their back.

653
00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:36.037
Theyre. un...

654
00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:41.798
Let's see. two. three. they are
22 hours. 21 hours into this.

655
00:44:41.888 --> 00:44:43.219
21 and a half.

656
00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:45.845
So...

657
00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:49.384
Going without sleep
for 24 hours.

658
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:52.561
because I'm sure they were up for a
few hours before this thing started

659
00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:55.856
and no food.
nothing's easy at this point.

660
00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:03.940
Are you gonna fall down?

661
00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:09.738
In three words or less. tell me what's
going through your head right now?

662
00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.368
"I'm depleted. cadre.”
that's three words. good.

663
00:45:17.173 --> 00:45:19.129
Go to your happy place there.
gilmore.

664
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:26.338
All right. Jason. we got an update
on state of affairs for you.

665
00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:27.638
Good.

666
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.204
So as they were
coming back and forth.

667
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:34.437
we asked six-two in three words
or less

668
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:38.107
what's going through your mind
right now and he said. "winning."

669
00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.216
And when the two-eight got down here.
I asked him the same question.

670
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.858
and he said.
"I am depleted. cadre."

671
00:45:45.952 --> 00:45:48.659
What? He said that?
=that's what he said.

672
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.851
So you're gonna be... you're
gonna be at one here real soon.

673
00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:54.706
Yeah.

674
00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:58.874
I mean. his only hope is that
he gets to the 24-hour Mark.

675
00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:00.546
that's his only hope.

676
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:02.043
What happens in 24 hours?

677
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:04.591
They get a break.
they get a food item.

678
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:09.719
get a maybe 45 minutes to sit down
and refit their... their stuff.

679
00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:12.095
Yeah. Priorities...
Priorities of work.

680
00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:15.474
That can go... hat break can go
one of two ways though.

681
00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:17.100
Yeah.

682
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:19.182
You know. nobody wants
to restart the cold engine.

683
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:21.855
You know.
nobody wants to do that.

684
00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:23.811
Especially. when the engine
is switching off.

685
00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:24.691
Yeah.

686
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:28.366
Two-eight's got his head down every time it
comes around that corner. He just got lapped.

687
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.660
Did he? - The only thing
he could tell me was he was depleted.

688
00:46:33.708 --> 00:46:34.993
Yeah. that's bad.

689
00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:38.117
Did you lap him. six-two?

690
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:39.748
Yes. cadre.

691
00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.750
You fucking lapped him.
look at you.

692
00:46:42.717 --> 00:46:45.834
Ahem. What's your warrior animal.
what's your warrior spirit?

693
00:46:47.513 --> 00:46:49.553
If you had to pick one
right now. tell me. hurry up.

694
00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:54.388
Then fucking go breathe fire
all over him and destroy him.

695
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.891
You got lapped. sucker.

696
00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.435
You got lapped.

697
00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:13.365
Turn around. go get a brick.
come back.

698
00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:14.662
Yes. cadre.

699
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.914
Make it so. Hurry up.

700
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:26.256
Six-two. do you care about anything
we throw at you at this point?

701
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.678
1 didn't think so.

702
00:47:38.314 --> 00:47:43.104
I mean. they're in terms of their
training. in terms of their preparation.

703
00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:47.483
in terms of all the stuff they've done and
prepared for this. they're identical.

704
00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:53.159
their bodies could be performing at the
same level right now. it's just...

705
00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:57.201
The mind controls the body.

706
00:47:57.291 --> 00:48:00.771
We try to tell them otherwise. we do tell them
otherwise but the mind controls the body.

707
00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:02.664
Two-eight looks terrible.

708
00:48:07.426 --> 00:48:08.866
Get the brick and keep moving.

709
00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:14.047
Two-eight. in three words or
less. how you feeling right now?

710
00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.049
Not very good.

711
00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:26.358
He knows what the definition
of winning is. he knows how to count.

712
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.561
one. two. three. three words
or less he says...

713
00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:30.817
Can be creative
in the middle of all this.

714
00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:32.739
Yeah. Not very good he says.

715
00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:34.818
- It's a terrible answer.
- Yeah.

716
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:39.406
But it meets the... the mathematical
requirements. you know.

717
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.206
The answer meets
the look on his face.

718
00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.592
Keep moving. iwo-eight.

719
00:49:06.986 --> 00:49:09.728
You can do whatever you want
when you're not in front of me.

720
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:15.950
Hint.
Here he comes. The machine.

721
00:49:19.915 --> 00:49:20.915
Drink water.

722
00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:25.106
What's motivating you right now?

723
00:49:26.005 --> 00:49:27.005
Winning.

724
00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:29.706
What do you want to win?

725
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.000
Zero-two-eight. in three words
or less. how are you feeling?

726
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:46.063
Is this ever gonna change.
do you think? Stop.

727
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.983
Is this gonna change? Or are you gonna
always feel sorry for yourself?

728
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.233
Is that your motivation
right now?

729
00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:03.114
So you failed to properly train
without...

730
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:09.579
You failed to properly train for 24
hours without consuming calories.

731
00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.130
Your body doesn't recognize
what this feels like

732
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:15.460
and so it's starting to eat itself
away and it's starting to crash.

733
00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:19.763
I mean. we still have hours
and hours and hours to go

734
00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.806
until your 24-hour Mark.

735
00:50:21.894 --> 00:50:24.351
You've been given
every opportunity to win.

736
00:50:26.732 --> 00:50:29.565
Six-two's gotten plenty of food
because he's been winning.

737
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:36.196
Do you have...
Do you have what it takes?

738
00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:41.068
But you don't?

739
00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:46.206
Every time I see
your shoulders roll forward

740
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:50.582
and this weakness inside of you. I
want to smoke you till you quit.

741
00:50:52.258 --> 00:50:55.591
That's... that's the kind of...
That's what you are doing to us.

742
00:50:55.678 --> 00:51:00.638
So you need to fix yourself. you need
to stop worrying about. I need food.

743
00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.589
Bullshit you need food.

744
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.393
Bullshit.

745
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.439
Pick it up. start fucking winning or
quit. that's what kind of event this is.

746
00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:14.815
You're... youre kissing your
cousin right now. Win or quit.

747
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:19.573
Meet the standard or quit.
that's the deal.

748
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:22.526
- Is that clear?
- Yes. cadre.

749
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:24.486
Do you want to quit
at this time?

750
00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:26.493
I do not. cadre.

751
00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:29.200
Then continue and start to win.

752
00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.514
He needs a victory.
That's what he needs.

753
00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:50.848
The problem is that there's nobody to motivate
him to win right now except for himself.

754
00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:54.149
Something's gonna have to change.
his luck's gonna have to change.

755
00:51:54.236 --> 00:52:00.106
He's gonna have to change his demeanor. his
confidence level. He's gonna have to dig deep.

756
00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:14.462
Every sfas selection has that
component to it. that individual component.

757
00:52:14.548 --> 00:52:18.666
where you're pushed so far mentally that
all you have to do is say. fuck it.

758
00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:23.346
And when you say fuck it. you put one foot in
front of the other. and follow instructions.

759
00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:26.549
07. 88. 89. 90.

760
00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:29.681
Leg straight out.
six-two. back to 70.

761
00:52:29.772 --> 00:52:33.856
We want people that show up
ready. we want them to pass.

762
00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:36.729
It is. they got to pass on
their own.

763
00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:42.315
Straight out. two-eight. Six-two.
doing the fucking standard.

764
00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:47.494
04. 65. 66. 67. 68. 69.

765
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:52.746
There is a standard but. you know.
once the goruck selection starts.

766
00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:56.124
the welcome party begins. the
standard is whoever's winning.

767
00:52:56.256 --> 00:52:58.872
So. you know. the cat's out of
the bag. that's the standard.

768
00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:00.847
Two-eight.
you're in the lead right now.

769
00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:20.235
- 97...
- 73.

770
00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:24.065
- 98. 99...
- 74.

771
00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:26.946
- 300.
- 75.

772
00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:29.494
You know there's
always a split sort of.

773
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.663
is it better to have somebody
behind you

774
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.242
who is doing poorly
so you look good by comparison.

775
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.669
But then also you're competing
with them

776
00:53:37.756 --> 00:53:41.044
and if the next evolution is something
that they're good at and you're bad at.

777
00:53:41.135 --> 00:53:43.968
well. guess what. heh. now you're
the one behind the eight ball

778
00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.716
and that might last for
one or two or three hours

779
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:48.576
and you might not be able
to recover from that.

780
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.431
Look who the smart guy is how?

781
00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:53.806
Pays to be a winner.

782
00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.890
Peanut butter and fucking jelly.
my favorite.

783
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.865
For me. it was just get past the pt
test. get past the welcome party.

784
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:11.412
uh. and then get to the 24-hour Mark and
then. boom. go time. that was the game plan.

785
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:22.960
This one looks good.

786
00:54:35.147 --> 00:54:36.478
I need water.

787
00:54:37.399 --> 00:54:39.981
A little bit of fungus. Get up.

788
00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.604
How are your feet?

789
00:54:42.696 --> 00:54:43.856
They feel good. cadre.

790
00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:49.658
Six-two. go and take
the shoes off.

791
00:54:49.745 --> 00:54:51.827
They. they actually. uh...

792
00:54:51.914 --> 00:54:53.914
Six-two. take off your shoes.

793
00:54:57.044 --> 00:55:00.252
They say the hardest part of
actual special forces selection

794
00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:05.504
is lacing up your boots for the second... for
the next day. after maybe an hour of asleep.

795
00:55:05.594 --> 00:55:09.257
That's the same thing. you know... the
same thing here. the hardest part is

796
00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:14.138
after that nice little break that you get.
lacing those boots up and going for round two.

797
00:55:15.187 --> 00:55:18.270
It's big. uh...
It's a big mind game.

798
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:33.473
Six-two.
how you doing right now?

799
00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:35.704
- I'm doing well. cadre.
- One to ten?

800
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.830
Nine.

801
00:55:39.378 --> 00:55:41.585
What's your biggest issue then?

802
00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:43.082
No issue. cadre.

803
00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:49.130
Just. obviously. not as fresh
24 hours in as zero hours in

804
00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:50.802
but I feel good.

805
00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:53.301
How are you
feeling mentally? Ten.

806
00:55:53.392 --> 00:55:56.429
How you feeling physically?
=nine.

807
00:55:58.146 --> 00:56:00.182
All right.
anything else you got to say?

808
00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:01.684
I have nothing. cadre.

809
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.308
All right.

810
00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:06.059
All right. two-eight.
quick check-in.

811
00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:08.896
How you doing. 1 to 10.
mentally and physically?

812
00:56:08.991 --> 00:56:14.657
Uh. physically. 6; Mentally. 8.

813
00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:17.321
What's going on in your head?

814
00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:18.576
Uh...

815
00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:21.913
Body is... body is tired.

816
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:28.466
I mean it's going at it for 24
hours. it's... it's expected so.

817
00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:31.294
It's... it's gonna
be difficult because...

818
00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:37.766
Yeah. the chest muscles
are sore. uh.

819
00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:44.144
quads... calves are a little
tight so it's just. you know.

820
00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:46.065
Okay. continue
to priorities of work.

821
00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:53.066
We asked six-two how he's doing. He's like.
mentally. I'm 10. Physically. I'm a 9. Right.

822
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.448
Doesn't want to say anything. doesn't
want to give me anything. right.

823
00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:59.450
which is exactly the right
answer. you know. I'm good.

824
00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:03.329
Like. fucking lie. that's what
you do. you fucking lie.

825
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.332
I'm good. right. I'm great.

826
00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:08.755
But you have to believe
that lie.

827
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:11.922
You do. You have to believe
the lie. - That's exactly right.

828
00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:15.804
For two-eight. he still remains.
you know. how are you doing?

829
00:57:17.225 --> 00:57:20.183
My body. 24 hours later.

830
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:24.604
I'm very sore. you know.
my chest hurts. stuff like that

831
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:28.229
and he still gotta find
that... that fighter.

832
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.560
Okay.

833
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:32.383
- He's gotta find it.
- His voice.

834
00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:33.968
Sounds like he's got
a lot of self-doubt.

835
00:57:33.992 --> 00:57:38.326
24 hours is not...
This is not close to done.

836
00:57:39.331 --> 00:57:41.476
- I mean. the good news is...
- It's halfway done.

837
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.207
The good news is.
is that there's only two people

838
00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:47.878
that have a chance of passing goruck
selection. they're both right over there

839
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:53.835
and they're doing well. one's doing a
little better but they're doing well.

840
00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:57.262
They both have it in them. they can
do it. it's just gonna be up to them.

841
00:57:57.349 --> 00:58:01.058
So root for them
and we'll keep it coming.

842
00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:08.854
At 24-hour Mark the cadre demeanor changes
to just. hey. here's the standard. do it.

843
00:58:08.944 --> 00:58:11.230
The standard is still upheld

844
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:15.030
but not to the point like it was when we
first began because that's impossible.

845
00:58:19.371 --> 00:58:23.205
Get up! Get up! Get up!

846
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:27.785
There's obviously. a point of physical
exhaustion that you just can't get through.

847
00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:32.543
whether it be dehydration or
altitude sickness or whatever it is

848
00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.250
but where people stop point is.

849
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:40.430
is probably two or three times
short of where they can go.

850
00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:42.007
Let's go. two-eight.

851
00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.184
You reach a point of collapse

852
00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:49.686
that if you're dehydrated
or you're hurt in some way.

853
00:58:49.776 --> 00:58:53.189
that's going to be a stopping point.
that's going to be a mid drop or whatever

854
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.772
but if you're just at
that point that you feel bad.

855
00:58:56.867 --> 00:59:00.906
your mind can do things and it's
amazing to push yourself through that

856
00:59:00.996 --> 00:59:03.487
and I think all of
the candidates have learned.

857
00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:07.491
some more than others.
what they can and can't do.

858
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:10.398
- Get your elbows off your knees.
- Get off the ledge.

859
00:59:10.422 --> 00:59:11.787
Get off the ledge.

860
00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:14.414
On your feet. two-eight.

861
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:16.875
Get on your gear.

862
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:19.090
Yes. cadre. - Move
with a sense of purpose.

863
00:59:20.974 --> 00:59:24.387
Yeah. this is very military
but there's success in failure

864
00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:26.639
so all those people
that showed up here

865
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.518
and didn't make it still are probably
better people at the end of the day.

866
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.232
they have higher standards
of themselves

867
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.483
and they'll expect more of themselves
in the future going forward.

868
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.529
One and two...

869
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.860
Move.

870
00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:48.540
Look straight ahead.
Only failure's on the ground.

871
00:59:48.627 --> 00:59:50.993
Roster two-zero-eight.
do you wish to continue?

872
00:59:51.088 --> 00:59:52.088
Yes. cadre.

873
01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.219
- Are you done?
- Are you done?

874
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.313
You done?

875
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.934
Get the rucksack.
get the sandbag up.

876
01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:16.143
Cadre mocha and cadre Garrett
are ramping up the intensity a lot.

877
01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:20.106
It's. uh... it's very hot.
Lot of mosquitoes. you know.

878
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.407
It's all that great
Florida stuff.

879
01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:27.204
Continue to move. Does not feel sorry
for yourself or have self-pity.

880
01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.541
Everyone's gonna have
a different why.

881
01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:40.501
Ultimately you have to do it for the right
reason. It has to be an honest reason.

882
01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:44.508
Toss it forward. Toss your
sandbag forward. Go get it.

883
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.512
Toss it. far. as far as you can.

884
01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:51.770
Go get it.

885
01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:59.486
I wanted to go through the experience
of being like pushed to my limit

886
01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:03.157
and learn like how to get past that
so that I could teach that to others.

887
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:07.577
You know what he needs to do one more
toss just 'cause he's last place.

888
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.369
When I had the thoughts of quitting
like it didn't even come up at all.

889
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.702
You need a special invite? You need a
special invite? You need some crayons?

890
01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:18.334
- You need a blankie?
- No. cadre.

891
01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:21.007
Well. then get moving.

892
01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:24.073
You read things that happened way more
significant than just an endurance event.

893
01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.634
You know. real life things
where people have taken action

894
01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:31.264
and you sort of wonder like. well. how
would I do in that sort of situation

895
01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:36.940
and this gives you a chance just to
have an idea of like how deep can I dig

896
01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.894
to just accomplish the task
at hand

897
01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:43.105
regardless of what might
happen or how things might be.

898
01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.391
Getting the engine started
again after you've had a long rest.

899
01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.155
I think that break is.

900
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.457
it's a blessing but it's also
a curse in a lot of ways.

901
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.253
These guys had over an hour to kind
of power down and get their shoes off

902
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.834
it's fair to say
it's a blessing in the long run

903
01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:05.340
and in the short run
it's miserable.

904
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.074
I think that's a great
way to describe it.

905
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.555
Without the rest.
they might not have had a shot

906
01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:14.057
and they needed the nutrition especially
in the hydration. they needed the rest but

907
01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:19.646
to go from 0 to 60 again
is very. very difficult.

908
01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:24.355
And it just doesn't feel very worth it after
you've had to get back up and start again

909
01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.316
so I think we're seeing that
especially with two-eight right now.

910
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.447
He just is having a hard time getting
back into the swing of things.

911
01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.120
If he can get through the next.
you know. 20 or 30 minutes

912
01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.449
and kind of get back on the...
On the horse.

913
01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.909
he might get in the zone
and keep going

914
01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:41.872
but he's really struggling to kind of
find the motivation coming off the break.

915
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:50.589
Okay. what you're gonna do
is reverse lunges.

916
01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.928
Understand me? You know. lunge.
facing this way.

917
01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:59.765
In that direction..

918
01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:01.652
You're done?

919
01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:02.987
Okay.

920
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.237
Six-two. move. you
heard the exercise. didn't you?

921
01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:10.401
Come here. Jonathan.
come over here. man.

922
01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:13.862
Here. bro. Sit down. sit down. Chill.
Let me have your fucking rucksack.

923
01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:17.575
Cadre was just going too
fast and I just couldn't move.

924
01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:22.254
I don't know if I just need to improve
cardio or what but it was just...

925
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.752
Well. the heat. man.

926
01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:28.836
We were trying to keep you guys cool.
obviously. you know. in the water all the time

927
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.264
but the heat's gonna do that. it's gonna
elevate your heart rate for sure.

928
01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:37.390
Anytime you get dehydrated and that heat
stuff. you're gonna be fucked. so...

929
01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.102
You're a bay area boy.
aren't you?

930
01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.148
Yeah. So there was no...

931
01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.214
I mean. it got hot there for a
week or two. didn't it like 100...

932
01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:49.356
A one weekend. that was it so.

933
01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:52.443
I tried to do the sauna thing
but it's just...

934
01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:53.993
Here. put this behind.

935
01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.451
It's not like this is a sauna.
it's not like this.

936
01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:02.752
Yeah.

937
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.673
Oh. man. it was... it was awesome
and an inspirational for real.

938
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.001
- I'Hank you.
- No. thanks again.

939
01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:11.051
- Good job. man.
- Thanks.

940
01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.230
You did a good job. man.

941
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.317
Heart rate.

942
01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:46.545
I don't like this
event at all. I really don't.

943
01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:49.124
I feel like it brings out

944
01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.794
the worst in humanity
but at the same time.

945
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:57.724
when that worst is... is... is... brought
in. the best kind of rises to the surface

946
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:02.430
so. you know. if it's a black class
that's not a good weekend at all.

947
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.442
If we have at least one
finisher. it makes it all worth it.

948
01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.370
Let's just hope
medically he can survive.

949
01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:36.551
One of the things that I've learned
early on as a young special forces soldier

950
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:41.431
was my team sergeant. my first team sergeant.
sat me down and talked to me and said.

951
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.263
"okay. what I need you to do

952
01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:50.398
and what every professional warrior
can do is tell me what he can't do."

953
01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:55.115
And I just completed the
qualification course and I was like.

954
01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.863
what do you mean what
I can't do. I can do anything.

955
01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:04.992
And he said. "listen to what
I'm going to say to you.

956
01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:08.044
you have to know yourself
as an individual.

957
01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:11.794
you have to bring that
to the team.

958
01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:16.549
and as an individual we need to know
what you can't do for two reasons.

959
01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:22.100
One. we won't give you a job to do that will
get you or other members on this team killed.

960
01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:25.679
And number two. it tells me
what you need to be trained in

961
01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:28.105
so I can schedule you
for future trainings."

962
01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.897
Hurry up. front mount it.

963
01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.575
Let's go.

964
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.829
"Before you can be a member of a team
or a member. a good member of a community.

965
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.914
you have to know what's inside you. you
have to know what you can and can't do

966
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.420
and openly share that
with others.

967
01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:58.254
then you can move on
beyond that."

968
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:08.559
All the way. keep going.
Bend knee down.

969
01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:09.890
Close it.

970
01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.918
Figure how to put that on.

971
01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.787
Do you have any numbness
and tingling in your hand?

972
01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:07.746
Uh...

973
01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:11.523
I don't know
if I'd say numbness but...

974
01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:14.394
Cap refill is good.
Can you do this for me?

975
01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.507
Don't rest your arm. just hold
it up and we'll do that.

976
01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.050
Can you touch my hand?

977
01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.606
Stand up and let your arms
hang down your side.

978
01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.034
Is your knee okay?

979
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:56.108
I saw you walk. limp up. Is your knee okay?
Do you want me to look at your knee?

980
01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.498
No. I think my knee is fine.
You think or...

981
01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.049
This is not think time.

982
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.947
I didn't. uh... I didn't twist
or anything like that. no.

983
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.177
All right. you'll be fine.

984
01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.624
I have let's say
like a calf cramp.

985
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.891
Maybe not perfect but good.

986
01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.049
Okay.

987
01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.646
Six inches.
I assigned six inches.

988
01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.943
- Six inches.
- I six inches.

989
01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:07.054
You're not six inches. yet.
six-two. It's is gonna be a long night.

990
01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.820
Six-two. let's go. six-two.

991
01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:16.576
Let's go. Pull them up. six-two.

992
01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:21.247
Hold it for ten seconds out of that
water. I'll let you go on your feet.

993
01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:24.755
Ten. no.
You got to start it over again.

994
01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:29.635
I think it's important
to communicate that our cadre

995
01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:34.811
are all former special operators of some
kind and they've been through selections

996
01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:39.391
but more important than being through selections.
they have been through world experiences.

997
01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.771
Just give me the pouch.
whatever you want to do.

998
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:47.157
They've been
in foreign countries

999
01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:51.907
at the worst possible time in those
same kind of similar moments

1000
01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:55.115
to your worst nightmare at the... you
know. the worst point during selection.

1001
01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:57.396
You give me that sandbag
running lights.

1002
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.411
I'll give your selection badge
right now.

1003
01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:08.552
- Holy shit. six-two.
- I so close. yet. so far.

1004
01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:09.970
Do you have it in you?

1005
01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:12.389
I think the cadre's role
in there

1006
01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:17.016
is it's almost an art form
of taking that experience.

1007
01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.597
that personal experience
that we have

1008
01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:25.312
and translating that to somebody in the civilian
community that just wants to be better.

1009
01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:28.318
Let's go. six-two.

1010
01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:31.067
Let's go.

1011
01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:34.746
It becomes an art of
how do I manage the standard

1012
01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.541
and how do I get the most out
of each individual

1013
01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:43.338
where they walk away with a learned
experience that's positive for them.

1014
01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:55.471
Keep moving forward. All right. take that
patch of your rucksack. Do you understand me?

1015
01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.893
- Yes. cadre.
- All right. let's go. come on.

1016
01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.971
That ain't one.

1017
01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.307
You're at zero
is what you're at.

1018
01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:10.823
Let's go.

1019
01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.732
- Can you touch the bottom?
- No. cadre.

1020
01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:24.003
Do you know what depth
of water you're in right now?

1021
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.921
I don't.

1022
01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.294
Approximately 12 feet
of water right now.

1023
01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:31.669
Get up higher. if it touches I will add
water to it. Do you understand me?

1024
01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.800
- Yes. cadre.
- Get it above your head.

1025
01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.223
Higher.

1026
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:44.224
Don't let it touch. You say you're comfortable
out here. you said this portion was easy.

1027
01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.313
Cody. what's them seal say?

1028
01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:51.449
Cadre. Cody.

1029
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:55.364
What's them seal say. what's that
seal saying you guys have about...

1030
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:03.535
That's it. That's what I was
searching for. Keep it up above your head.

1031
01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:07.622
- This shit's easy now. right?
- No. cadre.

1032
01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:12.339
1 think you're playing
with my emotion. six-two.

1033
01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:28.526
Two. one. two. three. three.
one. two. four...

1034
01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:31.571
If it tips over. you start all over
again. you understand that. right?

1035
01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.693
Sorry. cadre?

1036
01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:35.971
If it tips over you're gonna start
over from zero. you understand?

1037
01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:37.576
I understand. Continue.

1038
01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.154
One. two. three. five.

1039
01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:44.083
One. two. three. six.

1040
01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:51.044
One. two. three. seven. One...

1041
01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:53.030
That's just the alligator eating
that bird. don't worry about that.

1042
01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:56.137
Eight. One. two...

1043
01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:57.713
How's your calf?

1044
01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:03.891
I can still feel it but it's working
right now. I know when I get out of.

1045
01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:07.018
That's if you ever get out.
Keep it higher.

1046
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.940
Geez. my mom just joined this.

1047
01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:21.246
Hi. mom. what are you doing?
My mom is watching this.

1048
01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:29.745
Hey. six-two. question of the hour.
Why are you here?

1049
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.298
Why are you filling
this hole in with your life?

1050
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.085
Why do you want to finish?

1051
01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.719
What is it about you that makes
you want to be here

1052
01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:45.599
doing this ridiculous stuff?

1053
01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.964
A lot of the comments in the thread
here over the last few minutes

1054
01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:55.901
about why is he doing this. I'm gonna
level with you. I don't know why.

1055
01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.778
Well. what other hard stuff.

1056
01:14:57.868 --> 01:15:02.282
I mean. you like to walk to work
whoop-de-fucking-doo so do I.

1057
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.159
You like to... what else?

1058
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.365
Uh...

1059
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.956
Okay. whoop-de-doo. what else?

1060
01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:12.526
We did it primarily because I wanted
to know what was on the other side.

1061
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.040
I wasn't doing it
to prove myself.

1062
01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.592
I was doing it because I wanted
to be part of the community.

1063
01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:19.011
So in this scenario...

1064
01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.805
You probably wanted to
prove yourself a little bit too.

1065
01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.473
Right. maybe a little bit.

1066
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.401
You know. I mean.
it's the same gene.

1067
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:32.504
Some of you were saying it's for pride.
some were saying it's to prove yourself.

1068
01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:36.020
to yourself. to others.
whatever. Doesn't matter.

1069
01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:39.315
That's the thing. everyone that finishes
goruck selection or any event like this.

1070
01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:43.907
they've got something. some reason
deep inside why they're doing it.

1071
01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:46.785
If they didn't. they couldn't push
through this. They just couldn't.

1072
01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:51.752
Here's a good question. How
far does he have to roll this twig?

1073
01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:56.674
Well. he has to flip this twig
until I get tired. that's how far.

1074
01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:05.178
Six-two. 1 to 10. how are you
feeling right now. physically?

1075
01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:07.931
- Physically. five or six.
- Five or six.

1076
01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.478
You've gotten better?

1077
01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:14.354
- Yes?
- Probably five.

1078
01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:18.275
All right. What do you
think your chances are

1079
01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.196
of successfully completing
goruck selection?

1080
01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:22.320
Hundred percent.

1081
01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:25.403
All right. good. Charlie
Mike. continue the mission.

1082
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:29.366
See. all right. so
this is gonna be the sign off.

1083
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.920
There's just some preparation for
the long walk that's got to go on

1084
01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.748
which is just starting here in
not too long.

1085
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:40.050
He's doing really well. man.
We're really proud of him.

1086
01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.028
Keep moving forward. cadre.

1087
01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:24.136
The long walk is the last
evolution for goruck selection.

1088
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:28.925
It is. uh. exactly what it
sounds like. a very long walk.

1089
01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:32.557
It's an undisclosed distance.
undisclosed time to the candidate.

1090
01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:40.019
If he doesn't complete it.
he doesn't complete it.

1091
01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.947
That's really it.
It's not too tough to explain.

1092
01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.571
J my mind needs to lie I

1093
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:49.870
j in those fields so open wide j

1094
01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:53.916
j look up and take me j

1095
01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:59.168
j to the big. big sky j

1096
01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:03.251
it's. hey. go down this
road and don't stop.

1097
01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.461
The standard is forward
progression.

1098
01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:09.219
And by this time we've got. well. in
this class we had one person left

1099
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:13.053
but if you had three or four left.
they're gonna get separated.

1100
01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:15.354
they're not gonna keep
the same pace

1101
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:20.310
and now the only thing you have out
there besides a dark road or beach.

1102
01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:23.362
is what's going on
inside your head.

1103
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:27.067
And all the pain is amplified
and the tiredness is amplified.

1104
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.368
in fact. you're falling asleep
walking on your feet.

1105
01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:32.492
J where my love is bound to go j

1106
01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.290
j when I see her will I know j

1107
01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:38.835
ji know I'll know jl

1108
01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:19.498
It again brings back
that mental toughness.

1109
01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:23.422
like how too far can
you dig inside your mind to go.

1110
01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.716
it's gotta be around the corner.
I can go another foot.

1111
01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:28.545
I can put my foot in front
of the other one more time.

1112
01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:03.542
All right. goruck candidate zero-six-two
is still moving south down the beach.

1113
01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:09.548
He is now just over eight hours
into the long walk.

1114
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:15.508
So try to imagine that
he's absolutely was crushed for.

1115
01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:19.311
you know. 36 hours or so.
maybe more.

1116
01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:24.267
then he puts his rucksack back on and he's
been walking now for over eight hours.

1117
01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:28.320
At this point. I would be very surprised
if he can't complete the walk

1118
01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:31.615
or just endure what's left for him
down there at the finish line.

1119
01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:35.115
So I think we're gonna see
a selection finisher this year.

1120
01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:39.039
This guy's been rock solid
pretty much the whole way.

1121
01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:43.290
He's gonna make it. So we'll get
you updated here in just a second.

1122
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:47.248
Now we're gonna try to get you live footage
really from here to the rest of the way out.

1123
01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:51.052
So if you're into watching
the dude walk down the beach.

1124
01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:54.301
you know. for a few hours. this
is the place to do it today.

1125
01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:15.401
The beauty of it is as you come in
at the eight. the nine hour of walking

1126
01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:17.828
and there's all these
cadre again.

1127
01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:20.998
And all those senses come back.

1128
01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:25.044
The ocean's in your face.
The cadre are yelling again.

1129
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:28.372
They're asking you to do things that
in your mind are now impossible.

1130
01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:32.793
And you think. I'm done.
it's here.

1131
01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:54.402
Once you reach that dark point and I have
been there. all of our cadre have been there.

1132
01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:59.487
I don't want to be here. I'm
cold. I'm wet. I'm miserable.

1133
01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.163
every step feels like torture.

1134
01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:05.750
I mean. why do we do this
to ourselves?

1135
01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:12.917
The type of person
that passes selection.

1136
01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:18.130
they want to uphold themselves
to a standard.

1137
01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:19.911
They want to be the type
of person that says.

1138
01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:23.473
I want the hardest job
you can imagine. send me.

1139
01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:26.021
Do you wanna quit. six-two?

1140
01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:29.942
Hey. we can write your selection on a crown and
a piece of paper. That's the new generation.

1141
01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:34.525
That's a rare individual
that wants to do that.

1142
01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:40.452
And when you see that. when you look
into someone's eyes after 47 hours

1143
01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:45.408
and you know that there's nothing
you can do to break them

1144
01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:49.290
that is empowerment
that is inspiration.

1145
01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.921
All the way up. six-two.

1146
01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:00.493
- Lift your knees up.
- Let's go. six-two.

1147
01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:03.008
This is not mud.

1148
01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:06.721
Do the exercise as outlined by the
to the standard of the cadre.

1149
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.251
Not doing any exercises
right now. six-two.

1150
01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.516
Lift your arms. Lift your arms.

1151
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:16.113
As you go through selection.

1152
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.986
you almost reach

1153
01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:23.158
a different plane
of mental being.

1154
01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:28.618
And I think that plane what I would
equate it to is an understanding of self

1155
01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:32.955
that while you are
an individual.

1156
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.962
you become a part
of something greater.

1157
01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:40.926
Forward. forward. Keep moving.

1158
01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.348
- Forward. Forward.
- Keep going. six-two.

1159
01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:45.426
Hurry up. six-two.

1160
01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:48.686
Hurry up. six-two.

1161
01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.376
- Switch hands.
- Hurry up. six-two.

1162
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.120
One hand
with that fighter. six-two.

1163
01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.268
Don't let
that bag drag. six-two.

1164
01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.105
Don't let that bag drag.
Switch hands.

1165
01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:03.411
It's extremely refreshing
to come here and just see no excuses.

1166
01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:06.364
there's finally something
where there's a bar

1167
01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:10.371
and if you don't make it.
nobody cares.

1168
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:32.602
Six-two. see that's
pretty pathetic right now.

1169
01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:38.983
- Get it up. get it up.
- Come on. six-two.

1170
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:42.532
Are you expecting. six-two?

1171
01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:44.905
Are you expecting us. six-two?

1172
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.432
- Wwe are not stopping.
- Hurry up!

1173
01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.287
- Swing it!
- Hurry up!

1174
01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:49.978
. Get that fucking
bag over your head. let's go.

1175
01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.333
Let's go. six-two!

1176
01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:56.414
- What is your problem. six-two?
- Hurry up!

1177
01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.964
Get this. six-two. let's go!

1178
01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.994
Get it up there!

1179
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:11.436
Hurry up. we got six bags
on your back.

1180
01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:13.980
Hurry up. sixtwo.

1181
01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:16.558
You can die of hypothermia.
come on.

1182
01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:18.189
Come on. six-two.

1183
01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:27.285
Holy shit. six-two. Wow.

1184
01:25:28.415 --> 01:25:31.575
You saved yourself some time. -
Find the bottom of the squat. six-two.

1185
01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:36.002
. six-two.

1186
01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:38.089
- All right. six-two.
- Complete the task. six-two.

1187
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.964
You got to squat. six-two.

1188
01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:42.464
Squat. six-two. In the
bottom of the squat. sixtwo.

1189
01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:43.839
Squat.

1190
01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:48.223
Find the bottom of the squat.
six-two.

1191
01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.635
That's not the bottom.
=lt's not the bottom.

1192
01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:55.310
Six-two. stand up.

1193
01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:57.558
Turn around.

1194
01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.479
Candidate.

1195
01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:06.692
Congratulations for passing
the class. selection class 019.

1196
01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.789
Are you smiling. man?

1197
01:26:55.419 --> 01:27:01.335
I remember. when I... l was an eagle
scout or I'm an eagle scout and

1198
01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:05.714
you know. I was in junior high. high school.
and boy scouts and when you make eagle scout.

1199
01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:08.420
they put on a big court of honor.
it's a big ceremony. right.

1200
01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:10.722
they bring local dignitaries
and that sort of thing.

1201
01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:13.676
And I can't remember the gentleman
unfortunately who said it

1202
01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:18.605
but as part of his speech he said. "this
eagle scout medal. it's not a award.

1203
01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:20.586
it's not something that you...
You put on your wall

1204
01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:23.522
to say. look what I did.
It's just a burden.”

1205
01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:28.322
Congratulations for completing
goruck selection 020.

1206
01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:33.908
So it's the same thing with this

1207
01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:36.957
where it's like you better hold
yourself to that standard forever.

1208
01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:41.662
otherwise youre just spitting on everybody
else who's there in that patch.

1209
01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:47.627
you know. and fought so hard to get there
because people will look at all those

1210
01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:49.928
and... and that's how
they judge it.

1211
01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:06.278
The most important part of this event is
that it honors our roots in special forces.

1212
01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:12.944
It's really. really important
that those who pass it.

1213
01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:18.457
and those who want to pass it
know that there is a standard

1214
01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:23.958
and that that standard is based upon the
selection courses that we've been through.

1215
01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:29.960
There's a reason why
almost nobody passes those.

1216
01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:32.137
it's because
it's really. really hard.

1217
01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:39.974
We're giving people a slice of what
that looks like and feels like.

1218
01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:44.229
We're building a bridge between the
military and the civilian worlds

1219
01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.277
by leveraging our background
in special forces.

1220
01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:55.444
And when the human spirit is alive
and well like we see it here.

1221
01:28:55.539 --> 01:29:01.250
it reminds me of the guys that I graduated the
special forces qualification course with.

1222
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.584
And if that's not honoring our roots in
special forces. then I don't know what is.
