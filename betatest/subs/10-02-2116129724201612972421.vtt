00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:52.302
(We made sure the child actors who appear in this episode...)

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:55.029
(were safe and well taken care of throughout the shoot.)

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.824
(Episode 4)

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.784
Who are you?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.784
Where am I?

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:29.754
I don't know.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.854
I didn't do it.

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:34.224
I don't know anything.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.669
Please drive out the demon.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.134
Please drive out the demon.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.609
Please send this cunning snake to the fiery pit.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.579
Please send him to the fiery pit.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.579
Please cast away this evil fox to hades.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.048
Please cast him away.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.715
- Stop it! - Please bind the foolish monster...

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.155
with a chain and send him to the fiery pit.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.788
- Stop it. - Please protect us...

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.394
from the demon's trickery.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.928
I beg of you!

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.325
Please lock him up!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.669
I said to stop.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.298
Please send the demon and all the evil spirits...

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.438
that roam the earth to the fiery pit!

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.705
Stop it!

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.655
I knew nothing. but you turned me into a monster.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.584
I was human until you called me a monster.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.725
You're the one who made me a monster.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.665
Go to the fiery pit. you monster.

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:47.494
Why should I?

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:52.774
You are...

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.814
a monster filled completely by an evil spirit!

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.255
Why should I?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.864
(Euicheon Church)

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.825
Lead this monster...

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.165
into the fiery pit.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.344
Stop it!

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.934
Drive faster.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.304
Are you okay?

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.405
Let's go.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.975
Hey!

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.684
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.684
We're going inside?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.965
We'll suffocate to death before we even find him.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.944
Zi O. let's go outside and play.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:07.754
Hey.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.925
Hey. get to your senses. If you stay here...

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.364
I remember.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.074
It was me. I was here.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.304
I set this place on fire.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.874
Do you remember coming to my house?

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.645
Do you know where my parents went?

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.215
You don't remember?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.295
Let's go.

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:01.275
Sister. Sister Stella.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.595
Get in. Hurry.

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:16.824
Sister.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.134
Wait here for a moment.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.355
Where did the man go?

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.634
Are they not here?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.804
Her car's gone.

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:03.675
I told you we shouldn't go inside.

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:06.574
If we waited here. we would've caught them already.

00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:08.214
What about her cell phone?

00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:10.184
I can't trace their location.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.484
I think she turned it off.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.385
Either that. or it turned off on its own.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.875
Since when were you...

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.745
able to do...

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.814
You know. the sparks?

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.795
There are times when I want to die.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.125
When things get too tough and painful.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.594
I think to myself that I might be better off dead...

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.464
and that I'd be able to feel at ease if my life just ended.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.405
And whenever I think that way.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.035
my body starts to heat up.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.905
I don't know how it's possible.

00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:10.704
It's just what happens.

00:10:13.219 --> 00:10:14.814
And everything starts to look blue.

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.149
Whenever I feel the urge to die.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.684
it's as if my body is struggling not to.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.954
The moment you feel like dying...

00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:28.765
is actually when you want to live the most.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.395
No. that's not how I felt.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:36.234
I personally disagree.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.905
When you fell from the rooftop.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.344
ran away from the hospital.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.944
and even just now. it seemed like you really wanted to live.

00:10:49.219 --> 00:10:51.348
Anyway. you burned yourself...

00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:53.314
to stay alive.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.858
And I'm not interested in whether or not...

00:10:57.859 --> 00:10:59.098
you were there...

00:10:59.099 --> 00:11:01.094
or that you set the curtains on fire.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.169
I need to know what happened...

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.135
right before you ended up at the orphanage.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.409
You said you're going to dig through my brain. right?

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.834
I want you to stop.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:14.775
I no longer want to find out what's in my brain.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.915
I told you not to make a mistake.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.258
You missed him so many times already.

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.059
We checked the car that was parked by the church.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.454
and it turned out to be the female cop's vehicle.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.899
She and Zi O are traveling together.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.365
Her cell phone is turned off. so we can't trace her.

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:40.069
I think it's because of electromagnetic waves.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.464
Once she turns it on. we'll trace her location again.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.708
and I had my guys stand guard at the police station...

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:47.074
and her house just in case.

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:48.704
We'll find them soon.

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.275
- Did you eat? - No. not yet.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:56.984
Make sure you eat well. Don't skip your meals.

00:11:57.089 --> 00:11:58.149
Yes. sir.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.814
You know I don't trust people. right?

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:02.785
- Yes. I know. - But I trust you.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.454
So bring me results.

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:12.765
Professor Ryu. I trust you too.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.905
So let's get this done. okay?

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.275
Please.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:40.925
Are you okay?

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:43.765
I'm okay.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.405
I'm sorry.

00:12:48.739 --> 00:12:51.064
You can't leave this place because I saved your arm.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.074
It's better than not having it.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.005
It's just an arm after all.

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.944
but look at us.

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:03.484
Dr. Ryu.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.954
If I bring Z-0 to you.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.184
can you give me his arm?

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.224
Someone must've promised you...

00:13:14.229 --> 00:13:16.728
that you'd get his arm.

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:18.194
Is it possible?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.265
Science is a shadow of the Divinity.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.665
Only your faith can produce results.

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:24.304
So just believe it. and it'll happen?

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:26.734
"If I do a good job.."

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:29.704
"I'll get a normal arm."

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.545
Should I just believe in it?

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.645
What else can you do other than just believing it?

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.954
If there's anything else. do that too.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.189
So is it impossible?

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.329
It is possible in theory.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.454
However. theories are not what moves the world.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.255
Variables do.

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:49.895
And I'm a slave...

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.535
to variables.

00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:54.635
And so are you.

00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:59.135
Everyone here...

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.734
is the same.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.844
No one ever gives me an exact answer.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.978
Right.

00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:11.545
This place would be a headache for a former military officer.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.554
I understand how you feel.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.724
but please bring Z-0 to me safely.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.234
Don't hurt him. Bring him to me safe and sound.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.194
I've been...

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.535
having dreams about meeting him every night.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.454
Did you open it?

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:52.199
Yes. I did. Go ahead.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.429
01M 5273.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.895
01M...

00:14:57.369 --> 00:15:00.594
5273.

00:15:02.739 --> 00:15:03.909
(Loading)

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.035
(Scrapped)

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.505
Is this the right number?

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:08.875
Get in.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.645
(01M 5273)

00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:14.779
01M 5273.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.615
This says that the car's been scrapped.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.618
What?

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:21.258
It was owned by a car rental company. But last year.

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:22.888
it was sent to a junkyard.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.925
A typical way to turn a vehicle into a burner car.

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.054
But why do you need this info?

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.724
It's nothing.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.824
Come on. Tell me.

00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:32.569
The driver drove aggressively.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.209
You weren't feeling well. so you left early. Why are you driving?

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:37.208
Okay. bye.

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:40.234
Hey. don't tell me you're up to something.

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:41.779
No. I'm not feeling well. I have to go.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.145
Hey. Gu Reum.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.588
A man who can produce a powerful current like an electric eel...

00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:51.984
or shoots out potent venom like a jellyfish does.

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:53.615
Can you call that man human?

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.755
Jeung Kwon was actually working on it.

00:16:16.379 --> 00:16:18.175
Professor. it's me.

00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:20.775
I need to talk to you about something.

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:44.334
Someone followed us.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:46.974
Now?

00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:50.574
No. not now.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.944
Earlier.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.854
I saw a car I didn't see when we arrived at the church.

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.285
I asked my colleague to look it up. and it's a burner car.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.785
So who was it?

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.584
It's a burner car. so I don't know.

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.064
No...

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.724
This person didn't follow us.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.234
They purposely came here.

00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:17.365
Did you tell someone you'd be coming here?

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:20.738
No. I didn't tell anyone.

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:21.978
Then how did this person find out?

00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:24.745
Well. there are many ways to find out.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.074
Planting a tracker in my car or in my phone could be one way.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.684
Or they could be watching us in real time using satellites.

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:34.484
The thing is. "how" is not important here.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.954
What matters here is who they're after.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.284
Me.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.095
Yes. it's got to be you.

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:47.398
Someone knows that I'm with you now.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.934
And they used me because they couldn't track you down.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.974
But why are they tracking a cop to find you?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.014
Who are you. really?

00:18:02.689 --> 00:18:04.118
You said you weren't curious.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:07.155
You may be more than just a witness in a murder case.

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:10.784
I witnessed a murder case?

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.925
Forget it. Let's go.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.264
Where are we going?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.464
To find out who you really are.

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:31.345
(Awooa Plastic Surgery Clinic)

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.125
It's okay.

00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:51.925
I called him.

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:59.075
- Hello. Professor. - Hey.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.375
I was doing something inside.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.474
Is this the friend you told me about?

00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:08.415
He's not really my friend.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.345
He's the guy who escaped from the hospital.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.524
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Jong Hwan.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.855
This is my friend's clinic. I'm just borrowing it.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.625
We're the only ones here now. so put your worries to rest.

00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:22.595
Worries? About what?

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:27.569
We'll run a few tests on you today.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.709
It won't take long.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.865
What are you talking about?

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:31.605
What kinds of tests?

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:33.734
They're just simple tests.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.405
You didn't tell me any of this.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.219
I'm telling you now.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.145
He said he'd run tests on me. not you.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.085
You can't just go ahead and decide. I don't want to do this.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.524
Hey. hey!

00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:53.194
I'm explaining the situation now.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.069
You're explaining after the fact.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.964
Why should I listen to this?

00:19:58.939 --> 00:20:00.365
These tests will help us find out...

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.734
who made you like this...

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.704
No. I mean... That's not a good way to put it.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.408
If we do this. we can find out who gave you...

00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:10.744
such powers or whether you obtained them naturally.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.615
This is key in finding out who you really are.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.214
Let's do it. We both want to know.

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:22.254
If we dig up my past memories and find out...

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.325
that I actually killed your parents. then what will you do?

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.694
Then...

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.895
you'll die too.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.434
So you want to do this to decide whether or not you should kill me.

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:42.034
Yes.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.004
Let's go.

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:51.514
So what are we doing?

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.885
I'll take some samples of your blood and tissue.

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.484
But before we do that...

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:02.494
Have you seen this man?

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.464
Never?

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:10.464
I'm not sure...

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.905
whether I've never met him or simply don't remember him.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.575
All right. Shall we?

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.724
I'll take a sample of your epithelial cells.

00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:31.355
Open wide.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.444
I'll get a few samples of your skin cells for a biopsy.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.155
No! Don't!

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.095
Don't!

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.319
I'll get a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid...

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.954
to test your immune and antibody response.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.155
It'll hurt quite a bit.

00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:39.724
Let's just get it done.

00:22:40.429 --> 00:22:41.555
I'll begin now.

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:39.415
Stop it.

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:49.165
Enough. Enough!

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.264
Don't get up. It's dangerous.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.514
Oh my gosh.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.714
What the...

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.845
Put this on.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.895
Did it hurt a lot?

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:42.704
I won't apologize.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:44.905
Let's go.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.075
We're almost done.

00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:50.085
I don't want to find out anything more. Let me be.

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:10.305
Stop it.

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:13.335
Don't do it.

00:26:32.282 --> 00:26:33.387
Stop it.

00:26:35.292 --> 00:26:36.457
Don't do it.

00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:50.266
Whenever someone shows up.

00:26:51.441 --> 00:26:52.937
I get chills all over.

00:26:54.441 --> 00:26:58.576
Especially when a stranger appears in the dark.

00:27:01.151 --> 00:27:02.607
But not you.

00:27:16.362 --> 00:27:18.357
Both in the hospital and the subway station.

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:23.367
you were never dangerous to me.

00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:25.367
You were the only one.

00:27:27.441 --> 00:27:30.076
I thought I could be with you.

00:27:31.342 --> 00:27:32.476
Let's go.

00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:35.976
The next test doesn't hurt.

00:27:37.981 --> 00:27:40.286
If I had killed your parents.

00:27:40.691 --> 00:27:43.957
the hair all over my body would've stood up.

00:27:46.062 --> 00:27:47.226
It wasn't me.

00:27:48.092 --> 00:27:49.496
Someone else did it.

00:27:51.502 --> 00:27:53.301
Don't try to find me again.

00:27:53.302 --> 00:27:54.796
We're almost done with the tests.

00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:56.536
I don't want to learn anything more.

00:27:58.602 --> 00:27:59.766
I'm too scared.

00:28:12.052 --> 00:28:13.816
If you won't go. I'll force you.

00:28:58.931 --> 00:29:02.127
Are you interested in fixing up your entire face while you're at it?

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:05.397
I'm very interested.

00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:07.607
but I have no money.

00:29:09.272 --> 00:29:12.006
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:29:12.342 --> 00:29:14.450
It'll be a problem later on...

00:29:14.451 --> 00:29:16.647
if you hide a suspect like this.

00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:21.516
He came to my home...

00:29:22.762 --> 00:29:24.157
a long time ago.

00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:26.286
He did? How?

00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:29.387
I'm not sure.

00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:32.597
What did your dad do?

00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:36.337
- Why? - If it was in biotech.

00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:39.167
maybe he worked with Zi O.

00:29:39.772 --> 00:29:43.506
I saw him in a lab coat when I was a child.

00:29:44.312 --> 00:29:45.980
So I thought he was a doctor...

00:29:45.981 --> 00:29:49.046
but found out he was a researcher at an aerospace lab.

00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.716
That's understandable.

00:29:52.552 --> 00:29:55.046
Doctors are critical to space exploration.

00:29:57.691 --> 00:30:00.226
But why did Zi O go to your home?

00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:03.657
I don't know.

00:30:03.961 --> 00:30:05.097
But...

00:30:06.631 --> 00:30:08.066
what I know less is...

00:30:10.042 --> 00:30:11.266
he disappeared...

00:30:12.141 --> 00:30:14.236
with my mom and dad the next day.

00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:16.276
What do you mean?

00:30:17.411 --> 00:30:19.776
What I said. They disappeared...

00:30:20.512 --> 00:30:21.776
never...

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:24.680
to be seen again.

00:30:24.681 --> 00:30:26.046
They went missing?

00:30:28.651 --> 00:30:30.486
So that's why you were holding onto him.

00:30:31.292 --> 00:30:33.791
In case he knew something about your parents.

00:30:33.792 --> 00:30:34.927
Yes.

00:30:36.961 --> 00:30:39.867
But that jerk ran away.

00:30:40.832 --> 00:30:43.397
I have to catch him again. Let's go.

00:30:43.671 --> 00:30:44.796
Gu Reum.

00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:47.766
That was...

00:30:48.612 --> 00:30:52.476
the case you said you were investigating separately. right?

00:30:54.282 --> 00:30:55.377
No.

00:30:55.681 --> 00:30:57.617
That's why you became a cop. right?

00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:01.847
No. It's all in the past.

00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:04.256
You got kicked out of Major Crimes...

00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:07.561
because you were investigating your parents' case.

00:31:07.562 --> 00:31:08.786
Like today.

00:31:11.532 --> 00:31:13.367
Do you think...

00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:15.966
your mom and dad are alive?

00:31:17.941 --> 00:31:19.867
Or do you think they passed away?

00:31:23.512 --> 00:31:24.877
Isn't it only natural?

00:31:27.481 --> 00:31:30.377
Someone missing for five years is presumed dead.

00:31:31.282 --> 00:31:32.986
There are no records of their whereabouts of spending.

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:36.187
No proof of life anywhere.

00:31:36.721 --> 00:31:38.061
Not things like that.

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:39.857
Not things like that? What?

00:31:42.592 --> 00:31:45.496
What else is there?

00:31:48.032 --> 00:31:49.466
My mom and dad...

00:31:50.971 --> 00:31:52.937
They shouldn't be alive.

00:31:54.242 --> 00:31:56.677
Because if they are. it means they abandoned me and ran away.

00:31:57.681 --> 00:31:59.976
And if they're doing just fine. then I'm...

00:32:01.582 --> 00:32:02.707
What do I do?

00:32:03.752 --> 00:32:05.177
That's just wrong. you know?

00:32:05.981 --> 00:32:07.746
So they shouldn't be alive.

00:32:09.522 --> 00:32:10.657
But...

00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:24.437
I hope they're alive somewhere.

00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:31.036
I want to see them again. even if it's just once.

00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:36.816
Gu Reum.

00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:40.046
You're you.

00:32:40.921 --> 00:32:41.991
Right.

00:32:41.992 --> 00:32:43.216
You have your own life.

00:32:44.621 --> 00:32:45.716
I know that.

00:32:46.092 --> 00:32:48.587
No. you don't.

00:32:49.292 --> 00:32:51.697
You're your parents' daughter.

00:32:51.832 --> 00:32:53.667
and you're a friend to some people.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:56.466
And later on in life. you'll become a mother.

00:32:57.201 --> 00:32:59.806
You'll be given many roles throughout your life.

00:33:00.871 --> 00:33:02.536
but here's the most important thing.

00:33:03.582 --> 00:33:05.707
You're your own person.

00:33:07.312 --> 00:33:09.746
You shouldn't live the rest of your life as someone's daughter.

00:33:10.181 --> 00:33:12.647
You need to live your life.

00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:17.957
That sounds great and all. but...

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:21.786
it doesn't make me feel better.

00:33:22.332 --> 00:33:24.226
That's because your emotions are all dried up.

00:33:28.002 --> 00:33:29.597
Now. that's helpful.

00:33:30.572 --> 00:33:34.036
Not letting go of your parents may ruin your life.

00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:37.011
And by the same token. your husband or children...

00:33:37.012 --> 00:33:38.677
may ruin your life in the future as well.

00:33:39.512 --> 00:33:40.946
But don't do that to yourself.

00:33:42.182 --> 00:33:44.580
You make the final call on whether or not...

00:33:44.581 --> 00:33:46.047
your life can be ruined.

00:33:46.952 --> 00:33:49.116
Professor. let's talk about work.

00:33:50.521 --> 00:33:53.087
You'll call me first when the results are out. right?

00:33:53.262 --> 00:33:54.426
Yes. of course.

00:33:57.662 --> 00:33:59.096
Will the test results...

00:33:59.231 --> 00:34:02.297
help us determine if Zi O has something to do...

00:34:02.941 --> 00:34:04.496
with that man. Ryu Jeung Kwon?

00:34:05.872 --> 00:34:08.641
Each painter has his or her own unique...

00:34:08.642 --> 00:34:10.576
style of painting and brushstrokes.

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:11.906
The same goes for us researchers.

00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:14.777
Each research leaves its own unique footprints. so we can figure it out.

00:34:16.081 --> 00:34:18.181
So if this is actually linked to Ryu Jeung Kwon.

00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:19.946
and if we manage to track him down.

00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:23.621
we'll find out more about Zi O's past. right?

00:34:23.622 --> 00:34:24.717
Yes. I think so.

00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:27.957
Okay. that's all I needed to know.

00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:31.357
I'll be off. then.

00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:33.366
Thank you for everything. Professor.

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:34.667
All right.

00:35:09.432 --> 00:35:10.536
I'm so bored.

00:35:11.771 --> 00:35:12.866
Stay focused.

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:15.107
How much longer are we going to stay here?

Until Z-0 shows up.

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:19.437
Sit straight.

00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:21.306
I don't want to.

00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:26.687
Feel the wind.

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.286
I told you to sit straight.

00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:36.757
Hard work is for fools.

00:35:37.631 --> 00:35:39.457
It doesn't look like he'll show up today.

00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:44.797
I saw your records.

00:35:46.271 --> 00:35:48.136
My ex is in the military police.

00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:49.837
I asked him to look you up.

00:35:52.012 --> 00:35:53.210
Got a death wish?

00:35:53.211 --> 00:35:54.377
So...

00:35:55.282 --> 00:35:56.846
you killed nine people?

00:36:13.831 --> 00:36:15.797
But didn't you do that drill hundreds of times?

00:36:17.671 --> 00:36:18.837
Stop.

00:36:19.072 --> 00:36:20.241
Unless you're an idiot. I'm sure...

00:36:20.242 --> 00:36:22.511
you could tell the difference between a flare and a grenade.

00:36:22.512 --> 00:36:24.011
I said. stop.

00:36:24.012 --> 00:36:25.176
Maybe...

00:36:25.912 --> 00:36:28.846
someone put explosives inside the flare?

00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:35.147
The same thing happened to me.

00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:37.987
During a bilateral drill.

00:36:38.722 --> 00:36:40.487
I swear. I only took blanks with me.

00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:19.361

00:37:45.492 --> 00:37:48.457
Only after five people died. I realized I had fired live ammo.

00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:51.960
I had checked dozens of times to make sure they were blanks.

00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:53.366
so how was that possible?

00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:56.400
We were never given any live ammo as it was just a drill.

00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:59.567
so how come my gun was loaded with live ammo?

00:38:02.872 --> 00:38:05.536
After I was sentenced to life. I tried...

00:38:06.512 --> 00:38:08.007
to kill myself twice.

00:38:09.081 --> 00:38:10.377
Why didn't you actually do it?

00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:13.386
Because someone came to see me.

00:38:15.921 --> 00:38:16.960
Who?

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.116
That I can't tell you.

00:38:19.322 --> 00:38:21.886
I promised that I won't tell anyone until the day I die.

00:38:23.631 --> 00:38:25.056
But that person told me...

00:38:26.362 --> 00:38:28.071
that I'd get a job...

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:30.737
and even a healthy leg if I obeyed.

00:39:06.612 --> 00:39:08.207
I suppose you and I...

00:39:08.271 --> 00:39:10.707
just happened to make a similar mistake.

00:39:11.811 --> 00:39:14.277

00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:17.547

00:39:36.271 --> 00:39:38.297
without even knowing why you have to kill them.

00:39:38.472 --> 00:39:39.636
Wait inside the car.

00:39:40.472 --> 00:39:41.837

00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:06.830
will you track me down and kill me?

Yes. obviously.

00:51:09.061 --> 00:51:10.926
What are you doing? Do it.

00:51:37.122 --> 00:51:38.516
Nice.

00:51:43.831 --> 00:51:46.826
With your superpower electricity and my quick speed...

00:51:47.302 --> 00:51:49.866
We were as good as a mid-sized company.

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:54.406
Where were you this time?

00:51:55.271 --> 00:51:57.576
- Were we... - Yes. we were bad people.

00:51:57.811 --> 00:52:00.737
You don't think you were a good person. do you?

00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:03.676
Look at you. pretending to be shocked again.

00:52:03.782 --> 00:52:06.246
Don't go anywhere anymore. Stay and run a business with me.

00:52:06.682 --> 00:52:08.190
If you need an ID or passport.

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.886
I'll make them for you.

00:52:09.992 --> 00:52:11.361
You make things like that too?

00:52:11.362 --> 00:52:14.487
Zi O. Who do you think made you your license?

00:52:16.392 --> 00:52:18.060
- By any chance... - By any chance what?

00:52:18.061 --> 00:52:19.926
Do I know the people who are hunting you?

00:52:19.961 --> 00:52:21.071
Yes.

00:52:21.072 --> 00:52:22.971
Hey. Are you sure you're being hunted?

00:52:22.972 --> 00:52:26.167
You always say that and that you can't stay for long.

00:52:27.041 --> 00:52:28.710
Who's after you?

00:52:28.711 --> 00:52:30.837
You say it isn't the police. I'm dying to know.

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:37.147
- Who am I? - Darn it.

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:39.750
Listen.

00:52:39.751 --> 00:52:44.116
Your terrible parents abandoned you as soon as you were born.

00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:46.917
That's why the orphanage registered your birth.

00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:51.326
Right. Remember those older boys that used to beat us up every day?

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:54.797
- No. - No. Of course not.

00:52:56.671 --> 00:53:00.040
Anyway. we got beat up like crazy that day too.

00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:01.440
Stop it!

00:53:01.441 --> 00:53:02.837
- Let's go. - Let go!

00:53:02.842 --> 00:53:04.111
Stop it!

00:53:04.112 --> 00:53:05.911
- Get over here! - Stop it!

00:53:05.912 --> 00:53:07.707
It hurts!

00:53:17.092 --> 00:53:19.190
But when I came to.

00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:21.591
the church was ablaze.

00:53:21.592 --> 00:53:24.297
I knew you'd burn it down one day.

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.600
Anyway. the sisters were going crazy.

00:53:26.601 --> 00:53:28.326
and you and I ran away.

00:53:29.771 --> 00:53:30.871
Listen.

00:53:30.872 --> 00:53:33.837
What could teenage boys do to survive?

00:53:34.142 --> 00:53:36.111
We got free food. begged.

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.576
stole. and mugged.

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:40.040
What's the conclusion?

00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:42.150
Stop asking who you are.

00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:43.746
and write this down.

00:53:45.651 --> 00:53:46.877
Conclusively.

00:53:49.452 --> 00:53:51.016
you and I are nothings.

00:53:53.862 --> 00:53:57.031
Why aren't you writing it down? Seriously.

00:53:57.032 --> 00:53:59.661
Hey. Let's just get a tattoo.

00:53:59.662 --> 00:54:02.496
"I am absolutely nothing." What do you say?

00:54:08.242 --> 00:54:11.237
Did I ever tell you what I did and where...

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:14.551
before I went to the orphanage?

00:54:14.552 --> 00:54:16.446
Like whom I lived with.

00:54:16.881 --> 00:54:19.417
- You did tell me one thing. - What?

00:54:20.322 --> 00:54:22.116
That you remembered nothing.

00:54:25.722 --> 00:54:29.556
Hey. You probably used electricity before you came to the orphanage.

00:54:29.961 --> 00:54:31.357
Darn it.

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:33.527
Hey.

00:54:35.601 --> 00:54:38.437
Don't go anywhere else. You'll just suffer.

00:54:38.702 --> 00:54:40.567
Stay here and work with me.

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:44.737
I'll get people to take out loans and you can collect.

00:54:44.941 --> 00:54:46.540
If anyone won't pay.

00:54:46.541 --> 00:54:48.846
just flash your blue eyes. and it's game over.

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:54.821
It's not hard to light up your eyes and get money.

00:54:54.822 --> 00:54:55.987
Am I right?

00:55:11.872 --> 00:55:13.341
We have to wait again?

00:55:13.342 --> 00:55:15.636
How do cops do stakeouts?

00:55:16.311 --> 00:55:17.877
They deserve a raise.

00:55:28.251 --> 00:55:30.020
Don't glare at me like that.

00:55:30.021 --> 00:55:31.357
Sit up.

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:32.957
Don't look if you don't want to.

00:56:37.598 --> 00:56:39.222
Don't kill me!

00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:40.926
Where's Zi O?

00:56:40.927 --> 00:56:43.097
I... I don't know! I really don't!

00:56:43.098 --> 00:56:44.437
You lived together.

00:56:44.438 --> 00:56:48.472
That's not true! He just bummed off of me!

00:56:49.438 --> 00:56:51.242
It's true! It is!

00:56:52.647 --> 00:56:53.776
It's true!

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:56.216
He bummed off of me. and then he left!

00:56:56.217 --> 00:56:57.787
I haven't heard from him since!

00:56:57.788 --> 00:57:00.013
I know nothing!

00:57:06.357 --> 00:57:08.292
No!

00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:12.566
I don't know anything.

00:57:12.567 --> 00:57:15.533
I don't know. you scumbag!

00:57:17.098 --> 00:57:20.233
I'm sorry. sir!

00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:24.432
Please don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:37.017
If Zi O calls or comes by...

00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:38.852
I'll... I'll let you know right away.

00:57:39.357 --> 00:57:41.892
I'll let you know right away.

00:57:42.558 --> 00:57:45.863
So please. sir...

00:57:48.237 --> 00:57:51.263
Good. Let me know right away.

00:57:52.138 --> 00:57:55.236
If you get tempted to change your mind. remember this sound.

00:57:55.237 --> 00:57:56.372
Yes. sir.

00:58:19.297 --> 00:58:21.363
- Talk. - It's me.

00:58:21.768 --> 00:58:23.066
What is it?

00:58:23.067 --> 00:58:25.437
Zi O is here.

00:58:25.438 --> 00:58:26.807
He's in my home.

00:58:26.808 --> 00:58:29.577
Keep him there. Do whatever it takes.

00:58:29.578 --> 00:58:30.673
Yes. sir.

00:58:32.147 --> 00:58:33.443
We found Z-0.

00:58:58.938 --> 00:59:00.363
I looked it over.

00:59:01.978 --> 00:59:04.503
This is why people aren't interested in science.

00:59:04.777 --> 00:59:06.102
It's all gibberish.

00:59:08.918 --> 00:59:10.113
Look.

00:59:10.447 --> 00:59:13.586
This is a DNA homology test.

00:59:13.587 --> 00:59:14.952
What's homology?

00:59:15.317 --> 00:59:20.526
It's the level of homogeneity of different cells.

00:59:20.527 --> 00:59:23.423
There are six different characteristics.

00:59:23.598 --> 00:59:24.892
What does that mean?

00:59:25.168 --> 00:59:29.963
There are at least six different sets of genes in the body.

00:59:30.138 --> 00:59:31.263
What?

00:59:32.337 --> 00:59:35.437
The biggest characteristic is that of a knifefish.

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:36.872
What's a knifefish?

00:59:38.478 --> 00:59:41.176
Simply put. it's like an electric eel.

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:44.343
But electric eels aren't eels. They're fish.

00:59:44.578 --> 00:59:48.617
Regardless. he has the DNA of electric eels mixed in. right?

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.812
That's not all.

00:59:51.487 --> 00:59:54.057
The immortal jellyfish. Sturgeon.

00:59:54.058 --> 00:59:57.452
A bat. Fruit fly. All of their characteristics are there.

00:59:58.268 --> 01:00:00.896
If all of them are combined.

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:03.193
one can emit and sense electricity.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:05.137
He'd have an insane recovery rate...

01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:07.062
and have superhuman reflexes.

01:00:08.107 --> 01:00:10.133
Is it possible to mix them?

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.673
It's unusual.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:15.812
it can be possible for someone who solves LUCA's secret.

01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:17.673
What's that?

01:00:18.817 --> 01:00:22.086
Where do you think life began?

01:00:22.087 --> 01:00:25.327
Me? My existence?

01:00:25.328 --> 01:00:26.582
Biologically.

01:00:27.027 --> 01:00:29.657
Well... My mom's womb.

01:00:29.658 --> 01:00:30.753
Right.

01:00:30.897 --> 01:00:33.066
The cells with different characteristics.

01:00:33.067 --> 01:00:35.832
a sperm and an egg. met to create you.

01:00:36.098 --> 01:00:38.506
There must be similarities for the genes...

01:00:38.507 --> 01:00:40.763
from both of them to mix.

01:00:41.877 --> 01:00:43.003
Sure.

01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:46.943
If you look there and follow your way up.

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:49.113
there's a cell that's common to everyone.

01:00:49.277 --> 01:00:50.513
That's LUCA.

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:53.042
Last universal common ancestor.

01:00:54.888 --> 01:00:56.053
Then...

01:00:56.688 --> 01:00:57.986
is it a mutation?

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.153
No.

01:01:00.127 --> 01:01:02.392
A mutation cannot be this elaborate.

01:01:02.927 --> 01:01:04.292
It was created.

01:01:04.967 --> 01:01:06.823
A life form that was created?

01:01:09.237 --> 01:01:10.792
Professor.

01:01:11.538 --> 01:01:13.533
Isn't that beyond the realm of humans?

01:01:13.538 --> 01:01:16.106
No. It was a technological intervention.

01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:17.702
Although it was banned...

01:01:22.348 --> 01:01:23.872
Is it Dr. Ryu Jeung Kwon?

01:01:24.317 --> 01:01:25.412
99 percent.

01:01:27.018 --> 01:01:30.452
He's the only one with the skills to merge DNA like this.

01:01:31.317 --> 01:01:33.522
And he's the only one this crazy.

01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:35.222
Then...

01:01:35.697 --> 01:01:37.557
do you think they're the ones...

01:01:37.558 --> 01:01:39.097
who hired those men that are after Zi O?

01:01:39.098 --> 01:01:40.696
I'm not sure.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.093
but I'll have to request a study from the academy.

01:01:43.268 --> 01:01:45.463
I have to see if my analysis is correct.

01:01:45.808 --> 01:01:46.963
Also...

01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:51.503
If you see him again.

01:01:52.248 --> 01:01:53.472
lock him up.

01:01:53.908 --> 01:01:56.173
- You must. - Why?

01:01:56.518 --> 01:01:57.972
I can tell you now for sure.

01:01:59.217 --> 01:02:00.312
He isn't human.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:17.693
What's going on?

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:31.113
Seriously.

01:02:31.817 --> 01:02:34.082
You came here again after being fooled twice?

01:02:49.897 --> 01:02:51.392
There's this abandoned dog.

01:02:51.438 --> 01:02:53.667
A rescue group tries to catch him.

01:02:53.668 --> 01:02:55.803
have him examined to see if he had any diseases.

01:02:55.978 --> 01:02:57.472
and feed him.

01:02:58.078 --> 01:02:59.403
But he doesn't realize that.

01:03:00.248 --> 01:03:03.312
He just keeps running away. Like you.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.483
I have no disease. and I eat just fine.

01:03:07.947 --> 01:03:09.787
The dog must think the same.

01:03:09.788 --> 01:03:11.823
Although the humans can tell he's wrong.

01:03:12.757 --> 01:03:14.483
- Let's go. - Don't give me that garbage.

01:05:37.297 --> 01:05:38.602
We lost.

01:05:39.507 --> 01:05:40.633
Although we did catch him.

01:06:04.098 --> 01:06:06.093
Go up and delete the cell phone history.

01:06:06.297 --> 01:06:08.093
Clean everything up.

01:06:53.508 --> 01:06:55.976
This is my research.

01:06:55.977 --> 01:06:58.412
It took me 30 years.

01:06:59.218 --> 01:07:01.886
I devoted my entire life to it. And the results...

01:07:01.887 --> 01:07:04.782
were submitted to the academy without my name.

01:07:06.158 --> 01:07:08.322
You should've stopped it.

01:07:08.828 --> 01:07:10.827
My life's work...

01:07:10.828 --> 01:07:13.196
was shared with the rats in the academy.

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:16.662
Those punks in the academy are all morons.

01:07:16.968 --> 01:07:18.332
Morons!

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.507
They are way beneath me!

01:07:21.508 --> 01:07:23.072
Who knows what they'll do?

01:07:23.307 --> 01:07:26.207
My research... My lifelong research!

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.247
What if those rats ruin it?

01:07:28.248 --> 01:07:31.713
This is like giving free licenses to use my patent.

01:07:31.887 --> 01:07:35.082
It's murder! This is how you kill a scientist!

01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:40.223
Why are you just sitting there?

01:07:40.328 --> 01:07:42.822
You couldn't have come this far without me.

01:07:43.197 --> 01:07:45.896
Z-0 is the conclusion of my research that cost...

01:07:45.897 --> 01:07:47.696
billions of dollars!

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:48.832
Z-0...

01:07:49.838 --> 01:07:53.066
is the one thing that proves my worth!

01:07:53.067 --> 01:07:54.732
Do you realize that?

01:07:57.878 --> 01:07:58.973
Are you done?

01:08:00.947 --> 01:08:03.013
Get out and fix this.

01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:06.313
Burn the server. do something.

01:08:06.987 --> 01:08:09.383
Delete all of my material now.

01:08:10.817 --> 01:08:12.853
You're not acting. are you?

01:08:13.288 --> 01:08:17.328
- What? - You're so passionate. It's weird.

01:08:17.328 --> 01:08:18.423
Hey!

01:08:19.597 --> 01:08:22.463
Your friend posted that. Oh Jong Hwan at NFS.

01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:26.603
I feel like you asked him for help.

01:08:27.208 --> 01:08:28.832
Crazy talk!

01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:31.207
I offered up my soul...

01:08:31.208 --> 01:08:32.747
for more funds for my research!

01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:35.042
Why would I share it with that stupid academy?

01:08:35.918 --> 01:08:37.013
Why else?

01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:39.547
Because you can't do it alone...

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:41.082
without Ha Young Jae.

01:08:41.418 --> 01:08:44.183
Maybe you asked for advice and received warnings too.

01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:47.853
It's like a form of cheating. Am I wrong?

01:08:49.328 --> 01:08:51.393
Of all the people to doubt...

01:08:53.368 --> 01:08:54.497
All that NFS got...

01:08:54.498 --> 01:08:57.292
was Z-0's blood sample from the hospital.

01:08:57.697 --> 01:08:59.232
But those documents...

01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:02.072
are analyses of his blood and epithelial tissue.

01:09:02.637 --> 01:09:05.902
biopsies of his liver and lungs. and even spinal fluid.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:10.013
Did Z-0 get a physical or something?

01:09:10.777 --> 01:09:11.942
No. he didn't.

01:09:14.088 --> 01:09:15.617
We have no choice...

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.952
but to deduce that you leaked them.

01:09:19.658 --> 01:09:22.152
So... Explain it to me.

01:09:22.328 --> 01:09:23.822
How did that happen?

01:09:24.697 --> 01:09:26.723
I never did such a thing.

01:09:27.868 --> 01:09:29.692
I wouldn't do that!

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:34.332
Is it a desire for fame?

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:36.133
Scientists tend to be like that.

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:40.273
"I pulled off this impossible feat."

01:09:40.748 --> 01:09:42.042
"Give me a Nobel Peace Prize."

01:09:42.618 --> 01:09:45.747
Isn't it your lifelong wish to be in the Hall of Fame?

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:46.883
No!

01:09:49.057 --> 01:09:50.213
It is not.

01:09:51.658 --> 01:09:53.723
I don't need things like that.

01:09:55.128 --> 01:09:58.093
You're not a scientist without it.

01:10:06.437 --> 01:10:08.003
I'll have the documents removed.

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:10.936
But until we figure out how they got out.

01:10:10.937 --> 01:10:13.442
I will not trust you.

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:16.572
Also.

01:10:17.548 --> 01:10:19.186
you're old enough.

01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:22.082
Don't lose your temper just because you're angry.

01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:24.753
You look uneducated.

01:10:57.788 --> 01:10:58.923
Hey.

01:11:02.527 --> 01:11:03.652
What?

01:11:04.998 --> 01:11:06.393
You got him?

01:11:07.527 --> 01:11:08.992
Let's do a video call.

01:11:16.607 --> 01:11:18.402
Come in right now.

01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:35.082
Where are we going?

01:11:37.258 --> 01:11:39.192
Where are we going?

01:12:12.527 --> 01:12:15.023
What are you doing? Stop it!

01:12:15.027 --> 01:12:17.837
Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this?

01:12:17.838 --> 01:12:20.933
Why are you doing this? Stop it! Please!

01:12:21.807 --> 01:12:23.173
Why...

01:12:25.777 --> 01:12:27.106
It's the child I mentioned.

01:12:27.107 --> 01:12:28.603
Are you sure you won't regret it?

01:12:29.418 --> 01:12:30.843
Please give me...

01:12:31.118 --> 01:12:34.643
enough money for my family to settle down in another country.

01:12:34.647 --> 01:12:37.152
Let's confirm what you say is correct first.

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:48.122
You said you were buying me a snack.

01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:50.593
You said we'd go on a picnic.

01:12:51.298 --> 01:12:54.232
You said you wouldn't give me any more shots!

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:56.732
No!

01:12:57.178 --> 01:12:59.803
Our people are with your wife now.

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:02.773
We have the money.

01:13:02.817 --> 01:13:05.042
If the information you gave us is correct.

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.912
we'll give it to your wife right away.

01:13:11.088 --> 01:13:13.023
Stop it. Stop it!

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.482
Stop it!

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.523
Stop it!

01:13:20.527 --> 01:13:23.593
Stop it!

01:13:50.798 --> 01:13:52.263
Why are you doing this to me?

01:13:53.628 --> 01:13:54.822
Who are you?

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:52.332
(L.U.C.A.: The Beginning)

01:16:52.378 --> 01:16:54.907
What I have isn't an ability. it's a curse.

01:16:54.908 --> 01:16:56.646
It'll be a whole new world.

01:16:56.647 --> 01:16:57.717
The case was closed.

01:16:57.718 --> 01:16:59.146
The prosecutor said...

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:01.242
He never should've come into this world.

01:17:01.418 --> 01:17:03.217
Did you lose all the documents?

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.912
What about what I had sent?

01:17:05.317 --> 01:17:06.683
Don't you feel disgraced?

01:17:06.727 --> 01:17:08.322
Yes. but that's the rule.

01:17:10.758 --> 01:17:12.192
I won't run away anymore.

01:17:12.968 --> 01:17:15.023
If you want me. come at me.

01:17:16.197 --> 01:17:19.232
Don't leave me until I say so.

01:17:19.408 --> 01:17:20.503
Ever.
