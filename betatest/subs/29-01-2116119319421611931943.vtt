00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.553
Mother

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.725
'Appa...!'

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.362
'Let's kill this boy also. partner'

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.448
If we burn all the evidence
we will be the prime suspects

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.700
'We need a witness
to speak in our favor'

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.077
All that is fine

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.705
Just like his father. what if he also
makes trouble insisting on being truthful?

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.541
Let's find out right away

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.876
Hey boy
What's your name?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.920
- Bhavani
- Huh?

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:51.922
Bhavani

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:53.549
How did your parents die?

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.637
They were burnt to death
in a gas explosion

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.138
[loud laughter]

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.351
He sure knows to survive. I say

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:05.978
After we use him as a witness

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.730
...let us complain against him
for stealing our union funds

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.399
'His father is Lorry Union leader'

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.110
If we claim his son stole union cash
will anyone believe that story?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.070
Sudden show of mercy. huh?

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:17.030
He's so young. that's why

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.032
Hey boy. listen

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.911
I'll send you to a place where boys
like you are well looked after

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.913
Will you go there?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.960
'Govt Juvenile Observation Home
Nagercoil. Kallakurichi'

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.882
'That boy shouldn't sleep
even one night in peace'

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:37.009
I've given you more than
what you asked

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.135
Thank you. brother

00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:41.555
If there's any kind of foul play
Esakki will hunt you down and kill you

00:03:41.597 --> 00:03:43.056
- Keep an eye
- I'll take care. bro

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.564
'Hey! Come'

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:52.900
'What are you glaring at him for?'

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.781
Hey! You want the luxury of sleep. huh?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.704
What are you looking at?

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.080
Wipe it

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.415
Wipe my boots

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.002
Pickle you to pieces. rascal!

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.382
'All of you. move aside'

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.550
'Bro!'

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:24.014
Die!

00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:32.689
Hey you! Can't hit you more than this

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:34.316
Standing

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.151
Standing so still
least bit affected!

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.862
You are hitting me mercilessly
because someone is paying you

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:42.032
I have to pay you much more
to make you stop hitting me

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.868
I am penniless
Hit me all you want

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.578
When I have the money

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.746
I'll call you then

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.507
[phone ringing]

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.763
- Who is this?
- 'Brother'

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.765
'That boy Bhavani has escaped from jail'

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.934
Scumbag! Is this why
I'm spending so lavishly?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.896
I'll deal with you in person
Find him before daybreak

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.190
Scumbag!

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.414
'Don't worry. Brother'

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.915
I won't harm you

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:35.335
'If I had wanted to. I could have easily
slit your neck when you were asleep'

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:38.714
But I can't be on the run
throughout my life

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.175
I came here to request you
to let me lead a normal life

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.384
I don't understand

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.513
Let me live my own life

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.891
What do I gain by releasing you. huh?

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.976
Give me a chance
for just this 1 week

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.854
I'll give you half of
what I earn this week

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:55.731
'Whichever week I don't pay you'

00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:57.816
...stab me on that same day
at that same spot

00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.985
Fine. I'll take a chance on you

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.321
This week is yours. go

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.744
How much do you usually pay for a lorry
to cross the check post without a permit?

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.496
Only if you cough up Rs 1000 per lorry
you'll be allowed to pass

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.290
I'll get the permit slip

00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:15.000
Rs 1000 is yours to keep

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.793
I want Rs 100 per lorry

00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:18.837
If the policemen hassle us?

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.425
That's my responsibility

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.187
What. I say?
What do you want?

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.077
'2002-2003
Register'

00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:00.295
Go...go

00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:03.757
Move...move

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.592
Come. quick

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.094
Hey! Wait...wait

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:08.887
Hurry up

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.520
If you want the permit slip in your hand

00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:18.689
I must get Rs 500 per lorry

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.733
Got it?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.591
Whether I'm here or not

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.177
...ensure the boys get
their share of booze and fag

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.516
'Govt Reformatory'

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.589
In a way. only we are
responsible for all this. partner

00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:28.800
When we killed his father
we should have burnt him to ashes too

00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:34.431
Now he has the gall to contest as head
in the Lorry Drivers' Union Election

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.518
How did he amass
this much wealth. bro?

00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:42.189
Logu. do you know how many
lorries run under his control?

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:45.150
On top of it. he owns a meat factory

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.610
He is into exports too

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.571
All this is common news. partner

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.074
These boys in the reformatory
for juvenile delinquents

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.910
'He uses them to do something
That's where the money flows in'

00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:57.788
Some even say he plays proxy
to a minister to launder his money

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.083
If he wins this year's Union election

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.045
...he will stoop to any level
to avenge his father's murder

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:08.173
Doesn't make sense to spare him
beyond this stage. partner

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.145
Talk of the devil!

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.438
Close his chapter

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.963
Hello. my dear boy
Hindu. Muslim. Christian

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:50.424
You seem to have the charms
of all the Gods around your neck

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:51.967
Each sect endorses
a particular God

00:09:52.301 --> 00:09:54.178
One God will save me
when I'm in danger

00:09:54.303 --> 00:09:55.596
Minimum guarantee

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:56.722
Philosophy?

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:01.894
Is this the same chap who pleaded
when he was 17 to spare his life?

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.690
We need to discuss something
very important with you

00:10:06.732 --> 00:10:08.901
You were paying us
on a weekly basis all these years

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.360
You can stop it

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.447
Instead you can sell all your assets

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.657
'Go and earn a living
somewhere outside India'

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.076
I felt the same and
wanted to tell you next week

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.703
'For how long?
That too every week'

00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:21.955
How can I pay tax to you
to ensure my life is not at risk?

00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:23.749
That's why I've decided
to stop payment

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:28.587
That decision isn't
yours to take. scumbag!

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.631
'Just zip your lips
and obey our orders'

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.466
I will do only what I feel is right

00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:33.675
Hey...dai!

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.094
I am well aware of
how dirty your hands are

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.931
Making those boys surrender
for the crimes you commit

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.600
'Instigating them to kill
We know about all your offenses'

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:44.144
Don't show off your temerity
Just tuck your tail and scoot

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.064
Otherwise you will meet your death
in our hands. watch it

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.107
[mocking laughter]

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.360
[imitating laughter]

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.612
Look around you
This is my area

00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:54.821
'If I set my heart on it'

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.490
Only your lorry will move from here

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:57.658
Not you

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:01.787
I think you are unable to differentiate
working for money and for gratitude?

00:11:01.954 --> 00:11:03.622
Shall I show you a sample?

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.753
Listen! We have an important
work to do. come here

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.506
'He is calling us. come'

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.926
- 'Bhavani. da
- Why is he calling us suddenly?'

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:22.391
Whoever kills these 3 men
in this spot will be rewarded

00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:23.934
With a prize money

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:26.854
2 million

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.647
[burst of amused laughter]

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:33.861
'Do you realize where you are
and what you are blabbering?'

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:35.737
You think I work for brother
with money as motive?

00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:37.281
We go back a long way. da

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.366
- 3 million
- If you raise it 50%?

00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:41.410
- 'He is like my own brother'
- 4 million

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.704
Why are you keeping quiet
when he's so arrogant. bro?

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:44.872
Just say 'yes'
I'll kill him-

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:45.998
5 million!

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.918
- How dare you rattle off?
- 6 million

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.503
Hey! Kill him now

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:53.839
Wait...let us hear our brother out!!

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.091
7 million

00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:57.843
Wait...wait. bro

00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:00.804
I'll go up to the gate and
make sure no one enters this area

00:12:00.846 --> 00:12:02.639
- 8 million
- What?

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.807
Move aside

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:09.354
Then shall we lock
the deal for 8 million?

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.647
- Okay. bro
- Are you ready?

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:13.066
We will divide 8 million equally
I'll deal with these 3 men

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.366
Now do you know the difference
between greed and gratitude?

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.369
Bro. chopper

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.127
I don't need this

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:33.879
I'll give you 2 minutes

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:35.422
Kill me if you can

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:38.926
And save yourself

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.318
Hey!

00:12:58.695 --> 00:12:59.905
Hey!

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.315
These boys?

00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:36.817
Yes. sir

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.696
Post mortem matches the crime scene?

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.281
They have done a neat job. sir

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.825
Not knowing to drive
they ran over a man

00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:46.285
You expect me to buy this?

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.911
'Whom are you trying to trick?'

00:13:47.953 --> 00:13:49.913
Sir. I'm not a professional driver

00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:52.124
I thought I'll try my hand
But turned out fatal

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.542
- Right?
- Yes. sir

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.171
- 'Do they have a past history?'
- Yes. sir

00:13:57.296 --> 00:13:58.755
Pickpocket case. 511

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.133
Then 6 months they were in
a Govt reformatory

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.427
Now they are in IPC 302
Punished for murder

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.678
Is this a reformatory?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.430
Or a criminal training center?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.766
Why do you need this reformatory
that turns a thief into a murderer?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.436
- Call the Observation home staff
- Okay. sir

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.354
Sir. he's calling you

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:18.150
Good afternoon. sir
I am the superintendent here

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.111
Forget the introduction. when do you
intend employing a regular master?

00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:24.072
The boys drive away
any master we appoint

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.617
Actually scared of them.
no teacher wants to take up this post

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.118
But how can you run a school?

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.953
'Not one teacher so far. huh?'

00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:32.122
Shocking and shameful!

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:36.418
If there's no master to teach
or guide the students

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.337
'...how will they reform. huh?'

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.548
'I have personally seen

and colleges. to every single institution'

Changes will happen faster"

"His entry spells power"

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.829
"Who is our master?
Commander...!"

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.832
'St Jeffery College is a truly renowned
educational institution in Chennai'

'Alumni of this college

'In cinema. politics. advertising and
are celebrities in their own might'

00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:24.424
This college has molded innumerable VIPs

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:30.138
'Students are very eager to make this
a very memorable reunion'

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:32.474
Do you want to know why?
Come along with me

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:36.728
Hi...Ramya

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.730
- Hi. nice to meet you
- Same here

00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:40.440
I've spoken to you over the phone

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.650
- Oh! That was you?
- Yeah

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.818
Okay...okay

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.070
- What's your full name?
- Charulatha Prasad

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.573
Come. let me introduce you to everyone

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.617
- This college has a decorum
- Students are capable of doing it

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:53.745
Their plan is to ruin our image when
the minister arrives as our chief guest

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:56.331
'If this issue leaks.
your college reputation is at stake'

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.500
You want to take further action

00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:00.752
- Do so after the minister leaves
- This is well planned

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.713
'Sri. stop this cat & mouse game'

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:05.132
- You had better confess the truth
- Trust me. sir

00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:06.925
- Isn't JD responsible?
- No. sir

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.135
I swear. no. sir

00:16:08.177 --> 00:16:10.596
Then who is the culprit?
Your father...?

00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:12.764
Everyone knows about Savitha's trauma

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.850
I know how those 2 scumbags
sexually harassed her-

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.143
Hey! Mind your words

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:17.603
Spit that gum first

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.814
I said throw it out

00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:22.608
I'll trash it as soon as
it loses its sweetness

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.901
Don't act smart

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.153
The two noble souls
who sexually harassed her

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.863
You suspended them for 1 week

00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:30.407
Knowing it was inadequate
we even complained to the police

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:32.826
But they took us for a ride
without taking any action

00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:35.078
Only then we knew Aadith's dad
is a rich businessman

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.497
I think he has planned
to send them off to Canada

00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:39.416
That's why I took the boys

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:41.168
'...to his house
to find out his plan'

00:16:43.462 --> 00:16:45.714
'Hello. sir. they haven't
left the house as yet'

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:47.007
'I think they are still inside'

00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:49.718
'But it's evident they have
hatched a plot to escape'

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.471
'Strangers keep walking in to their house'

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.806
'Sir. I can hear their voices
I think they are coming out'

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.433
- 'Take care. son
- Don't worry. pa'

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:58.852
- Be safe
- I'll call as soon as I reach

00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:00.354
'This is the duo'

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:01.605
'Call after you reach the airport'

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:02.856
Go...go...go

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:04.816
Let's follow them

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.946
Both of them have left home. sir

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.406
Aadith and Rahul are in a taxi
They just crossed Ashok Nagar

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.700
'Along with our boys
I am following them. sir'

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.327
- Where are you. bro?
- 'At a signal'

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.579
- Which signal?
- Jafferkhanpet

00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:18.747
Ask him the bus number

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.332
- Which bus?
- '70 V'

00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:21.375
Bus number. bro?

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.751
70. V

00:17:22.793 --> 00:17:24.753

Waiting at the signal now

00:17:24.795 --> 00:17:26.088

'Bus number TN 01 AN 1184'

00:17:40.853 --> 00:17:43.146
'Bus has crossed
Jafferkhanpet signa-'

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.315
Why did he cut my call?

00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:50.153

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.447

Shut up. da
Vanathi. didn't you try?

- What did they say?
- He has been suspended

00:24:28.302 --> 00:24:31.305
If you had told us earlier. we could
have gone in person and brought him

00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:33.223
He must be very busy. try again

If that student is such a troublemaker

00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.621
...why not just dismiss him?

00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:58.582
Then he should have
got dismissed 20 years ago!

00:25:15.724 --> 00:25:16.767
'What happened?'

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.908
Sir. students are refusing
to come from the back stage

00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:34.284
Hey!

00:25:34.493 --> 00:25:36.203
It seems you said this function
won't go on without JD?

00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:38.622
Then what. sir? We kept
telling you he is not to blame

00:25:38.664 --> 00:25:40.123
'You've suspended him for 2 weeks'

00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:42.626
Any other day it's fine. sir
This alumni meet is only for him

00:25:42.668 --> 00:25:45.212
How can he not be here. sir?
Nothing will happen without him

00:25:45.254 --> 00:25:47.172
Are you the human rights activist?

00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:50.050
Just you wait!

00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.511
Sir. the minister has been
waiting for a long time

00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:54.847
- Please bear with us
- He cancelled so many appointments

00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:57.599
- Start the program
- I'll talk to them and join you

00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:03.772
Om Shanti! Om Shanti!
Peace in speech and spirit

00:26:03.814 --> 00:26:06.024
- Call JD
- You suspended him and asking me to call?

00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:08.277
- You call him
- I don't know his number

00:26:08.318 --> 00:26:09.319
Call him. dude

00:26:09.361 --> 00:26:10.988
Call before he changes his mind

00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.741
[humming a song]

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.119
[mobile ringing]

00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:20.247
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

00:26:20.539 --> 00:26:22.624
Hello...huh...JD

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.544
This is Principal...Samuel here

00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:27.087
JD sir is fast asleep

00:26:27.129 --> 00:26:28.130
Call later

00:26:28.172 --> 00:26:29.506
Principal Anbiah Samuel

00:26:29.548 --> 00:26:32.551
Anbu. your name can mean love but
he won't get up to hear your loving words

00:26:32.593 --> 00:26:34.970
- Guzzled down 3 or 4 bottles
- 'Can you wake him up or not?'

00:26:35.012 --> 00:26:37.014
Huh...? No chance. love

00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:41.643
Hey!

00:26:41.894 --> 00:26:43.020
He's drunk

00:26:44.062 --> 00:26:45.063
What can I do?

00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:47.816
Will you ask your Education Minister
to wait for half an hour?

00:26:47.858 --> 00:26:49.109
We'll go and get him

00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:51.028
- What?
- Do it

00:26:55.657 --> 00:26:57.492
- What. da?
- Not budging an inch

00:27:02.623 --> 00:27:03.957
Is this how you drum-roll?

00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:05.918
Getting paid right?
Bump it. fellows

00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:11.965
Rock & roll. man

00:27:12.007 --> 00:27:13.800
This is it
This is what we want

00:27:13.842 --> 00:27:15.677
Ready. da
Come on. da

00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.638
"Master is coming. move aside"

00:27:22.643 --> 00:27:24.144
Hey stop...stop

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.647
Lift him

00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:29.733
Heave-ho!

00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:48.043
Speed up!!

00:27:54.967 --> 00:27:56.927
- Sir. good morning
- Good morning

00:27:56.969 --> 00:27:58.095
Tea. sir

00:28:09.231 --> 00:28:11.775
"The moment our bro steps in
it's like an atom bomb exploding"

00:28:19.074 --> 00:28:21.910
- Did they really invite me?
- Sir. why this doubt?

00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:23.537
'I swear they asked you to come'

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.790
Bro. beat the drum

00:28:37.634 --> 00:28:38.927
"Master coming!"

00:28:38.969 --> 00:28:39.970
'Move aside!'

00:28:44.349 --> 00:28:45.851
'Rock & roll!'

00:28:51.106 --> 00:28:54.067
"Deliberately if you make trouble"

00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:56.778
"It will boomerang on you centuple"

00:28:56.945 --> 00:28:59.656
"If you jeer or sneer at us"

00:28:59.698 --> 00:29:02.451
"Mind you. you'll be limbless"

00:29:04.828 --> 00:29:05.871
'Zazzorific!'

00:29:07.623 --> 00:29:08.832
Aiyo!

00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:14.338
"Tell topsy turvy
Yell curvy scurvy"

00:29:24.348 --> 00:29:26.099
"Rock & roll
Heart & soul"

00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:37.819
"Split their ears. no matter
Scare them to scatter"

00:29:48.747 --> 00:29:49.790
'Move aside'

00:30:04.847 --> 00:30:05.973
Aiyo!

00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:36.336
"The second our bro steps in
it's like an atom bomb exploding"

00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:52.561
"Hit the drum harder
Scare them to scatter"

00:31:02.154 --> 00:31:04.031
"Master. coming"

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:06.867
Bent double. sir?

00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:08.535
- Where is the ID card?
- I have it. sir

00:31:08.577 --> 00:31:10.287
- First wear it and go inside
- Done

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:20.839
'We are all soaked in celebration mode'

00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:24.551
Let's go

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.222
Hey. JD. come.

00:31:28.388 --> 00:31:30.807
- 'Sit with us. JD'
- Is he a professor?

00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:32.267
Suspended professor

00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:33.602
'What is his name?'

00:31:33.644 --> 00:31:34.728
'JD'

00:31:36.104 --> 00:31:37.147
Start the program

00:31:37.231 --> 00:31:38.774
Sir. 1 minute
Let me speak

00:31:38.815 --> 00:31:39.816
Sir-

00:31:40.108 --> 00:31:41.777
'Wait. child'

00:31:43.237 --> 00:31:44.321
- JD
-'I've attended many college functions'

00:31:44.363 --> 00:31:46.532
- Wear your ID card
- 'Witnessed many gatherings'

00:31:46.657 --> 00:31:48.867
'But I've never seen a crowd like this'

00:31:49.326 --> 00:31:51.328
Because the entire crowd here

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.622
More than the anchor of the show

00:31:53.664 --> 00:31:55.582
'They are celebrating
the man seated below'

00:31:55.624 --> 00:31:57.125
'It is no mean achievement'

00:31:57.167 --> 00:31:59.837
'If he is getting this kind of
reception among students'

00:31:59.878 --> 00:32:03.090
'Then he must be a dedicated
and focused professor'

00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:04.508
'If he himself is like this...'

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.677
- 'Imagine his students'
- Why try all these gimmicks?

00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:07.928
'Must be good as gold'

00:32:08.762 --> 00:32:10.973
'First give this man
a big round of applause'

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.268
To get a professor like him

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.478
You and your college
must be truly blessed

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.896
Your eyes are red
Wear this shade

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.815
'This most revered master'

00:32:19.857 --> 00:32:22.943
'I would like him to come up
to the dais and say a few words'

00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:25.279
'I am calling you. sir'

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.321
Please come

00:32:27.948 --> 00:32:29.324
Come up and speak

00:32:29.867 --> 00:32:31.785
Hey...! Where are you going?

00:32:31.827 --> 00:32:33.787
Wait. let me tell a mini story

00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:35.205
Did you look at your shoes?

00:32:35.998 --> 00:32:37.749
Instead of being humiliated. sit down

00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:39.251
If you get up once more-D

00:32:39.293 --> 00:32:41.170
Please take your seat

00:32:43.088 --> 00:32:44.131
JD is our-

00:32:45.507 --> 00:32:48.635
Management and staff
are completely against JD

00:32:48.927 --> 00:32:50.804
But students celebrate him

00:32:51.513 --> 00:32:52.598
I don't get this

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.309
He has gone out of his way
for students' welfare

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.102
Students revere him as their true hero

00:32:57.144 --> 00:32:59.146
Reason enough for
the management to dislike him

00:32:59.229 --> 00:33:01.815
Secondly after 6:00 p.m
our hero will be totally sloshed!

00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:33.680
[indistinct]

00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:35.557
Good morning. sir

00:33:43.023 --> 00:33:44.024
Careful. sir

00:33:47.819 --> 00:33:49.196
t- Sorry...sorry
- It's okay

00:33:51.823 --> 00:33:52.908
Hi...hi

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.493
Your classroom is at that end

00:33:54.535 --> 00:33:55.994
Oh! Good morning

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:58.914
'What is his flashback sob story
to get sloshed every day?'

00:33:58.956 --> 00:33:59.957
Don't ask him that alone

00:33:59.998 --> 00:34:03.210
If he gets a gullible idiot. he'll reel off
a Mani Ratnam classic as his own!

00:34:03.252 --> 00:34:05.921
Fell head over heels. chased her
in the college. bus. everywhere

00:34:05.963 --> 00:34:10.175
She also reciprocated and one day
we were happily sitting in a coffee shop

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:11.301
Her father walked in!

00:34:11.343 --> 00:34:13.679
- Aiyo! Did you get caught?
- Wait. sister

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.930
Her father's name

00:34:14.972 --> 00:34:16.265
Mr Chandramouli!

00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:18.058
We were both neighbors
in Rainbow Colony

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.060
I was in 8G
She was in 7G

00:34:20.102 --> 00:34:21.270
India is here

00:34:21.979 --> 00:34:23.772
America is right here

00:34:23.814 --> 00:34:27.568
I took my guitar and left. my love for
Anjalai was as strong as 1000 elephants!

00:34:27.609 --> 00:34:29.695
We climbed up straight to
the top of the mountain

00:34:29.736 --> 00:34:32.155
We decided to jump
counting 1 to 5

00:34:32.197 --> 00:34:34.616
My bad luck. I got stuck
in a tree and escaped death

00:34:34.658 --> 00:34:35.951
What. da?

00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:38.161
Her head hit a boulder and she died

00:34:38.203 --> 00:34:40.330
- That's a Kamal classic...don't bug me
- Hey...listen

00:34:40.497 --> 00:34:41.957
Too much filmy imagination

00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:44.293
Okay. which department is he in?

00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:47.254
He studied in this same college
He finished M.Phil Psychology here

00:34:47.296 --> 00:34:49.715
'Now he teaches
Personality Development'

00:34:49.756 --> 00:34:51.884
May I request you all to please stand up?

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.721
I said...stand...up

00:34:55.762 --> 00:34:59.057
Now I intend checking
if your mind and body are focused

00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:00.517
We are hearing

00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:02.853
But not listening

00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:06.231
Students don't listen to their teachers
Teachers don't listen to their students

00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:07.274
Now

00:35:07.316 --> 00:35:08.525
RUN

00:35:08.942 --> 00:35:10.652
Run...run...run

00:35:10.694 --> 00:35:11.737
WATER!

00:35:12.988 --> 00:35:14.198
Electricity...!

00:35:16.074 --> 00:35:20.078
Children don't listen to their parents
Parents don't listen to their children

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.288
And finally

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.540
The ____ doesn't listen to the people!

00:35:23.582 --> 00:35:26.460
Whatever I tell you now
repeat it verbatim

00:35:26.502 --> 00:35:27.503
But

00:35:27.961 --> 00:35:29.296
Do just the opposite

00:35:29.338 --> 00:35:30.756
Jump in

00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:32.633
Jump left

00:35:32.674 --> 00:35:34.635
Jump right
Dai...dai...!

00:35:34.676 --> 00:35:35.969
Now on the starboard

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.013
Faster...faster...faster

00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:40.474
Now close your bloody eyes and freeze

00:35:46.271 --> 00:35:47.731
Class disperse

00:35:49.316 --> 00:35:50.692
Getting late for my class

00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:52.528
- We'll meet at lunch
- Okay. sure

00:35:57.824 --> 00:35:59.159
'Let me repeat this'

00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:01.620
That bloody Bhavani is
responsible for all this

00:36:01.662 --> 00:36:04.957
He finished off his opponents contesting
in our Union election one by one

00:36:04.998 --> 00:36:06.917
I know his history A to Z

00:36:06.959 --> 00:36:10.212
Gurumurthy. whether these people
understand it or not. hope you do

00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:13.006
I have been saying this
right from the beginning

00:36:13.048 --> 00:36:14.091
Who endorsed my view?

00:36:14.132 --> 00:36:16.718
With the help of juveniles
he is into all criminal activities

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.970
Has the cat got your tongue?!

00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:20.597
- Tell them
- Yov! We know this alread-

00:36:32.276 --> 00:36:33.277
Hello. brother

00:36:34.528 --> 00:36:35.821
Damn you!

00:36:36.029 --> 00:36:38.198
Are you such a big shot. huh?

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.535
If you kill him. will you get his post?

00:36:41.577 --> 00:36:43.328
- Let me see
- No. bro

00:36:43.453 --> 00:36:45.747
Why are you so mad at me?
I'm like a brother to you

00:36:45.789 --> 00:36:47.040
Whatever it is
let's talk it over

00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:48.917
Any need for me to talk to you?

00:36:48.959 --> 00:36:50.085
I'll close your chapter!

00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:51.170
Get the car ready

00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:53.213
Bro. will a problem
be solved if we fight?

00:36:53.255 --> 00:36:55.632
Will murder solve the problem?
Let's discuss it amicably

00:36:55.674 --> 00:36:59.136
I'll use the same juvenile delinquents
you use as tool to finish you off!

00:36:59.178 --> 00:37:00.179
Want to wait and watch?

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.055
I'm like one of them
You watched me grow

00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:04.016
- Wait. bro
- You peed in your pants scared of me

00:37:04.057 --> 00:37:05.559
You think you're my equal now?

00:37:05.601 --> 00:37:07.311
Whatever it is. let's talk it over

00:37:07.311 --> 00:37:09.646
I am much younger than you
But pay heed to my words

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.814
Don't go. br-

00:37:11.523 --> 00:37:12.649
'Oh my God!'

00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:14.026
Gone. brother?

00:37:14.067 --> 00:37:16.069
Catch that lorry driver

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.076
So sad

00:37:23.118 --> 00:37:24.244
You were eye witnesses

00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:25.704
What did I do?

00:37:25.746 --> 00:37:28.248
If I had walked out talking to him
I would've shared his fate

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.209
Impossible for a human
to time this so perfectly

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.002
I pray to all Gods thrice daily

00:37:32.044 --> 00:37:33.962
So God has saved me
and punished him

00:37:34.338 --> 00:37:35.714
'He was a good soul!'

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.928
To conduct Students' election
in our college this year

00:37:41.094 --> 00:37:45.891
University Grants Commission has granted
permission. but I opposed it strictly

00:37:45.933 --> 00:37:50.270
That's why for a mere formality
I need all your opinions

00:37:50.854 --> 00:37:52.773
Why we don't want election

00:37:52.814 --> 00:37:54.107
For the records

00:37:54.733 --> 00:37:56.610
I somehow feel it is unnecessary. sir

00:37:56.652 --> 00:37:57.861
'Semester is fast approaching'

00:37:57.903 --> 00:37:59.988
'In the current scenario
why do we need an election?'

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.407
'Sir. if this is happening
some other issues will create'

00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:04.868
r- I don't think they are fit for elections
- Exactly

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.662
'In my honest opinion. no'

00:38:06.745 --> 00:38:09.081
'I have no issues with
the day college students'

00:38:09.248 --> 00:38:11.333
'I am a little apprehensive
about the evening batch'

00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:12.668
Thanks. Ramya

00:38:12.709 --> 00:38:13.752
Charulatha. your opinion?

00:38:13.794 --> 00:38:16.922
It's only been 2 weeks
since I joined. sir

00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:19.675
So if I voice my opinion
I don't know if it will be right

00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:21.301
Come on. what's there?

00:38:22.427 --> 00:38:23.512
- No. sir
- Hey!

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.014
- Why is JD sir keeping quiet?
- That's right?

00:38:26.056 --> 00:38:28.976
- He'll wait to get a good point
- 'I don't think election is a good idea'

00:38:29.017 --> 00:38:32.020
Sir. to be on the safe side
ask JD his opinion

00:38:35.399 --> 00:38:37.651
'JD. tell us your opinion'

00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:44.825
What is your opinion. JD?

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:47.077
- What day was yesterday?
- Thursday

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.662
Thursday is his day off. da

00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:50.747
- 'Professor JD'
- He would have been piss drunk

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:53.250
- Come...come
- Hey! Careful

00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:55.043
JD...?

00:38:56.712 --> 00:38:58.213
SIR!

00:38:58.255 --> 00:38:59.423
Emergency. sir

00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:00.507
What are you doing here?

00:39:00.549 --> 00:39:02.509
Let me give this phone to Rosie madam

00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:04.344
Her husband fell off his bike

00:39:04.386 --> 00:39:05.637
'What the hell are you doing?'

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:06.763
I will expel you

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:09.391
- Let her just talk to him
- What happened. Abdul?

00:39:09.433 --> 00:39:10.434
'Wake up. sir'

00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:11.977
Don't switch off your phone

00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:13.103
Talk to him

00:39:13.145 --> 00:39:14.688
- Poor husband
- 1 minute. sir

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.065
They are objecting to elections
Support us. sir

00:39:17.608 --> 00:39:18.692
- Sorry. sir
- Get out

00:39:18.734 --> 00:39:20.110
- Useless fellow!
- Thank you. sir

00:39:21.737 --> 00:39:24.072
JD. what is your opinion
about conducting elections?

00:39:24.114 --> 00:39:26.575
Election is essential. that's all

00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:29.995
- I thought as much
- 'He will say something meaningless. sir'

00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:33.832
If we announce a students' election
all of them will be thinking of only that

00:39:33.874 --> 00:39:36.668
Not one of them will study
nor will anyone attend any class

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.005
Correct. what will they learn
by conducting students' election?

00:39:40.714 --> 00:39:42.508
Why encourage politics in college?

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.301
Matthew sir

00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:46.428
What is 'politics'. sir?

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.388
Sir. I don't wish to talk to you

00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:50.390
Is that so?
But I wish to speak

00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:51.433
I'm coming

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.604
Sir

00:39:56.355 --> 00:39:59.066
First a student should know
'politics' means service

00:39:59.107 --> 00:40:02.778
Only if our students learn about election.
canvassing. leadership in college

00:40:02.819 --> 00:40:05.864
...they will have an awareness about
state. central elections for the future

00:40:05.906 --> 00:40:08.700
College students are our first time voters

00:40:09.117 --> 00:40:10.536
Only if (s)he is allowed to think

00:40:10.577 --> 00:40:12.538
A new leader will emerge
for the next generation

00:40:12.746 --> 00:40:15.415
To mould as a good leader
or to choose the right leader

00:40:15.499 --> 00:40:17.668
...they will acquire
both tact and discretion

00:40:17.709 --> 00:40:18.794
For someone to-

00:40:19.253 --> 00:40:21.880
They will stick posters all over
and spoil the walls with graffiti

00:40:21.922 --> 00:40:23.841
Then claim ownership
over the walls and fight

00:40:23.882 --> 00:40:25.926
Doesn't all this happen
in normal elections?

00:40:25.968 --> 00:40:26.969
Sit down. sir

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.806
Aren't these normal issues
that crop up in general elections?

00:40:30.848 --> 00:40:33.308
So can we decide to
abolish elections in our country?

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.520
We have grown up with this culture of
poster. banner. fanfare. still follow it

00:40:36.728 --> 00:40:40.232
If students should know
the do's and don'ts of poster etc

00:40:40.274 --> 00:40:42.401
...we must conduct
elections in college

00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:44.111
Only then he will be
a good example outside

00:40:44.152 --> 00:40:48.448
'If our culture of bribing with 'biriyani'
booze and big bucks should change'

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.784
...students should know
the ins and outs of politics

00:40:50.826 --> 00:40:51.827
Okay

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:53.871
Let's assume what you're saying is right

00:40:53.871 --> 00:40:58.792
Who is responsible if students resort
to violence or damage college property?

00:40:58.834 --> 00:41:00.919
Sir. nothing of that sort will happen

00:41:00.961 --> 00:41:03.463
If you are proved wrong
will you leave this college?

00:41:03.797 --> 00:41:05.716
Will you resign. huh?

00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:07.801
We'll see if it happens

00:41:07.843 --> 00:41:10.095
Then you be the presiding officer

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.680
And conduct this election

00:41:12.097 --> 00:41:14.057
If any problem crops up

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:16.393
Sign an affidavit
you will leave this college

00:41:22.608 --> 00:41:25.652
Coming June 25th
Students' elections

00:41:25.694 --> 00:41:27.404
[loud cheering]

00:41:29.406 --> 00:41:32.117
I haven't seen him conduct
an election as a master

00:41:32.242 --> 00:41:34.995
'But I've seen him
do the same as a student'

00:41:39.541 --> 00:41:40.584
Pccht!

00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:45.547
Shake your hands

00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:53.055
This is the wall of democracy

00:41:53.096 --> 00:41:54.890
Your rules & regulations

00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:01.063
'Gym facilities free for all students'

00:42:01.104 --> 00:42:03.524
'Meat will be served for all in the hostel'

00:42:03.732 --> 00:42:05.901
'Good orators have become able leaders'

00:42:05.943 --> 00:42:07.611
You should speak up more boldly. Savi

00:42:07.653 --> 00:42:09.988
'Instead of finding faults
with your rival and campaigning'

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.823
'...ask for votes
listing your reforms'

00:42:12.908 --> 00:42:15.410
Tear every single poster. dude

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:18.330
Posters and banners should be stuck
or erected in their allocated places

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.541
'Even if there's a small brawl
among the students'

00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:22.000
'...election will be canceled'

00:42:23.293 --> 00:42:26.004
You pull back and fire

00:42:26.046 --> 00:42:27.047
Cheers!

00:42:27.089 --> 00:42:29.299
'Our total strength is 5500 students. sir'

00:42:29.341 --> 00:42:31.593
We have divided them into 10 categories

00:42:31.802 --> 00:42:32.886
What is this column?

00:42:32.928 --> 00:42:35.597
That is religion & caste category

00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:37.307
Let's avoid that

00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:39.726
Only if we delete it here

00:42:40.352 --> 00:42:41.937
It won't tag along with us terribly

00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:47.651
Hey! How much longer do you intend
drinking like this and roaming around?

00:42:47.693 --> 00:42:49.403
Why yell at me
for no reason?

00:42:49.444 --> 00:42:51.655
Will I yell at you
if you are steady on your feet?

00:42:53.615 --> 00:42:55.742
- I am sober
- Is that so?

00:42:57.244 --> 00:42:59.079
Hit an arrow
anywhere on this board

00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:00.831
I'll agree you are
sober and steady

00:43:01.081 --> 00:43:03.083
Machi. aim for the bull's eye

00:43:13.552 --> 00:43:15.387
Rs 1 lakh to students
in each department

00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:16.972
Cheers!

00:43:17.723 --> 00:43:20.350
'I have a fair amount of
experience in counselling'

00:43:20.392 --> 00:43:24.229
If you can tell me the reason
I can do my level best to help you

00:43:24.271 --> 00:43:27.065
Earlier on...when I was jobless

00:43:28.358 --> 00:43:30.736
I was hanging around
in a tiles company in Rajasthan

00:43:30.777 --> 00:43:32.237
- Oh!
- At that time

00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:35.032
A girl lost her bag in the train

00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:38.035
I found it and sent it to her

00:43:38.118 --> 00:43:40.329
She liked me for the effort I took

00:43:40.996 --> 00:43:44.833
She and I became pen pals and
we built a 'Fort of love' just for us

00:43:45.918 --> 00:43:48.587
Then when she knew
I was in Rajasthan

00:43:48.629 --> 00:43:50.380
For my sake that girl
took extra pains

00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:54.384
Embroidered. knitted
a sweater and sent it to me

00:43:54.426 --> 00:43:55.844
Sweater in Rajasthan!

00:43:58.096 --> 00:43:59.097
True that?

00:44:08.607 --> 00:44:10.609
'Tomorrow if you have a problem
and you come to me'

00:44:10.651 --> 00:44:12.569
'Even if it's midnight
I'll be there for you'

00:44:12.611 --> 00:44:15.697
Why should we create problems
and end up in the police station?

00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:17.115
Beverages free in the canteen

00:44:17.741 --> 00:44:19.409
Aqua training access free

00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:22.746
You will have campus interviews
You'll leave the college with a job in hand

00:44:22.788 --> 00:44:24.748
Above all give this serious thought

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.792
Do you want to be ruled by a girl?

00:44:26.834 --> 00:44:28.460
Or revel in a boy's leadership?

00:44:32.297 --> 00:44:35.342
Hey! That isn't even my glass

00:44:35.384 --> 00:44:37.970
Some other chap has relished
a drink and gone. madcap!

00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:39.054
How dare you!

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.348
'JD' please

00:45:00.033 --> 00:45:02.286
'The third round of votes
have been counted...'

00:45:02.703 --> 00:45:04.746
'We have started counting
for the fourth round...'

00:45:08.292 --> 00:45:09.293
Sir...?

00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:10.586
'4th round. sir'

00:45:10.627 --> 00:45:12.212
Results are due any moment

00:45:13.088 --> 00:45:14.548
I'm scared. sir

00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:21.388
Are you Satyaraj acting
as Amavasai in 'Amaidhi Padai'?

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.598
4th round it seems

00:45:22.639 --> 00:45:23.682
Pah!

[loud cheering]

00:46:00.385 --> 00:46:01.887
Congratulations. chairperson

00:46:02.513 --> 00:46:05.599
Sir. I think they have already
started creating a ruckus there

00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.059
Sir. what do we do now?

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.603
Why do you still ask me?
She's the captain of your ship

00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:12.105
Chairman. tell us what to do?

00:46:13.649 --> 00:46:14.650
'Sir'

00:46:14.691 --> 00:46:18.820
To avoid all these unnecessary confusion
I'm thinking of talking to Bhargav directly

00:46:19.488 --> 00:46:20.531
Look at that!

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:22.074
By all means go and talk

00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:23.492
But go alone

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.661
Madam

00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:28.997
Don't dilly-dally. scratch your head.
crack your knuckles and keep looking back

00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:30.749
Don't dawdle and
do 'instalment' walk

00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:31.792
Forward march!

00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:37.673
Sir. will you give me your bracelet?

00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:38.966
Why?

00:46:39.007 --> 00:46:40.008
Please give. sir

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:41.134

00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:05.367
I want to talk to you

Your son lost. bro

00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:17.004
What?

Bhargav...er-

00:47:19.089 --> 00:47:20.966
I came to congratulate

00:47:21.008 --> 00:47:24.887
Winning by just 60 votes
is no big victory at all

00:47:25.596 --> 00:47:28.724
Er...is there any rule in college
there should be only 1 chairman?

00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:31.935
You take over day college
and I'll handle evening college

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.396
Okay. bye

00:47:35.689 --> 00:47:36.690
Congrats

I extended my hand
even on nomination day

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:40.736
You didn't want to shake hands

00:47:43.906 --> 00:47:45.574
At least let it be truce now?

00:47:46.742 --> 00:47:48.869
I don't think it's safe
for her to go alone

00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:50.746
Shall I go and check. sir?

00:47:59.588 --> 00:48:00.672
'Let's shake hands'

00:48:01.924 --> 00:48:03.634
- Okay
- How ridiculous

00:48:03.675 --> 00:48:05.260
He has patched up happily

Dad. there's no problem
I spoke to that girl

00:48:14.353 --> 00:48:16.563
She even asked me to be
the chairman for Day college. pa

'You got a sudden desire to
beg a post from her. huh?'

00:48:19.733 --> 00:48:22.569
It isn't what you think. pa
I'll come in person and explain to you

Sir. he wasn't nasty to me

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.260
I shook hands and he said okay

00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:47.970

Ensure our college students are safe. sir'

'I have checked all the groups'

00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:32.528
They have texted me

00:52:32.736 --> 00:52:35.989
The entire riot has been recorded
in our college CCTV cameras

00:52:36.031 --> 00:52:37.658
Is he behaving like a professor?

00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:40.118
Excuse me. ma'am. you are
talking about damage of property

Rowdies got together and
bashed up 4-5 of our girls

00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:44.790
What could all the teachers do?

00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:47.000
- No one came to stop them
- Stop it. Charu

It isn't even 1 month
since you joined this college

00:52:49.586 --> 00:52:50.587
Just keep quiet

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.966
What the hell are they discussing?

00:52:54.383 --> 00:52:55.425
I'll be back

a commitment I'll resign

00:53:12.734 --> 00:53:13.735
I said 'wait'

00:53:17.239 --> 00:53:18.282
'I understand'

00:53:18.448 --> 00:53:20.284
If they need to know your worth

00:53:20.909 --> 00:53:22.619
A gap is essential

00:53:24.329 --> 00:53:26.039
Your decision is correct

00:53:26.081 --> 00:53:28.041
You wanted a break for 3 months?

00:53:28.083 --> 00:53:29.501
I have okayed it

00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:32.087
When did I ask?

00:53:37.718 --> 00:53:39.094
Isn't this your signature?

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.431
Sir

00:53:43.015 --> 00:53:44.433
Carbon copy. sir

Haven't you opted for a break
of 3 months. intending to teach?

00:53:49.646 --> 00:53:51.815
Teach? In which college?

00:53:52.941 --> 00:53:53.984
College?

What will I do there?

00:54:00.824 --> 00:54:02.117
I didn't sign this

00:54:03.994 --> 00:54:06.288
Maybe after 6:00 p.m?

00:54:10.626 --> 00:54:12.211
After 6:00 p.m

00:54:12.586 --> 00:54:13.629
Good chance

00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:14.922
See

00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:18.550
JD. you're losing control on yourself

00:54:21.845 --> 00:54:25.599
If there's any issue in the election
didn't you agree to resign your job?

00:54:26.266 --> 00:54:28.101
That means you have
something on your mind

00:54:29.019 --> 00:54:30.646
Fine. sir. I'll go

00:54:31.271 --> 00:54:33.273
Well...I have many 'well' wishers here

00:54:33.315 --> 00:54:34.816
This must be their handiwork

00:54:35.651 --> 00:54:37.694
It's okay. I need a change too. I'll go

to explain the job you'll be undertaking'

- Needhimani
- Bro?

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.372
You didn't pass on any information?

00:54:48.413 --> 00:54:49.748
No. bro

00:54:51.667 --> 00:54:53.877
Then whatever lawyer sir
and I spoke in the union office

00:54:53.919 --> 00:54:56.713
- How did the police get to hear?
- That's what puzzles me. bro

00:54:59.091 --> 00:55:01.260
You know this music director Anirudh?

00:55:01.802 --> 00:55:04.054
He has composed a new film song

00:55:04.096 --> 00:55:05.722
Shall we listen?

00:55:09.017 --> 00:55:10.394
- Listen

You are his next target'

by framing it on those boys'

What do you say. bigamist?

00:55:18.443 --> 00:55:20.988
At least is this your voice
or will you claim its mimicry?

00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:23.240
- Bro
- Did you call me. Bhavani?

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:28.662
Make sure the boys are supplied
their regular dose of drinks and drugs

00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:31.540
Whether they get
3 square meals a day or not

00:55:32.499 --> 00:55:34.668
Booze and dope should flow steadily

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:36.503
Okay. Bhavani
I'll see to it

00:55:38.338 --> 00:55:39.381
Where was I?

00:55:39.423 --> 00:55:41.800
You got me married and how
can you make my wife a widow?

00:55:42.885 --> 00:55:44.219
- Tell me. bro
- Wait

00:55:44.261 --> 00:55:46.847
I'm choking with emotion
hearing your sentimental speech

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.769
Why are you jerking?

00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:56.648
I had tucked the knife in my waist
What if it pierces me in the wrong place?

00:55:57.065 --> 00:55:59.985
- Not that
- Suppose an enemy kills us

00:56:00.027 --> 00:56:02.529
Doesn't matter if they say
'that's how Bhavani died a noble death'

00:56:02.738 --> 00:56:06.241
If they say. 'he had tucked a knife
that stabbed him in a wrong spot'

00:56:06.283 --> 00:56:07.576
Does that sound good?

00:56:07.618 --> 00:56:09.077
- No
- No. right?

00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:10.120
Won't sound good

00:56:10.245 --> 00:56:12.247
- Lean back comfortably
- Don't. bro

00:56:12.289 --> 00:56:13.874
- Is that a show of respect?
- Yes. bro

00:56:13.916 --> 00:56:16.835
How is it over the phone
all this 'bro' kinship is missing?

00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:18.086
What is this?

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.297
- Lean back
- No. bro

00:56:20.464 --> 00:56:22.549
Won't you comply with
your bro's death wish for you?

00:56:22.591 --> 00:56:24.676
Lean back...sit...sit...sit!

00:56:24.718 --> 00:56:25.719

00:56:51.745 --> 00:56:53.330
I thought I should inform you

00:57:18.605 --> 00:57:21.817
"Break like a wave. wash the filth away"

00:57:28.532 --> 00:57:33.287
Sir. college students are bound by
certain protocols of parents and society

00:57:33.328 --> 00:57:35.330
But those boys there
lack all that discipline

00:57:35.372 --> 00:57:38.834
Their age and their activities
have no connection whatsoever

00:57:42.796 --> 00:57:45.382
'Not even a single inmate
is human or humane'

00:57:45.883 --> 00:57:47.050
'Beasts'

00:57:47.593 --> 00:57:48.719
'Demons'

00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:50.762
'Kabaddi'

00:57:50.804 --> 00:57:54.224
'They know our law is lenient
to their habitual crimes'

00:57:54.266 --> 00:57:57.269
'They use it to their advantage
breaking laws as reckless criminals'

00:57:58.562 --> 00:58:00.022
'That's why. I'm telling you. sir'

00:58:00.063 --> 00:58:03.233
Don't bend backwards to reform them
in those 3 months you are assigned there

00:58:05.277 --> 00:58:08.113
Aren't you wondering
whether to go there or not?

00:58:08.906 --> 00:58:09.948
'Sir...?'

00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:11.700
'Sir...!'

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:14.620
'Is our hero in dream world?'

00:58:15.495 --> 00:58:17.372
Sir. check if that's your phone?

00:58:17.998 --> 00:58:19.041
Bro...bro

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.043
'Wake up. bro'

00:58:21.877 --> 00:58:22.920
Not mine

00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:24.046
Oh! Brother's phone

00:58:24.421 --> 00:58:26.715
That's no problem. sir
I don't mind going

00:58:27.007 --> 00:58:28.717
- I can handle them
- Sir

00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:31.303
So have you decided you're going?

00:58:43.482 --> 00:58:44.691
Here

00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:47.319
Das...?

00:58:47.986 --> 00:58:50.322
That teacher will be here tomorrow

00:58:50.364 --> 00:58:52.115
Despite knowing about this place

00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:54.284
...if he is ready to set foot here

00:58:54.326 --> 00:58:55.911
Don't underestimate him

00:58:55.994 --> 00:58:57.538
First let him land up

00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:59.081
After he steps in here

00:58:59.414 --> 00:59:01.667
Let's see if he lasts here
even for half an hour

00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:14.263
You should be in there by 10'o clock

00:59:14.304 --> 00:59:17.349
If you freshen up
I can take you in my car

00:59:19.351 --> 00:59:20.435
In that vehicle?

00:59:20.727 --> 00:59:22.104
- Yes
- Okay. you go

00:59:22.229 --> 00:59:23.981
- I'll take you safe-
- I'll shower and come

00:59:24.022 --> 00:59:25.023
Okay. bro

00:59:27.818 --> 00:59:30.237
Life is a pain. hmmm?

00:59:33.615 --> 00:59:34.658
3 months

00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:51.341
If he comes in and
starts taking a lesson

00:59:51.383 --> 00:59:53.177
...ask all of them
to fling these at him

00:59:54.761 --> 00:59:55.888
Das

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.866
"Ooooh yeah
You know who it is!"

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.662
"If I'm doin' somethin"

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:26.627
"Boy...I like to do it well"

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:32.925
"And when I'm in the zone"

01:00:36.178 --> 01:00:38.847
"Ain't nobody stoppin' me"

01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:46.438
"You know who it is"

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:54.029
Das. look at his stride and beard!
Doesn't look like a master

01:00:54.071 --> 01:00:55.697
Doesn't carry a book or a cane

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.366
He looks so local
Rough & tough

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:00.410
We'll provoke him and then pounce

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:11.463
"Master"

01:01:12.256 --> 01:01:14.258
"They call me...master"

01:01:15.092 --> 01:01:17.135
"You know me...master"

01:01:18.679 --> 01:01:20.597
"I'm master the blaster"

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:23.058
"Master"

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:25.811
"They call me...master"

01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:29.356
"You know me...master"

01:01:30.107 --> 01:01:32.317
"I'm master the blaster"

01:01:33.944 --> 01:01:36.905
"If you step foot in our place
it is trespassing into our space"

01:01:36.947 --> 01:01:39.658
"We will hassle you to the root
Master. change your route"

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.411
"As juveniles we roam
in this Observation Home"

01:01:42.452 --> 01:01:44.913
"Tears in our eyes ready
if you ask us to study"

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.457
"Don't take lessons in life
Or ask us to drop our knife"

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:50.335
"Your lame advice is of no use
We don't want your views"

01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:52.004
"Sir. don't take lessons in life-"

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:54.381
Why did you stop singing?
It was such a peppy song

01:01:56.592 --> 01:01:57.801
Wow!

01:01:57.843 --> 01:01:59.887
Song...sketch

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:02.306
Looks like a bunch of talented boys

01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:03.473
Not bad at all

01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:06.894
Are you setting out to play?

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.228
Why?
What's wrong?

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:11.690
I don't interfere in the likes
or dislikes of anyone. boss

01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:14.109
Whoever wants to play. go ahead
Want to sit here. be my guest

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:16.361
'I am allergic to the sun
I'll sit right here'

01:02:16.945 --> 01:02:18.030
Should I teach now?

01:02:18.113 --> 01:02:20.407
- No...no
- We want to play

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:21.950
Very good

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:25.370
- 'I must catch up on Amazon. Netflix'
- Shall we give the letter now. brother?

01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:28.040
'I hate the sight of
this classroom. bench'

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.334
- 'I will throw all this out'
- Not now. I'll tell you

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:35.047
Don't indulge in all this graffiti
on the board. bathroom walls

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:37.299
You focus on your work
and I'll stick to my job

01:02:37.716 --> 01:02:38.717
Deal?

01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:40.886
We thought of chasing you away
if you started lessons today

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:42.763
You are unique. master

01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:43.972
He seems to be one of us

01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:46.016
Turned out I'm quite jobless

01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:47.476
Why waste time sitting?

01:02:47.601 --> 01:02:52.105
Why is this place so dirty
and stinking to high heaven?

01:02:52.147 --> 01:02:55.776
We celebrate 10 festivals a year
and 20 birthdays of leaders

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:58.445
You don't clean up this place
and celebrate on any occasion?

01:02:58.487 --> 01:02:59.696
'Celebrate' means?

01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:01.865
That means-

01:03:01.907 --> 01:03:02.950
Have a blast. huh?

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:04.034
Right

01:03:04.117 --> 01:03:04.910
Rock on

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:07.663
We have no idea of day or date
You and your ideas!

01:03:08.205 --> 01:03:09.414
So simple

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:11.416
Some of you were singing
when I entered. right?

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:13.418
- Who were they?
- I sang

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.587
What the four of you just sang

01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:17.756
If 40 of you sing in chorus

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.216
That's celebration

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:23.011
Come with me
I'll show you

01:03:31.478 --> 01:03:32.646
Beat it

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:45.450
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention. listen to me"

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:48.453
Why singing in English. bro?

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.414
Just listen. bro

01:03:50.455 --> 01:03:55.085
"Let me sing a short story
Pay attention. listen to me"

01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:59.673
"If you want. take it or else
no need tension. leave it. baby"

01:03:59.715 --> 01:04:06.430

Always be happy"

01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:11.435
"100s of problems will come & go"

01:04:11.476 --> 01:04:14.479
"Chill a bit. bro"

01:04:16.398 --> 01:04:17.691
Together. man

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:22.487
"Let me sing a mini story
Pay attention. listen to me"

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:27.034
"If you want. take it or else

01:04:27.117 --> 01:04:32.706
"Life is very short. 'nanba'
Always be happy"

"Chillax and relax. bro"

01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:45.260
No tension. baby

"If you race at a zip zap zoom speed
concentration is a must indeed"

01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:08.200
"If you crawl at a slow pace
to be steady is a must always"

01:05:11.912 --> 01:05:17.292
"Oh! Anger always misery. baby"

01:05:17.334 --> 01:05:21.964
"Stand united as friends. powerful. buddy"

"Haters are gonna hate but ignore calmly"

01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:31.056
"Delete negativity totally. baby"

01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:35.310
"Focus on what you dream
and don't worry. mApi"

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:39.731

01:06:19.438 --> 01:06:22.482
"Take a break. bro"

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.736
No tension. baby

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:58.101
"Hard work too is necessary
Smart work also is compulsory"

01:06:58.143 --> 01:07:02.940
"Self motivation
Isn't it your reflection?"

01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:07.444
"You need education
Plus total dedication"

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:11.615

"Many problems will come and go
Put your feet up. bro"

"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention. listen to me"

"Breathe a bit easy. bro"

01:08:14.595 --> 01:08:16.722
"That was my 'kutti' story"

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:18.891
"How was my short story"

01:08:19.099 --> 01:08:21.101
"That was my Lilliput story"

01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:25.355
"How was my 'kutti' story?"

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.070
Go...go...go

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:38.285
Master

01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:41.580
'He's asleep. da?'

01:08:41.997 --> 01:08:43.248
Quick. wake him up

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:44.458
Sir

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.335
Sir

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:48.212
Sir?

01:08:48.253 --> 01:08:50.422
- Put the letter in his pocket
- He is sleeping. bro

01:08:50.464 --> 01:08:51.798
Just do it

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.013
Hey!

01:08:58.055 --> 01:08:59.890
Who is that tickling me?

01:09:00.766 --> 01:09:03.227
I can hear footsteps. we'll talk
to him over the phone tonight

01:09:03.268 --> 01:09:04.353
Come away

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:06.730
We shouldn't get caught

01:09:12.236 --> 01:09:15.239
Thank God. only another 89 days left

01:09:15.781 --> 01:09:16.907
Go home

01:09:43.141 --> 01:09:44.810
Hello. stop

01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:47.437
I noticed just now

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:50.357
Don't know who played this prank
Why are you riding a cycle?

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:51.775
I can drop you in my car

01:09:51.817 --> 01:09:53.443
That's alright
I can manag-

01:09:53.485 --> 01:09:57.030
I was hoping at least
you will bring about a change

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.782
Why? It's all going smooth

01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:00.450
The boys are having fun

01:10:01.118 --> 01:10:03.453
We are submerged in problems

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.081
Half the boys are drowning
in a sea of drugs

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:08.876
Whatever they get
they readily use as weapons

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:11.086
Everyday some boy or the other
twists his arm or ankle

01:10:11.128 --> 01:10:14.047
Why tell me all these tales?
Am I the police or what?

01:10:14.089 --> 01:10:15.465
I'm just a teacher here

01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:17.384
Sir. you don't understand

01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:20.095
The police will nab the criminals
Court will punish them

01:10:20.137 --> 01:10:21.305
To guide these boys

01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:23.307
To sift and sieve right from wrong

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:25.684
We are not equipped. sir
They need a master like you

01:10:25.726 --> 01:10:28.312
First understand this is
a reformatory for juvenile delinquents

01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:30.480
'The boys have got into a fist-fight. sir'

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:32.900
'I am unable to control them
Whoever is out there. come in. sir'

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:34.860
Yov! Wait. man
I am coming in now

01:10:34.902 --> 01:10:37.946
First close A block and
ensure outsiders don't enter

01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:43.202
He isn't picking the phone. da

01:10:44.912 --> 01:10:45.954
'What happened. bro?'

01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:48.290
'I tried 10-15 times
He isn't picking my call'

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:50.083
'Try again. bro'

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:22.699
'He isn't picking our call'

01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:25.452
'Do you remember sister Charu's number?'

01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:27.287
'Call her. bro'

01:11:27.663 --> 01:11:28.664
'Hurry up'

01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:33.168
Manikandan speaking. sister
You saw me in the Observation Home

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.461
Someone is coming

01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:36.171
- Switch off the phone
- 'Hello...hello?'

01:11:36.213 --> 01:11:37.464
'Can you hear me. Mani?'

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:38.632
Go. brother

01:12:18.338 --> 01:12:19.673
Enjoy the 'biriyani'

01:12:20.757 --> 01:12:22.009
'Brother...?'

01:12:22.467 --> 01:12:24.720
- We don't want
- Why?

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:26.221
Not hungry

01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:27.681
Is that so?

01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:30.475
He asked you to eat. right?

01:12:33.645 --> 01:12:35.063
Half baked nutcase!

01:12:37.024 --> 01:12:40.319
How much we have suffered.
starving in this same spot. moron

01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:44.239
Get me some water

01:12:45.741 --> 01:12:47.159
Bro. I'm scared-

01:12:47.201 --> 01:12:49.453
Lucky to get a leg piece in a 'biriyani'

01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:54.041
You can even kill someone

01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:55.876
But not rob him of food

01:12:56.793 --> 01:12:58.003
Go on. eat

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.136
Water

01:13:08.138 --> 01:13:09.139
Enough

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:17.105
They took my phone though
they knew very well it was mine

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.153
Whom did you call?

01:13:23.237 --> 01:13:24.613
No one. bro

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.241
Don't know

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:28.450
Tell me the truth

01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:30.160
I don't know. bro

01:13:30.369 --> 01:13:32.204
Ma...master. bro

01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:33.580
Who?

01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:35.415
The master who joined duty

01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:38.001
- Master. huh?
- He's a boozer. bro

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:40.212
You don't have to take him
seriously at all. bro

01:13:42.965 --> 01:13:44.049
Why. 'master'?

01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:45.968
My father died
when I was a kid

01:13:46.009 --> 01:13:48.762
Couldn't bear the hunger
I stole and got caught

01:13:48.929 --> 01:13:51.098
They piled cases on me

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:53.976
And sent me to this
Ju...Juvenile Home. bro

01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:55.644
We are being released tomorrow

01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:59.481
But he is asking me to surrender
for a murder case. bro

01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:02.985
If my mother gets to know this
she will die of shock. bro

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.740
If you had called me
instead of calling that master

01:14:08.782 --> 01:14:10.450
I'm emotional by nature you see

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.911
I would have assigned
someone else to surrender

01:14:13.412 --> 01:14:15.789
Not wanting to surrender
isn't a mistake on your part

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:17.958
But you wanted to sneak
our internal information

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.710
Isn't that a grave mistake?

01:14:20.794 --> 01:14:23.046
Grown-up boy. you tell me
What you did was wrong or not?

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:25.132
- Yes. it was wrong
- So I am right?

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:28.886
Enough of eating 'biriyani'

01:14:28.927 --> 01:14:31.388
I'll take it
You've had enough

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:32.472
Here. take this

01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:34.933
Aren't we both very young. bro?

01:14:34.975 --> 01:14:37.853
Think of us as your younger brother
and please forgive us this time

01:14:37.895 --> 01:14:41.023
My dear. only boys like you
should not be pardoned

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:44.109
They pardoned me
Look how it has shaped me

01:14:44.484 --> 01:14:45.819
How do we deal with this?

01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:48.739
We won't repeat this. bro
We won't snitch to anyone

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.160
Listen. you can be scared
of anyone in this world

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.454
But if death knocks at our door

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:57.748
...even if it is Lord Yama
you shouldn't be scared

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:01.418
I'll give you 2 minutes

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:04.922
Kill me and then save
your brother and yourself

01:15:07.299 --> 01:15:10.177
What were you doing
when these kids stole your phone?

01:15:10.219 --> 01:15:12.054
On top of it you have
this stuck up attitude!

01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:13.722
- Go away
- I won't leave you

01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:15.474
Listen to me
Just run away

01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:16.725
- Run outside
- I won't go

01:15:16.767 --> 01:15:19.061
Mess up all my orders
Only plus is your voice!

01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:19.895
I won't go

01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:21.855
You have only 1 minute left

01:15:21.897 --> 01:15:23.023
Decide fast

01:15:23.065 --> 01:15:24.066
Go away from here

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:26.360
I won't leave you alone

01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:37.120
'What are you doing?'

01:15:37.579 --> 01:15:38.580
'Don't. bro'

01:15:39.915 --> 01:15:41.834
This is what I expected from you!

01:15:43.085 --> 01:15:44.294
Clear out

01:15:44.336 --> 01:15:46.046
I won't leave you

01:15:55.013 --> 01:15:57.349
Brother...!

01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:00.394
Wake up. bro
Get up

01:16:00.435 --> 01:16:03.021
I'm constable Arumugam
Get up. bro

01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:05.691
School starts only at 10'o clock
Why are you waking me-

01:16:05.732 --> 01:16:08.026
We have a problem on hand
Inspector wants to see you

01:16:08.068 --> 01:16:09.903
Why should I meet the inspector?

01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:12.406
You have to get up now
Not realizing the gravity of the situ-

01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:13.782
Okay. I'll get up

01:16:13.866 --> 01:16:15.450
Don't shake me up like a rattle!

01:16:16.118 --> 01:16:17.369
Go. I'll follow

01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:20.038
'I will come'

01:16:21.456 --> 01:16:24.626
"You say you heard a rumor"

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.630
"And it's time I let you know"

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:30.007
Start...make it quick

01:16:31.383 --> 01:16:34.636
"You won't need. won't need no ruler"

01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:02.915
"If delinquents like us lament in pain
will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?"

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:04.917
'Not too sure. sir'

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:06.752
'I think they were here
for less than a year'

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:11.798
"2 innocent boys here
Lost their lives so dear"

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.300
'I am in the crime spot. sir'

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:16.094
"To reside here or hang by a rope
One and the same without hope"

01:17:16.136 --> 01:17:18.180
'What are you gawking at. huh?'

01:17:18.222 --> 01:17:19.348
Yov! Who are you?

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:20.599
- Get out
- Sir...sir

01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:21.892
He is our class master

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.062
Oh! You are that master. huh?
First I have to interrogate you

01:17:25.103 --> 01:17:26.313
What did you do?

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:27.814
This has never happened before

01:17:27.898 --> 01:17:29.274
Did you hit any of the boys?

01:17:29.316 --> 01:17:30.359
Tell me

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.152
Can't you hear me?
Answer. man

01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:36.031
Sir. what is this?

01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:37.866
Not here. I need to
take him for inquiry

01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:39.910
'Get him into our police jeep'

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:43.163
'Search all the rooms in case
they left any suicide note'

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:47.751
"We want to reform given a choice
We are good-for-nothing boys"

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:54.174
"If delinquents like us lament in pain
will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?"

01:17:58.387 --> 01:18:03.767
"If good-for-nothing louts wail
will our voice make justice prevail?"

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:08.188
'N2 Police Station
Vadaseri'

01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:20.158
Bhavani. can we come with you?

01:18:20.742 --> 01:18:22.953
He has asked me to come
by myself. I can handle it

01:18:22.995 --> 01:18:25.455
What about...that master
who is in police custody?

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.460
I came out of the reformatory 15 years ago

01:18:30.586 --> 01:18:32.421
Reason I've been patient
for the past 5 years

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:36.258
I wanted to kill these 3 men and
become the president of the Drivers' union

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.178
2 men are dead and gone
This is the last one to go down

01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:40.387
He has sent for me

01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:42.264
Is he my priority?

01:18:43.056 --> 01:18:44.725
Or is this master important?

01:18:44.766 --> 01:18:45.934
He's only important

01:18:45.976 --> 01:18:47.895
- What shall we do with this master?
- I'll handle him

01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:50.147
- Sure?
- No problem

01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:52.065
- Shall I go now?
- I'll go

01:18:53.108 --> 01:18:54.359
Let's go

01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:01.950
Come with me

01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:10.959
Where are you going?

01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:13.462
- 2 minutes. sir
- Quick. sir will be here anytime

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:15.422
'Are you the mother of
those 2 boys who died?'

01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:17.382
- 'Yes. sir
- Is that so?'

01:19:17.716 --> 01:19:18.926
'Give him all the details'

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:20.385
Boozed upto your brow. huh?

01:19:20.427 --> 01:19:23.096
- 'Sit outside
- Okay. sir'

01:19:23.889 --> 01:19:26.058
If someone is calling you
10 times from the same number

01:19:26.099 --> 01:19:28.393
...won't it occur to you
it may be a serious problem?

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:30.604
No. Ch...Charu

01:19:31.188 --> 01:19:32.439
Why are you staring so blankly?

01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:35.150
I was a volunteer in an NGO
before I took up this post here

01:19:35.984 --> 01:19:39.238
Based on a complaint I went
for inspection to that Observation Home

01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:42.115
That's how I befriended those 2 boys

01:19:43.116 --> 01:19:45.702
They told me about the injustice
in that reformatory

01:19:46.119 --> 01:19:48.830
But I couldn't take
any legal action

01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:50.123
So many vile threats

01:19:50.165 --> 01:19:53.043
The only reason I shifted to Chennai
was to handle such cases myself

01:19:53.085 --> 01:19:56.255
I needed to be financially secure
So I took up this lecturer's post

01:19:57.089 --> 01:20:00.300
When you defended the students
my faith was recharged

01:20:01.134 --> 01:20:04.054
I was convinced this flawed system
could be changed for the better

01:20:06.473 --> 01:20:08.433
I forged your signature for this post

01:20:08.475 --> 01:20:10.644
Even for your job
I was the one who applied

01:20:11.061 --> 01:20:12.855
Even the founder is aware of this

01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:14.857
Now I feel that was a big mistake

01:20:16.817 --> 01:20:20.654
If you hadn't come here
at least those 2 boys would be alive

01:20:22.406 --> 01:20:24.366
Now both of them have left us

01:20:24.408 --> 01:20:26.118
How can you defend yourself. sir?

01:20:31.039 --> 01:20:34.835
See. I had no idea whatsoever
No one told me anything

01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:37.004
When have you been
sober enough to understand?

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:40.424
Have you ever realized anytime
who is talking to you?

01:20:44.052 --> 01:20:46.180
I have my share of personal problems

01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:48.056
I am unable to come out of it

01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:50.017
I can't

01:20:50.684 --> 01:20:51.894
...cry

01:20:52.477 --> 01:20:55.147
I can't cry. I can't sleep
at night either. that's why

01:20:58.650 --> 01:20:59.818
I drink

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.030
I swear I never thought
it would be this horrific

01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:06.116
Oh! You can never cry. right?

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.410
'I can't understand
'Tell me without crying'

01:21:08.452 --> 01:21:09.661
Charu. where are yo-

01:21:09.745 --> 01:21:12.789
- Were your boys into drugs?
- I never thought I would see them dead

01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:15.584
This is the lady who gave birth
to those boys who are dead now

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:16.919
I had reassured her

01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:18.253
A master will come

01:21:18.295 --> 01:21:20.297
'He will save your boys'

01:21:21.048 --> 01:21:25.052
Both my sons are very fond of each other
They stick together like glue

01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:28.430
My eldest told me
just last week

01:21:28.472 --> 01:21:32.059
'Let my younger brother study
I'll find some job to support us'

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.894
'A master was coming he said'

01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:36.730
He was sure they will be rescued

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:38.982
But no one came

01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:41.985
'My entire lineage has snapped'

01:21:42.611 --> 01:21:44.446
Yov! Where are you?

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:45.614
Hurry up

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:47.699
'Listen to him'

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.201
Bring your wife

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:52.037
- Yov! Come here
- You can go

01:21:52.204 --> 01:21:53.830
'He has gone back to his old ways'

01:21:53.872 --> 01:21:56.041
- Sir
- Who are they?

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:58.377
She is that master's colleague it seems

01:21:58.418 --> 01:22:00.462
Pack them all off and
move that master to the cell

01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:01.588
Okay. sir

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:03.966
Yov! Clear the other cases
out of the station

01:22:04.007 --> 01:22:05.008
Okay. sir

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:06.635
'What will I do now?'

01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:08.971
'How will I live without them?'

01:22:09.012 --> 01:22:10.806
'Even now you're so hard hearted?'

01:22:10.848 --> 01:22:12.933
Your eyes won't shed tears
till the day you die

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.393
Get even more sloshed

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.979
'Why are you lamenting here?
Shut up now'

01:22:17.062 --> 01:22:18.063
I said shut up

01:22:18.772 --> 01:22:21.650
Do I have to repeat myself?
Clear this place now. madam

01:22:21.692 --> 01:22:22.776
Clear out

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:24.194
Come with me. sir

01:22:24.945 --> 01:22:26.029
I swear-

01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:28.407
Come along. sir
Standing rooted to the spot

01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:30.450
I swear I didn't expect any of this

01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:33.453
Don't forget you are also responsible
for the death of those 2 boys

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.289
Convey my apologies to their mother

01:22:34.154 --> 01:25:34.154
<small><small><b><i><font color="yellow">Official Movie Site "MSMOVIESBD.COM"</b></i></font></small></small>

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:37.916
You are taking undue advantage
of the respect I'm giving you

01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:40.085
Don't make me lose my temper
Stand right there

01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:42.880
I sacrificed my children
in such an awful unjust way

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.798
'Hey! Come here'

01:22:55.142 --> 01:22:56.268
Go inside

01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:09.281
- 'You want a mosquito repellent!
- Don't hit. it hurts'

01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:24.129
Listen. Bhavani

01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:28.258
Only you and I are left to contest
the Lorry Drivers' Union election

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.052
I have to win unopposed

01:23:30.093 --> 01:23:31.595
'Looks like it may rain'

01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:33.305
Can we have tea
and then discuss?

01:23:42.481 --> 01:23:43.649
[sniffles]

01:24:00.666 --> 01:24:03.377
'Master. my name is Sabari'

01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:05.254
'My elder brother is Manikandan'

01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:09.258
'He stole from a bakery for my sake
because I was starving'

01:24:09.675 --> 01:24:13.136
'But they foisted some other case
on us and brought us here'

01:24:13.804 --> 01:24:15.681
'Everything is wrong here. master'

01:24:16.056 --> 01:24:17.766
'They thrash us mercilessly'

01:24:17.975 --> 01:24:20.102
'They stuff some powder into our mouths'

01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:24.273
'Immediately even our teeth
start shivering. master'

01:24:24.857 --> 01:24:27.192
'Don't know if it is day or night'

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:31.029
'We put up with all this
thinking it is for a short period'

01:24:31.113 --> 01:24:32.656
'Now when we are
about to be released'

01:24:32.698 --> 01:24:34.950
'...they want us to surrender
for some other murder case'

01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:38.370
'Otherwise they are threatening
to kill our mother. master'

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:42.833
'Sister Charu assured us you will come
and be our savior. rescue us'

01:24:43.834 --> 01:24:45.335
'Please save us. master'

01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:47.629
'Our poor mother'

01:24:47.713 --> 01:24:49.256
'She is all alone'

01:24:49.298 --> 01:24:51.008
'Crying nonstop daily'

01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:53.218
'I can't cry anymore. master'

01:24:53.886 --> 01:24:56.221
'Please. brother
Rescue us from this hell'

01:24:56.889 --> 01:24:58.765
'I am begging you. brother'

01:25:19.244 --> 01:25:20.245
Go ahead

01:25:21.163 --> 01:25:22.789
I told you. Bhavani

01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:24.249
I want to win unopposed

01:25:24.291 --> 01:25:26.627
I called you here
to arrive at a compromise

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:28.295
But still I can't trust you

01:25:29.338 --> 01:25:34.051
You'll take any kind of cruel measure
using those juvenile delinquents

01:25:34.218 --> 01:25:39.097
Should I step out of my house daily
with fear in every breath I exhale?

01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:42.184
That is why-

01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:45.103
Did you call me here
planning to kill me?

01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:48.732
You-

01:25:48.774 --> 01:25:50.901
You call someone
with a plan to kill him

01:25:50.984 --> 01:25:53.612
Treat him royally like a guest
and offer him hot tea

01:25:53.654 --> 01:25:56.740
You're the only man who
asked me for permission to kill

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.784
Instead you could have-

01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:02.371
Putting you on a pedestal. I wanted to
fix an auspicious day to finish you off

01:26:02.412 --> 01:26:04.414
I need my brain examined!

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:08.293
'Hey! Wait'

01:26:09.086 --> 01:26:10.796
I'll give you 2 minutes

01:26:12.214 --> 01:26:14.967
Kill me and then save
your men and yourself

01:26:37.197 --> 01:26:38.490
'Hurry up'

01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:42.870
Do you need an army
to bash up 1 man?

01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:44.872
Open the door first

01:27:26.872 --> 01:27:28.457
Hey. he is a master
Watch your blows

01:27:28.582 --> 01:27:29.875
You have only 10 minutes

01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:31.585
Come out without too much damage

01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:33.837
Turn the other way

01:27:34.046 --> 01:27:35.380
[indistinct]

01:27:37.382 --> 01:27:38.675
Come. Murali

01:27:38.717 --> 01:27:40.052
Switch it off and come

01:28:04.785 --> 01:28:07.287
Even if you are reborn
pray I don't set eyes on you!

01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:09.164
Don't. Bhavani

01:28:18.841 --> 01:28:20.425
Wonder what their plan is!

01:28:21.009 --> 01:28:24.221
Master. my boss has
given you a bus ticket

01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:26.682
'Luxury bus
Air-condition sleeper'

01:28:26.723 --> 01:28:29.184
Leave tonight. you'll reach
your hometown in the morning

01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:30.894
Got it into your head?

01:28:30.936 --> 01:28:32.980
'If you stubbornly refuse'

01:28:33.021 --> 01:28:34.606
You saw the 2 boys
hanging from the roof?

01:28:34.648 --> 01:28:36.149
You'll be next

01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:38.485
I'm talking to you

01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:40.237
Is that a love letter in your hand?

01:28:42.364 --> 01:28:44.449
Sabari. Manikandan

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.785
[reading under his breath]

01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:51.081
Refusing to surrender in the murder case
and ended up dead. those 2 tramps-

01:29:38.295 --> 01:29:40.839
Sir. the noise is too loud

01:29:42.216 --> 01:29:43.884
Ignore. we'll handle it

01:30:21.296 --> 01:30:23.048
Sir. the noise is ear-splitting

01:30:23.715 --> 01:30:25.217
- Go in and check
- Okay

01:30:45.112 --> 01:30:47.447
'Stab him and rip him apart'

01:30:54.121 --> 01:30:55.122
Sir?

01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:58.041
They may kill that master
Please come here. sir

01:31:06.425 --> 01:31:07.593
Yov Soundar!

01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:13.765
Open the damn door

01:31:24.234 --> 01:31:25.444
Soundar

01:31:46.089 --> 01:31:47.633
- Tell me
- BHAVANI!

01:31:48.926 --> 01:31:52.262
The master-

01:31:58.227 --> 01:31:59.645
Who are you?

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.356
Who is behind this?
What is your motive?

01:32:02.397 --> 01:32:05.317
Why do you use these innocent boys?
I don't know any of this

01:32:06.818 --> 01:32:08.153
But I will find out

01:32:09.112 --> 01:32:12.032
'Hiding behind these boys and
framing them. neck deep in crime'

01:32:12.115 --> 01:32:14.034
I will catch those sissy fellows

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:18.372
I'll hunt high and low. find you
and stand right in front of you

01:32:19.081 --> 01:32:20.374
I will-

01:32:24.086 --> 01:32:28.090
I will make you answer
for the death of those 2 boys

01:32:29.967 --> 01:32:31.093
Master

01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:34.721
Whatever I'm about to say
is nothing new for you

01:32:36.098 --> 01:32:38.267
Still I'll say it
and you listen

01:32:41.353 --> 01:32:42.354
I'm waiting!

01:32:44.648 --> 01:32:46.483
[confident laughter]

01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:48.610
Wait. I say

01:32:48.652 --> 01:32:49.987
I will meet you face to face

01:32:50.028 --> 01:32:51.280
"He stands for powerful victory"

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.739
- "Who is he?
- Thalapathy...!"

01:33:10.007 --> 01:33:11.925
'Das. I'm very scared'

01:33:11.967 --> 01:33:14.344
'He is back again
Is there no one to save me?'

01:33:14.386 --> 01:33:15.971
'Aiyaiyo!

01:33:16.013 --> 01:33:18.640
"Don't spoil for a fight unnecessarily"

01:33:18.682 --> 01:33:21.685
"If you give us hell foolhardily
a stone will split your skull speedily"

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.354
Master. you've been staring
at the rope for a long time?

01:33:24.396 --> 01:33:25.647
Want to play on it as a swing?

01:33:25.689 --> 01:33:27.441
What is that famous song of his?

01:33:27.441 --> 01:33:29.318
Let me tell a 'kutti' story

01:33:29.359 --> 01:33:30.903
Hey chee chee!
Not short. da

01:33:30.944 --> 01:33:32.237
Sad story!

01:33:32.321 --> 01:33:34.406
"Let me tell a sad story"

01:33:34.448 --> 01:33:37.117
"Zip lip. or slip
Skip and trip"

01:33:37.159 --> 01:33:39.119
"Chillax. master!"

01:33:41.288 --> 01:33:43.290
"Take a deep breath. master"

01:33:43.332 --> 01:33:44.833
Hey master!

01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:47.085
"Cheers to your beers!"

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:57.596
'Youths to the youngest ones
are doped day and night. bro'

01:33:58.096 --> 01:34:00.849
'When they are intoxicated
they are not in control of their senses'

01:34:00.891 --> 01:34:03.268
'Both have plenty of
criminal cases against them'

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:04.895
'2 boys who died are sheer poison'

01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:06.897
'Both must have died
when totally tanked. sir'

01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:09.441
'They won't toe the line with
their parents or with our rules'

01:34:09.483 --> 01:34:11.485
They are arrogant boys
who insist their word is law

01:34:11.568 --> 01:34:14.112
'There are 10-12 year olds
with all kinds of diseases in here'

01:34:14.154 --> 01:34:15.280
All dazed and doped

01:34:15.322 --> 01:34:18.283
Who told you they were
good-for-nothing boys?

01:34:18.325 --> 01:34:20.118
Both are 24 carat gold. sir

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.079
Both those boys who died

01:34:22.287 --> 01:34:24.831
They called a girl I know
on the night they died

01:34:24.873 --> 01:34:26.041
You mean Charu?

01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:28.085
Yes. Charu

01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:31.338
I know Charu and I know
who killed those 2 boys too

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.131
We have tried our level best

01:34:33.173 --> 01:34:36.343
But we are unable to stop
the dope and booze supply

01:34:36.385 --> 01:34:39.263
How can drugs enter the premises
without your knowledge. sir?

01:34:40.305 --> 01:34:43.308
They have so many routes to supply. sir

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:45.102
Without the wardens' support

01:34:45.185 --> 01:34:47.062
'...nothing can be brought in. sir'

01:34:47.104 --> 01:34:50.357
As per our rule book. no violence on
our boys who are all below 18 here

01:34:50.399 --> 01:34:52.901
Using that as an excuse
they will bring the roof down!

01:34:52.943 --> 01:34:54.862
Presuming others' fears are their plus

01:34:54.903 --> 01:34:56.655
...these are riff-raffs
who rule the roost

01:34:57.614 --> 01:35:00.534
Poor chaps! Trapped for life
caught in Bhavani's web

01:35:01.493 --> 01:35:02.578
Who is Bhavani?

01:35:03.161 --> 01:35:04.162
Beast!

01:35:04.204 --> 01:35:07.040
- Bhava...Bhavani?
- Don't know anyone by that name

01:35:11.378 --> 01:35:14.214
Sir. don't simply keep asking questions

01:35:14.256 --> 01:35:16.633
You got any other work.
carry on. okay?

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.010
See you. sir?

01:35:18.051 --> 01:35:19.219
Let's go

01:35:47.915 --> 01:35:50.209
'Teachers who came here earlier
to reform these boys'

01:35:50.250 --> 01:35:53.295
...would have made a hasty retreat
thinking their family takes priority

01:35:54.546 --> 01:35:56.340
But my story is completely different

01:35:56.965 --> 01:35:58.675
I have no one to call my own. sir

01:36:00.093 --> 01:36:03.847
'The day I saw those 2 boys
hang right in front of my eyes'

01:36:05.307 --> 01:36:06.934
Their eyes bulging

01:36:07.559 --> 01:36:08.977
Tongues sticking out

01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:11.480
I died. sir

01:36:14.942 --> 01:36:16.109
If you can help me

01:36:16.318 --> 01:36:18.820
I will change this place and
bring order and fair play here

01:36:20.155 --> 01:36:22.950
Whatever hardship comes my way
I don't care even if I lose my life

01:36:22.991 --> 01:36:24.117
"My life's breath"

01:36:24.284 --> 01:36:25.410
I have no problem. sir

01:36:25.452 --> 01:36:29.081
If you stick to rules & regulations here.
even move heaven and earth legally

01:36:29.206 --> 01:36:30.624
I will back you up 100%. sir

01:36:30.666 --> 01:36:34.127
"High time I stop needing a high from you"

01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:41.093
"Enough of (s)tumbling thanks to you!"

01:36:41.301 --> 01:36:46.348
"Today my troubled times will heal anew"

01:36:47.349 --> 01:36:50.644
"Enough of being sloshed night & day
Get it out of your system today"

01:36:50.686 --> 01:36:53.856
"Enough of gifting yourself strife
Switch off this dizzying life"

01:36:53.897 --> 01:36:56.942
"No more booze to give a kick
Quit now. double quick"

01:36:56.984 --> 01:37:00.195
"Break the bottles. you surely should
Trash them for your own good"

01:37:00.237 --> 01:37:04.324
"Enough of being drunk as a skunk
Get it out of your system as junk"

01:37:04.867 --> 01:37:06.243
Forgive me. ma

01:37:06.368 --> 01:37:09.413
"No more daily booze session
Quit this deadly addiction"

01:37:09.454 --> 01:37:12.791
"Break this habit. begin life anew
Trash the bottles now. dude"

01:37:12.833 --> 01:37:15.502
"Enough of this. night & day
Get it out of your system today"

01:37:15.544 --> 01:37:18.630
"Enough of this dependence
Switch off without a fuss"

01:37:18.672 --> 01:37:21.800
"Enough of being a slave to craving
Quit drinking; no more depraving"

01:37:21.842 --> 01:37:26.054
"Break the bottles and the habit
Trash them for your own benefit"

01:37:49.411 --> 01:37:50.954
You got me wrong. Bhavani

01:37:50.996 --> 01:37:52.539
Ever since Gurumurthy died

01:37:52.581 --> 01:37:54.791
...everyone is scared
to contest for that post

01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:57.044
I've spoken to the district councilor

01:37:57.085 --> 01:37:58.295
In another 10 days

01:37:58.337 --> 01:38:00.506
...it will be announced
you won unopposed

01:38:00.547 --> 01:38:01.548
Come here

01:38:02.174 --> 01:38:04.343
Bro. she is the one
putting a spoke in the wheel

01:38:04.384 --> 01:38:07.054
She registered the case it seems
Our boys sent her photo just now

01:38:07.095 --> 01:38:08.555
What should we do with her?

01:38:08.597 --> 01:38:10.390
Can't you handle a female?

01:38:10.974 --> 01:38:13.644
As if you need a priest to choose
an auspicious time! Get lost!

01:38:14.645 --> 01:38:17.481
Bhavani. even if someone else
occupies this post as union leader

01:38:17.481 --> 01:38:20.984
Anyway whatever you say will be law
Then why aspire for this post?

01:38:21.068 --> 01:38:23.612
Fear stemming out of murder is short lived

01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:26.949
But fear derived from a post of power
and authority lasts a lifetime. right?

01:38:27.783 --> 01:38:29.660
After this I'm entering politics

01:38:29.993 --> 01:38:32.496
Don't know how many heads will roll
to make that dream come true

01:38:32.538 --> 01:38:34.623
I don't get it. Bhavani

01:38:34.665 --> 01:38:36.500
Our boys will shoulder the sin

01:38:45.843 --> 01:38:48.387
"They call me master
Changes will happen faster"

01:39:22.004 --> 01:39:23.172
Hey master!

01:39:23.213 --> 01:39:25.549
- 'Looking tip-top like a new groom?
- Correct. man'

01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:27.050
He looks different. right?

01:39:27.092 --> 01:39:29.094
'Master is in a mood
to teach us a lesson'

01:39:29.136 --> 01:39:30.554
Do you think he's married?

01:39:30.596 --> 01:39:32.097
'If he was married'

01:39:32.139 --> 01:39:33.557
And if his wife looks hot

01:39:33.599 --> 01:39:34.850
Soooper. no?!??

01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:37.686
All of you stand height-wise

01:39:38.687 --> 01:39:40.230
Shorter ones in front

01:39:40.314 --> 01:39:42.316
Taller ones in the back
Come on. fast

01:39:42.357 --> 01:39:45.819
If you come clean shaven and yell
you think we'll get scared?

01:39:45.819 --> 01:39:49.031
- 'Move on to your next job
- At least pretend to be scared'

01:39:49.114 --> 01:39:50.240
Poor master!

01:39:50.282 --> 01:39:52.201
Let me repeat

01:39:52.284 --> 01:39:53.535
Fall in line
Stand height-wise

01:39:53.577 --> 01:39:57.664
Master. don't judge a book by its cover
Instead of height try weight as a measure

01:39:57.789 --> 01:39:59.374
This chap like a buffalo here

01:39:59.416 --> 01:40:01.460
'Pickpocket case
Real pipsqueak'

01:40:01.502 --> 01:40:04.254
But our little black ant
had the guts to kill

01:40:04.296 --> 01:40:06.298
Cut above the rest
Then isn't he the heaviest?

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.217
What is your name?

01:40:08.258 --> 01:40:10.219
You heard me?
What is your name?

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:12.012
Master. you can't lay a finger on us

01:40:12.054 --> 01:40:13.305
Know that. right?

01:40:13.347 --> 01:40:16.600
Sir. you can't lay a finger on the boys

01:40:16.642 --> 01:40:17.643
Rules

01:40:18.477 --> 01:40:21.188
'Don't hit them and
get caught unnecessarily'

01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:25.567
'Like a new starched shirt.
sir is all stiff and spruced up'

01:40:25.609 --> 01:40:27.110
"Master's raid beginning"

01:40:27.152 --> 01:40:29.279
"A-Aa-E-Ee. A-B-C-D
This is our time. buddy"

01:40:29.321 --> 01:40:30.948
"Come. brother. welcome"

01:40:35.202 --> 01:40:37.246
It is wrong only if I bash up the boys?

01:40:37.287 --> 01:40:38.288
Yes

01:40:41.583 --> 01:40:44.795
"World famous local master
will bash up any lowlife gangster"

01:40:44.837 --> 01:40:48.340
"His cane will speak loud and clear
To reform a rowdy. law will persevere"

01:40:48.423 --> 01:40:51.510
"If you come in to commit a crime
Master's raid will give you a hard time"

01:40:51.552 --> 01:40:53.095
"Master's raid
Pain postpaid"

01:40:53.136 --> 01:40:55.264
"Don't buy trouble for a fee
Turn your back and flee"

01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:56.807
Why are you hitting us?

01:40:56.849 --> 01:40:58.642
As master. think you can
get away hitting us?

01:40:58.684 --> 01:41:00.060
'We are also wardens here'

01:41:00.102 --> 01:41:02.521
We told you not to hit the boys
So why are you caning us?

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.232
"Don't run over him and look the other way"

01:41:05.315 --> 01:41:07.401
"Don't get into his bad books. stay away"

01:41:07.442 --> 01:41:10.237
"Master's raid. no warranty
Pain 100% guarantee"

01:41:10.571 --> 01:41:12.447
It hurts. sir
Please don't hit

01:41:12.489 --> 01:41:15.242
Sir. I'm going to Sabarimala
I have taken the 48 days vow

01:41:15.284 --> 01:41:18.829
Why? What happened to your devotion
when you were peddling drugs?

01:41:18.871 --> 01:41:22.416
"He'll even the score and more
His blows blast fireworks encore"

01:41:22.457 --> 01:41:23.709
"Who is the master?
Commander!"

01:41:23.792 --> 01:41:25.335
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

01:41:25.377 --> 01:41:26.879
"Move aside
Watch his stride"

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.463
"Shut the gate tight"

01:41:44.605 --> 01:41:45.856
- Name?
- Bharath

01:41:45.898 --> 01:41:47.149
- Sibi
- Karuppusami

01:41:47.191 --> 01:41:48.192
- Dhanus
- 'Udaya'

01:41:48.233 --> 01:41:49.234
- 'Venkatesh
- Stephen'

01:41:49.318 --> 01:41:50.235
'Pencil'

01:41:50.319 --> 01:41:52.696
Inspection it seems
All of you line up to one side

01:41:52.779 --> 01:41:55.449
"He will take law into his hand
When discipline fails to stand"

01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:57.409
"Master's raid will be well planned"

01:41:57.451 --> 01:41:59.786
"When he uses his soft voice
Obey his rules. dear boys"

01:41:59.828 --> 01:42:02.247
"If you defy however slight
his cane will hug you tight"

01:42:02.289 --> 01:42:04.374
"Don't create a ruckus
His warning smile is dangerous"

01:42:04.416 --> 01:42:06.293
"Accept your mistake. bro
he will let you go"

01:42:06.335 --> 01:42:07.336
Good boy!

01:42:07.377 --> 01:42:09.463
"What was that noise. lad?
Your nose is bleeding bad"

01:42:09.505 --> 01:42:11.798
"Wherever you hide. dude
master's eyes will find you"

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:14.176
"Listen to master's advice
you'll be wealthy and wise"

01:42:14.218 --> 01:42:16.512
"If you act smart anymore
time to kneel on the floor"

01:42:35.781 --> 01:42:37.908
"Don't stand and stare
Don't get caught again. beware"

01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:40.661
"Hit him once. you are out cold
He will retaliate multifold"

01:42:41.286 --> 01:42:43.288
"Don't turn a blind eye
to a crime on the roadside"

01:42:43.330 --> 01:42:45.499
"Says 'Thirukkural' wisely
Don't chicken out and flee"

01:42:45.832 --> 01:42:47.918
"My followers devotedly
Will be true wholeheartedly"

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.003
"Without discrimination
of caste. race. religion"

01:42:50.045 --> 01:42:51.547
"Apple of our eye is our nation"

01:42:51.588 --> 01:42:55.676
"We were patient till now; simply
But we will retaliate; world war 3"

01:42:55.801 --> 01:42:58.303
"Continents will quake & quiver
Nonentities will shake & shiver"

01:42:58.345 --> 01:42:59.930
"His entry spells power
Loud and clear"

01:42:59.972 --> 01:43:01.014
"Who is he?
Thalapathy"

01:43:01.056 --> 01:43:02.808
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:04.601
"Move aside. dude
Beast mode"

01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:09.940
'Master. my name is Sabari
My brother's name is Manikandan'

01:43:09.982 --> 01:43:11.817
'My brother stole from
a bakery for my sake'

01:43:11.859 --> 01:43:13.235
'But they foisted another case-'

01:43:13.318 --> 01:43:15.404
'Bhavani. that master is
acting too big for his boots'

01:43:15.445 --> 01:43:16.822
'He bashed up the wardens'

01:43:16.864 --> 01:43:19.992
'He raided the premises and burnt
all the drugs. dopes and phones'

01:43:20.325 --> 01:43:21.869
'What to do with him now?'

01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:28.375
How did a master get to be so gutsy?

01:43:32.337 --> 01:43:34.923
Find out who is backing him up

01:43:43.307 --> 01:43:44.433
Let's get to work

01:43:54.318 --> 01:43:56.486
"Don't stand and stare
Don't get caught again. beware"

01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:59.281
"Hit him once. you are out cold
He will retaliate multifold"

01:44:00.199 --> 01:44:02.868
"Won't turn a blind eye
to a crime on the roadside"

01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:04.244
My dear angels!

01:44:04.536 --> 01:44:05.621
Can you give us a hand?

01:44:05.662 --> 01:44:07.623
"Without discrimination
of caste. race. religion"

01:44:07.664 --> 01:44:08.832
Love. huh?

01:44:08.874 --> 01:44:10.167
"Apple of our eye is our nation"

01:44:10.292 --> 01:44:14.671
"We were patient till now; seriously
Reign of terror; world war 3"

"Continents will quake & quiver
Nonentities will shake & shiver"

01:44:17.299 --> 01:44:18.592
"Master spells power"

01:44:18.634 --> 01:44:19.635
Take your hands off

01:44:19.676 --> 01:44:21.386
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

01:44:21.428 --> 01:44:23.013
"Move aside. dude
Beast mode"

01:44:25.557 --> 01:44:27.684
Master. you had your way. eh?

01:44:27.809 --> 01:44:29.394
You can trim my hair
or tonsure my head

01:44:29.436 --> 01:44:31.980
Beware of my leader Undiyal
Try your tricks on him

01:44:32.064 --> 01:44:33.190
'Undiyal. listen to me'

01:44:33.232 --> 01:44:35.400
- Don't go there. go to your block
- Shut up. warden

01:44:35.442 --> 01:44:36.652
- Vanakkam. boss
- Morning. bro

01:44:36.818 --> 01:44:38.820
Who had the guts to
lay a finger on our hair?

01:44:38.987 --> 01:44:41.240
Is there a rule on
the long and short of it?

01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:43.575
Master. do you know the rules or not?

01:44:43.617 --> 01:44:45.953
You are having a free hand
with everyone's heads

01:44:47.204 --> 01:44:48.372
Master

01:44:48.413 --> 01:44:50.123
Let go of me. master

01:44:53.126 --> 01:44:55.254
You don't know whom
you're pitting your wits against

01:44:55.295 --> 01:44:56.922
You will regret what you're doing

01:44:56.964 --> 01:44:58.841
"Master's raid
Pain post paid"

01:44:58.966 --> 01:45:01.093
"Don't get into strife
Run for your life"

01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:03.136
"When he uses his soft voice"

01:45:03.178 --> 01:45:04.346
Gawd! You're scaring me!

01:45:04.888 --> 01:45:06.056
- Hey Dheena
- 'Sir'

01:45:06.098 --> 01:45:07.349
Let it be a close cut

01:45:07.391 --> 01:45:08.475
"Master raid"

01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:11.019
"Don't run over him and look the other way"

01:45:11.061 --> 01:45:13.438

"Master's raid. da!"

01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:18.610
"A-Aa-E-Ee. A-B-C-D
This is our time. buddy"

01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:21.071
"Bro. good morning
Master's raid in full swing"

01:45:23.156 --> 01:45:25.117
Next week will be
back to square one

01:45:25.409 --> 01:45:27.619
You can come back
and scrub it again. okay?

01:45:27.661 --> 01:45:28.912
Bye. sweetheart

01:45:28.954 --> 01:45:31.623
I've never seen such bad
nicotine stains at so young an age. JD

01:45:31.665 --> 01:45:33.834
Prise open their mouth
it's like a cigarette shop!

01:45:33.876 --> 01:45:37.129
'I have collected cavity samples
from the 6 boys you mentioned'

01:45:37.171 --> 01:45:39.798
- How long will it take?
- I'll let you know in 1 or 2 days

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.091
Thanks. Madhi

01:45:42.509 --> 01:45:44.845
He left me with a half shaved
moustache and beard

01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:46.305
Such a disgrace!

01:45:46.346 --> 01:45:48.098
I feel like I am naked!

01:45:48.182 --> 01:45:49.474
I'm so mad I feel like sta-

01:45:49.516 --> 01:45:51.185
'I feel like stabbing him right now'

01:45:51.226 --> 01:45:53.604
When you get your hands dirty
enemies will come and go

01:45:53.645 --> 01:45:56.940
If we rage like a mad bull against every
single enemy. our life will be ruined

01:45:57.441 --> 01:45:58.901
Handle him with patience

01:45:58.942 --> 01:46:00.611
'Make him run in all 4 directions'

01:46:00.652 --> 01:46:02.070
Don't let him sleep

01:46:02.321 --> 01:46:04.114
- Torture him mentally
- Fine

01:46:04.281 --> 01:46:05.782
- 'Hey-'
- I'll tackle him

01:46:24.885 --> 01:46:26.803
[overlap of angry voices]

01:46:39.566 --> 01:46:41.151
Hey! Come out

01:46:41.193 --> 01:46:43.612
'Listen to me
I'm telling you boys'

01:46:43.654 --> 01:46:45.155
'Listen to me'

01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:46.281
'Wait. da'

01:46:46.323 --> 01:46:48.033
- What happened?
- Sir. I don't know

01:46:48.075 --> 01:46:49.868
They just started a brawl
and hit each other

01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:51.787
Back door is open in A block
What to do now?

01:46:51.828 --> 01:46:53.205
Go look for the key

01:46:53.664 --> 01:46:54.831
Hurry up

01:46:54.873 --> 01:46:55.832
Quick. man

01:46:55.874 --> 01:46:57.668
Don't let anyone out
Lock them up in the class

01:46:57.793 --> 01:46:59.670
- Okay. bro
- Give me the torch

01:46:59.795 --> 01:47:00.963
'You'll get bashed up'

01:47:12.391 --> 01:47:13.433
Get lost!

01:47:41.461 --> 01:47:42.462
Hello. bro

01:47:42.504 --> 01:47:45.007
- 'Yes. tell me'
- None of our boys are missing I hope

01:47:45.048 --> 01:47:47.509
Bro. head count is correct 63

01:47:47.551 --> 01:47:49.428
'Not one of them is missing'

01:47:50.095 --> 01:47:52.181
'They came from outside for sure'

01:48:21.835 --> 01:48:23.170
'Aiyo! It's burning!'

01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:26.423
Aiyo!

01:48:29.801 --> 01:48:31.303
You're hurting me

01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:36.975
Aiyaiyo! Bala

01:48:37.392 --> 01:48:38.894
'What happened to you?'

01:48:40.145 --> 01:48:41.647
'You messed up my face. right?'

01:48:41.688 --> 01:48:43.065
'Go. collect your mess'

01:48:43.148 --> 01:48:44.650
'This is just the beginning. master'

01:48:46.485 --> 01:48:49.112
'Hit them at least once. master'

01:49:23.856 --> 01:49:27.401
Hey master! This is your fate
every single minute you are here

01:49:27.401 --> 01:49:30.112
Don't think this is the end
There's more to come

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.239
We will escape from here tonight

01:49:32.281 --> 01:49:34.241
Try to stop us if you can

01:49:47.379 --> 01:49:49.173
'I was on my bike
sticking to the kerb side'

01:49:49.214 --> 01:49:52.384
Whether he collided by mistake
or deliberately targeted me

01:49:52.426 --> 01:49:53.844
'Only God knows'

01:49:54.011 --> 01:49:55.637
'But his intention is to provoke you'

01:49:55.679 --> 01:49:58.974
Only then you'll get angry and show
your fist power on a handful of boys

01:49:59.016 --> 01:50:01.685
'They will use that as excuse
and pack you off from here'

01:50:01.894 --> 01:50:03.353
'Don't act rashly on impulse'

01:50:05.230 --> 01:50:07.441
Only his leg is fractured
Hand is intact. right?

01:50:12.654 --> 01:50:15.741
[kabaddi-chatter]

01:50:30.297 --> 01:50:31.298
Sorry. da

01:50:31.465 --> 01:50:33.467
I couldn't do anything to help you

01:50:33.509 --> 01:50:34.927
It's okay. forget it

01:50:34.968 --> 01:50:36.220
What can you do?

01:50:36.553 --> 01:50:39.598
My fear is those grown up boys are
waiting to pounce on us in kabaddi

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.684
And we have to play against
those beefy buffaloes it seems

01:50:42.726 --> 01:50:44.353
In case we lose...

01:50:44.394 --> 01:50:46.313
...we'll be 'alti'
this entire month

01:50:46.355 --> 01:50:47.523
'Alti' means?

01:50:47.606 --> 01:50:49.525
Being an errand boy

01:50:49.566 --> 01:50:52.402
To be under their beck and call
Do all their dirty jobs like a slave

01:50:52.444 --> 01:50:53.987
I'll anyway lose

01:50:54.029 --> 01:50:56.949
'I am agreeable to being an 'alti'
but they insist I should play. master'

01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:58.951
I snitched to you. right?

01:50:58.951 --> 01:51:00.994
Using Kabaddi as an excuse
as if it's just a game

01:51:01.036 --> 01:51:02.955
'...they plan to bash me up. master'

01:51:03.330 --> 01:51:04.581
'Hey Undiyal...!'

01:51:05.332 --> 01:51:06.375
Come. da

01:51:08.377 --> 01:51:09.503
Look here

01:51:09.545 --> 01:51:10.546
Look at me

01:51:10.587 --> 01:51:11.839
'I am calling you...dai!'

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:14.299
Coming or shall I lift you
and bring you here to play?

01:51:14.341 --> 01:51:16.260
More than the aches
from blows and kicks

01:51:16.718 --> 01:51:18.595
Pain from fear hurts deeper!

01:51:19.346 --> 01:51:20.430
Go with courage. da

01:51:21.348 --> 01:51:23.183
Go and check what he's doing

01:51:23.225 --> 01:51:25.102
Das. he is coming

01:51:50.335 --> 01:51:51.336
Tell me. Madhi

01:51:51.378 --> 01:51:53.380
You snitched about us
to the master. right?

01:51:53.422 --> 01:51:55.174
- Face us now
- Hey!

01:51:55.215 --> 01:51:56.633
I know very well. da

01:51:56.675 --> 01:51:59.052
If Bala plays we will win for sure

01:51:59.094 --> 01:52:01.388
So you got scared and
broke his hand. right?

01:52:01.513 --> 01:52:03.265
Had he been here
would he have defeated us?

01:52:03.307 --> 01:52:05.642
For sure then you would
have lost pathetically

01:52:06.018 --> 01:52:08.896
Call whomever. how many ever boys
you want from here to play on your side

01:52:08.937 --> 01:52:11.398
I'll call anyone I want but then
you can't go back on your word

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:14.359
Call. we won't send you back
without breaking all your teeth today!

01:52:17.154 --> 01:52:19.406
MAAASTER!

"Clash of wills here"

01:52:24.453 --> 01:52:26.330
"You are ready for your bier"

"Kabaddi...kabaddi...to show your strength"

01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:48.185
- Tell me. Madhi
- 'I checked the results'

01:52:48.227 --> 01:52:51.021
I am sure all 6 of them
are above 20 years of age

01:52:54.274 --> 01:52:56.026

"One foot in the grave. no fear
You are ready for your bier"

01:53:02.866 --> 01:53:04.159
What are you saying?

01:53:04.535 --> 01:53:06.537
Not one of them is less than 18?

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:09.206
100% sure. in those 6 boys
no one is younger than 18

01:53:15.587 --> 01:53:17.673
"On your mark. get set. ready"

01:53:22.719 --> 01:53:24.388
"Bash them up deadly"

01:53:26.014 --> 01:53:29.017
Master.. at least do you know
the name of this game?

01:53:29.059 --> 01:53:31.103
'This is not cricket or football'

01:53:31.144 --> 01:53:33.730
You must hold your breath and
repeat 'kabaddi'. you know?

01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:36.692
Our rules are different

01:53:36.733 --> 01:53:38.360
You can't just touch and run

01:53:38.652 --> 01:53:40.696
You must toss your opponent
outside the line

01:53:40.737 --> 01:53:42.447
What...still want to play?

01:53:45.033 --> 01:53:46.159

Bingo!

'He got a solid slap'

01:54:35.125 --> 01:54:36.627
Knock him down

Lift him

01:55:19.628 --> 01:55:22.339
You dare lay a finger on us
Just you wait and watch!

01:55:23.465 --> 01:55:25.133
Come...come

01:55:29.054 --> 01:55:31.306

Watch the line

on these boys just once more

01:57:25.921 --> 01:57:27.172
Master...?

01:57:27.464 --> 01:57:29.466
- What?
- Is it okay to talk frankly?

01:57:29.508 --> 01:57:31.885
- Camera is recording everything
- Go on. doesn't matter

01:57:31.927 --> 01:57:33.178
I'll tell you. master

01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:35.222
My mother passed away
when I was born

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:37.975
My neighbor sister raised me

01:57:38.559 --> 01:57:41.311
My father asked that sister
if she will sleep with him!

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.896
That's why

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:45.107
I threw the grinding stone on his head

01:57:45.148 --> 01:57:47.693
Immediately the police put me in jail

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.863
'That's when I got
trapped with brother Das'

01:57:50.904 --> 01:57:54.116
From then on I had to listen
only to what brother Das says

01:57:56.034 --> 01:57:57.286
Brother Das will walk in

01:57:57.369 --> 01:57:59.454
He will check who is addicted to drugs

01:58:00.122 --> 01:58:03.041
Powder. smoke. booze
He will increase the dosage

01:58:04.459 --> 01:58:06.170
Which one of you here

01:58:07.462 --> 01:58:09.131
...has seen Bhavani?

Bhavani?

01:58:10.632 --> 01:58:12.509
Where have I heard this name?

01:58:12.551 --> 01:58:14.261
'Somehow sounds familiar'

01:58:14.303 --> 01:58:15.304
Master

01:58:15.679 --> 01:58:18.640
We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him

01:58:18.682 --> 01:58:21.059
Brother Das is 'be all and end all' here

01:58:21.143 --> 01:58:22.895
We must obey him implicitly

01:58:22.936 --> 01:58:25.564
'If he asks us to surrender
we should do so with our eyes closed'

01:58:25.606 --> 01:58:26.940
Otherwise we will be hanged

01:58:26.982 --> 01:58:28.525
'They recently hanged 2 boys'

01:58:28.567 --> 01:58:30.110
'Didn't you see that. master?'

01:58:31.612 --> 01:58:33.947
Do you all want to go home
and live with your family?

01:58:34.239 --> 01:58:35.866
Or do you want to surrender?

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.910
- Go home. master
- Be with our family

01:58:39.161 --> 01:58:40.996
You have been here for 10 days

01:58:41.038 --> 01:58:43.248
We haven't taken to drugs till now

01:58:43.290 --> 01:58:45.292
Only now we know
our own selves

01:58:46.293 --> 01:58:48.545
Somehow save us from here. master

01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:52.299
If you follow what I say. you can
go home and live as you wish

01:58:52.341 --> 01:58:53.383
Will you do as I say?

01:58:53.425 --> 01:58:55.636
- Yes. master
- We will

01:58:55.677 --> 01:59:00.390
Whatever you shared with me now
will you tell the same to the magistrate?

01:59:00.432 --> 01:59:02.392
Of course we will. master

01:59:02.434 --> 01:59:05.229
I'll arrange all the formalities
to get them out on parole

01:59:05.312 --> 01:59:06.313
Thanks. sir

01:59:06.355 --> 01:59:08.482
Let the video evidence
be with Charu till then

01:59:08.565 --> 01:59:10.526
It will reach the magistrate
when you say so

01:59:10.567 --> 01:59:14.029
Master. you shot some video
and cleverly made us confess

01:59:14.071 --> 01:59:15.989
You haven't shared your story

01:59:15.989 --> 01:59:17.282
Tell us
Let's listen

01:59:17.366 --> 01:59:18.450
'Ask him. da'

01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:19.660
Cat got your tongue. huh?

01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.620
- Tell us
- Tell us. master

01:59:21.662 --> 01:59:23.247
'Please share your story. master'

01:59:23.288 --> 01:59:25.082
We are asking. right?
Please tell us

01:59:25.123 --> 01:59:27.876
Don't ask for trouble
Trust my voice of experience!

01:59:27.918 --> 01:59:29.753
Wait. they are very eager to hear

01:59:29.837 --> 01:59:31.129
I'll be happy to share
Let them enjoy

01:59:31.338 --> 01:59:33.257
I was in college then

01:59:33.298 --> 01:59:35.050
'I think it was my final year'

01:59:35.092 --> 01:59:38.220
A new teacher joined our college

01:59:38.345 --> 01:59:40.138
Her name was Malar

01:59:40.722 --> 01:59:42.933
Unbelievable one in a million 'Love'

01:59:48.188 --> 01:59:50.148
All of a sudden that girl I loved

01:59:50.691 --> 01:59:52.150
...met with an accident

01:59:52.192 --> 01:59:53.652
'She forgot her past'

01:59:53.694 --> 01:59:56.029
She didn't even know who I was

01:59:56.363 --> 01:59:58.365
She even forgot my mad love for her

01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:03.161
Fate made me attend her wedding
present a bouquet with my own hands!

02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:05.873
After tha-

02:00:06.874 --> 02:00:09.710
Dai! Why are all of you
sniffling and crying?

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:12.129
Now that girl has totally
forgotten our past

02:00:12.212 --> 02:00:14.548
Master. isn't that teacher sister Charu?

02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:17.301
Hey. this sister is teacher
working as my colleague now

02:00:17.342 --> 02:00:19.303
That was my college time

02:00:19.344 --> 02:00:21.471
Down memory lane
Malar teacher

02:00:21.513 --> 02:00:23.515
Dai. don't you watch Malayalam movies?

02:00:23.557 --> 02:00:25.517
If I don't understand the language

02:00:25.559 --> 02:00:26.643
- I won't watch
- Okay

02:00:26.685 --> 02:00:28.478
Getting late
All of you leave

02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:30.689
Class tomorrow morning as usual

02:00:30.731 --> 02:00:32.316
Okay. master
Bye. master

02:00:32.357 --> 02:00:36.195
How much longer will you quote a film story
if someone asks you about your past life?

02:00:36.236 --> 02:00:39.156
Fool yourself in the bargain
and trick others too?

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:40.616
Which is a film story?

02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:42.159
Don't act

02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:44.161
What you narrated was
Malayalam film 'Premam'

02:00:44.161 --> 02:00:46.997
Copy cats! They stole my story
and it is released. huh?

02:00:47.122 --> 02:00:49.666
One track mind
on plagiarism. huh?

02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:53.337
Okay. what do you want to know?

02:00:53.378 --> 02:00:54.379
Tell me

02:00:54.421 --> 02:00:56.298
Why did you start drinking?

02:00:57.674 --> 02:00:59.510
Every drunkard will have a story

02:00:59.551 --> 02:01:00.844
Why go into it now?

02:01:01.094 --> 02:01:02.387
If I tell you my reason

02:01:02.429 --> 02:01:05.891
...a handful of them
will follow my footsteps

02:01:07.309 --> 02:01:09.186
Is that necessary?
Isn't it wrong?

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:10.479
Okay...okay

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:13.524
I won't tell you now
why I got into this habit

02:01:13.982 --> 02:01:16.568
If you like I'll tell you
why I quit. shall I?

02:01:28.622 --> 02:01:33.919
"When we see those eyes of his
won't love automatically bloom in us?"

02:01:33.961 --> 02:01:39.424
"When we go close to him especially
won't our mind skip like a deer joyfully?"

02:01:40.968 --> 02:01:44.346
"Residing in her heart all the time
His style. his stride so sublime"

02:01:44.388 --> 02:01:49.977
"Featuring in her dreams always
24x7 is his charming dear face"

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.356
"He is Mr Handsome truly
He is our Master. one and only"

02:01:54.398 --> 02:01:57.693
"His smile. not too much. not too less"

02:01:57.734 --> 02:02:01.947
"His charisma beams through in excess"

02:02:02.531 --> 02:02:05.242
"His heart is soft as a flower
Youthfulness is his signature"

02:02:05.284 --> 02:02:07.953
"I pity our girls for sure"

02:02:07.995 --> 02:02:10.664
"His smile is like a sparkler
He's good natured forever"

02:02:10.706 --> 02:02:13.292
"This master with his class
covers one and all en masse"

02:02:13.333 --> 02:02:18.547
"If his fire work-glance falls on you
even a failed heart will pass too"

02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:22.009
"He is single. our news a fact
This is your chance to act"

02:02:22.050 --> 02:02:27.097
"When we see those eyes of his
won't love naturally blossom in us?"

02:02:27.139 --> 02:02:31.935
"When we go close to him especially
won't our mind skip like a deer joyfully?"

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:34.021
JD is an orphan

02:02:34.354 --> 02:02:36.273
Just grew like a wild tree

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:37.900
Only after joining this college

02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:39.234
'...he met a professor'

02:02:39.276 --> 02:02:42.196
'His friendship and care
changed JD's life altogether'

02:02:42.237 --> 02:02:43.363
V.C.Selvam!

02:02:43.864 --> 02:02:45.908
But unfortunately he had a health issue

02:02:45.949 --> 02:02:47.951
'He got admitted
in a hospital to get treated-'

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:49.703
That really shattered JD

02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:51.997
After that he was unable to sleep

02:02:52.039 --> 02:02:55.375
'That bloody alcohol took over him'

02:02:55.417 --> 02:02:59.046
"Residing in her heart all the time
His style. his stride so divine"

02:02:59.087 --> 02:03:04.676
"Featuring in her dreams always
24x7 is his endearing dear face"

02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:08.430
"He is Mr Handsome truly
He is our Master. one and only"

02:03:08.472 --> 02:03:12.267
"His smile. not too much. not too less"

02:03:12.309 --> 02:03:15.938
"His charisma beams through in excess"

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:19.942
"Friendly gaze he sweeps
Calm and collected he speaks"

02:03:19.983 --> 02:03:22.528
"No holds barred at all
All of them flip and fall"

02:03:22.569 --> 02:03:25.489
"Magnetic personality
Quick & slick. sharp is he"

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:27.699
"Our master is always
Top in all ways"

02:03:27.908 --> 02:03:33.288
"Some kind of innate power he displays
Endearing temerity always in place"

02:03:33.330 --> 02:03:36.542
"If he stands solo; which Miss
won't yearn to be his Mrs?"

02:03:36.583 --> 02:03:40.379
"When we see those eyes of his
won't love naturally blossom in us?"

02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:41.922
What-?

02:03:42.422 --> 02:03:43.924
Please move

02:03:50.889 --> 02:03:52.057
Hey!

02:04:00.357 --> 02:04:01.525
Come on

02:04:02.651 --> 02:04:04.319
[mobile ringing]

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:12.536
Tell me. Charu

02:04:12.619 --> 02:04:13.912
Sir. don't know who they are

02:04:13.954 --> 02:04:15.831
'2 or 3 boys are chasing me'

02:04:15.873 --> 02:04:18.375
Charu. where are you?
Which area?

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:20.460
In Triplicane. Murugan temple

02:04:20.502 --> 02:04:22.337
Road opposite Murugan temple

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.970
Charu?

02:04:30.637 --> 02:04:31.972
Charu...?

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:36.268
Follow me

02:04:50.199 --> 02:04:53.452
'They started chasing me when I was
on my way to the magistrate's house'

02:04:53.493 --> 02:04:56.121
I don't know what to do
or where to go

02:04:56.205 --> 02:04:57.539
Charu. don't be scared

02:04:57.581 --> 02:04:58.874
'I will send our boys'

02:04:58.916 --> 02:05:01.835
Go inside some shop there

02:05:01.877 --> 02:05:03.629
'Enter a shop to be safe'

02:05:04.546 --> 02:05:06.715
'Thank you for calling. Parandhaman'

02:05:08.175 --> 02:05:10.344
- I've come into a shop. sir
- Turn on the speaker

02:05:10.511 --> 02:05:12.137
What do you need?

02:05:12.179 --> 02:05:14.556
'Bro. 1 minute please
Listen to what I have to say'

02:05:15.724 --> 02:05:17.684
'Let this girl hide
in your shop for a while'

02:05:17.726 --> 02:05:19.144
I'll send my men. please

02:05:19.186 --> 02:05:22.147
My business will get affected
Don't involve me. clear out

02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:23.941
Aren't you a fiery blooded youth?

02:05:24.024 --> 02:05:25.317
'Speak boldly'

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:27.694
Bro. I'll take care

02:05:27.736 --> 02:05:29.446
- 'You don't worry'
- Thank you. brother

02:05:29.488 --> 02:05:30.906
Come here. dear

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:49.383
- Did a girl come in here?
- No

02:05:49.424 --> 02:05:53.637
"My dark and bold beau
why was he Uncle Scrooge?"

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:58.600
"He made my heart soft and cottony
quake with desire; explode in rhapsody"

02:05:59.726 --> 02:06:04.314
"Tell me the auspicious time
when wedding bells will chime?"

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:07.609
[song from 'Pudhu Nellu Pudhu Naathu']

02:06:07.734 --> 02:06:10.112
- Master. they are teasing m-
- Sshhhhhhhhhh!

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:14.157
"He made my heart soft and cottony
quake with desire; explode in rhapsody"

02:06:16.451 --> 02:06:18.370
'I told you no one came in here'

02:06:19.955 --> 02:06:21.623
'Bro. where are you going in?'

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:22.708
'Listen'

02:06:22.749 --> 02:06:24.168
'He already told you no one is here'

02:06:24.334 --> 02:06:25.878
Oldie. shut up

02:06:34.845 --> 02:06:36.346
Give it of your own accord

02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:38.557
Or else just 2 punches
I'll smash your face

02:06:38.599 --> 02:06:40.559
If I have to grab it from you-

02:06:40.601 --> 02:06:42.102
- Dai...dai
- Wait. master

02:06:42.186 --> 02:06:43.687
This face looks familiar

02:06:44.313 --> 02:06:45.314
'Sister'

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:49.151
'Turn your phone towards him'

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:52.654
Hey Undiyal...!

02:06:52.696 --> 02:06:54.740
'Hey Button. my dear friend!'

02:06:55.365 --> 02:06:56.450
Undiyal. da

02:06:56.533 --> 02:06:58.243
What are you doing
in this video call?

02:06:58.285 --> 02:07:00.621
Dai. the girl you are chasing is my sister

02:07:00.662 --> 02:07:02.289
- 'Your sister?
- Yes'

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.374
I didn't know that

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:07.169
I was asked to finish her
That's way I chased her

02:07:07.336 --> 02:07:09.296
But tell me. why are you chasing her?

02:07:10.714 --> 02:07:12.633
- What is that?
- She has a camera

02:07:13.675 --> 02:07:15.135
I believe she has a camera

02:07:15.177 --> 02:07:17.387
Ask her to give it
and we'll leave

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:19.723
Sister. give him what he wants

02:07:19.848 --> 02:07:21.350
We will deal with this differently

02:07:21.391 --> 02:07:22.601
'Okay?'

02:07:23.018 --> 02:07:24.311
'Just give it. sister'

02:07:24.353 --> 02:07:28.023
"My eyes can't close at night
without leaning on your chest in delight"

02:07:33.237 --> 02:07:34.446
'Hey Button'

02:07:34.905 --> 02:07:36.990
I told you she's my sister
I didn't hear your apology?

02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:38.617
- Apologize to her
- Sorry. sister

02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:40.285
'Hey! You boys too'

02:07:40.410 --> 02:07:41.620
Sorry. sister

02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:43.664
Glad you are that scared of me!

02:07:43.705 --> 02:07:46.166
Master. end of incident
Sister safe from any accident

02:07:46.208 --> 02:07:47.960
You talk to her
I'll wait there

02:07:49.002 --> 02:07:51.421
Charu. leave that place immediately

02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:54.675
"Trust us even if we are teeny
For you. we get our hands dirty"

02:07:54.716 --> 02:07:58.637
"We can steal a weapon in jail
Chase you. hot on your trail"

02:07:58.679 --> 02:08:02.850
"Chew a gum for flavor
Take the boys you favor"

02:08:03.225 --> 02:08:05.227
Dai. who are all of you?

02:08:05.644 --> 02:08:07.437
What are you doing?

02:08:07.563 --> 02:08:08.689
Look

02:08:09.731 --> 02:08:11.275
What is this tattoo?

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:12.401
This branding?

02:08:12.442 --> 02:08:14.027
When boys are sent to this Home

02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:16.989
Brother Das will pick up
the sharp ones and train us

02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:20.367
When we get released. he will tattoo
our hand with this Tamil letter 'pa'

02:08:20.492 --> 02:08:23.620
If we show this tattoo in the Mess.
we can eat to our stomach's content

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:26.164
If you are older. you'll get
plenty of booze and cigarettes

02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:28.166
You can get clothes for free
from their textile shop

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:31.044
They will even get you
dope from a pharmacy

02:08:32.212 --> 02:08:33.255
But the hitch is

02:08:34.173 --> 02:08:37.593
Every now and then. they will
make us surrender for a crime

02:08:37.634 --> 02:08:39.928
Not to get back into the old
bad ways. I'm staying aloof

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.728
'We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him'

02:08:47.853 --> 02:08:50.147
'Brother Das is 'be all and end all' here'

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.690
'We must obey him implicitly'

02:08:51.732 --> 02:08:53.984
- Is it a newly released film?
- 'No one can defy him'

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:56.320
'He asks you to surrender
we should. with our eyes closed'

02:08:56.361 --> 02:08:57.946
How did you lose track of her?

02:08:58.113 --> 02:09:00.532
Don't know how. Bhavani
I sent only professionals

02:09:00.616 --> 02:09:02.201
- Somehow they messed up-
- Shut up!

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:07.206
What do we do with this. bro?

02:09:07.331 --> 02:09:11.293
It has a card inside which stores
whatever we shoot or click

02:09:11.335 --> 02:09:14.546
Break that card alone and
keep the camera at my place

02:09:15.088 --> 02:09:16.089
Okay

02:09:16.131 --> 02:09:17.841
When are they announcing the results?

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:19.676
Heard it's Monday or Tuesday

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:21.428
You'll anyway win unopposed

02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:23.096
Why should you be tense?

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.891
- I can enjoy. right?
- Yes. then what?

02:09:28.644 --> 02:09:29.853
Sit here

02:09:32.606 --> 02:09:34.191
Do you know this ostrich?

02:09:34.942 --> 02:09:37.194
A bird with a long neck like this

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:39.238
Have you seen its egg?
It will be this big

02:09:39.363 --> 02:09:41.365
So big in size

02:09:42.366 --> 02:09:45.160
But only that ostrich will know
the pain of hatching such an egg!

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:48.539
Will you sit here even after
I've explained to you?

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.040
No. Bava

02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:51.625
- Get lost!
- No. Bhavani

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:55.254
Bhavani. boys want a booze party

02:09:55.295 --> 02:09:56.672
You won't anyway drink

02:09:56.713 --> 02:09:57.923
At least for them-

02:09:59.341 --> 02:10:01.134
Drink to dig your own grave

02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:03.554
- Go ahead
- Thanks a lot. Bhavani

02:10:04.179 --> 02:10:05.973
- 'Goodnight. Bava'
- Goodnight

02:10:10.477 --> 02:10:12.354
Somehow you made me
show you this place

02:10:12.646 --> 02:10:14.731
I was staying away
from this place

02:10:14.898 --> 02:10:16.316
Let's go back. master

02:10:17.234 --> 02:10:19.236
Wait. I have a good reason

02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:20.279
We'll go soon

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.865
'Right. you haven't come here to eat'

02:10:22.906 --> 02:10:26.702
- 'What happened to my chicken 'pakoda'?
- Narayana. serve him'

02:10:27.369 --> 02:10:30.289
I thought you were inviting me
for a candle light dinner

02:10:30.330 --> 02:10:32.291
Last time I came here.
there was no power

02:10:32.332 --> 02:10:33.709
They had lit only candles

02:10:36.044 --> 02:10:37.337
Okay. relax

02:10:38.672 --> 02:10:40.340
Don't look at this place

02:10:40.716 --> 02:10:42.968
I heard the food here is super

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:45.345
'Get a token for the meals'

02:10:46.346 --> 02:10:47.639
'Madam. you too'

02:10:48.348 --> 02:10:50.058
I thought we'll have some privacy

02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:53.729
Close your eyes and
show me your right hand

02:10:54.313 --> 02:10:56.315
- Why?
- Show. I'll tell you

02:11:00.277 --> 02:11:02.988
You shouldn't open your eyes
till I tell you

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:06.450
'Open now'

02:11:09.703 --> 02:11:12.456
That boy's hand in the salon
had this same mark

02:11:12.497 --> 02:11:13.999
Show this over there

02:11:14.583 --> 02:11:16.293
Ask for 'meals' token

02:11:18.086 --> 02:11:19.463
Why should I-

02:11:19.505 --> 02:11:21.423
All for a good reason
Go and show your hand

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:57.125
Who the hell is he?

02:12:15.978 --> 02:12:18.313
'We don't differentiate or discriminate'

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:21.650
'Whoever has a Tamil letter 'pa'
tattooed on their hands...'

02:12:21.692 --> 02:12:24.027
...we give them whatever they ask

02:12:26.655 --> 02:12:29.032
Bhavani's boys will take care of the rest

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:41.920
What is this for?

02:12:41.962 --> 02:12:43.881
Still some balance left
in my bucket list!

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:10.532
"Let the drums beat; no restraint
Let the party rock; no constraint"

02:13:10.616 --> 02:13:15.662
"Let our army smash and slam
Our earth will quake with the wham"

02:13:15.704 --> 02:13:20.375
"My hands will never miss a beat
when I beat the drum ever so neat"

02:13:20.417 --> 02:13:24.296
"Even the dormant nerve will dance
hearing my drum's resonance"

02:13:24.338 --> 02:13:25.506
'Beat it!'

02:13:25.547 --> 02:13:30.135
"Till the sun rises to a new day
let the ground shake and sway"

02:13:30.344 --> 02:13:35.224
"Till the game is won. job is done
slow down but have your fun"

02:13:35.432 --> 02:13:39.269
"Even the Lord of Death Yama will die
if he glares with his razor sharp eye"

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:40.354
'Hey boy!'

02:13:40.395 --> 02:13:44.399
"Light the camphor for our Lord
He is possessed by our demi-god"

02:13:45.108 --> 02:13:49.988
"Look high and low diligently
Every nook & corner and alley"

02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:54.159
"There is no other big gun to defy
Or create a ruckus and vilify"

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:55.160
'Bhavani!'

02:14:08.966 --> 02:14:12.052
That master is churning in my mind

02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:14.721
Tell him to kill that master
tomorrow before day break

02:14:15.222 --> 02:14:18.308
Why wait till tomorrow morning?
We can close his chapter right now

02:14:21.353 --> 02:14:23.939
Shut your gob
Just do what I say

02:14:26.567 --> 02:14:30.737
"Let the force of his punching fist
make the drumhead rip and split"

02:14:31.113 --> 02:14:35.534
"Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo!
Announce who struck the blow"

02:14:39.913 --> 02:14:40.914
'You there!'

02:14:40.998 --> 02:14:45.961
"Let the force of his punching fist
make the drumhead rip and split"

02:14:46.003 --> 02:14:50.382
"Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo!
Announce who struck the blow"

02:14:50.465 --> 02:14:54.928
"Shaking his stupor. without a doubt
he is all set to rip your gut out"

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:59.516
"To hang you upside down
and skin you alive is his vow"

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:00.684
'Master...!'

02:15:10.736 --> 02:15:15.282
"Let the drums roll; no restraint
Let the party rock; no constraint"

02:15:15.532 --> 02:15:20.120
"Let our army smash and slam
Our earth will quake with the wham"

02:15:20.621 --> 02:15:25.542
"My hands will never miss a beat
when I beat the drum; it's a royal treat"

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:29.171
"Even the dormant nerve will dance
hearing my drum's resonance"

02:15:29.213 --> 02:15:30.547
'Rock & roll'

02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:35.969
"Till the sun rises to a new day
let the ground shake and sway"

02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:37.930
Give me Dinkie Dow if you have

02:15:37.971 --> 02:15:39.389
I don't stock drugs

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:44.228
"Even the Lord of Death Yama will die
if he glares with his razor sharp eye"

02:15:44.353 --> 02:15:45.145
'Hey boy'

02:15:45.354 --> 02:15:49.858
"Light the camphor for our Lord
He is possessed by our demi-god"

02:16:15.926 --> 02:16:18.470
"Got the man with the plan right here"

02:16:18.554 --> 02:16:20.973
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

02:16:21.098 --> 02:16:25.143
Forward all the videos
to the police department

02:16:25.227 --> 02:16:28.981
I'll bring the boys
to the Magistrate directly

02:16:29.106 --> 02:16:30.148
Okay

02:16:31.608 --> 02:16:32.693
Master

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:35.153
This is Bhavani brother's truck

02:16:35.279 --> 02:16:37.781
I've heard he comes here often

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:40.534
Let's go there

02:16:40.617 --> 02:16:43.120
Aiyaiyo! Are you joking. master?

02:16:43.203 --> 02:16:45.581
I am not coming
You go if you want

02:16:50.544 --> 02:16:53.213
"A whole night of merry-making"

02:16:54.298 --> 02:16:56.967
"Day spent in sleep overtaking"

02:16:57.593 --> 02:17:03.599
"This is the world we rejoice
Reveling in unforbidden joys"

02:17:05.601 --> 02:17:12.232
"A whole night of merry-making
Day spent in sleep overtaking"

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:18.530
"This is the world we rejoice
Reveling in unforbidden joys"

02:17:20.157 --> 02:17:23.619
"A whole night of partying"

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:26.496
[song from 'Navarathiri']

02:17:27.122 --> 02:17:30.584
"This is our universe
for better or worse"

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:32.878
You move I'll stab you

02:17:32.961 --> 02:17:34.296
Walk straight ahead

02:17:41.845 --> 02:17:44.306
"What existed before birth"

02:17:44.348 --> 02:17:45.390
Knock. da

02:17:45.432 --> 02:17:47.851
"Even you can't unearth"

02:17:49.269 --> 02:17:50.812
To top it all
a secret code!

02:17:50.854 --> 02:17:55.442
"What happens after we die
Even I don't know the right reply"

02:17:57.194 --> 02:17:59.613
If any hand reaches out to his weapon

02:18:00.364 --> 02:18:01.740
He will end up a corpse

02:18:02.241 --> 02:18:03.450
Kneel. man

02:18:04.368 --> 02:18:06.245
- Kneel down
- Switch off the song

02:18:07.287 --> 02:18:08.956
Damn. switch it off!

02:18:11.792 --> 02:18:13.377
Who is Bhavani here?

02:18:14.503 --> 02:18:15.546
Huh?

02:18:16.338 --> 02:18:18.298
Which one of you here
has seen Bhavani?

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:36.567
What kind of sissy name
is that...Bhavani?

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:39.486
Was he lying on his stomach
as a baby when he was named?

02:18:44.116 --> 02:18:45.242
Shabaa!

02:18:46.201 --> 02:18:47.953
Let me make it clear once more

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:52.082
If any of you do something stupid
trying to retaliate

02:18:52.749 --> 02:18:55.460
I'll sign on your man's
Adam's apple. got it?

02:18:55.752 --> 02:18:57.671
'Try your luck flinging another bottle?'

02:18:57.963 --> 02:18:59.423
That means

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:02.593
You know Bhavani very well

02:19:04.428 --> 02:19:07.347
Will you go and repeat this
to him verbatim?

02:19:08.557 --> 02:19:10.100
Bhavani...Bhavani

02:19:10.976 --> 02:19:12.686
Bhavani...Bhavani

02:19:14.605 --> 02:19:17.441
A man walked in right royally
knowing it is your den. Bhavani

02:19:18.609 --> 02:19:19.776
Repeat. da

02:19:20.235 --> 02:19:21.945
No. you tell me
I'll convey it

02:19:21.987 --> 02:19:24.615
No. you are scared

02:19:25.699 --> 02:19:28.243
'Listen. I might as well tell all of you'

02:19:28.285 --> 02:19:31.163
The day you killed those 2 boys in
the Observation Home and hung them

02:19:31.205 --> 02:19:33.123
I hung my head in guilt and died

02:19:33.707 --> 02:19:35.834
I'm least bothered about myself hereafter

02:19:36.835 --> 02:19:39.922
Branding those juveniles with a tattoo
and making them do your dirty work

02:19:39.963 --> 02:19:41.298
I've put a full stop to it

02:19:41.632 --> 02:19:45.177
From now on. anyone wants to do anything
using the boys as lambs for the slaughter

02:19:45.219 --> 02:19:47.888
...has to kill me and then go ahead
but that has a slight hitch

02:19:48.722 --> 02:19:52.476
I will kill minimum 10 of you
and only then breathe my last

02:19:53.936 --> 02:19:57.189
Be it Bhavani
or Banumathi!!!

02:19:58.774 --> 02:20:00.609
Will you go and tell him
word by word?

02:20:01.485 --> 02:20:02.778
Come. get up

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:09.409
Close the door

02:20:26.635 --> 02:20:28.387
Who threw that bottle at me. da?

02:20:30.848 --> 02:20:31.890
Come here

02:20:31.932 --> 02:20:33.392
No. Bhavani

02:20:33.433 --> 02:20:35.435
I aimed it at him

02:20:35.477 --> 02:20:38.146
The pen will fall down and
you can escape I thought

02:20:38.188 --> 02:20:39.398
'But it missed and-'

02:20:39.606 --> 02:20:41.650
Hey! Lazy lout
Open the door

02:20:41.692 --> 02:20:42.860
- 'Open the door
- Madcap!'

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:45.404
- Open the door. da
- What false bravado!

02:20:45.445 --> 02:20:47.364
Son of a scumbag!
Open it. damn you

02:20:47.406 --> 02:20:49.783
Where did you go?
Open now. I'll kill you

02:20:49.867 --> 02:20:50.909
'Hey! Open'

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:53.120
'How dare you lay a hand
on Bhavani when I'm here?'

02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:54.162
- Kottamuthu
- Come now

02:20:54.246 --> 02:20:56.164
- Hey Kottamuthu
- What did you think of us?

02:20:56.206 --> 02:20:57.916
Bro is calling you

02:20:57.958 --> 02:20:58.959
Come here

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:03.547
- What are you doing?
- He locked us in

02:21:03.589 --> 02:21:05.674
He was holding a knife
to my neck for an hour

02:21:05.716 --> 02:21:07.176
WTH were you doing then?

02:21:07.217 --> 02:21:09.386
Bhavani. that wasn't a knife

02:21:09.595 --> 02:21:11.972
- It was a pen
- You knew it. huh?

02:21:12.097 --> 02:21:14.933
How will he open the door
if you yell after he has gone?

02:21:14.975 --> 02:21:16.518
Shall we pen him a letter?

02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:18.145
'Sir. please open the door'

02:21:21.523 --> 02:21:22.983
Don't hit me. Bhavani

02:21:30.115 --> 02:21:31.241
Who can draw very well here?

02:21:31.283 --> 02:21:32.910
Master. he is our best artist

02:21:32.910 --> 02:21:36.413
He's the madcap who doodles foul stuff
all over the toilet and the walls. master

02:21:38.373 --> 02:21:39.374
'Hi master'

02:21:39.416 --> 02:21:40.959
I believe you came to my den

02:21:41.084 --> 02:21:44.379
Threatened a man with a pen and
conveyed an important message to Bhavani

02:21:44.421 --> 02:21:45.797
I am that Bhavani

02:21:45.881 --> 02:21:46.924
'Vanakkam'

02:21:46.965 --> 02:21:51.595
If you destroy all that I own.
textile shop. hotel. wine shop

02:21:52.179 --> 02:21:55.557
What the hell will he do?
He is himself a criminal

02:21:55.599 --> 02:21:57.768
'You assumed I won't
go to the police. right?'

02:21:57.809 --> 02:21:59.686
Your assumption is 100% right

02:21:59.853 --> 02:22:01.730
But thinking you'll make
a fool of me was wrong

02:22:01.772 --> 02:22:02.981
'I enquired about you'

02:22:03.106 --> 02:22:05.692
I believe you have a big gang
of ardent fan followers

02:22:05.734 --> 02:22:08.529
'Which one of them can I finish off?
I asked my boys their choice'

02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:11.907
They said we can have a jolly time
killing them all without discrimination

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:14.785
Let me give you a task
Take a pen and paper'

02:22:14.868 --> 02:22:18.830
List out your favorites
in alphabetical order

02:22:18.872 --> 02:22:20.123
Hey Bhavani!

02:22:20.165 --> 02:22:23.085
Don't ignore girls and kids
thinking I'll be soft on them

02:22:23.126 --> 02:22:25.212
Include their names too definitely

02:22:25.254 --> 02:22:27.548
'Write and call each one of them'

02:22:27.589 --> 02:22:29.591
And then...master?

02:22:31.426 --> 02:22:32.678
Give me the phone

02:22:32.719 --> 02:22:33.887
'Hello...?'

02:22:34.137 --> 02:22:36.181
- Why did he hang up on me?
- 'Must have got scared'

02:22:36.223 --> 02:22:37.432
Got very emotional I guess

02:22:38.433 --> 02:22:41.395
Why do emotional men
get so hyper and angry?

02:22:46.733 --> 02:22:49.570
Pick...pick...pick up my call

02:22:54.116 --> 02:22:55.409
Pick up

02:22:55.450 --> 02:22:56.660
- Hi. dude
- Where are you?

02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:57.911
I'm just leaving my office

02:22:57.953 --> 02:22:59.705
- You are safe?
- Yes. what's the problem?

02:22:59.746 --> 02:23:01.582
'Listen to me
Don't step out'

02:23:01.623 --> 02:23:03.417
What is the proble-

02:23:04.168 --> 02:23:05.627
Come on. pick up

02:23:06.295 --> 02:23:07.546
- Sir?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

02:23:07.588 --> 02:23:09.089
- Shut u-
- 'I hope you're safe?'

02:23:09.131 --> 02:23:10.757
- 'Yes. sir. what happened?'
- Listen

02:23:10.841 --> 02:23:13.594
Check if our batch students
are safe. okay?

02:23:13.635 --> 02:23:15.137
'Madhi. where is Srinath?'

02:23:15.179 --> 02:23:16.180
'He is here. JD'

02:23:16.221 --> 02:23:17.973
- What is it?
- 'Stay at home. don't go out'

02:23:18.015 --> 02:23:19.099
'Everything safe?'

02:23:19.141 --> 02:23:20.225
JD called me

02:23:20.267 --> 02:23:21.643
'He was so hassled'

02:23:21.685 --> 02:23:23.520
'He told us not to step out'

02:23:23.562 --> 02:23:26.440
Guys. don't step out of your house
Most important. avoid road travel

02:23:26.481 --> 02:23:30.194
'In case you are out. go to any house
or shop nearby or any safe place'

02:23:30.235 --> 02:23:32.654
'JD sir called just now
I think there's a major problem'

02:23:32.696 --> 02:23:33.989
'If you are safe'

02:23:34.114 --> 02:23:36.116
For heaven's sake
text our entire group

02:23:36.158 --> 02:23:37.242
Park the bike

02:23:40.621 --> 02:23:42.915
'Almost everyone in the group
texted they are safe'

02:23:42.956 --> 02:23:45.751
But we couldn't reach
only Bhargav and Savitha. sir

02:23:45.792 --> 02:23:47.419
Don't swerve too much to the right

02:23:47.878 --> 02:23:49.338
Careful!

02:23:52.758 --> 02:23:53.842
Hello?

02:23:53.884 --> 02:23:54.927
I am safe-

02:23:57.721 --> 02:23:58.889
Vanathi. where are you?

02:23:58.931 --> 02:24:00.557
In a mall nearby
What happened?

02:24:00.599 --> 02:24:02.392
- Is Prem with you?
- 'Yes. da'

02:24:02.434 --> 02:24:04.394
He has gone to fetch
my purse from the car-

02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:07.272
'VANATHI. WHAT IS IT?'

02:24:07.314 --> 02:24:08.690
'What happened. Vanathi?'

02:24:08.774 --> 02:24:10.317
'VANATHI. TALK TO ME
What is it?

02:24:12.361 --> 02:24:13.570
VANATHI

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:16.240
- 'Where are you. da?'
- Theater. why. sir?

02:24:16.281 --> 02:24:17.658
- Are you alright?
- What happened?

02:24:17.699 --> 02:24:18.909
SIR...!

02:24:18.951 --> 02:24:20.118
SRI DAI!

02:24:21.203 --> 02:24:22.246
SIR!

02:24:23.539 --> 02:24:24.540
Hey!

02:24:25.582 --> 02:24:26.917
Hey! Get out

02:24:26.959 --> 02:24:28.794
- What happened?
- Savitha. go

02:24:28.836 --> 02:24:30.254
'Bhargav'

02:24:30.295 --> 02:24:32.506
BHARGAV!

02:24:32.589 --> 02:24:33.799
'Bhargav...!'

02:24:34.174 --> 02:24:35.342
'SIR!'

02:24:37.636 --> 02:24:38.971
Sir...!

02:24:41.265 --> 02:24:43.225
Bhargav is dead. sir

02:25:12.462 --> 02:25:14.590
"Got the man with the plan right here"

02:25:14.631 --> 02:25:15.924
"Bringin' swag with the-"

02:25:16.592 --> 02:25:17.885
Master

02:25:18.260 --> 02:25:19.887
How many wickets down?

02:25:19.928 --> 02:25:21.305
'According to the News I got'

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:22.931
2 wickets down
2 retired hurt

02:25:23.974 --> 02:25:27.269
If you are still stubborn enough
to hang out with that gang

02:25:27.311 --> 02:25:28.979
...you'll lose 4 wickets daily

02:25:29.104 --> 02:25:31.982
'I have never forgiven anyone
who has crossed my path till now'

02:25:32.107 --> 02:25:34.276
This is my first time
and I am forgiving you

02:25:34.154 --> 02:38:34.154
<small><small><b><i><font color="yellow">Official Movie Site "MSMOVIESBD.COM"</b></i></font></small></small>

02:25:34.568 --> 02:25:37.905
Just quit your job. do an 'about turn'
and disappear from this town

02:25:38.614 --> 02:25:41.450
'Otherwise one who escaped today
will die tomorrow and repeat'

02:25:41.491 --> 02:25:43.160
It will go on repeat mode

02:25:43.202 --> 02:25:45.621
They will keep falling like ninepins
Thank you and good bye

02:25:45.662 --> 02:25:47.372
Hey...hey!
Master...master

02:25:47.414 --> 02:25:49.583
'The main reason I called you'

02:25:49.625 --> 02:25:51.793
I didn't lie face down
when I was named it seems

02:25:52.127 --> 02:25:53.712
I was on my back
it was clear as a bell!

02:25:53.754 --> 02:25:55.339
- Hey
- 'Aahn'

02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:56.381
- DAI!
- 'Hahn?'

02:25:58.091 --> 02:26:00.552
I'll dice you. dry and
pickle you to pieces

02:26:01.136 --> 02:26:02.596
Thank you
Goodbye

02:26:07.184 --> 02:26:09.895
Take care of them just for today

02:26:09.937 --> 02:26:10.938
I'll be back soon

02:26:10.979 --> 02:26:12.272
Don't worry. you go

02:26:12.397 --> 02:26:14.316
'I will ensure the safety of these boys'

02:26:18.111 --> 02:26:20.739
- Aiyo! Let go of me. bro
- Shut up. get into the truck

02:26:20.781 --> 02:26:22.533
- Bro. let go of me
- Hit you

02:26:22.616 --> 02:26:23.867
Where are you taking me?

02:26:23.909 --> 02:26:26.161
- I'm not coming. bro
- Das!

02:26:26.912 --> 02:26:28.205
Hey! Come here

02:26:28.247 --> 02:26:29.748
Das. he's throwing a tantrum

02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:31.750
- Lift him
- Don't force me. bro

02:26:31.792 --> 02:26:33.377
- No...no
- Bloody well listen

02:26:33.418 --> 02:26:35.128
Save me. warden

02:26:35.170 --> 02:26:36.421
Don't do this. Das

02:26:36.463 --> 02:26:38.090
Save us somehow. warden

02:26:38.131 --> 02:26:40.133
- Don't take them
- Let me go. bro

02:26:40.592 --> 02:26:41.677
Move it

02:26:41.718 --> 02:26:45.556
'Hey Das! Where are you taking the boys?'

02:26:50.435 --> 02:26:52.604
[mobile ringing]

02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:55.566
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

02:26:56.316 --> 02:26:58.652
'Hello. sir
I'm Thulukanam speaking'

02:26:58.694 --> 02:27:01.280
'Das and his boys have
locked us in here'

02:27:01.405 --> 02:27:03.282
'He has taken the boys
who turned approvers'

02:27:03.365 --> 02:27:04.783
'In a truck somewhere. sir'

02:27:04.867 --> 02:27:07.536
'We don't know what to do
Please come soon. sir'

02:27:22.259 --> 02:27:23.802
[mobile ringing]

02:27:24.386 --> 02:27:25.554
Yes. Vanathi

02:27:38.609 --> 02:27:41.236
'This is not the end of the world for us'

02:27:42.112 --> 02:27:44.448
You have gone out of your way
for these boys. enough

02:27:44.489 --> 02:27:48.160
'I have informed the higher authorities
They said they will be here soon'

02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:51.163
"He was chewing betel leaves in bliss
I punched his nose without a miss"

02:27:51.246 --> 02:27:54.374
"You should have seen blood gush out
This Amaran's heart is gold. no doubt"

02:27:54.416 --> 02:27:56.585
[Singing a song from 'Amaran']

02:27:56.627 --> 02:27:59.505
"Just utter the name 'Amaran'. bro
soda bottles will fly at our foe"

02:27:59.546 --> 02:28:01.381
I don't care two hoots
about the repercussion

02:28:01.423 --> 02:28:03.967
I'll take full blame
Beat the hell out of them

02:28:04.593 --> 02:28:05.594
Hold this

02:28:05.636 --> 02:28:08.263
"It's a lilting tune anyone can hum"

02:28:08.305 --> 02:28:11.433
"Amaran is a seasoned singer awesome"

02:28:11.475 --> 02:28:14.436
"He was chewing betel leaves in bliss
I punched his nose without a miss"

02:28:14.478 --> 02:28:17.189
"Should have seen his nose bleed
This Amaran's heart is gold indee-"

02:28:17.231 --> 02:28:18.232
Master...master. da

02:28:18.482 --> 02:28:19.566
Back again?

02:28:22.986 --> 02:28:24.363
Plan to hit us?

02:28:24.404 --> 02:28:25.489
Go ahead

02:28:32.663 --> 02:28:33.914
Come here

02:28:34.957 --> 02:28:37.334
Think you've achieved
something great in life

02:28:38.836 --> 02:28:40.295
Shout all you want

02:28:41.588 --> 02:28:42.464
Dai!

02:28:44.132 --> 02:28:45.217
Bhargav

02:28:46.468 --> 02:28:47.928
He is dead. da

02:28:52.975 --> 02:28:56.311
Bhargav created much more trouble
in college than all of you put together

02:28:56.603 --> 02:28:57.771
He is dead now

02:28:58.146 --> 02:29:03.443
If a real rowdy reforms and just when
he wants to lead a good life. if he dies-

02:29:03.485 --> 02:29:05.487
Do you know it is
the height of cruelty?

02:29:05.779 --> 02:29:08.657
The faith people around him have
to turn over a new leaf will vanish

02:29:08.699 --> 02:29:10.200
Oh my gawd!

02:29:10.242 --> 02:29:12.160
Master has started preaching to us

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:13.245
Ignore them. bro

02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:15.497
Why do you treat them
on an equal footing with you?

02:29:15.581 --> 02:29:17.332
These mongrels won't reform
even if they die!

02:29:17.374 --> 02:29:19.334
Yov! Who will reform?

02:29:19.877 --> 02:29:22.337
When have we treated him with respect?

02:29:22.379 --> 02:29:24.798
Or given him time. place
or an opportunity to reform?

02:29:25.549 --> 02:29:28.510
Undiyal. Odacha Kadalai. Bottle Mani.
Soda Sekar. what kind of names?

02:29:28.552 --> 02:29:31.305
Then how will they remember
their family or tender love and care?

02:29:32.472 --> 02:29:34.433
Family and society alienate them

02:29:34.516 --> 02:29:36.685
If everybody has exiled him
how will he reform?

02:29:39.521 --> 02:29:40.731
Come here. da

02:29:40.898 --> 02:29:41.982
What?

02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:46.111
1st crime by many boys here
is based on emotion quotient

02:29:46.778 --> 02:29:48.780
Affection. betrayal. anger.
or a rush of adrenalin

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.115
Each with a reason

02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:52.534
But after the first time

02:29:52.618 --> 02:29:56.747
You know what instigates you to commit
every crime you pile on to your account?

02:29:57.331 --> 02:29:58.582
Intoxication!

02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:03.253
I can bet on this. da

02:30:03.462 --> 02:30:06.673
All other crimes after your 1st was
committed losing control of your senses

02:30:06.715 --> 02:30:08.926
Didn't you booze?
Didn't you have a ball?

02:30:08.967 --> 02:30:10.344
Oh! Yes. sir

02:30:10.427 --> 02:30:11.553
Open your warped mind!

02:30:11.845 --> 02:30:13.889
Only a drunkard can talk
of how it ruined his family

02:30:14.681 --> 02:30:16.350
Only because of my addiction

02:30:17.351 --> 02:30:19.603
2 boys lost their lives
I got that into my thick head

02:30:20.229 --> 02:30:21.271
I quit drinking

02:30:21.313 --> 02:30:23.982
'Chee! Don't be a drama king. master!'

02:30:24.107 --> 02:30:25.567
Am I brewing liquor at home?

02:30:25.609 --> 02:30:27.277
Blaming the buyer
instead of the seller!

02:30:27.319 --> 02:30:30.864
That's exactly what I'm saying
This intoxication is a political game

02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:34.243
You are not yet 18 years
You can't watch this Adult film

02:30:34.284 --> 02:30:36.370
A security guard stands out
to push you out. right?

02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:38.872
Why is no one standing guard
outside a wine shop?

02:30:38.914 --> 02:30:42.543
How do 10 -15 year olds get hold
of a booze bottle and cigarette?

02:30:43.919 --> 02:30:45.379
Politics

02:30:46.964 --> 02:30:49.591
Bhavani is moving his pawn
and playing this kind of politics

02:30:50.217 --> 02:30:52.469
When the law is against child labor

02:30:52.553 --> 02:30:55.973
...that beast is forcing the same boys
into nefarious activities unwillingly

02:30:59.726 --> 02:31:00.936
What is this?

02:31:01.562 --> 02:31:02.771
What is it?

02:31:02.855 --> 02:31:05.607
Like bribing you to vote and
you end up with an inked finger

02:31:05.649 --> 02:31:08.610
He gives you freebies and
brands you with a tattoo

02:31:09.611 --> 02:31:13.532
He has bathed you in basic amenities
providing free food and clothing

02:31:16.285 --> 02:31:17.870
Good lord!

02:31:19.371 --> 02:31:20.664
Enough of this atrocity

02:31:21.248 --> 02:31:25.544
You have packed those boys who believed
they have a good future into that truck

02:31:26.712 --> 02:31:29.631
Don't know if they will hang from a fan
or be run over by a tyre

02:31:30.674 --> 02:31:31.717
But

02:31:32.593 --> 02:31:34.094
I will save them

02:31:34.595 --> 02:31:36.346
Every single one of them

02:31:42.853 --> 02:31:44.229
What did he say. da?

02:31:44.688 --> 02:31:46.857
He will kill all those who like me?

02:31:47.399 --> 02:31:48.567
Hey!

02:31:48.609 --> 02:31:50.360
[ironical laughter]

02:31:51.445 --> 02:31:54.531
There are zillions outside who like me
Mind. body. heart and soul. da

02:31:57.117 --> 02:31:58.869
Ask him to try his luck

02:32:02.372 --> 02:32:08.212
'Bro. Bhavani has loaded the documents.
money bags of his 'benamis' in his lorries'

02:32:08.253 --> 02:32:10.797
'He is planning to
cross the border tonight'

02:32:11.215 --> 02:32:13.008
'The boys are in one of the trucks. bro'

02:32:24.186 --> 02:32:25.354
Bhavani

02:32:25.437 --> 02:32:27.314
All 40 lorries have crossed the border

02:32:27.356 --> 02:32:28.815
Expected anytime now

02:32:29.775 --> 02:32:31.109
Those boys?

02:32:31.151 --> 02:32:33.362
Das is bringing them in the container

02:34:00.574 --> 02:34:01.742
Go

02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:39.571
Finish her off!

02:34:42.616 --> 02:34:44.034
Vanathi...Vanathi

02:34:47.037 --> 02:34:48.413
Run over her

02:34:49.122 --> 02:34:50.374
Vanathi

02:34:57.756 --> 02:34:59.299
Vanathi. take the wheel

02:36:12.247 --> 02:36:13.957
Come...come

02:36:49.785 --> 02:36:51.411
Bang his car and kill them

02:37:10.472 --> 02:37:11.598
Come...come

02:37:12.474 --> 02:37:13.725
'Stop...stop'

02:37:15.227 --> 02:37:18.063
If those 15 boys turn approvers
whom will they point their fingers at?

02:37:18.105 --> 02:37:19.147
Das of course

02:37:19.231 --> 02:37:21.149
They have never met you. Bhavani

02:37:21.191 --> 02:37:23.110
What if Das turns approver?

02:37:29.283 --> 02:37:30.826
Your name. Bhavani

02:37:31.076 --> 02:37:32.661
Then kill Das

02:37:57.227 --> 02:37:58.270
Go

02:37:58.312 --> 02:37:59.396
Go. da

02:38:00.731 --> 02:38:03.025
Do you want him to kill me
out of your sight?

02:38:03.066 --> 02:38:04.401
Your words came to my mind

02:38:05.152 --> 02:38:07.279
'I will give my life for you'

02:38:08.071 --> 02:38:09.239
Give it now

02:38:12.117 --> 02:38:14.411
I thought of you
as my own elder brother

02:38:14.453 --> 02:38:17.039
I regarded you as my brother

02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:19.374
Even I thought of you
as my very own younger brother

02:38:19.833 --> 02:38:21.126
'What do you want me to do?'

02:38:21.168 --> 02:38:22.461
Where are the boys?

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:24.922
Where are they. da?

02:38:25.881 --> 02:38:28.634
Hey! Go and check the container

02:38:30.552 --> 02:38:32.429
Go...move it

02:38:47.236 --> 02:38:48.278
Bloody-

02:38:50.072 --> 02:38:51.573
Let's see who wins
You or me?

02:38:51.615 --> 02:38:52.866
Das. listen to me

02:38:53.075 --> 02:38:54.993
Listen to me
JUST LISTEN!

02:38:56.328 --> 02:38:57.454
Hear me out

02:38:58.038 --> 02:39:01.625
Oral statement by all those boys
point fingers accusingly only at you

02:39:02.084 --> 02:39:04.419
They don't even know the name Bhavani

02:39:04.962 --> 02:39:06.213
Bhavani knows that too

02:39:06.338 --> 02:39:07.756
Give it serious thought

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:09.591
Will he kill all the boys?

02:39:09.633 --> 02:39:12.678
Or kill the one they are pointing
fingers at. which is YOU?

02:39:12.719 --> 02:39:15.389
- You deserve to die
- In one swift blow. I'll-

02:39:17.558 --> 02:39:18.976
That is not my intention

02:39:19.434 --> 02:39:21.854
Let's stop with the lives already lost

02:39:22.563 --> 02:39:24.273
I'm saying this like a broken record

02:39:24.314 --> 02:39:25.399
Bhavani is clever

02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:28.026
He won't kill the boys
His target is YOU

02:39:29.236 --> 02:39:31.071
Listen to me once
Only this time

02:39:31.446 --> 02:39:34.783
Ask him if you can bring the boys
in front of him he will say 'no'

02:39:35.117 --> 02:39:36.410
Continue to ask repeatedly

02:39:36.451 --> 02:39:38.662
You'll know the true colors of Bhavani

02:39:39.246 --> 02:39:40.831
If this doesn't happen-

02:39:43.083 --> 02:39:44.835
I am all yours to kill

02:41:39.074 --> 02:41:40.868
"Master"

02:41:41.201 --> 02:41:43.245
"They call me...master"

02:41:44.037 --> 02:41:46.039
"You know me...master"

02:41:47.416 --> 02:41:49.209
"I am master the blaster"

02:41:49.251 --> 02:41:50.627
"Oooh yeah!"

02:41:50.669 --> 02:41:51.920
"Master"

02:41:52.629 --> 02:41:54.256
"They call me...master"

02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:57.926
Welcome. master

02:42:00.053 --> 02:42:02.389
This is the first time
we are meeting. right?

02:42:06.643 --> 02:42:08.896
Loaded with emotion. huh?

02:42:09.897 --> 02:42:11.106
My dear master

02:42:13.734 --> 02:42:15.736
Bhavani isn't just a name

02:42:16.737 --> 02:42:18.614
It's a kingdom I created for myself

02:42:19.156 --> 02:42:22.034
You can't create a world record
with your overnight lesson

02:42:22.993 --> 02:42:26.038
If he was sharing his pearls of wisdom
what about the mud between your ears?

02:42:28.624 --> 02:42:30.417
You carried that boy on your waist?

02:42:31.168 --> 02:42:32.920
Did you think they are kids?

02:42:34.171 --> 02:42:36.006
They are killers of the worst kind

02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:40.302
I've already given you too much time

02:42:40.344 --> 02:42:42.012
Still I'll give you 2 minutes

02:42:42.638 --> 02:42:44.973
If you can ki-

02:42:46.892 --> 02:42:48.852
Master. why did you hit me in mid speech?

02:42:49.061 --> 02:42:50.562
Didn't you ask for it?

02:42:51.271 --> 02:42:52.439
Come

02:42:52.606 --> 02:42:54.816
Is this all the force you can muster?

02:44:09.224 --> 02:44:10.392
Master

02:44:50.641 --> 02:44:52.601
[fired up laughter]

02:45:29.054 --> 02:45:30.389
Job done and dusted

02:45:32.808 --> 02:45:35.018
'Lord. pardon this sinner'

02:45:40.065 --> 02:45:41.358
Don't!

02:45:43.861 --> 02:45:47.239
Hey! I am fighting here for your sake

02:45:48.031 --> 02:45:50.826
So your hands don't grip
a knife once more

02:45:51.451 --> 02:45:52.578
Your mind

02:45:52.828 --> 02:45:55.080
Your mind should not
go back to its old way

02:45:55.122 --> 02:45:56.623
I am fighting your cause

02:45:56.665 --> 02:45:58.000
Not one of you

02:45:58.667 --> 02:46:00.711
Not even one of you
should raise his hand

02:46:02.171 --> 02:46:03.380
Step back

02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:06.425
MOVE BACK!

02:46:10.304 --> 02:46:15.225
"O master. come to my den
If you don't. I'll force you then"

"In my own hot spot
you bet I'm a big shot"

02:46:21.565 --> 02:46:23.066
'How was it?'

02:46:23.317 --> 02:46:25.694
You're teaching a lesson
even when you're about to die

02:46:25.736 --> 02:46:27.237
Is this your last lesson. master?

02:46:28.238 --> 02:46:29.448
'Come'

02:47:07.152 --> 02:47:09.363
Shall we have it this way?

02:47:18.664 --> 02:47:20.165
Show me your fist power

02:47:37.641 --> 02:47:39.268
[whistling]

02:48:11.341 --> 02:48:13.010
- Hey...hey
- Master

02:48:13.177 --> 02:48:15.929
- Take the boys to the truck
- Okay. master

02:48:15.971 --> 02:48:16.972
Hey Das

02:48:45.459 --> 02:48:47.419
Bhavani! Bhavani!

02:48:52.841 --> 02:48:56.178
"Come. my dear dude
Raw banana 'bajji' for you"

02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:59.389

Fry and serve as bajji"

Master...master...wait

02:49:32.422 --> 02:49:33.715
Sit down

02:49:38.679 --> 02:49:40.013
Master

02:49:41.139 --> 02:49:43.642
A problem won't be solved
by killing a person

02:49:43.684 --> 02:49:45.978
I asked a man
when I was just 17

02:49:46.436 --> 02:49:48.647
This is the same request
I'm asking you

02:49:49.064 --> 02:49:51.066
Let me live

02:49:51.859 --> 02:49:53.443
I will do anything for you

02:49:54.027 --> 02:49:55.362
I won't harm those boys

02:49:55.821 --> 02:49:58.282
You are the one who made
those innocent children criminals

02:50:00.367 --> 02:50:01.368
One-

02:50:02.619 --> 02:50:04.705
Only 1 year

02:50:04.788 --> 02:50:08.709
You were let into that Observation Home
and you've progressed so much in life

02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:12.629
If you are punished and sent to jail
imagine what you'll do to this town

02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:19.887
I'll get into politics

02:50:20.971 --> 02:50:22.306
I'll start a party

02:50:23.056 --> 02:50:24.850
Will you join me?

02:50:25.601 --> 02:50:26.894
Master

02:50:28.103 --> 02:50:29.146
What?

02:50:29.438 --> 02:50:31.106
Sssshhhhhh!

02:50:53.962 --> 02:50:56.131
[satisfied laughter]

02:50:57.716 --> 02:50:59.718

02:51:20.072 --> 02:51:21.949
- Master
- Who is that?

02:51:24.034 --> 02:51:25.577
The boys are in the truck. master

02:51:27.162 --> 02:51:29.039
Come here
Sit down

02:51:30.415 --> 02:51:31.458
Sit

02:51:36.713 --> 02:51:38.966
Shall I surrender instead of you?

02:51:41.051 --> 02:51:43.345
Won't you understand till the very end?

02:51:43.762 --> 02:51:46.723
Each person has to endure
the punishment according to his crime

02:51:47.975 --> 02:51:49.017
Madcap!

02:51:49.059 --> 02:51:51.061
I feel I should do something for you

02:51:51.103 --> 02:51:54.022
Tell me if you have a family
I'll take care of them till you're back

02:51:55.899 --> 02:51:59.903
I overheard the children in the reformatory
saying you loved a girl it seems

02:51:59.945 --> 02:52:02.406
A girl from an affluent family
Already engaged to someone

02:52:03.115 --> 02:52:04.908
Shall I go and talk to her?

02:52:06.743 --> 02:52:08.829
Maybe I can share my epic story!

02:52:08.871 --> 02:52:11.039
Listen. my dear boy

02:52:11.456 --> 02:52:13.250
My name was not JD then

02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:15.085
Jack Daniels

02:52:15.419 --> 02:52:17.880
People called me 'Jack'

02:52:18.172 --> 02:52:19.673
I used to draw well

02:52:19.715 --> 02:52:21.216
Good at a game of cards

02:52:21.800 --> 02:52:26.013
In such a game we were lucky
My friend and I won 2 tickets

02:52:26.805 --> 02:52:30.058
You would have seen everyone
run to catch a bus or train

02:52:30.601 --> 02:52:33.770
But imagine we ran and caught a ship
about to leave the dock

02:52:34.438 --> 02:52:35.939
Huh?

02:52:36.356 --> 02:52:38.734
That's where I set eyes on her
for the very 1st time

02:52:39.401 --> 02:52:41.195
Her name was Rose

02:52:43.113 --> 02:52:44.823
What did you say her name was?

02:52:45.824 --> 02:52:46.909
Rose

02:52:47.075 --> 02:52:48.911
Rose...Jack

02:52:48.952 --> 02:52:50.454
Listen to my love story

02:52:50.579 --> 02:52:52.915
After I fell head over heels
in love with her. I found out

02:52:52.956 --> 02:52:54.416
...she's already engaged

02:52:55.918 --> 02:52:58.754
After that. as we were sailing smoothly

02:52:58.837 --> 02:53:01.006
The ship hit an iceberg on the way?

02:53:02.174 --> 02:53:03.383
How do you know that?

02:53:03.425 --> 02:53:04.885
I'll wait outside. master

02:53:05.052 --> 02:53:08.013
- Listen to my full epic love story
- No need. it's okay. master

02:53:10.349 --> 02:53:14.019
'Since manipulation of boys into crimes
by anti social elements was proved'

02:53:14.061 --> 02:53:15.854

'That specific Govt Reformatory
was shut down permanently'

02:53:18.232 --> 02:53:22.611
'Of the 63 inmates. those above 18
were sent to Central Prison'

02:53:22.653 --> 02:53:26.740
'And those below 18 were sent
to other Govt reformatories'

02:53:30.661 --> 02:53:31.995
Go inside

02:53:38.335 --> 02:53:40.587
What is the crime
you are serving term for?

02:53:41.129 --> 02:53:44.258
Baby face. partner
Must be a gigolo

02:53:44.299 --> 02:53:46.635
Look at his face

02:53:50.055 --> 02:53:52.266
I heard it was 7 of them
Only 6 are here

Baby face is here
Handsome face is missing

02:53:55.227 --> 02:53:56.395
Where is your master?

02:53:56.436 --> 02:53:58.730
Must have been sent to Vellore jail

02:54:04.278 --> 02:54:05.946
It's even more convenient. partner

02:54:05.988 --> 02:54:08.574
We go to Vellore in 10 days
We'll finish him there

02:54:08.657 --> 02:54:11.159
Then we will meet your master in Vellore

02:54:13.912 --> 02:54:15.289
Transfer only after 10 days. huh?

02:54:15.330 --> 02:54:17.416
- Are you here till then?
- Why?

02:54:17.457 --> 02:54:19.084
Drag that 'beedi'
deep into your lungs

02:54:19.168 --> 02:54:21.170
This is the last 'beedi' you'll smoke
