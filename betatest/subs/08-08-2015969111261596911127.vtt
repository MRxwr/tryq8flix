00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.457
Maybe next time. bring back
some horses. Save my back. huh?

5
00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.526
Yeah. I don't think they'd
deal with the journey.

6
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.694
Then I guess you're
stuck with me then.

7
00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:03.629
I guess so.

8
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.666
-[Lani] Aylmer!
-Lani. beautiful as ever.

9
00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:10.069

-Oh. my knight in shining armor.
-M'lady.

13
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.346
-I'll make some tea.
-That sounds good.

14
00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.649
-Did you manage to find me any--
-I did.

15
00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.185
You know. for someone
who loves the quiet life.

16
00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:29.288
you are obsessed with
modern convenience.

17
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.123
Here you go.

Ladies.

25
00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.185
A question.

26
00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.788
Well. it's a request
more than a question.

27
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.156
Spit it out then.

28
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:05.657
How can we help?

29
00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:07.693

-Absolutely not. With linen?

No.

34
00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.671
Uh-- Leave it with us.

35
00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:21.607
We'll see if we have
anything that will work.

36

Thanks.

00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:26.812
-A few additions.-
-Okay. let's have a look.

38
00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:31.483
Anything else?

39
00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:33.519
All right. leave with me.

40
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:35.621

[students speaking faintly]

44
00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:52.671
Only you two?

[children laughing]

46
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.643

[screaming] Ah!

55
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:55.801
What do you say. we skip dinner?

56
00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.770
I say that by the time
dinner rolls around--

57
00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.872
You. you did this.

58
00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.675
-Uh. what. me. me.
what. what'd I do?
-You should've been there!

59
00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.277
I shouldn't have been
doing it alone.

60
00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:06.878
Okay. well I'm sorry you got--

61
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.581
You've been shirking
your responsibilities

62
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.783
and sneaking off with her.
It's unacceptable!

63
00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:13.752
-Just let her help you then.
-I don't need her help.

64
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:14.920
Okay then.
let's go back to the farm

65
00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:16.655
and discuss this like men. yeah?

66
00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.792
There's no need to talk.
this is your fault.

67
00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.527
Okay. it's my fault. you happy?

68
00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.963
What's going on?
Hey. what happened to your arm?

69
00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:26.865
-This<i> alaho</i> did this to me.
-Hey. what--

70
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.401
-Enough with the name-calling.
-What. you did this to him?

71
00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:30.402
No. he did it to himself.

72
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.306
Hey. you watch
what you say about my girl.

73
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.608
-Hey!
-Haku!

74
00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.343
[Kalima] What are you--

75
00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:39.578
Uh. no. I. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.980
I. I. I know. I'm sorry.

77
00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.715
Okay. I didn't mean
for that to happen.

78
00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:45.517
-I didn't. I didn't
mean for that.
-No!

79
00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.718
-Hawila. stop.
-No!

80
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.553
-Get off of him!
-Stop!

81
00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.622
[men groaning and grunting]

82
00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:53.425
Haku.

83
00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:57.296
Enough!

84
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:03.935
And well?

85
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:06.738
Well. what?

86
00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.042
What have you got to
say for yourself?

87
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.578
I told you I was sorry.

88
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.315
And you shouldn't have
said that about Lani.

89
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.482
[Hawila scoffs]

90
00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.917
That's not an apology.

91
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.919
Well. neither is that.

92
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.389
You know who I am?

93
00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:28.093
Who my father is.
who my grandfather was?

94
00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.997
Fifty years ago. he would
have been hanged for this.

95
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.433
banished at least.

96
00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:35.734
Everyone appreciates

97
00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.602
what your family
has done for the islands.

98
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.839
But that was then. this is now.

99
00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:45.410
Yes. well in Aylmer's absence.
we are all your subjects.

100
00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.779
You are to take care
of us as best you can.

101
00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:51.683
No one will be
killed or banished

102
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.385
for a simple misunderstanding.

103
00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.687
Simple misunderstanding?
He struck me!

104
00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:58.056
How do you expect me
to work with him again?

105
00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:58.990
I don't.

106
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:02.661
You'll work with me.

107
00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:04.463
[Hawila scoffs]

108
00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.432
-Hey. I'm. I'm not a fisherman.
-Not yet.

109
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.072
Apologize to Lani.

110
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.812
That's it?

111
00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:23.749
[Hawila scoffs]

112
00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:25.083
He shirks on me.

113
00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:27.652
he shirks on the whole village.

114
00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:29.588
That's the end of it.

115
00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.526
Sunrise. Don't be late.

116
00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:40.966
[Ben sighs]

117
00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:48.140
[Ben sighs]

118
00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:52.577
[Ben sighs again]

119
00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:56.181
[singing in Hawaiian]

120
00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:07.893
-[Ella] What?
-[Ben] Nothing.

121
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.629
Oh. it's something.

122
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.063
I know you're not
the best dancer.

123
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.832
but you were never this bad.

124
00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:14.766
[Ben chuckles]

125
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.602
What's going on
in that head of yours?

126
00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:21.907
He thinks I'm weak.

127
00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:23.608
Don't mind Hawila.

128
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.610
He will fare.

129
00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:30.715
But Haku did hit him.
and people are angry.

130
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.484
You're the island protector:

131
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.823
Because John Reaney died.

132
00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.026
Because you are
a man of integrity.

133
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.198
I'm a hunter. I'm not a leader.

134
00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:50.869
Leader isn't someone who uses
others to make him strong. Ben.

135
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.841
It's someone willing to give
their strengths to others.

136
00:07:58.679 --> 00:07:59.711
Sounds simple.

137
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:04.850
Aylmer believes in you.
I believe in you.

138
00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:10.989
The people of Niihau believe
in you and your decisions.

139
00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:16.127
[Ben sighs]

140
00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:24.870
[Haku groans]

141
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.741
I think this thing is stupid.
it's not even working.

142
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.844
A poor workman blames
his tools. man. [laughs]

143
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.279
Aw. yeah. yeah. it's
easy for you to say.

144
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.213
you're the guy who never--

145
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.752
[tense music]

146
00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:41.820
What is that?

147
00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:50.962
[plane engine rumbling]

148
00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:03.308
Wait. Ben. wait!

149
00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.115
-Ben!
-Haku. no.

150
00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:11.116
-Ben!
-Hey. Haku. don't!

151
00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:14.719
[dramatic music]

152
00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:32.604
Let's go. let's go!

153
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.987
[tense music]

154
00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:53.325
-With me. Grab the gear.
-Got it.

155
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:03.034
Lani. clear the table!

156
00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.869
[Ben panting]

157
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:06.371
[Ben grunting]

158
00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:09.040
-[Lani] What happened?
-His plane crashed!

159
00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:10.141
-Water.
-Okay.

160
00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:11.810
[Haku] Yeah. Ben saved him!

161
00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:12.911
He's not saved yet.

162
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:14.746
What can we do?

163
00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.281
Just go outside. wait.

164
00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.216
and give us room. Go. go.

165
00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:21.886
[tense music]

166
00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:46.378
[Lani] You can come in now.

167
00:10:57.924 --> 00:10:59.391
[Ben] He looks in bad shape.

168
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:02.293
Well. he looks worse than he is.

169
00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:07.098
Water inhalations.
his ribs may be broken.

170
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:10.869
sprained shoulder.
a few cuts on his head and face.

171
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:12.070
but nothing that won't mend.

172
00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:14.305
Can he talk?

173
00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:17.375
I've given him something
for the pain. but...

174
00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:24.215
Do you know where you are?

175
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.386
You are on Niihau.

176
00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:41.199
Okay. so he can talk.
We just can't understand him.

177
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:43.101
It's great.

178
00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:45.737
Where's Yoshio?

-[Yoshio] Is Ben okay?

181
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.781
-Haku. wait!
-We need you to translate.

182
00:11:56.783 --> 00:12:00.185
-Translate? Translate what?
-Not what. it's who.

[tense music]

184
00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:07.125
Someone order a translator?

185
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.954
No. no. you need to rest.

186
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.132
What was found on his person?

187
00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:24.803
A book in his jacket.

188
00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:28.773
-No papers?
-No.

189
00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.340
-Where's his plane now?
-At the bottom of the Pacific.

192
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.154
Well. what happened?

193
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.523
Yoshio?

194
00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:58.563
It was engine failure.

195
00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:07.305
[Lani] So. what
do we do with him?

196
00:15:08.608 --> 00:15:10.408
[Ben] Same thing
we'd do for any visitor.

197
00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:14.078
Tell him to rest.
he's in good hands.

198
00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.291
[crickets chirping]

199
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.272
What's going on?

200
00:15:42.075 --> 00:15:43.241
I'm getting some extra.

201
00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:45.076
You know what I'm talking about.

202
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:52.183
I heard what he said.
what he actually said.

203
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.687
What did you want me to do?

204
00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:04.028
You need to tell Ben.

205
00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:08.032
I know. and I will.

206
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:13.371
Just don't say
anything until I do.

207
00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.118
It's been a long day.

208
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:29.454
It has.

209
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:33.725
[Ella] You did a good thing.

210
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:36.427
I did what anyone else would do.

211
00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.696
I am not so sure about that.

212
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.432
People help when they can.

213
00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:43.301
If they can.

214
00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:45.103
How they can.

230
00:24:23.863 --> 00:24:25.763
I didn't mean to disturb you.

231
00:24:35.608 --> 00:24:39.643
You don't have to be afraid
of us. We'll take care of you.

232
00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:48.953
My husband. Ben. he saved you.

233
00:24:51.858 --> 00:24:52.823
You have someone?

234
00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:55.192
Back home?

235
00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:02.233
When you are better.
we will get you back to them.

236
00:25:04.537 --> 00:25:05.269
I promise.

237
00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:14.778
For now. what say we get
you back to Kalima. yes?

238
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:18.616
Are you okay?

239
00:25:19.252 --> 00:25:20.784
I'm fine. Just tea.

240
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:22.720
[Irene] Let me see your hand.

241
00:25:22.722 --> 00:25:24.221
I need to clean this up.

242
00:25:24.223 --> 00:25:25.923
Yoshio. it's just tea.

243
00:25:25.925 --> 00:25:26.891
Show me your hand.

244
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.128
Yoshio.

245
00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:34.932
I need to tell you something.

246
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.802
I don't know how.

247
00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:41.705
Whatever it is you can tell me.

248
00:25:43.843 --> 00:25:44.775
The pilot.

249
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:49.396
What about him?

250
00:25:49.397 --> 00:25:51.080
He didn't crash.
he was shot down.

251
00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:52.850
By whom?

252
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.319
By Americans.

253
00:25:56.689 --> 00:25:57.821
I don't understand.

254
00:25:58.925 --> 00:26:02.626
Japan and America are at war.

255
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.068
No one else knows.
no one but Matsu.

256
00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:14.038
He heard me mistranslate.

257
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:22.580
Say something.

258
00:26:22.582 --> 00:26:26.216
I know I shouldn't have
lied. but I did--
I need talk to him.

259
00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:27.685
What?

260
00:26:27.687 --> 00:26:30.988
We should tell Ben.
he'll know what to do.

261
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.691
Look what happened
with Haku and Hawila.

262
00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:35.826
Ben couldn't control that.

263
00:26:38.331 --> 00:26:41.665
Talk to Matsu and explain
that we need time.

264
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.669
Let me talk with the pilot.

265
00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:55.779
Shigenori.
his name is Shigenori.

266
00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:10.761
Matsu.

267
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:15.099
I hope you're here to tell
me you've spoken with Ben.

268
00:27:15.101 --> 00:27:19.269
We don't know how he'll
react. how anyone will.

269
00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:23.107
This is someone's son.
Matsu. someone's grandson.

270
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.643
What if it were you?

271
00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:39.657
I'm not asking for much.
just time. patience.

272
00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:48.198
Where are you going?

273
00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:55.439
I don't want anything
to do with this. Yoshio.

274
00:28:00.713 --> 00:28:01.779
[surf crashing]

275
00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:17.194
Early morning swim?

276
00:28:17.897 --> 00:28:18.962
Something like that.

277
00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:20.431
That's a first.

278
00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:21.899
It's not a habit.

279
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.475
Hey. come on in.

280
00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:34.311
You can set that there.

281
00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:36.146
How is he?

282
00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:39.950
He doesn't really say much.

283
00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:44.421
I'm going to change his bandages
soon if you wanna help.

284
00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:47.257
Can you please pass me my kit?

285
00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:43.347
[tense music]

286
00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:12.376
-Is he okay?
-Yeah. he's fine.

287
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:55.279
-How's it coming?
-[Ella chuckles]

288
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.014
Matsu?

289
00:31:57.616 --> 00:31:58.916
He's a genius.

290
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.653
Fresh batch.

291
00:32:05.925 --> 00:32:07.291
[clattering]

292
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:23.573
He's a young man.

293
00:32:27.947 --> 00:32:32.382
He's alone in a strange
place and he's afraid.

294
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.718
more than most.

295
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.954
You know how that feels.

296
00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:40.257
Just talk with him.

297
00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:43.593
It'll make sure he's okay.

298
00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:58.075
[Ella chuckles]

299
00:33:02.114 --> 00:33:03.180
[children laughing]

300
00:33:14.727 --> 00:33:15.625
How is he?

301
00:33:16.395 --> 00:33:17.594
Physically. he's improving.

302
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.097
It'll take some time but--

303
00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:21.098
Can he walk?

304
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.368
His shoulder's a bit tender
and his ribs are bruised.

305
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.670
but he should be okay.

306
00:33:27.473 --> 00:33:29.339
We're hoping to move
him out of here today.

307
00:33:31.377 --> 00:33:32.309
Come with me.

308
00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:57.134

315

Why?

316
00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:56.353
Why did you save me?

317
00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:01.358
Tradition. these things.

318
00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:04.661
I should have died.

319
00:36:09.801 --> 00:36:13.203
When I found myself here.
I didn't know anyone.

320
00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:17.807
I didn't have anyone.
but I was taken in.

321
00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:22.879
given food. shelter. family.

322
00:36:25.617 --> 00:36:28.285
So. I guess my tradition
dictates that I should help.

323
00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:38.795
Tradition is a funny thing.

324
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:47.804
I was trained to be a warrior...

325
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:50.473
once.

326
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.344
All I ever wanted was peace.

327
00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:59.282
Peace.

328
00:37:03.422 --> 00:37:04.487
Family.

329
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.759
What do you want now.

330
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:14.831
To go home.

331
00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:21.838
I just want to go home.

332
00:37:23.609 --> 00:37:26.676

[door rattles]

334
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:42.692
I tried to speak with Matsu.

335
00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:49.833
He's not happy. but I don't
think he'll say anything.

336
00:37:52.504 --> 00:37:53.837
We need to think of a plan.

337
00:37:55.274 --> 00:37:57.540
but at least we have
some time to decide.

338
00:37:57.542 --> 00:37:58.608
No. we don't.

339
00:38:02.047 --> 00:38:03.613
There's a beacon on his plane

340
00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:06.516
and submarine out there
waiting for him.

341
00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:08.818
But. but how could they
know he's--

342
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.887
Because they told
him to land here.

343
00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:15.025
We're their contingency.

344
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:23.400
Yoshio. if he hit the beacon.
the Japanese know he's here.

345
00:38:25.003 --> 00:38:26.536
And if they come for him.

346
00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:29.572
they'll slaughter everyone
on the island.

347
00:38:49.528 --> 00:38:50.393
[flies buzzing]

348
00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:53.563
Wow. impressive.

349
00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:02.906
And Niihau is yours. my friends.

350
00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:06.509
-[Shigenori groans]
-Ooh. [laughs]

351
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.651
He should take it easy
does not mean go hunting.

352
00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:22.025
Well. I hope it was worth it.

353
00:39:29.735 --> 00:39:30.667
Done.

354
00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.471
Can I show him?

355
00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:50.653
I hope you like it.

356
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.763
Is that a yes?

357
00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:01.731
Yes.

358
00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:02.665
[both laughing]

359
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:05.135
Yeah.

360
00:40:05.137 --> 00:40:06.870
He could stay on the island.

361
00:40:16.815 --> 00:40:17.747
[Hawila] Have a word?

362
00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:19.783
-Is this about Haku?
-It's not.

363
00:40:23.622 --> 00:40:26.089
-In private?
-There's no one on this island

364
00:40:26.091 --> 00:40:28.091
more qualified to deal
with a problem than my wife.

365
00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:31.761
This pilot.

366
00:40:33.432 --> 00:40:34.531
we need to be careful.

367
00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:36.132
He could be a spy.

368
00:40:37.569 --> 00:40:39.736
I know that your sheep-rearing
techniques

369
00:40:39.738 --> 00:40:41.438
have been productive. Hawila.

370
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.573
but I'm not sure
word has spread to Japan.

371
00:40:44.443 --> 00:40:45.742
This isn't funny.

372
00:40:45.744 --> 00:40:46.676
[Ben] I agree.

373
00:40:47.746 --> 00:40:49.012
Then what's your plan here.

374
00:40:49.014 --> 00:40:52.048
When Aylmer arrives.
we take him to the big island.

375
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.583
maybe get him home.

376
00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:55.552
-But we don't even know--
-I wasn't asking.

377
00:40:57.556 --> 00:41:00.723
-This is our land
and we need to protect--
-He's here now.

378
00:41:01.493 --> 00:41:03.893
and he'll be treated
for what he is. a guest.

379
00:41:12.704 --> 00:41:15.605
No way. Absolutely not.

380
00:41:15.607 --> 00:41:17.774
You're the best swimmer
on the island.

381
00:41:18.143 --> 00:41:20.109
-There is no one else to ask.
-I told you.

382
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.678
I don't wanna be
involved in this.

383
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.913
-You are Japanese.
-Exactly.

384
00:41:23.915 --> 00:41:26.783
You're a Nisei born
in Hawaii. and I'm Japanese.

385
00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:29.886
and that's exactly why I don't
wanna be involved in this

386
00:41:29.888 --> 00:41:31.721
'cause I can't risk
my life here.

387
00:41:31.723 --> 00:41:35.191
If that beacon is on
and the Japanese turn up.

388
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:37.694
what do you think
is going to happen?

389
00:41:37.696 --> 00:41:39.996
They're aren't gonna
grab Shigenori and leave.

390
00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:45.235
This is the only way
no one gets hurt. Matsu.

391
00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:52.976
If we don't. it'll be worse.
much worse for everyone.

392
00:41:55.814 --> 00:41:57.046
Including you.

393
00:42:09.828 --> 00:42:10.994
What do you want me to do?

394
00:42:13.532 --> 00:42:15.632
[Yoshio] Once we confirm
the Japanese aren't coming

395
00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:19.869
and the island is safe.
we'll get him on a boat.

396
00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:22.238
Then we can put
this whole thing behind us.

397
00:42:26.244 --> 00:42:28.311
[indistinct chatter]

398
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:31.981
[clattering]

399
00:42:31.983 --> 00:42:33.116
[Ako] Here. my friends.

400
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.927
[underwater bubbling]

401
00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:16.726
Ella tells me you went
out with Shigenori today.

402
00:43:26.037 --> 00:43:27.203
He spoke to me.

403
00:43:28.273 --> 00:43:29.639
He spoke to you?

404
00:43:30.709 --> 00:43:31.641
In English.

405
00:43:33.244 --> 00:43:34.611
You never said that.

406
00:43:35.213 --> 00:43:36.145
What did he say?

407
00:43:36.915 --> 00:43:37.847
Not much.

408
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.183
He's a good hunter.

409
00:43:42.988 --> 00:43:44.921
He'll start with me
fishing detail. tomorrow.

410
00:43:45.757 --> 00:43:46.689
Earn his keep.

411
00:44:18.957 --> 00:44:19.922
[exhales]

412
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:22.992
That's nice.

413
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:25.928
Did you make it?

414
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.066
A friend?

415
00:44:34.172 --> 00:44:37.407
Cheer up. I'm sure
you'll see him soon.

416
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:44.280
No.

417
00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:53.256
I watched him die.

418
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:07.437
[Irene] What did you find out?

419
00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.406
It's a simple distress beacon.

420
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:11.808
[Matsu grunts]

421
00:45:12.377 --> 00:45:13.743
I know how it works.

422
00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:15.745
It wasn't flashing.

423
00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:17.480
It wasn't emitting
any information.

424
00:45:18.817 --> 00:45:21.217
-Then they don't know he's here.
-And they aren't coming.

425
00:45:22.287 --> 00:45:25.088
-[Yoshio] Do we tell him?
-No. let him think they are.

426
00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:26.889
It buys us time to get
him off the island.

427
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.758
[Yoshio] He won't leave
without his papers.

428
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.027
His papers. they weren't there.

429
00:45:31.496 --> 00:45:33.396
-[Irene] Then where are they?
-I don't know.

430
00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:35.198
It could've fallen out
on impact.

431
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.066
It could be at the bottom
of the ocean or--

432
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:39.969
Or?

433
00:45:41.506 --> 00:45:45.274
Hawila. I think he may
have gone down there.

434
00:45:45.477 --> 00:45:47.343
Could he have made that swim?

435
00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:51.147
-In daylight. yes.
-Okay then. if Hawila has them.

436
00:45:51.149 --> 00:45:53.149
-we need to get them back.
-There is no we.

437
00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:57.887
The beacon
has not been triggered.
The island is safe. I'm done!

438
00:45:58.857 --> 00:46:00.022
What about Hawila?

439
00:46:01.893 --> 00:46:02.959
Matsu!

440
00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:04.193
[Irene] What about Hawila?

441
00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:07.964
[tense guitar music]

442
00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.813
[Yoshio] You spoke of tradition.

443
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.216
Here on Niihau.
everyone contributes

444
00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:28.417
to each other's materials.

445
00:46:28.419 --> 00:46:32.889
Of each catch. each kill.
everyone plays a part.

446
00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:36.425
Lures are passed down
through generations.

447
00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:45.568
This was given to me
by the man who raised me.

448
00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:49.539
the man who made me
who I am today.

449
00:46:51.476 --> 00:46:52.842
I want you to have it.

450
00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:02.585
[gentle music]

451
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:26.008
[Shigenori chuckles]

452
00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:27.410
[Haku] What?

453
00:47:30.148 --> 00:47:31.214
Pitiful.

454
00:47:31.216 --> 00:47:33.349
[Ben and Matsu chuckling]

455
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:36.219
Oh. all right. well thanks
for the support. guys.

456
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:37.854
I've only been at
this for two days.

457
00:47:39.524 --> 00:47:40.323
Ha!

458
00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.123
[Shigenori] It's your technique.

459
00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:47.230
I watch. your style.
very poor. very bad.

460
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:51.167
Okay. okay. very poor. very bad.
Okay. I get it.

461
00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:54.203
Think you can do better.

462
00:48:03.982 --> 00:48:04.981
[Ben chuckles]

463
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.512
Thank you.

464
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.128
A friend gave me this.

465
00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:56.265
Now I...

466
00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:00.569
give it to a friend.

467
00:49:29.701 --> 00:49:32.134
-[Shigenori sighs]
-[Ben chuckling]

468
00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:44.380
You went to the crash site.

469
00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:47.483
I know you have his papers.

470
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:53.990
I need them back.

471
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:55.491
-You need them?
-I have a little over $40 here.

472
00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:57.760
42 to be exact.

473
00:49:59.097 --> 00:50:02.031
It's all yours for the papers.

474
00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:05.134
No.

475
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:09.038
-Don't you get it?
I don't have any--
-I don't want money.

476
00:50:10.008 --> 00:50:11.340
Then what do you want?

477
00:50:11.609 --> 00:50:13.275
I wanna know why he's here.

478
00:50:18.483 --> 00:50:20.282
And I want you
to get off my farm.

479
00:50:21.786 --> 00:50:24.653
There will be trouble
if the papers aren't returned.

480
00:50:27.592 --> 00:50:29.091
I said. get off my farm.

481
00:50:38.169 --> 00:50:39.101
[door slams]

482
00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:50.813
He won't sell them.
but he has them. he has them!

483
00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:52.815
He said that. He didn't have to.

484
00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:56.752
Aylmer arrives
tomorrow. tomorrow.

485
00:50:56.754 --> 00:50:59.555
Then we've run out
of time. I'm sorry.

486
00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:02.124
There's nothing else we can do.

487
00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:04.693
Maybe you can talk to him

488
00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:06.562
before anybody else
gets a chance.

489
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:09.231
-make him see sense.
tell him that--
-Are you in?

490
00:51:10.435 --> 00:51:12.101
He'll listen to you.

491
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.403
Convince him to take Shigenori

492
00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:16.372
back with him
to the authorities.

493
00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:19.341
We just need him off the island.

494
00:51:19.343 --> 00:51:21.110
And how do you know
that's any better

495
00:51:21.112 --> 00:51:24.814
than staying here
for him or for us?

496
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:28.350
I don't.

497
00:51:28.352 --> 00:51:31.554
[guitar music]

498
00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:45.835
Why are you so important?

499
00:51:54.178 --> 00:51:55.411
[screams]

500
00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:01.684
[knocking on door]

[door opens]

503
00:52:22.673 --> 00:52:23.606
It's late.

504
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:26.642
I swam to the plane.

505
00:52:27.812 --> 00:52:28.878
Hawila.

506
00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:38.320
What am I looking at?

507
00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:39.622
I don't know.

508
00:52:39.624 --> 00:52:40.689
They make no sense to me.

509
00:52:41.492 --> 00:52:42.691
Found them in the cockpit.

510
00:52:46.264 --> 00:52:47.396
I also found this.

511
00:52:47.798 --> 00:52:50.866
[tense music]

512
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:54.837
Yoshio offered me money
for these tonight.

513
00:52:55.573 --> 00:52:57.206
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

514
00:52:58.476 --> 00:53:00.342
but I'm telling you.
something isn't right.

515
00:53:01.712 --> 00:53:03.345
You really think
he just falls from the sky.

516
00:53:03.347 --> 00:53:05.214
-lands in our lap?
-What are you saying?

517
00:53:06.184 --> 00:53:08.817
I said it before.
maybe he's a spy.

518
00:53:10.555 --> 00:53:14.256
-Think about it. He drops in.
-He didn't drop in.

519
00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:19.562
I know this because I pulled
him from the wreckage myself.

520
00:53:20.198 --> 00:53:21.530
He's not a spy.

521
00:53:21.532 --> 00:53:22.932
You don't think
this is suspicious?

522
00:53:24.435 --> 00:53:26.368
This is a service weapon. okay?

523
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.737
And you said yourself.
these make no sense.

524
00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:31.340
Look. why don't you
take him to Matsu.

525
00:53:31.342 --> 00:53:33.275
No. no. no.
he could be in on it.

526
00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:35.945
Something's going on.

527
00:53:41.986 --> 00:53:45.521
Then take these papers
and the weapon.

528
00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:48.324
and don't let them
out of your sight.

529
00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:50.793
So what. that's it?

530
00:53:53.631 --> 00:53:55.397
-I'm going to bed. let it go.
-But Ben.

531
00:53:57.301 --> 00:53:58.234
Get some rest.

532
00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:04.840
[Hawila sighs]

533
00:54:11.816 --> 00:54:12.915
You don't seem yourself.

534
00:54:16.387 --> 00:54:17.853
You haven't in a few days now.

535
00:54:21.859 --> 00:54:22.992
Is everything okay?

536
00:54:23.661 --> 00:54:24.627
I'm fine.

537
00:54:26.497 --> 00:54:27.429
Really.

538
00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:38.540
I don't know about you girls.
but I may have overdone it with
the<i> inu</i> last night.

539
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.877
It doesn't take much
to overdo it on the<i> Okolehao</i>

540
00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:44.647
especially with Haku's
hands on it.

541
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:47.650
That's true.

542
00:54:47.652 --> 00:54:49.318
A few painkillers
will set you right.

543
00:54:49.687 --> 00:54:51.420
I don't think I should
be using the painkillers

544
00:54:51.422 --> 00:54:53.722
on my self-inflicted
headache given the news.

545
00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:55.758
What news?

546
00:54:57.895 --> 00:55:00.963
[tense guitar music]

547
00:55:06.604 --> 00:55:07.569
What's wrong?

548
00:55:38.436 --> 00:55:40.402
I know a lot of you are
worried about Aylmer.

549
00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:42.838
Yes. he's been delayed.

550
00:55:43.774 --> 00:55:45.974
but we have enough food
to last until next week.

551
00:55:46.877 --> 00:55:47.810
We'll be fine.

552
00:55:47.812 --> 00:55:50.746
[Izzy] What if it takes
longer than a week?

553
00:55:51.015 --> 00:55:52.481
Then we hunt more food.

554
00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:53.882
[Ako] But we need supplies.

555
00:55:53.884 --> 00:55:55.484
Not imminently. we don't.

556
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.486
[Izzy] What if something's
happened to him?

557
00:55:57.922 --> 00:55:58.987
I'm sure he's fine.

558
00:55:58.989 --> 00:56:00.622
We should try and contact Kauai.

559
00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:02.358
And how do we do that?

560
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.461
I don't know. with. with
flashlights from the peak?

561
00:56:05.463 --> 00:56:06.795
[Izzy] The lights
will never reach.

562
00:56:06.797 --> 00:56:07.963
[Ako] I don't hear you
coming up with any ideas.

563
00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:09.365
It can be done!

564
00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:13.669
Not with flashlights
and not at the peak.

565
00:56:13.671 --> 00:56:16.739
but at nightfall. we could
bring kerosene from Paniau.

566
00:56:17.007 --> 00:56:18.607
We could maybe signal Kauai

567
00:56:18.609 --> 00:56:20.576
if I can find
a reflector of sorts.

568
00:56:22.613 --> 00:56:23.696
Find a reflector.

569
00:56:23.697 --> 00:56:24.780
Haku will organize some
kerosene with you.

570
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:27.850
We give Aylmer one more day.

571
00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:30.853
Until then. we go on as normal.

572
00:56:41.866 --> 00:56:42.798
What was that?

573
00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:05.654
I know what you said. but
we need more medical supplies.

574
00:57:06.457 --> 00:57:08.056
Our rations were already low.

575
00:57:08.058 --> 00:57:09.591
and we used most
of them on Shigenori.

576
00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:13.562
-This can't wait?
-There are those who can
wait and those who can't..

577
00:57:15.433 --> 00:57:16.865
Aylmer may arrive tomorrow.

578
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:18.467
[Kalima] Or he may not.

579
00:57:19.537 --> 00:57:20.936
What do you suggest we do?

580
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.773
Contact him. walk away.

581
00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:26.508
Matsu's already going
to use kerosene--

582
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:27.976
And how long will
that take. Ben?

583
00:57:27.978 --> 00:57:29.611
We need to act quicker.

584
00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:31.146
With what? We have
no telephones.

585
00:57:31.148 --> 00:57:32.781
we have no way
of contacting him.

586
00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:33.849
What if there was?

587
00:57:35.553 --> 00:57:38.020
[tense music]

588
00:57:38.022 --> 00:57:41.723
There may be an unused radio
in with all the other junk.

589
00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:44.593
-May?
-Yeah. I haven't
seen it in a while.

590
00:57:44.595 --> 00:57:46.462
and I don't know
if it's still working.

591
00:57:46.464 --> 00:57:47.529
but it's worth a shot.

592
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:48.597
Find it.

593
00:57:49.667 --> 00:57:50.599
I'll help.

594
00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:52.134
See?

595
00:58:15.793 --> 00:58:16.892
Hey. what about Shigenori?

596
00:58:17.528 --> 00:58:18.527
What about him?

597
00:58:18.529 --> 00:58:21.663
-Maybe we can get on his plane--
-No. the plane is gone.

598
00:58:21.899 --> 00:58:23.198
That's not an option.

599
00:58:26.237 --> 00:58:27.169
Okay.

600
00:58:28.572 --> 00:58:30.038
I'm just trying
to help. you know?

601
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:32.508
I'm an ideas man.

602
00:58:33.143 --> 00:58:34.843
You know. that's why I need you.

603
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:37.112
Or Ben or Matsu. you know?

604
00:58:37.114 --> 00:58:38.547
It's to keep me right.

605
00:58:44.989 --> 00:58:46.655
You don't honestly believe

606
00:58:46.657 --> 00:58:48.624
a disused radio
will work. do you?

607
00:58:49.927 --> 00:58:52.227
I don't know. that's
why I'm looking for it.

608
00:58:52.897 --> 00:58:54.062
which is
what you should be doin'.

609
00:58:55.099 --> 00:58:57.533
I was. I've checked
all that side.

610
00:58:57.535 --> 00:58:58.834
Then let's switch.

611
00:58:58.836 --> 00:59:00.269
Double check.
no room for errors.

612
00:59:00.271 --> 00:59:01.737
Come on. Kumu.

613
00:59:01.739 --> 00:59:03.005
this is what you
taught me. you know?

614
00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:08.010
But yeah. I do. you know?

615
00:59:08.012 --> 00:59:10.913
If we can contact
Kauai and Aylmer.

616
00:59:11.749 --> 00:59:14.917
we can find out what's going on.
and if nothing else.

617
00:59:15.819 --> 00:59:17.586
we just let them know
we need more supplies.

618
00:59:17.588 --> 00:59:19.154
That's if we find it.

619
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:29.331
If? [laughing]

620
00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:30.966
Yahoo!

621
00:59:31.669 --> 00:59:32.801
Yeah!

622
00:59:39.076 --> 00:59:39.942
Done.

623
00:59:39.944 --> 00:59:40.943
[laughs]

624
00:59:40.945 --> 00:59:43.579
See. I know you'd get
it working. man.

625
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:44.613
That's why you help Aylmer.

626
00:59:44.615 --> 00:59:45.714
You know this stuff.

627
00:59:48.686 --> 00:59:49.618
We'll see.

628
00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:55.324

No! Ben--

[children shouting]

647
01:01:55.713 --> 01:02:00.248
You couldn't have known.
no one could. no one did.

648

[Aka grunting]

649

[grunting and panting]

650
01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.266
What are you doing?

651
01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.652
You were supposed
to be watching him!

652
01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.037
You heard what he did.
he's got this coming to him!

653
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.406
That's not your call to make!

654
01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.175
And whose is it. yours?

655
01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.244
Why is it okay for
you to strike him?

656
01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.046
-I was angry.
-So are we!

657
01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:33.115
[Aka panting]

658
01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:42.257
No one touches him. no one.

659
01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:01.543
Heard about Aka.

660
01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:02.243
I'm not discussing
this with you.

661
01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:06.448
People are angry. Ben.

662
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:08.917
and we can't hold him
in there forever.

663
01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:11.019
We can until help arrives.

664
01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:12.454
Who. Aylmer?

665
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.224
We take shifts. watch him.

666
01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:19.394
Tonight Izzy.
tomorrow Haku. and so on.

667
01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:21.229
And what about them?

668
01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.566
-When Aylmer arrives--
-Aylmer's not coming!

669
01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.268
Keep your voice down.

670
01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.405
For all we know. he's dead.

671
01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:33.241
I said. keep your voice down.

672
01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.545
They knew. Ben. they knew.

673
01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:38.280
Shigenori could have
lied to them.

674
01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.582
just as he lied to us. to me.

675
01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.051
That's not true.

676
01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:45.187
-You don't know that.
-I know more than you!

677
01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.490
I told you something
was off. didn't I?

678
01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:52.327
-But no. you wouldn't listen.
-That's enough. Hawila!

679
01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:58.099
The people need to know who's
making our decisions for us.

680
01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.902
If you've been wrong
about everything else.

681
01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:03.271
what makes you think you're
the man to lead us now?

682
01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:06.474
And you are?

683
01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.312
I could be.

684
01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:19.487
My name is Ben Kanahele.

685
01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.597
Its protector.

686
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:34.202
Following John Reaney
by decree of Aylmer Robinson.

687
01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:39.107
If anyone here sees fit that
I relinquish that title.

688
01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:42.644
then use your voice now!

689
01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:50.252
If anyone thinks they can handle

690
01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:53.889
the situation better
than I. speak now!

691
01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:04.399
If anyone here thinks that
the best interests
of this island

692
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:07.302
do not beat with the blood
of my heart.

693
01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:09.938
then speak now!

694
01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.373
[Ben panting]

695
01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:22.017
We keep the prisoner
until Aylmer arrives.

696
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.320
He'll be detained
in the guest hut.

697
01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:28.657
Tonight. Izzy will guard him.

698
01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:33.628
Hawila. you watch
the beach at daybreak.

699
01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:35.463
And you?

700
01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.299
[Ben] I'll man the radio.

701
01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.127
Did he say much?

702
01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:09.631
No.

703
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.635
Just stared
at a photograph all night.

704
01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.705
[child giggling]

705
01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.347
[F. D. Roosevelt]<i> ...in Midway.</i>

707
01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:31.319

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.559
Well. that is not what I asked.

Because he lied to us!

744
01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.268
He didn't have a choice.

745
01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.704

If Aylmer doesn't arrive?

751
01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:40.882
Then I'll take him myself!

752
01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:41.850
To Kauai?

753
01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:43.618
That's crazy!

754
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.752
If it's what I need to do.

755
01:08:46.857 --> 01:08:47.639
And then what?

756
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.422
What do you think
they'll do to him?

759

It's not up to me. or to us.

760

to punish him
or to show leniency.

761
01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:05.473
I'm done talking

766
01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.606
Aylmer's no show is a lifeline.

767
01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:42.277
They aren't gonna let
Shigenori just leave.

768
01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.512
Not for Shigenori. for us.

769
01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:45.780
For us?

770

You still don't get it. Yoshio?

771

Look at what our
so-called friends

772
01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.320
have already done to Shigenori.

773
01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:55.823
They think of us as more
Japanese than Hawaiian.

774
01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:00.695
Our skin is a little different.
our voice is a little off.

775
01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:04.465
They don't see our person.
they see our heritage.

776
01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.301
which make us as their enemy.

777
01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:14.309
Do you honestly think everything
will go back to normal?

778
01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:20.548
It's only a matter of time
and it will only get worse.

779
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:22.450
We need to leave!

780
01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.219
And go where?

781
01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.957
Let's just hope Shigenori
knows where his submarine is.

782
01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:43.671

Well. I was hoping
it'd be more than that.

786

How long are you here?

787
01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:56.751
A few more hours.

788
01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:58.753
And then?

789
01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.255
Then we change it up.

790
01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:01.022
I meant for you.

791
01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:04.993
I don't know.
Why. what do you suggest?

792

Argh! Who knows?

799
01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:33.688
He hasn't said a word.
he just sits there

800
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.323

886
01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:21.942
[Yoshio] Ella. Ella!

887
01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:24.545
[both grunting]

888
01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.280
-Get off me!
-Come down. Ella.

889
01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:34.121
[Irene] Matsu.

890
01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:37.925
Before you say it.
the reflector didn't work.

891
01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:39.260
Shigenori is hurt.

892
01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:41.996
Hurt. what happened?

893
01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:44.999
He was shot by Hawila.
we need your help.

894
01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.500
Whoa. whoa. whoa. start again.

895
01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:48.969
Hawila shot him?

896
01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:52.239
I told you I don't want
to be a part of this.

897
01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:55.576
You're already part
of this. Matsu. we all are.

898
01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:57.311
What do you want from me?

899
01:21:58.414 --> 01:21:59.513
I already helped you.

900
01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.382
I made sure the island was safe.

901
01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:04.385
Besides. I never asked
for any of this.

902
01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:09.323
I just want it to go away.
for it all to go away

903
01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:11.558
and just let me and the island
get back to how it was.

904
01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.694
-That's all I want!
-Then help us get off

905
01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:15.262
the island tonight

906
01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.298
before Hawila can
raise the alarm.

907
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.000
-Us?
-It's okay for you.

908
01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:21.568
They don't think
you knew about Shigenori.

909
01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:24.505
You can go back
to normality after all this.

910
01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.076
as long as they don't
know you helped him.

911
01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:35.549
-Are you threatening me now?
-I don't need to threaten you.

912
01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:39.203
You're Japanese.

913
01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:39.986
How do you think this
plays out for you

914
01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:41.388
if they think you're implicated?

915
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.558
[tense music]

916
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.660
You want everything
to go back to normal?

917
01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:51.999
The only way that happens
is if we leave the island.

918
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:57.071
-Who else knows about it?
-Only Hawila.

919
01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:00.507
He tore off into the forest
heading west towards the peak.

920
01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:03.077
He'll be circling back
to the village.

921
01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:04.311
We don't have much time.

922
01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:22.763
Is everything okay?

923
01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:29.169
Shigenori's hurt.
we need your help.

924
01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:33.407
Shigenori?

925
01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:36.677
Where's Haku?

926
01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:44.485
Irene. where's Haku?

927
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.656
Stay there. Lani.

928
01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:51.592
What are you doing. Irene?

929
01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.694
Get some bandages. Matsu.

930
01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.097
No! [crying]

931
01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.134
-You need to come with us.
-[Lani cries]

932
01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:03.203
Irene. this is not what you
want to do. okay?

933
01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.805
Just get some bandages. Matsu!

934
01:24:06.776 --> 01:24:09.743
[crying]

935
01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:17.084
Yoshio. what are you
thinking. hmm?

936
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.786
Please be quiet.

937
01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:23.057
Well. what are you gonna do when
everyone finds out about this?

938
01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.293
When Ben finds out?

939
01:24:28.364 --> 01:24:31.532
As I said. be quiet.

940
01:24:33.836 --> 01:24:37.104
[tense music]

941
01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:38.539
[bell ringing]

942
01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:48.849
-[Ben] What's going on?
-I was right.

943
01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:50.517
I was right all along.

944
01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:52.286
The. the-- They came for me.
but I shot him.

945
01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:53.454
I shot him and escaped.

946
01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:55.823
-Shot who?
-Shigenori.

947
01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.601
[Ben panting]

948
01:25:17.413 --> 01:25:20.481

[Kalima sobbing]

950
01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.175
[baby crying]

951
01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:51.545
We need to get everyone
out of the village.

952
01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:53.480
Leave it to me.

953
01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:57.184
You can take 'em to
my family's burial cairn.

954
01:25:58.187 --> 01:25:59.319
They'll be safe there.

955
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.523
Okay. come on.

956
01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:05.159
Hawila.

957
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.795
You said they came for you.

958
01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:10.864
Who is they?

959
01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:13.700
Yoshio and Irene.

960
01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:18.305
Why you?

961
01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:21.575
For these.

962
01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:26.747
Come with me.

963
01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.319
Someone else has the same idea.

964
01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:35.656
-You're not going to Kauai.
-It's the only way.

965
01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:38.325
A rowboat? That'll take hours.

966
01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:39.893
I'm not saying it will be easy.

967
01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:41.528
No. it's too dangerous.

968
01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:43.597
It's what needs to be done.

969
01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:46.667
I'll go.

970
01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:52.372
I made the trip before.
I know the Kaulakahi Channel.

971
01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.313
I wanna help the island.
this is my chance.

972
01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:02.849
I'll take the papers
to Kauai and bring back help.

973
01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:04.518
Let me do it.

974
01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.621
Let me do it.

975
01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:11.692
You sure you'll be okay?

976
01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.402
What are you gonna do?

977
01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:24.838
I'm going to find my wife.

978
01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:29.977
Yoshio.

979
01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.748
You can stop this. let me go.

980
01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:39.886
It's gone too far.

981
01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:41.655
Nothing has happened yet.

982
01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:52.032

[Lani sobbing]

984
01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:04.978
-[Irene] What is she doing here?
-[Yoshio] She saw us.

985
01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.617
It's okay. we'll be fine.

986
01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:11.785
Haku. [Lani sobbing]

987
01:28:19.928 --> 01:28:22.529
Lani. I'm sorry.

988
01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:24.765
No. no. I won't help him.

989
01:28:36.378 --> 01:28:37.311
[Shigenori grunts]

990
01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:38.412
[Lani cries]

991
01:28:49.058 --> 01:28:50.691
Don't you touch her!

992
01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.860
-[Lani] No. no!
-[Yoshio] Are you crazy?

993
01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:57.631
I'll do it.
I'll do it. I'll do it!

994
01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:00.701
It's okay. I'll do it.

995
01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.338
Shigenori. please sit down.

996
01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:06.740
Please. Shigenori. sit down.

997
01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.913
It's okay.

998
01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:19.920
[Yoshio] We need to find Hawila.

999
01:29:19.922 --> 01:29:21.521
What? No.

1000
01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.690
Shigenori will kill
everyone in the village.

1001
01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:26.026
starting with all
of us if we don't.

1002
01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.127
[Matsu] Then you do it.

1003
01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:30.397
[Irene] We're not asking. Matsu.

1004
01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:33.867
Find Ben. tell him Ella is here.

1005
01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:37.738
-You know he'll go crazy
when he finds out--
-He'll find Hawila.

1006
01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:40.006
Do it!

1007
01:29:43.946 --> 01:29:47.013
[somber music]

1008
01:29:49.418 --> 01:29:51.017
-Where is Ben?
-That depends.

1009
01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:53.086
On what?

1010
01:29:53.956 --> 01:29:55.522
On whether he's looking for me

1011
01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:00.660
or whether he's looking for you.

1012
01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:02.696
[Ben screams]

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:06.700
[radio announcer]
<i> State of emergency...</i>

1014
01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:26.920
-[Ben] Yoshio and Irene are--
-I know.

1015
01:30:29.158 --> 01:30:30.090
I know.

1016
01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:37.130
I didn't mean for this
to happen! [panting]

1017
01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:40.467
I'm sorry. Ben.

1018
01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:44.838
Where are they? Where is Ella?

1019
01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:48.842
[somber music]

1020
01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:05.592
Why are you doing this to us?

1021
01:31:07.763 --> 01:31:09.062
You're one of us.

1022
01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.866
You don't understand. you can't.

1023
01:31:14.069 --> 01:31:15.035
It's complicated.

1024
01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:20.740
Maybe you were too blind
to see what was coming.

1025
01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:23.243
I'm not.

1026
01:31:23.245 --> 01:31:27.247
-We would've protected you.
-Like you protected him.

1027
01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:29.549
-That was different.
-Was it?

1028
01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:32.586
You saw how fast
the village turned.

1029
01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:35.021
locked up like
an animal. attacked.

1030
01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:36.690
We'd have been next.

1031
01:31:37.226 --> 01:31:39.793
As you said.
you can't understand.

1032
01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:42.496
But I did what I did
for the island.

1033
01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:45.031
You tell that to Lani.

1034
01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:48.168
You tell that to Haku.

1035
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:54.641
It was one thing
and then another.

1036
01:31:54.643 --> 01:31:55.575
It got out of hand.

1037
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.786
[Ben panting]

1038
01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:08.588
Are you okay?

1039
01:32:09.157 --> 01:32:10.090
Yes.

1040
01:32:12.928 --> 01:32:13.860
What do you want?

1041
01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:17.764
You know what I want.

1042
01:32:18.267 --> 01:32:19.633
Then go.

1043
01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:21.835
We won't stop you.

1044
01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:24.304
We need his documents.

1045
01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:27.641
Hawila have them. He ran off.

1046
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:30.176
Find him and bring him
back him back to us.

1047
01:32:30.679 --> 01:32:33.046
Once we get the papers.
we can leave the island.

1048
01:32:33.315 --> 01:32:35.282
This doesn't have
to be this way.

1049
01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:40.887
There's nothing here for us now.

1050
01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:43.023
Who says I know where Hawila is?

1051
01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:45.091
You know this island
better than anyone.

1052
01:32:46.628 --> 01:32:47.794
You'll be able to find him.

1053
01:32:51.867 --> 01:32:52.866
And if I say no?

1054
01:32:52.868 --> 01:32:58.738
Then everyone
on this island will die!

1055
01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:00.707
It's okay.

1056
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:03.777
[tense music]

1057
01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:10.617
You once spoke of being
a warrior who wanted peace.

1058
01:33:13.355 --> 01:33:15.922
Better to be
a warrior in a garden.

1059
01:33:17.192 --> 01:33:18.758
than a gardener in a war.

1060
01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:25.265
This is your last chance.

1061
