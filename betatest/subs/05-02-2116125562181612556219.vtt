00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.375
- Midway is the
punk rock. you know.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.625
They're like The Ramones
or The Sex Pistols

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.750
of the video game industry.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.041
the guys who are like.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.458
"Oh. this is how you
think we should do it?

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:12.875
"These are the rules that
you think we should obey?

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.250
"Well. what if we
go the other way?"

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250
[music]
[character screaming]

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.208
- What was the culture
of Midway in the '90s?

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.375
And my take on it
was aggressive.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.166
- It's being. pushing the
boundaries of maybe good taste.

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.291
- [Character] I love it.

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.916
[car screeching]

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.333
- I don't think that there
a single gamer that exists

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.125
that never played a Midway game.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.583
- They were the only
company. in a lot of ways.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.333
that could make
fantastic sports games

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.541
that anyone could
pick up and play.

00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.250
[character yelling]

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.250
- It looked so real to
me. that I was like.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.666
Boop. you just killed me.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.666
[character yelling]

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.916
- I remember thinking to myself.
wow. I'm working with gods.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.291
- We made great games.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.000
And at one point.
we led the world.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.750
[gentle music]

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.291
- I call it like the Big Bang
of the video game universe.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:50.458
I mean. we want
from blank screens

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.375
to very rudimentary
games like Pong.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.833
to all of the sudden.
we've got Space Invaders.

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:58.291
Pac-Man. Donkey Kong.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.083
You know. we came
out with Defender.

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:03.500
- [Announcer] Within months
of appearing on the market

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.250
in 1981. his game Defender shot
to the top and stayed there.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.333
For Williams. the
company that owned it.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.416
his idea was worth $100 million.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.125
- Well. it's sort of the.
it's the ultimate fantasy

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:20.875
where you are the only force
left between evil and good.

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.791
- You'd go into a place.

00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.291
I mean. there'd be
eight Defenders.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.916
People would be standing
in line. you know.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.250
three or four. five deep.

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:30.500
It was a golden era.

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:38.041
But then we got to '84.

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.250
All this great stuff
got kind of buried

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.208
under like this stinking
pile of shitty clones.

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:48.375
and you know. six-week
Atari 2600 ports.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:51.666
- Anything was
selling at the time.

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:53.750
as far as the home
market was concerned.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.416
And people started just
shoving garbage out the door.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.291
And at some point in time.

00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.208
the customer got fed
up with the thing.

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.333
- This year's hit is the
next year's firewood.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.041
- It's that tough.
this business?

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.750
- It is. I mean
three years from now.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.541
you'll ask somebody
what Defender was.

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.375
and they'll go.
hmm. I don't know.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:17.000
- The consumer got disenchanted
with what was going on

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.625
with. I think. the
consumer product.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.250
It affected how things were
going on in the arcades

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.500
and how the game's
earnings went down.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.541
And we did backtrack.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.291
- The whole video game
crash. we just kind of like.

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.541
wow. man. this is
like game over.

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.250
And went back to school for
a couple years in California.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.875
But I just couldn't get the
video game thing out of my head.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.958
So it was like. yeah. man.
we gotta do a new game.

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.375
get the band back together.

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:49.083
So back to working at what
was known as Williams.

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:54.000
I just remember him. before
he started doing anything.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.583
coming to New York when
I was still in New York.

00:03:57.583 --> 00:04:01.208
talking about the idea of
doing another video game.

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.916
- Eugene came in and
wasn't really prepared.

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:07.375
But he knew in his mind
what he wanted to do.

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:11.041
And he wrote down on a big
piece of paper. N-A-R-C.

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.250
He held up the piece of
paper. and it says NARC.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.041
And they said. "What's NARC"?

00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:18.791
- Guy. you know. protecting
the world from this scourge

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.958
of drugs and pushers
and drug dealers.

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.291
I felt like video
games was always

00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:25.916
in some kind of fantasy
world. you know.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.583
It was always like. oh.
we're men in tights.

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.625
We're running around with swords

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:33.583
and casting spells on people.
and spears. and stuff.

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:37.500
And like. why can't a video
game be about something real?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.708
We wanted to make an
impression to the world

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:42.000
that Williams was back.

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.500
- My job was in field service.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.291
Like I answered the 800 number.

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.750
And I would badger
the programmers at ni

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.416
to understand what they did.

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.541
So then I would go to college

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.583
and I would try to find classes

00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:01.166
that somehow matched
what these guys knew

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.250
because I wanted to
know what that was.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.250
You know. my goal was
to program a game.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.250
And I just. there's
no way you can learn

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.583
You just have to
do it on your own.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.875
- You think about the
casualness of this era.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.583
you know. you're kind of
like putting together a team

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:17.041
and like man. I need a
programmer for this game.

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.208
And then. you talk
to a couple people.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:22.791
and here's some kid. you
know. just got out of college.

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:24.958
Actually. I think he's
still trying to finish

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.875
the last couple of
courses [laughs]

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.625
- I'm gonna be. this is.

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.791
I did visualize that
as the opportunity.

00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.000
the video game opportunity
of a lifetime for me.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.500
I mean. if Eugene's
starting video

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.333
and I'm not on the ground floor.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.583
I mean. if I wait six months
to go do summer school

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.083
or whatever. I'm
gonna miss something.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.958
- Jack Haeger was
really the lead artist

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958
and then kind of
the art director.

00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.750
- Jack has a great history
where he went on to be

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.791
one of the founders
of the Amiga.

00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:52.791
- What more can you say?

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.583
[audience laughing]

00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:00.083
- When we started. I guess
there wasn't a clear sense

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.916
of what we were going to do.

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:05.083
It was more let's develop
a hardware and a software.

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:06.750
- I always thought
with video games.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.916
when you make them. someone
would come with this great.

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.791
like this book. here it is.

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:11.416
This is what we're gonna
make. and we start page one

00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:12.625
and we start making it.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:13.958
It was never like that.

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.291
It was like. so what
do you guys wanna do

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.500
- At the time. then. the
Japanese games had such.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.000
they had this animation down.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.958
I mean. they had just armies
of incredibly talented artists.

00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.583
How can you compete?

00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:29.375
- I started playing
with video digitization.

00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.958
That became a huge thing
for me during my career.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958
The idea of taking actual
images. video images.

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.083
and getting them
into a video game.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:40.750
that was kind of revolutionary.

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.375
- The only thing that had
happened like this prior

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:44.958
was a game called Journey.

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.583
They actually like digitized
the heads of five frames

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.541
of the band members.
and they would like. go.

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.458
[video game music]

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:59.916
A normal company. right.
would go out and buy

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:02.125
tens of thousands of
dollars worth of equipment

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.583
and cameras and studio
setup and everything.

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:06.166
But no. we worked
for Eugene Jarvis.

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:09.750
He's like. "Yeah. go out. I
bought a camera at Target."

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.375
It's like one of these.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.250
you remember those RCA cameras
where you put the videotape

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.583
in the side and you
held it like that?

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.333
That's what we had.
right. it was [laughs]

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.708
- We bought a treadmill
that we were able

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.416
to take the top off.
'cause I realized

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:24.791
we would have to film
people walking in place.

00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:29.625
And teaching actors how to
be a video game character.

00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:33.000
And to my mind. nobody had
done that up to that point.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.041
- Jack Haeger approached
me one day and said.

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.166
"Hey. Mark. I got this
concept for this character.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.625
"I think you'd be
perfect for it."

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.250
- [Jack Haeger] I came up
with that character

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.250
basically from the
old Ironsides TV show

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.958
with Raymond Burr
in a wheelchair.

00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.875
And the wheelchair was
mounted with guns. of course.

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.958
- It really was. at the
time. just another day.

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.875
I don't think it hit
me till decades lat

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:59.333
that oh my gosh. my
image is still in there.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:01.250
I have daughters now.
they're gonna see this.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.541
- I did have a question.

00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.625
At that point. we had
filmed a few characters.

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.958
We had filmed the environments.

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.000
And I asked. okay. we're.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.875
a rocket launcher is
one of your weapons now.

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.875
And I said. "Okay. when a player
fires the rocket launcher.

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:17.125
"what happens?"

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.458
And people said.
"What do you mean?"

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.000
I go. "Well. I can
make it look real.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
"These are real people."

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The mission was to
no. make it look real

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.583
- The body parts would fly.

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:34.750
I mean. I guess this was one
of the first body part games.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.291
I think maybe the first.

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.166
- I remember George was like.

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:39.625
"God. this is so cool.
I can't believe this!

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:40.958
"It's so cool!"

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.750
And I came up and I was really
being very gentle about it

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.125
and I just said. "I
mean. it is cool.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.875
"But do you think that's
a good thing to put

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:55.958
"in an arcade where
little kids are there?"

00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.000
- You have to understand.
arcades at that point

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.541
were still very
democratic environments.

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:07.041
Any family. any age could
walk in without concern.

00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:09.583
- And this escalated
into a huge argumen

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:12.708
And I just remember. it was
a huge. huge screaming match.

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:14.291
And all I'm saying is.

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:15.375
"I'm just saying we
should think about i

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.375
"I'm not trying to
limit your creativity

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.000
"I'm not trying to censor you."

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.875
- You know. I think.
and I think. too.

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:29.250
with a game that involved
realistic content.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.041
when we crossed that
bridge of digitizing life.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:37.541
the game was no
longer an escape.

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.500
- I remember actually a member
of the board of directors

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.250
of Williams called the game
a surrealistic nightmare.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.958
And he was really concerned
that there might be some.

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.416
you know. negative ramifications
from releasing this game

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:58.166
to the public. and felt that
the game should be canceled.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.583
- With the coin-op business.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:08.250
you're selling that game
a quarter at a time.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.541
With the home business.
once you sell the cartridge.

00:10:10.541 --> 00:10:12.291
if it was back in the old days.

00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.250
it was a cartridge
that fit into a Sega.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.333
fit into a Nintendo.

00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:19.958
And it was a crappy game.
okay. you made your money.

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:23.000
Coin-op. it was one
quarter at a time.

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.791
And if that game sucked.
the second quarter

00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:29.541
or the third quarter. the
fourth quarter wouldn't happen.

00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:33.375
And in our case. we wouldn't
even get out of the test phase.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.291
- We had this magic
number of like $700.

00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.958
I don't know how
that number came up.

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.750
But we wanted to
earn $700 in a week.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.833
That would be. if
we could do that.

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:49.541
we felt like we've
got something.

00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:52.791
- So we put it out there.

00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.166
I remember. actually.

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.291
I actually think we
had some champagne.

00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:56.791
You know. we were
drinking champagne

00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:59.166
in this high school arcade.

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:02.250
- I remember the first
two guys that played it.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.791
They were literally
drug dealers.

00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.958
I was like [laughs].
these guys walk in.

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.875
I'm like. these are
some bad characters.

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:11.875
They're like. oh. check
this out. you know.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.500
and they start playing it.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.500
- The cool thing was the
kids really dug the game.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.083
And just this whole new world
of kind of like reality.

00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:21.625
No one had ever seen
anything like that

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.166
in a video game before.

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.000
- Even with all of the problems
in the software and stuff.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.541
I think the first week.
it earned like $742.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.416
And we're like we've done it!
[triumphant video game music]

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:32.958
We are successful!

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.500
Yeah. that was the first
time that we actually started

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.208
like going. maybe. you know.
maybe there's something here.

00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:39.333
And that's when we
got confident enough

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:41.000
to actually make
a plan to sell it.

00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:44.750
I think then management
all of the sudde

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.625
all of the sudden.
he actually goes.

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:48.791
"Well. maybe we should order
some parts for this game.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.541
"Maybe we should actually
plan to build this game

00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:52.166
"at some point."

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:52.875
- I don't know if they thought
about canceling the game.

00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:54.458
but it made so much money.

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:56.958
I think that thought
kind of quickly vanished.

00:11:58.416 --> 00:11:59.958
[Reporter] - The new game is called NARC.

00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.625
It's manufactured by
a company in Chicago

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:04.416
by Williams Electronics.

00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:07.083
And it's currently the
number one video arcade game

00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:07.875
in the country.

00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:08.916
- People were talking
about this game

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.000
that was extremely violent.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.500
And people could explode
and this all other stuff.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.916
But it was okay. because they
were drug dealers [laughs]

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:17.125
- [Reporter] For some players.

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:19.000
the carnage is
part of the appeal.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.625
- I love the gore and the blood

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.208
and the guts
spilling everywhere.

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.208
Then when you hit people.
they go flying through the air

00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:25.416
and their heads smash
on the pavement.

00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:26.458
It's really cool.

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.083
- Still ahead of its time.
Pac-Man sitting next to it.

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.500
and things like Donkey Kong.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.916
And now here's NARC.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.791
It was like fast sports
cars. drug dealers

00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.041
trying to like take you down.

00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:36.250
and body parts
flying everywhere.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.333
And it looked like a movie.

00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:40.000
[guns shooting]
[characters yelling]

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
- We weren't aware of
the changing groundswell

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.125
and the appetite for

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:50.958
aggressive or realistic
types of games were.

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.750
and what NARC brought
to that evolution.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.458
[characters yelling]
[guns firing]

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.375
- One of the things that
Williams was so successful

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:09.333
at doing was hiring very
creative. dynamic designers.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:11.791
But in order to do that.
creative people have a tendency

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:16.791
sometimes to be kind of
off the wall situation.

00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.250
But we tried to
bring those people in

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.958
because we knew that
they could design

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.333
the most successful games.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.666
- Ken goes. "Oh. I want
you to meet this guy.

00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:24.291
"He's flying in. his
name's Mark Turmell

00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.958
"He's coming from California."

00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:29.041
And here comes this
larger than life dude

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:33.125
tall. big like
permed blond hair.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.500
- What's funny. the
interview process in Chicago

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.625
was a little bit crazy because
I was kinda Mr. California.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.458
I had kinda long hair.

00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:43.333
And I think I came in there
with some white pants on

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:46.583
and a blue vest. and. you
know. kinda looking funny.

00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:48.625
- Pretty much the
conclusion was this guy

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.250
you know. like he's
Hollywood. he's crazy

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.541
He'll never be able to
actually do any real work.

00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:57.625
- No. no.

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.041
- They did not wanna hire Mark.

00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:00.291
We said. "No. we're hiring Mark.

00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:01.625
"whether you like it or not."

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.458
- We're going. "Oh.
this is a big mistake."

00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.625
But you know. actually.
he turned out to be

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:09.583
one of the most brilliant
designers we ever had.

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:11.500
- Even when I interviewed.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.583
I said I wanted to revive
the dual joystick mechanic.

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.083
The dual joystick
mechanic of Robotron i

00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:19.791
again. it's one of my favorites.

00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:20.958
- Crazy thing about Robotron.

00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.500
I remember when we came up with

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.041
that dual stick control
thing. and we felt. okay.

00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.750
this is going to be
the new standard.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.625
Every video game from now
on will have to have this.

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.708
Yet no one copied it.

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:34.291
- Robotron. when I
think about that.

00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:35.708
it's sensory overload.

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.250
There's so many rainbow
of colors coming at you.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.041
and the sound effects.

00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:41.416
And so I was kind
of in that vein

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:44.333
of trying to duplicate
that experience.

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:47.250
And so we started kind of
plugging away at the game.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.208
And it only took maybe
a couple of weeks

00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.083
before I realized
this John Tobias guy

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:54.416
was just a rock star.

00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:56.791
- You know. the first game
I worked on was SmashTV.

00:14:56.791 --> 00:14:58.083
The funny thing about it was

00:14:58.083 --> 00:15:00.000
I always looked at
it as temporary.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.083
I thought I'm gonna
do this for a while.

00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:03.708
I'm gonna save my money.

00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:05.291
And I'm either gonna
draw comic books.

00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:08.208
or I'm going to CalArts.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.791
- I remember when
we brought him in.

00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:11.458
I thought he hated me.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.791
I thought he was like.

00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:16.750
'cause he doesn't
smile that much.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.500
He doesn't talk that much.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.041
And I just go. wow. this
guy. I think he hates me.

00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.541
- I remember thinking
to myself. wow.

00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.250
I'm working with gods.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.875
I mean. I thought
that these are gods.

00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:31.125
And just was super excited
about working with them.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:34.083
- A big film at the time.
of course. was Running Man.

00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:36.708
Robocop was in that same era.

00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:38.625
- I'd buy that for a dollar.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.250
- We just had the idea
to take these characters

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.125
and turn them into a game show.

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:48.750
- I'd buy that for a dollar.

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:52.541
[video game shooting]

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:56.333
- This consumerism gone
crazy. futuristic world where.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.666
you know. a toaster is more
important than human life.

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.416
[cheering]

00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:05.416
- You know. Eugene was the king.

00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:07.625
We would all go
to him for advice.

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:11.416
- We were just starting
the Boss Master.

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.333
which I guess was Mutoid Man.

00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:19.125
And we reached the point
where you blew off his head.

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.541
- And so I remember creating
the little blood spatters

00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:26.208
and watching the characters
onscreen kinda explode.

00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:27.541
I remember the first
time I had done it.

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.250
I kinda minimized the impact.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.250
because I thought. oh.
that's looking pretty gory.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.875
and I dialed it back.

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:36.500
- I think John was opposed to
just how many bloody chunks

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.083
I put on the screen.

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:40.083
- Everybody goes. "Oh. that's
amazing. that's awesome."

00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:42.916
And I was going.
"Yeah. it's all right."

00:16:42.916 --> 00:16:47.500
Then I go. "You know. multiply
that by 100." [laughs]

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.750
- They pushed. hey more.
more blood. more blood.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.416
- This boiling fountain
of blood. you know.

00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:56.583
it was like. that's gonna
get people's attention.

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.541
But it. oh man. it
looked so alive.

00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:01.958
It was just like this cauldron
of just boiling blood.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.583
- He said. "Now. you
know what a game is

00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:07.250
I said. "No."

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.250
He said. "A game is 100 of
those fucking cool things.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.541
"And now you have one."

00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:12.250
And he walked out of my office.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.291
So I was like. okay. so
I'm on the right track.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.125
- In terms of how the
games did earn money.

00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.791
we call that percentaging.

00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:22.333
And that was largely

00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:26.708
up to the game designer
to pay attention

00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:28.250
to moments in the game

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.333
where you might want
to lock down a player.

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.541
and you might want to give
them a greater challenge.

00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:36.000
- We wanted to crush the player.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.583
And if you're like crushed
by some little guy.

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:42.500
or you get shot in the
back by a ant or something.

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:46.708
I mean. it's like. wait a
minute. that's not fair.

00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:48.333
That guy couldn't have
killed me. that guy's a wimp.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.708
But if it's some monstrous
guy that's 30 feet tall

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:55.916
on like tank treads running
around. and he kills you.

00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:57.958
it's like. well. you
know. the dude was badass.

00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.541
I mean. that was a badass dude.

00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.583
I mean. obviously he's
gonna kill me a few times

00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:03.000
before I figure
out how to do it.

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:06.416
You accepted it.

00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:09.000
You accepted your death
and gladly paid for more.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.791
- Arcade games were built around

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:12.416
you play for this chunk of time.

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:14.291
and then you give
us another quarter.

00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:17.750
It's like. aw man. I was
hoodwinked for decades.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.250
Like people complain about
mobile game microtransactions.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.708
but arcade games were doing
that decades before that

00:18:22.708 --> 00:18:24.750
in way more nefarious ways.

00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:28.375
- Supposedly. within
SmashTV. was this

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:31.083
Pleasure Dome that

00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:33.166
never existed.

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.416
- Well. I guess I'm
a bit of a scammer.

00:18:34.416 --> 00:18:36.208
I just kind of did it on a whim

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:39.958
because I couldn't bring
myself to just having a message

00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958
that said
congratulations. go away.

00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.416
and never play this game again.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:48.541
It didn't make sense
to just shun people

00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.250
- And he figured.
eh. you know what.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.791
we'll just tell them it's there.

00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:54.291
And since it's so
late in the game.

00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:56.375
the majority of players
will never even know.

00:18:56.375 --> 00:19:00.166
[Ernest Cline] - I remember
just feeding mountains

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:02.958
of tokens and quarters
into SmashTV in the arcade

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.125
trying to get to the
Pleasure Dome

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.666
and could never make it there.

00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:10.416
And I figured. well. I
didn't try hard enough.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.333
- So when Ken Fedesna found
out that I had done that

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.333
and that there was
no Pleasure Dome.

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:19.791
he said. "You've gotta
resolve it somehow."

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:23.291
And so we put
together a new room.

00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:24.875
and we actually supported it.

00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:29.416
But of course. not every
distributor or arcade owner

00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:33.250
would get the new EPROMS
to upgrade their machine.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.541
- You know. with a lot
of things that happened

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.416
in those days. we
may not like it.

00:19:38.416 --> 00:19:40.125
But if the game
ended up doing well.

00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:43.583
we kind of would shrug
our shoulders and say.

00:19:43.583 --> 00:19:46.791
"Okay. well. let's move
on to the next thing.

00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:48.208
"Don't do that again."

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.000
We wouldn't make that
big of a deal of it

00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:56.500
[Ernest Cline] - So I
managed to find a guy

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.791
much like myself. who like

00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:01.416
had probably spent
his whole life.

00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:04.000
like I'm gonna find these
goddamn Pleasure Domes.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.500
And he somehow found a
version of the ROM chips

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.625
that had the Pleasure
Domes in them. the upgrade.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.291
I remember getting
this chip in the mail

00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:13.791
and swapping it out
and booting it up

00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:15.458
and seeing the new version.

00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:18.583
And then finally. finally. I
reached the Pleasure Domes.

00:20:18.583 --> 00:20:21.416
And it was really just a bunch
of like girls in bikini icons

00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.083
that you could run
around and scoop up.

00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:26.875
[triumphant video game music]

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.083
It was pretty...

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:30.166
...lame

00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:33.125
Whoever was responsible
for. you know.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.250
for that quest taking
me like 20 years

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.666
to reach the Pleasure Dome.
you should just be ashamed.

00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:41.583
And if you never reached
the Pleasure Domes.

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:43.041
if you're one of those people.

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.000
I will tell you. it was not
worth it once you get there.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.125
It's just a. yeah. just shitty.

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:50.250
All right. [laughing]

00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.166
- There was a grittiness
about producing product.

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:02.625
about making games at
Williams Electronics.

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.791
that I think certainly had an
effect on the types of games

00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:06.958
that we produced.

00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.041
- We were in a big factory.

00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.958
We had rats coming
through ceilings.

00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:14.000
We had water leaks. floods.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.916
It was part of
what Neil fostered.

00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:21.666
was a hungry. dirty.
grungy atmosphere.

00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:25.958
- Yeah. being in Chicago. I
think it comes out of the grit

00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:30.208
of the manufacturing process.

00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:33.500
- I think it's a lot to
do with the personalities

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.625
of all the people. and the
collective personalities.

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:41.375
as we all kind of went for
the down and dirty sometimes.

00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:45.125
- We weren't afraid and we
weren't troubled by the idea

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:48.125
of having people compete.
because. you know.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.041
we thought that it
would be helpful

00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:52.750
enhancing their animal spirits.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.416
to really come up
with something special

00:21:54.416 --> 00:21:57.250
- When you go back
to the pinball days.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.833
you know. in the '60s and
'70s. and all that other stuff.

00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:02.625
you had basically three
major pinball companies.

00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:05.250
You had Gottlieb. you had
Bally. and you had Williams.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.333
Bally was the
leaders at the time.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:08.625
They were the first
ones to come out

00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.708
with solid state
pinball machines.

00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:12.291
They acquired Midway.

00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:13.916
and then they were
running the whole thing.

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.375
And they then were able
to get Space Invaders.

00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:18.000
and of course. Pac-Man.
and all the other stuff

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.625
that went on at the time.

00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:24.375
- The rivalry between
Bally Midway and Williams

00:22:24.541 --> 00:22:29.250
was. you know. a really
longstanding. highly competitive

00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:33.916
love/hate. maybe more hate
than love relationship.

00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:36.083
- [Reporter] Well. this is
supposed to be Bally's big new.

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:37.791
you know. answer to Pac-Man

00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:39.083
and all of that kind of stuff.

00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:40.541
the next Pac-Man.
the next generation.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.375
Think you'll ever
play Roto again?

00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:46.958
- I probably would. you know.

00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:50.000
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on. you know.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.583
- Everyone at Bally
Midway had been

00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:54.375
looking at Williams
for years as Them.

00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:56.333
They were the other guys.

00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:59.000
They did these type of games

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.916
that required enormous skill.

00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:03.791
And I did games that were
idiot-proof and silly and funny.

00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:06.875
- And so we really wanted
to bury those guys.

00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:08.541
We wanted to bury Bally Midway.

00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:13.291
We felt that they relied on
licensing brands too much.

00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:19.208
So we just felt they were
phonies and incompetents

00:23:19.416 --> 00:23:21.791
and we were going to
teach them a lesson

00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:24.416
- And they were
them and we were us.

00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:27.916
and all of a sudden.
now they were buying us.

00:23:27.916 --> 00:23:29.458
[Ken Fedesna] - They were
diversifying into

00:23:29.458 --> 00:23:30.875
health clubs and casinos.

00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:33.125
âª Bally's. Bally's

00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:35.708
- They decided to get out
of the coin-op industry.

00:23:35.708 --> 00:23:38.375
So it became available
for us to buy.

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.250
and that's why we ended
up purchasing them.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.625
- Yeah. we won the war.
we killed these guys.

00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:47.125
And then the crazy thing
is. then we like hired

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:50.750
all their managers and they
became our managers [laughs]

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.250
And then it was. I don't
know. it wasn't a year or two

00:23:54.250 --> 00:24:00.125
before we had our name
changed to Midway [laughs]

00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:05.541
[Neil Nicastro] - We changed the
branding of our video games

00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:07.333
from Williams to Midway

00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:11.583
because Midway had a
stronger consumer presence.

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.208
- I think I could see
Eugene's emotion in it.

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:17.583
We were fighting a
war for our jobs.

00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:19.541
to get video started.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.250
It was the Williams name.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.541
And a lot of us. we all
took very much pride

00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.833
in the Williams name.

00:24:24.833 --> 00:24:26.625
- We won this war.
we're Williams.

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.291
Why are we Bally Midway?

00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:31.250
I mean. they should. Bally
Midway becoming Williams.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.291
And he goes. "You know what.
I paid five million bucks

00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:36.500
"for that fucking name.
we're gonna use it."

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.625
[laughs]

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:42.583
- The only people that we
were able to actually attract

00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:44.916
was Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman.

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:47.041
who had done Rampage
and Xenophobe

00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:49.250
prior to the acquisition.
and then came over.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.958
and their first game
with us was Arch Rival.

00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:53.041
which was a big
success at the time.

00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:55.708
- The income from Arch
Rivals basically paid for

00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:58.333
the entire price of the merger.

00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:00.125
So really. it was a free deal.

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:02.875
It was actually. Williams
got Bally Midway for nothing.

00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:05.250
[laughs]

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.000
- I'll have to send you
the waving goodbye photo.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.541
You'll appreciate it.

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:12.291
It shows what people
thought about the buyout.

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:18.916
[George Petro] - I got
a call. my phone rang

00:25:18.916 --> 00:25:21.250
and it was Neil
Nicastro. the CEO.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.333
And he goes. "Hey.
what would you think

00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:25.041
"about doing a
Terminator 2 game?"

00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:28.500
And I was like. "There's
gonna be a Terminator 2?"

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.791
- Arrangements were made
for George and I to fly out

00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:36.541
to Hollywood to meet with
Jim Cameron and his people

00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:38.500
and to show demonstrations

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.000
of what our digitizing hardware
and software was capable of.

00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:45.500
- We put on this videotape
of us creating NARC.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.625
And Jim Cameron sees it
and he just freaks out.

00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:51.708
He's just like. he's
like. "This is awesome."

00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:53.375
- Cameron was great.

00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:54.500
I mean. it was like. you
guys are making movies

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.416
like we are.

00:25:56.416 --> 00:25:58.416
- And he just stands up
at one point. he goes.

00:25:58.416 --> 00:26:01.500
"Give these guys
everything they need."

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.791
And we're like.
Jack and I are like.

00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:05.416
- What was interesting
to us when we mad

00:26:05.416 --> 00:26:07.708
the Terminator 2 arcade
game is I'm pretty sure

00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:09.375
it was the first
movie that ever had

00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:11.208
on the set of the movie.

00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:13.291
shooting simultaneously
through the movie

00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:14.958
the arcade game people.

00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:16.708
- We had access to all of
the actors and everything

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.375
from the movie.

00:26:18.375 --> 00:26:21.625
But like Arnold. we didn't
really have access to him.

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:24.208
He was a little more
expensive. more difficult.

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.583
But we had access to his stunt
double that we could use.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:30.250
And once he put. he had a
prosthetic jaw that he put on.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.291
and he could look
exactly like Arnold.

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:34.916
[shooting]

00:26:34.916 --> 00:26:36.791
- What's not commonly known
is that Linda Hamilton

00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:39.416
actually has a twin sister.
who's a stunt double

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.750
and also her stand-in.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.583
And in fact. at the
end of Terminator 2.

00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:46.250
there is a sequence where
the T-1000 replicates itself

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.500
as Sarah Connor.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.416
and then the real Sarah
Connor comes behind.

00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:51.333
And actually. there's no trick
photography in that shot.

00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:53.250
That's actually her
and her twin sister.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.291
So her twin sister came
in and did all the stuff

00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:56.666
and was quite happy to do it.

00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:01.291
- Robert Patrick
was so enthusiastic.

00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:03.375
he kept asking me. "So
it's gonna look like me?"

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:05.416
And I said. "Yes.
it's going to be you.

00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.708
"We're gonna digitize you."

00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:07.875
He goes. "Really?"

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.208
"We're gonna videotape you.

00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:10.500
"and it's gonna be
you in the game."

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.083
I think he was just
as excited about tha

00:27:12.083 --> 00:27:13.958
as he was about his
role in the movie.

00:27:15.583 --> 00:27:17.250
- [Character] Excellent.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.541
- I think what's really fun
about the arcade experience

00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:22.416
with peripherals is
it kind of allows yo

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:24.000
to have a gaming experience

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.125
that you might not be
able to get in your house.

00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:28.250
Having that thing that
you're holding in your hands

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.250
makes it feel more
like a performance.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.916
[Ernest Cline] - That was
one of the most egregious

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:33.208
quarter-sucking games. too.

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:34.708
Like you would get killed
after three seconds

00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:36.375
and have to put it
in. but the graphics.

00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:38.750
again. it was like graphics
from the movie scanned in.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.750
So you're actually playing
Arnold and fighting the T-1000

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.416
and there were elements
from the movie.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:45.083
So it really felt like
you were in the movies.

00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:47.291
- [Character] Hasta
la vista. baby.

00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:50.750
- But by the time
you reached the end

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.708
and defeated the T-1000.
you had spent more

00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:56.125
than it would cost to
watch the movie 10 times.

00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:57.750
- See. when a game
went on test. we all.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.208
we all went out and kind of.

00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:03.125
we'd go watch it and have
dinner and come watch it.

00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:04.958
And the game was
killing people in like.

00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:07.583
I mean people were literally
lasting like 18 seconds.

00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:09.875
I remember John Tobias one time.

00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:12.250
he's like standing next to
it and we're watching it.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.333
and these guys just got wasted.

00:28:15.333 --> 00:28:17.583
And he just turns around. he
goes. "That was 18 seconds!

00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:19.250
"They died in 18 seconds!"

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.875
And it was like. you
know. he's yelling.

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:22.000
I'm like. "Don't tell them
they just lost their money."

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.958
It was so funny.

00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:27.208
- T2 was a good
success for Midway.

00:28:27.208 --> 00:28:32.916
It opened the door for a
more cinematic experience.

00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:35.125
- It got Midway to a new level.

00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:36.958
It just all of a sudden was
like. this is what it means

00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:39.291
to sell a crap ton of games.

00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:41.375
And this is what it means
to earn $1.000 a week.

00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:43.125
And just. you know. I
mean. it was just nonstop.

00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:46.208
- [Character] It's Judgment Day.

00:28:46.208 --> 00:28:51.208
- So we released T2. and
it did. it was doing great.

00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:52.583
And I think this was
around the holidays

00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:53.791
Matter of fact. I
know it was around.

00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:56.708
It was New Years Eve.

00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:59.625
And our marketing person
called me at home and said.

00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:01.500
"Jack. are you available
on New Years Da

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.791
"to come downtown to the studio

00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:09.125
"and be interviewed by
Entertainment Tonight?"

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:12.125
So I went down the next day.
and there was a reporter there.

00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:14.708
and the game was
there. and she was asking

00:29:14.708 --> 00:29:16.333
lots of questions
about the development.

00:29:16.333 --> 00:29:18.583
Like. "How did you get
Arnold into the game?"

00:29:18.583 --> 00:29:20.625
and "Wow. that really
looks like Robert Patrick."

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.875
those sort of questions.

00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:24.208
And right in the middle
of it was a question

00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:26.375
that was framed very different
than any other question

00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:28.000
she had been asking me.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.500
"So in the game. you are
shooting police officers.

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:36.583
"How do you feel about that?"

00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:37.875
- It's very clear in the movie

00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:40.000
that Arnold never kills anybody.

00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:41.375
He shoots them in the knee.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.208
And they fall over and
they're no longer a threat.

00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:49.750
And that's exactly what
happens in the game.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.375
[characters crying out]
[shooting]

00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:55.333
- And I told her to stop
right then. and I said.

00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:01.375
"You need to convey my
answer in its entirety."

00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:05.583
because I felt very
personal about this.

00:30:05.583 --> 00:30:09.750
And I said I had family members
who were in the police force

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.916
so I took it very seriously.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:17.125
And what it ended up being was
kind of this real accusatory.

00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:20.041
hard-hitting like.
"So how do you feel

00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:22.583
"about making a video game
that encourages people

00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:24.000
"to shoot cops?"

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.125
- And it was. it was
our first experience in

00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:34.083
how video games were
directly impacting

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.291
the entertainment community.

00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:41.166
and through the media.
society as a whole

00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:46.000
- You know. in some ways.
I think the old saying is

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.666
bad publicity is
never really bad.

00:30:48.666 --> 00:30:50.208
It's publicity.

00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:52.791
And it gives you some
notoriety and some attention.

00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:55.833
And maybe people that
might not have been aware

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:57.833
of the game before have
now become aware of it

00:30:57.833 --> 00:30:59.416
because of this free publicity.

00:30:59.416 --> 00:31:02.625
So it worked to our
advantage. ultimately

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:10.375
- By the early '90s. I mean.
we were on a roll at Midway.

00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:12.333
and the whole NARC technology.

00:31:12.333 --> 00:31:17.083
our photorealistic digitization
was just killing the world.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:22.291
But as studio head. I really
didn't have the cycles

00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:24.625
to like do something new.

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.791
A dream of mine was what's the
next phase of the industry.

00:31:27.791 --> 00:31:29.708
and it's 3D texture mapping.

00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:31.541
I could see that that
was going to happen

00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.750
And I really wanted
to do a driving game

00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:37.916
- Go in to work Monday morning.

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:42.000
and the person that had
to office next to me

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.666
I noticed was empty.

00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:46.416
And I was like. well.
what's going on?

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.291
And I noticed a couple
of cubicles were empty.

00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:52.291
I called Ken. I'm like. "Did
I miss something?" [laughs]

00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:54.291
"Did I miss something
that was going on?

00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:55.958
"I don't understand."

00:31:55.958 --> 00:31:59.833
And he said. "Oh
yeah. Eugene and Mark.

00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:01.500
"they had a project
they wanted to work on.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.000
"But they're gonna work
on it out of house."

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.125
And out of house
meant they had quit

00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:07.666
and they started
their own company.

00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:10.416
And it was like. uh.

00:32:10.416 --> 00:32:12.708
- You know. they had
tremendous talent.

00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:17.083
And you know. it was
Turmell. Petro. Jack Haeger.

00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:19.875
The art side had John Tobias.

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:21.208
- The first time I heard that.

00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:23.791
I remember feeling
lost a little bit.

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:25.958
It's almost like your
parent is leaving the house

00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:27.208
kind of a thing.

00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:29.083
- You know. in true
Williams style.

00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:31.208
nobody decided to say anything.

00:32:31.208 --> 00:32:35.750
They never sort of like
dealt with the fact

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.000
that the manager of the
video department was gone.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.250
They just kind of
left us. you know.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.541
Lord of the Flies style.

00:32:43.541 --> 00:32:45.208
- I always looked at him as
being kind of the Godfather

00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:47.958
of the industry and sort
of a leader of. you know.

00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:49.291
of our studio.

00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:51.125
And so when he was walking away.

00:32:51.125 --> 00:32:54.541
that was not a good feeling.

00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:57.166
Here we've got the Godfather.
the Doctor of Video Games.

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.666
Eugene Jarvis. creator of all.

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:01.000
Some call him God.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.625
What do you call yourself?

00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:04.500
- Ah. [beep] face.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.333
[laughing]

00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.666
- [Woman] That's a wrap.

00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:09.125
- That's good. that's
a wrap. let's end it.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.416
- In the early '80s.
the games were metaphor.

00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:16.375
So it wasn't real space men.

00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:19.000
It was little
metaphorical bleeps.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.208
and you know. little
animated sprites

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:25.250
that represented a human
or an alien or a spaceship.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.916
The more you got into
realism. definitely

00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:35.750
I think brought in more of the
male aggressive game player.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.041
- The games were louder.

00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:38.416
The graphics are more detailed.

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.625
There's lots more blood.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:41.750
Like it feels different.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.916
And that's something
that the companies

00:33:43.916 --> 00:33:45.708
were really actively
advertising.

00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:47.041
Games have always been violent.

00:33:47.041 --> 00:33:48.625
so I'm not saying that
comes out of nowhere.

00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.208
But it's not the thing

00:33:50.208 --> 00:33:52.333
that they were kind of
leading with before. right?

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.708
[Neil Nicastro] - I think
everybody by this point

00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:57.291
knows the story about
Mortal Kombat.

00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:59.416
It wasn't Mortal Kombat
to start out with

00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:03.708
And this is probably the
greatest story of Midway

00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.875
Ed Boon and John Tobias.

00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:09.041
[John Tobias]- I think the
first time I met him was...

00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:11.958
he was playing his radio
really loud in his office.

00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:13.875
He kept coming next door to us.

00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:15.416
you know. knocking on
our door and coming in.

00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:17.625
sticking his head in and going.

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:18.541
"Hey. is that too loud?

00:34:18.541 --> 00:34:20.416
"Sounds too loud."

00:34:20.416 --> 00:34:21.666
And he'd go back and lower
his volume a little bit

00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:22.708
and he'd come back.

00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:24.291
"Hey. is that too loud?"

00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:27.250
And you know. so that was the
first time that I met him.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.916
I think my first reaction
was. who the fuck is this guy?

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:32.708
[Neil Nicastro] - We had about
a three-month gap

00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:35.375
in the factory's
production line.

00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:37.583
And they said. "We
can give you a game."

00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:39.708
It was like some
ridiculous break time.

00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:41.166
It was like six months.

00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:44.000
"A new game in six
months to fill the gap."

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.083
"All right. what is it?"

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.583
"It's a fighting game."

00:34:46.583 --> 00:34:49.416
[John Tobias] - Karate Champ was
a fighting game that I had

00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:51.250
played in high school.
and I loved that game.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.250
And I thought. wow.
that would lend itself

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.125
to sort of this one-on-one
fighting game idea.

00:34:56.125 --> 00:34:58.958
I was a huge martial arts fan.

00:34:58.958 --> 00:35:01.250
I loved old Kung Fu movies.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.125
In the early '90s.

00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:05.583
there were two up-and-coming
martial arts stars.

00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:08.750
There was Van Damme. and
then there was Steven Seagal.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.125
We thought. wow. we have to
get one of those guys involved.

00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.458
- Not bad kid.

00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:18.958
- And we're gonna use
Jean-Claude Van Damme's image

00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:22.333
in this game like we. you know.

00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:25.000
now have begun doing in
our other video games.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.500
Okay.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.916
- We wanted him to come
in to do some videos

00:35:28.916 --> 00:35:31.416
you know. to digitize
him. and things like that

00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.708
the voiceover. whatever.

00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:35.541
What I remember is
he just wasn't cooperative

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.208
- This was a filler game for us.

00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:39.125
you know. just something
to fill the gap

00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:42.625
And excuse my language.
okay. but I said

00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:44.791
"Kenny. tell him to go fuck off.

00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:48.000
"Tell these guys. make
up their own characters

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.208
"and put their own
characters in the gam

00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:52.333
"Make a fighting game
with their own characters.

00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:54.250
"Forget about
Jean-Claude Van Damme."

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.875
- Actually. I thought
that was great.

00:35:55.875 --> 00:36:00.333
Like. I thought the freedom to
sort of create our own story

00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:04.250
and our own characters and all
those things was appealing.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.000
The first character we
taped on Mortal Kombat

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.750
was Johnny Cage.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.208
- I remember first showing up
to the first day

00:36:10.208 --> 00:36:12.791
of shooting Mortal Kombat.
showing up to film

00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:16.333
and literally having to spend
an hour with John and Ed

00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.375
cleaning up an area
for us to film.

00:36:18.375 --> 00:36:21.250
because there was no room
for us to film anything.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.250
[John Tobias] - When we taped the
Johnny Cage character.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.333
I think we might have
worked on the game

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:30.208
for at least a month before
we taped the second character.

00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:33.750
I think the idea was we wanted
to kinda take our learnings

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.791
on Johnny Cage and figure
out really what it was

00:36:36.791 --> 00:36:38.458
that we were messing with.

00:36:38.458 --> 00:36:41.791
If a character threw a kick.
you know. they would always.

00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:44.208
they'd wanna throw it
as fast as they could.

00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:47.500
And so the problem for us
was it would become a blur.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.875
- John is like. "Bup
can't you float?

00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:50.791
"Try to float.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.083
"Hold yourself in the air.

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:53.500
"because it's gonna
come out blurry."

00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:56.333
I was like. Bup. really?

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.666
- And that was a
learning process.

00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.666
We didn't walk in
with all the answers.

00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:06.958
It was just sort of. we would
tape a character doing moves

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:09.208
and then we'd go back and
work with the actual artwork.

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:11.958
Ed would start to work with
the graphics and the game.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.625
He would kinda come back
with the reality of.

00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.791
well. we have to do that in
three frames. or four frames.

00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:21.958
Speed was super
important to him.

00:37:21.958 --> 00:37:23.791
- Then we'd go on our review.

00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:24.583
We'd go look at the games.

00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:26.250
And it was early on.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.416
When we saw up on the screen.

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:33.875
they had fighters
fighting fast as hell.

00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:35.875
[Mortal Kombat music]

00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:39.791
[characters yelling
and grunting]

00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:43.375
We said. holy shit.

00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:46.375
This thing is great.

00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:51.875
And what was a six-month
production time

00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:56.625
to fill a hole in the factory.

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.583
we threw that out the
window and realize

00:37:59.583 --> 00:38:00.708
continue where you're going.

00:38:00.708 --> 00:38:02.750
because this thing is great.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.000
[characters yelling]

00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:13.125
[Game] - Test your might.

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:28.541
Liu Kang. wins.

00:38:28.541 --> 00:38:30.208
[applauding]

00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:32.708
[John Tobias] - That's
just an obnoxious moment

00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:35.958
[Daniel Pesina] - John
wanted to do a ninja

00:38:35.958 --> 00:38:38.958
And right away. I
was like. ninja?

00:38:38.958 --> 00:38:40.541
Ninja's already been.

00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:43.208
you know. everyone's a
ninja. it's friggin' '80s.

00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:47.958
But there's. in China
there's these type of ninja.

00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:51.375
- The Chinese Ninja Connection
was the name of the book.

00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:53.625
It was written as this
historical book about

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:58.000
some order of Chinese
assassins who had

00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:01.958
sort of predated
the Japanese ninja.

00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:03.625
- So actually. he
bought that book.

00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:07.416
and Scorpion and Sub-Zero are
originally from that clan.

00:39:07.416 --> 00:39:09.583
- The whole thing was
like. the name was made up.

00:39:09.583 --> 00:39:11.708
The whole story was
gonna be bullshit.

00:39:11.708 --> 00:39:13.708
- You have people
out there who care

00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:15.041
about the lore of Mortal Kombat.

00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:16.916
You have people that
can go through. lik

00:39:16.916 --> 00:39:18.125
well. this is
Sub-Zero's brother.

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:18.791
and he's not wearing
the mask here.

00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:20.250
And this is original Sub-Zero.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.625
and then there's
classic Sub-Zero.

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.416
They can run all that stuff down

00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:26.666
because those characters
have just become so iconic

00:39:26.666 --> 00:39:28.500
over the years.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.333
I mean. wrestling was stealing
stuff from Mortal Kombat.

00:39:30.333 --> 00:39:33.208
Glacier. the wrestler.
was just Sub-Zero

00:39:33.208 --> 00:39:34.291
[video game yelling
drowning out announcer]

00:39:34.291 --> 00:39:36.541
[Announcer] -
Combination of styles.

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:39.041
[John Tobias] - You know.
while I may have created

00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:42.250
maybe the visual qualities
of the characters.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.583
you know. the back-
story and whatnot.

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:48.791
really. the core of the
product was its playability.

00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:51.541
And that started with Ed.

00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:54.291
That always came from him
sort of playing the game.

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.125
And he would sit in
his office for hours

00:39:56.125 --> 00:39:58.000
and call people in to kind of.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.541
"Hey. try this. hey. try that."

00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:03.208
- His games reflect
his personality.

00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:06.416
I think his games bring
out the way Ed really feels

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:09.500
about things. because
his nature is outrageous.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.000
- There was a period
at the end of a match

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.416
where you kind of got a free
hit off of your opponent.

00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:18.541
And we wanted to kind of
put an exclamation on it.

00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:21.250
For us. it was always. hey.
watch me go do an uppercut.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.791
Somewhere along the way.

00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:26.958
Ed put in Johnny Cage punching
off the opponent's head.

00:40:29.208 --> 00:40:31.958
- I was like. you can't.
I was like. in shock.

00:40:31.958 --> 00:40:33.541
I was like. you can't do that.

00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:37.458
Holy cow. it looked so real
to me. that I was like.

00:40:37.458 --> 00:40:38.500
Boop. you just killed me.

00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:42.250
- [Game] Cage wins.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.291
- And he was like. "Yeah.
isn't that really cool?"

00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:44.666
And I was like. "Dude.
you can't do that

00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:47.000
And he goes. "We can
do whatever we want

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.458
And I was like. looked
at him. I was like

00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:51.125
"You're right. we can"
because no boss has ever let.

00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:53.416
I've never seen a boss
hanging out with us.

00:40:53.416 --> 00:40:55.833
We can shoot whatever we want.
and that's what they get.

00:40:55.833 --> 00:41:00.708
- I was never telling Ed
Boon. "Hey. don't pull that.

00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:02.625
"don't decapitate
that guy's head."

00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:07.583
Instead. you know. I would.
I remember suggesting to him.

00:41:07.583 --> 00:41:10.250
"Can't you do a fatality where
you rip the guy's leg off

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.875
"and beat the crap out
of him with his own leg?"

00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:16.875
[character yelling]

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:21.250
From a management
standpoint. we also believed

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.916
that's what the customer wanted.

00:41:22.916 --> 00:41:25.750
- He buried it in some
button. joystick combination

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.500
that he thought no one
would ever discover.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.875
I remember the players
discovered it right away.

00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:32.541
Like it was the first
weekend. they discovered it.

00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:36.541
And we were there at some
point watching the reactions.

00:41:36.541 --> 00:41:40.708
- Oh. everybody kind of. when
they saw the fatalities...

00:41:40.708 --> 00:41:43.791
[characters yelling]

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:53.375
They knew this was
something different.

00:41:53.375 --> 00:41:55.333
- We knew right then.
there. that there was no way

00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:57.041
we were going to ever
take those things out.

00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:59.166
And if anything. we
need to give them more.

00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:01.416
- Back in the day. I had
a little piece of paper

00:42:01.708 --> 00:42:05.041
that had all of the combos for
the fatalities written down.

00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:07.333
I mean. obviously you have to
memorize them at some point.

00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:09.541
But I would like whip that
little cheat sheet out

00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:11.541
and like quickly type
in all the buttons

00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:12.833
to make sure I got it.

00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:14.791
- They've got this
game. Mortal Kombat.

00:42:14.791 --> 00:42:16.541
and you could kill people.

00:42:16.541 --> 00:42:18.333
And I was like. I didn't.

00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:20.291
it's hard to even know
what that even meant.

00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:21.625
But I'm like. all right. dude.

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.500
I'm gonna go. we're
gonna check this out

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.750
And sure enough. in the back
of this skateboard shop.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.750
they had an MK machine.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.708
And I just took one
look at it and was like.

00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.000
- [Game] John Cage.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.416
- They are killing people.

00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:38.916
- It was like a big
F-U to everybody.

00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:39.791
It was like. oh.
you don't want us

00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:41.083
to make video games like this?

00:42:41.083 --> 00:42:42.625
Well. how about we
turn it up to 11

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:45.375
and just make that even worse
than anything you could imagine?

00:42:45.375 --> 00:42:47.375
I'm sure they were all
just laughing heartily.

00:42:50.166 --> 00:42:51.791
- You know. we're doing
the stuff with Liz.

00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:53.166
She's athletic. kickass.

00:42:53.166 --> 00:42:54.416
- Then she goes up into that.
- Yeah.

00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:55.458
- Okay.
- Then pose.

00:42:56.583 --> 00:42:57.625
- Right!
- Yeah!

00:42:59.416 --> 00:43:01.958
- We're going to
go into fatality.

00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:03.875
And Liz looks at him and goes.

00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:05.875
"I'm not going to do a fatality.

00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:08.250
"Why can't I just give him
like a flower or something.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.583
"and peace and love?"

00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:11.291
[character yelling]

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:13.250
- [Game] Sonya wins. fatality.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.791
- And then. of course.
came the brutalities.

00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:22.750
the babalities. which
were so ridiculous

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:23.708
and the friendships.

00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:28.916
- By the end of
its production run.

00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:31.291
the first Mortal
Kombat game. I believe.

00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:34.791
ended up selling
about 27.000 units.

00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:38.875
- And I guarantee if you
ask Ed and John separately.

00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:40.333
there's no way they had a vision

00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:42.875
that it was going to go
the way that it went.

00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:44.333
I mean. none of us did.

00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:46.250
None of us could imagine
that you could sell

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.708
that many games
again in our era.

00:43:48.708 --> 00:43:51.958
[music]

00:43:55.625 --> 00:43:58.291
- Being a nerd and
being aspirational

00:43:58.291 --> 00:43:59.791
about the games
industry in general.

00:43:59.791 --> 00:44:02.125
from a young age.
I knew some names.

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:04.250
I knew Mark Cerny had
created Marble Madness.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.333
And I remember
hearing these stories

00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:08.375
about a guy named Mark Turmell.

00:44:08.375 --> 00:44:12.375
who had created Toy
Bizarre for Activision.

00:44:12.375 --> 00:44:14.500
- [Announcer] Mark is one of
nation's leading designers

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.958
of home video software.

00:44:15.958 --> 00:44:18.541
a former boy wonder
who did not burn out

00:44:18.541 --> 00:44:22.625
A creative computer whiz with
a dinosaur-like age of 23.

00:44:22.625 --> 00:44:25.541
he's still cranking out video
games for the home market.

00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:26.875
How many teenagers. after all.

00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:28.166
make it into People Magazine

00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:30.416
and find themselves
in other articles

00:44:30.416 --> 00:44:33.416
described as the hottest
designer in the industry?

00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:34.541
- I love golf.

00:44:34.541 --> 00:44:36.208
I go on streaks on golf.

00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:38.291
I get addicted and
then I get frustrated

00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:41.583
But I love basketball
and gambling.

00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:44.916
- So when I recognized
Mark Turmell's name

00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:48.541
in the credits of NBA Jam.
that was a revelation.

00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:50.083
I know that guy.

00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:51.750
I don't know that guy.
but I know that guy!

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.041
I remember. I remember hear.

00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:54.416
whatever happened
to Mark Turmell?

00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:57.750
Oh. he's making one of
the greatest arcade games

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.541
of all time.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.875
[Mark Turmell] - The rules of
basketball are so perfect

00:45:04.875 --> 00:45:07.000
You've got a three-point line.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.208
You've got timers
for the shot clock.

00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:13.291
You've got periods that
we can tighten up to be

00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:14.750
the right timeframe.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.750
So just the inherent
rules of basketball

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:22.166
made for really a
great product strategy

00:45:25.166 --> 00:45:27.333
- People have asked me
about the influence of

00:45:27.333 --> 00:45:30.333
Arch Rivals on
NBA Jam. obviously.

00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:32.666
'cause a lot of the same
game-playing mechanic.

00:45:32.666 --> 00:45:34.250
We were first.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.708
But all I really know
is that I've been told

00:45:36.708 --> 00:45:39.875
that Mark Turmell was a fan.

00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:41.708
- You know. I think maybe
I've played that game

00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:44.208
three or four games
total in my life.

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:48.375
It's just not a game
that appealed to me with.

00:45:48.375 --> 00:45:49.625
you know. you kinda
pull the pants down.

00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:51.208
They had a punch.

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:53.791
- He asked us about our interest
in doing licensed products.

00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:55.958
officially licensed products.

00:45:55.958 --> 00:45:59.083
And we were resistant.

00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:01.875
mainly because on my side was.

00:46:01.875 --> 00:46:03.916
I didn't want to do
photographic stuff.

00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:05.958
I wanted to keep doing cartoons.

00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:08.291
I felt that's where
the humor was gonna be.

00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:10.250
- Neil Nicastro came
into my office one day.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.541
and he said. "How
come you're not pursuing

00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:14.791
"the NBA license?

00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:17.250
- If they're the real
basketball players

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.791
that's what the players
are going to want to be.

00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:21.125
They're going to want to.

00:46:21.125 --> 00:46:23.125
they have their
favorite basketball stars

00:46:23.125 --> 00:46:25.625
They want to play as
those basketball stars.

00:46:25.625 --> 00:46:26.791
That what we have to do.

00:46:27.791 --> 00:46:28.666
- Made the pitch.

00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:31.833
- [Announcer] Williams
Electronics is
currently developing

00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:35.125
an arcade-based. four-player
video basketball game.

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:38.541
one which employs lifelike
digitized graphics.

00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:41.000
First. basketball players
are videotaped in the studio

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.375
performing hundreds of moves.

00:46:43.375 --> 00:46:46.791
Artists digitize this footage
into individual frames.

00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:49.625
which are stored and
played back in sequence.

00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:52.625
or animated to create a
video basketball player

00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:55.583
capable of performing
on command.

00:46:55.583 --> 00:46:58.333
Well. the NBA's
immediate reaction was.

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:00.625
hey. thanks. but no thanks.

00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:03.208
Their kind of understanding
or perception

00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:06.416
of the arcade business
was rooted there

00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:10.625
in Times Square. which was a
very seedy area at the time.

00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:15.375
And they did not want
the NBA logo presented

00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.791
in that atmosphere.

00:47:16.791 --> 00:47:19.750
- I remember a
comment internally

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.375
"Don't they realize how much
money they're gonna make?"

00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:24.250
Seriously. I mean. we're not
even gonna cover the salary

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.916
of one player. let's face it.

00:47:25.916 --> 00:47:29.333
The NBA will continue whether
they do a game with us or not.

00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:31.666
- So our video guy.
once again. he said.

00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:33.250
"I can solve this."

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.541
He went out to family
entertainment centers

00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:38.916
around Chicago and
he took videos to sho

00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:40.375
what a real arcade is like.

00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:42.708
We sent that back to the NBA

00:47:42.708 --> 00:47:46.750
to tell them this is what
it's like. not Times Square.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.541
They accepted that.
they understood.

00:47:48.541 --> 00:47:52.208
and they started talking
deal terms with Roger Sharpe.

00:47:52.208 --> 00:47:54.250
- Understand and appreciate
that there's never been

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.250
a professional sports
team licensed in coin-op.

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.291
- Well. the logistics of
getting all the players

00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:05.250
in our studio. and then the
logistics of having them do

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.916
every animation over
and over and over again.

00:48:07.916 --> 00:48:09.333
because there was a
few hundred animations.

00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:11.500
and the logistics of
then going through

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.333
and stripping out all
those. it couldn't be done.

00:48:14.333 --> 00:48:16.333
Like there's just no way.

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:18.500
- [Man] Okay. all
right. that's good.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.250
- We figured out
a system for using

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:25.333
an attachment system
that games typically used

00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:28.000
for putting like different
types of guns or weapons

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.125
or props in characters' hands.

00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:32.541
[Mark Turmell] - And so Shawn
Liptak trimmed off a head

00:48:32.541 --> 00:48:36.208
and he pasted that
head on to prove

00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:39.125
that we could kind of change
up a different flesh tone.

00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.708
a different look.

00:48:40.708 --> 00:48:43.208
- There were 16 different head
angles that we had to use.

00:48:43.208 --> 00:48:45.375
one looking forward. one
looking up. one looking down.

00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:46.958
one looking left.
one looking right.

00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:49.083
one looking left up. one
looking left down [mumbles].

00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:52.250
all the way around.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.375
- And again. this is
before the internet

00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:59.125
This is before. you know. any
easily accessible resource.

00:48:59.958 --> 00:49:01.750
So we were looking at VHS tapes

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.916
of the biggest
dunks of all time.

00:49:03.916 --> 00:49:07.958
looking at the athletes
and trying to trim out

00:49:07.958 --> 00:49:12.375
their faces at these
different angles.

00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:14.583
- We thought. hey. why
don't we put our heads in.

00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:17.375
Like let's be in
the game ourselves.

00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:18.708
How cool would that be?

00:49:18.708 --> 00:49:21.000
That's worth doing the
game right there for.

00:49:22.875 --> 00:49:25.250
We got. you know.
everybody from around

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:26.541
who wanted to be in there.

00:49:26.541 --> 00:49:27.875
And we'd get them
into the studio.

00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.166
and we'd shoot all our angles.

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.583
And then there was one
guy that we worked with.

00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:35.250
Sheridan Oursler. who came in
with a derby hat on his head.

00:49:36.958 --> 00:49:39.250
And we're like. "Hey Sheridan.
you want us to shoot you

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.916
"with that hat on your head?

00:49:40.916 --> 00:49:42.958
He was like. "Yeah.
yeah. this is my derby."

00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:45.250
And so we go. "Okay."

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.750
And so we shot him with
a derby on his head

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:48.958
and put him in the game

00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:50.291
and like didn't
think anything of it.

00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:52.291
And then I think we
put the game on test

00:49:52.291 --> 00:49:55.375
And people freaked out
because it was a person

00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:56.708
with a derby.

00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:57.916
You've never seen a
person with a derby

00:49:57.916 --> 00:49:59.958
playing a basketball
game before.

00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:02.416
So like within a
few weeks. you know.

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.583
throughout the arcades
that we had it on test in.

00:50:04.583 --> 00:50:07.291
everybody's playing Sheridan's
head with a derby hat.

00:50:07.291 --> 00:50:09.375
- [Game] Go up.
delivers the special!

00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:12.083
- Funny. because
we got NBA license.

00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:13.708
but people liked playing
the special characters

00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:14.958
more than they liked
playing the NBA players.

00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:17.375
- Well. we were
doing things now.

00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:20.375
like putting in the
Mortal Kombat characters.

00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:22.958
[NBA Jam music]

00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:26.250
- The NBA had a fit

00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:28.000
when they saw there were
Mortal Kombat characters.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.333
[characters yelling]

00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:33.208
- And I thought. oh gamers
are gonna love that.

00:50:33.208 --> 00:50:35.333
A little crossover.
thing. that's great.

00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:37.708
And so Mark says that on
the record in an interview.

00:50:37.708 --> 00:50:40.625
and I go and I type it up.

00:50:40.625 --> 00:50:44.291
And a week-and-a-half later.
I get a phone call from Mark.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.416
which I'm not expecting.

00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:49.041
And he goes. "Yeah. I
needed to follow up with you

00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:52.125
"on something that came
up in our interview.

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.666
"Remember that thing
about the Mortal Kombat

00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.375
"secret characters
in Tournament Edition

00:50:57.375 --> 00:50:59.250
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm
looking forward to that."

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.708
He goes. "Yeah. we've been
on the phone with the NBA.

00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:07.458
"and they're. they're not
really into the idea." [laughs]

00:51:08.083 --> 00:51:09.791
- And it was not
a good situation.

00:51:09.791 --> 00:51:11.333
And we had to scramble
very. very quickly

00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:13.416
to produce a new set of
ROMs that did not have

00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:16.583
the Mortal Kombat
characters in them.

00:51:16.583 --> 00:51:19.083
- [Game] Get that outta here!

00:51:19.083 --> 00:51:21.875
- That traditional
gaming audience

00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:23.291
that wants to find secrets.

00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:25.875
that needs to collect
every coin in the game.

00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:28.375
that wants to know every
secret warp in every level.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.208
that absolutely was catnip

00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:34.250
to all of the hard-core
gamers that were like.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.000
"Well. I know something
you don't know."

00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:38.000
- [Game] No way!

00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:41.541
Jackson [cheering
drowns out words]

00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:44.291
- Having actual announcers.

00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:48.625
I couldn't push them
into the high energy part

00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:51.333
of being an announcer voice

00:51:51.333 --> 00:51:53.791
for a quarter-at-a-time
video game

00:51:53.791 --> 00:51:55.083
in an arcade setting.

00:51:55.083 --> 00:51:57.125
- I had never done
any voiceover before.

00:51:57.125 --> 00:51:59.375
I had never done any
sports work before.

00:51:59.375 --> 00:52:01.166
related to acting or voiceover.

00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:03.125
It was just acting
work. stage work.

00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.875
and work at Second City.

00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.291
- So I got Tim in.

00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:10.333
And he was kinda doing
his Marv Alpert

00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:12.333
but really. he
just became himself

00:52:12.333 --> 00:52:14.125
and became that actor.

00:52:14.125 --> 00:52:15.041
- It was like this.

00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:17.000
John came in. gave me a script.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.375
He said. "Big." he said. "Loud."

00:52:19.375 --> 00:52:23.291
and I went. "He's on fire.
rejected. boom shakalaka!

00:52:23.291 --> 00:52:24.500
"He's heating up!"

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.333
And that was about it. [laughs]

00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:29.250
- And think about
making that system work

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:33.208
We're talking about a
system that is calling

00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:37.708
the play-by-play action.
splicing in player names.

00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:39.583
at different levels
of inflection.

00:52:39.583 --> 00:52:41.750
- The reason for the
different inflections is

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:45.250
just for that variety
of before a shot.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.541
after a shot. in the
middle of a shot.

00:52:47.541 --> 00:52:49.750
Pippen for three!

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.375
Pippen with the dunk!

00:52:51.375 --> 00:52:54.041
Pippen with the monster jam!

00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:57.833
Pippen. Pippen. Stockton.
Stockton. Stockton!

00:52:57.833 --> 00:53:00.125
- [Game] Rebound.
Jams it in!

00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:04.250
- And there used to be a game
called Run and Gun by Konami

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:06.250
that was the first game that
actually the camera work

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.125
seemed to like follow
you down the court

00:53:08.125 --> 00:53:09.583
I go down. I listened
to that game.

00:53:09.583 --> 00:53:12.791
and I hear the guy
go. "Nice shot."

00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:17.000
- [Game] Fakes him up. put
it up. three. yes. good shot.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.250
Way to go.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.250
- What is this guy?

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.958
Is he medicated or something?

00:53:20.958 --> 00:53:23.416
That's not how you
call a basketball gam

00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.250
I go down to the
other end and hear.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.125
"Get that stuff outta
here. rejected!"

00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:28.875
And I could feel the
effect that my voice had

00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:31.250
on that extra amping
up of the situation

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.333
So sometimes I'd
sneak up behind him.

00:53:33.333 --> 00:53:35.291
guy would take a shot.
and I'd go. "Ugly shot!

00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.208
"Puts up a brick!"

00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:37.958
or "Get that stuff outta here!"

00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:39.083
He'd turn around and go.
"Hey. you sound like the guy!"

00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:41.125
And I'd go. "I am
the guy. dude."

00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:46.500
- Eugene Jarvis always
told me. you know

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.125
make sure the player
gets more powerful.

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:50.208
Never take something
away from him.

00:53:50.208 --> 00:53:52.750
But what if we. you know.
put the player into a mode

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.791
where he's on fire and
everything's a swish?

00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:58.541
And we knew right away that
there was a mechanic there

00:53:58.541 --> 00:53:59.833
that made sense.

00:53:59.833 --> 00:54:02.500
- And I was saying.
"Oh. that's unrealistic.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.500
"That's not cool. it's
gonna be fantasy then.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.291
"People aren't gonna take
it seriously." or whatever.

00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.541
And they're like. "No.
no. it's video game.

00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:10.000
"It's totally video
game. it's totally cool.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.583
"It's totally cool!"

00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:13.125
And I'm all like [muttering]
"It's not gonna be cool at all.

00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:14.291
"Nobody's gonna like that."

00:54:15.125 --> 00:54:17.125
- He said. I won't
give you the art.

00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:19.291
I won't give you flame art.

00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:22.041
So I actually went
back into SmashTV

00:54:22.041 --> 00:54:26.791
and took the flame explosions.
attached them to the ball.

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:31.250
and we started the Smoke
Mode and the On Fire.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.791
- First time that we
had seen in the arcade.

00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:37.250
and these kids who are
playing the game already

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.708
for a couple weeks had
seen. you know. On Fire.

00:54:40.708 --> 00:54:43.250
and slamming and
shattering the backboard

00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:47.500
and the guy just went. "Ah!"

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.625
Raised his arms up in
the air. "Oh. hell no!"

00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:53.708
And ran around the
arcade. inside.

00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:55.875
He ran around four times.

00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:57.375
Everybody screamed.

00:54:57.375 --> 00:54:58.791
Everybody was like. "Ah!"

00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:00.666
They're holding their
heads like they just saw

00:55:00.666 --> 00:55:02.583
the Second Coming.

00:55:02.583 --> 00:55:04.416
And we were like looking at
each other. like oh my God.

00:55:04.416 --> 00:55:07.375
It's just such an
iconic part of.

00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:10.250
and just felt so good
to see people get

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.916
that excited about something.

00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:13.333
We're like. yeah. I think
it's gonna be pretty cool.

00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:15.958
- This is bad. man. this is bad!

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.333
[NBA Jam music]

00:55:21.416 --> 00:55:23.041
- If you're playing
against the computer

00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.916
it's never going to allow
you to get too far in front.

00:55:25.916 --> 00:55:28.333
You'll start missing shots.

00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:30.333
Or the computer will
start missing shots a lot.

00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:32.375
if the score's too far in front.

00:55:32.375 --> 00:55:34.291
So it doesn't allow the
scores to get too far apart.

00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:35.625
and it keeps the excitement of.

00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:37.250
oh. I can so overtake
you. the last minute.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.125
the last throw. I can win!

00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:40.750
- If you're in the
fourth quarter.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:44.041
and you have. you know.
just a few seconds left

00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:45.750
and have an opportunity
to tie the game.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.291
to have it go into overtime.

00:55:47.291 --> 00:55:50.541
and take a shot at the buzzer.

00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:52.958
the chances are so much higher

00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:54.541
from the half court line

00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:57.416
than it would be
from laying it up

00:55:57.416 --> 00:55:59.125
at any other point in the game.

00:55:59.125 --> 00:56:01.166
- Rubberbanding is.

00:56:01.166 --> 00:56:03.958
I don't know if that
was a Mark Turmell call.

00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:05.083
or what the deal was.

00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:07.250
but the rubberbanding in NBA Jam

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.250
and then later in NFL
Blitz. and Showtim

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:10.375
and all that sort of stuff.

00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:14.375
it's almost evil.

00:56:14.375 --> 00:56:16.375
But also. it makes for
really heightened moments

00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:17.875
of like. oh man. we
went to overtime again!

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.166
What are the odds!

00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:20.958
Turns out the odds
are pretty good.

00:56:20.958 --> 00:56:24.125
- [Game] At the
buzzer. he scores!

00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:28.166
- We were getting calls
about games that were broken.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.250
I said. "What?"

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.875
Because that's
one of the things.

00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:36.125
you put a game on test.
you know. it's gotta work.

00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:38.500
And to have a game
that's not working.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.583
it's like the
height of stupidity.

00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:42.041
- The game was supposedly down.

00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:42.791
We said. "What the
heck's going on here?

00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:44.416
So we go out there.

00:56:44.416 --> 00:56:45.791
and you couldn't put any
more quarters in the game.

00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:48.416
- It had accumulated
so many quarters.

00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:50.208
it had jammed the coin mech

00:56:50.208 --> 00:56:52.708
and you couldn't put
any more quarters i

00:56:52.708 --> 00:56:53.958
- [Announcer] Unheard
of collections.

00:56:53.958 --> 00:56:55.708
At all of our test locations.

00:56:55.708 --> 00:57:02.375
NBA Jam is collecting between
124 and 167 percent

00:57:02.375 --> 00:57:05.583
of what Mortal Kombat did
during its first six weeks.

00:57:05.583 --> 00:57:08.916
- Jurassic Park was the
biggest film at the time.

00:57:08.916 --> 00:57:11.250
and it was breaking all
kinds of earning records.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.083
It made $350 million.

00:57:14.083 --> 00:57:16.375
And that was a milestone
that people said

00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:20.291
we can't believe it.
it's incomprehensible.

00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:22.916
And here comes NBA Jam.
and Mark said. I said.

00:57:22.916 --> 00:57:25.750
"Can you tell me about how
popular this really is?"

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.000
"I can tell you this.

00:57:28.458 --> 00:57:31.500
"NBA Jam made a
billion dollars."

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.250
And I said. "In quarters?"

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:37.541
- Anybody that just liked
games and liked sports

00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:40.041
and walked around a mall
would hear and see that game.

00:57:40.041 --> 00:57:41.541
because in malls.
they were like arcades

00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.250
and there was always
groups of people around.

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.125
And you're like. what's that?

00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:45.791
- And when people
were playing together.

00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:47.250
they're probably more
likely to keep playing.

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.083
because you can't just
walk off from your friend

00:57:49.083 --> 00:57:50.291
that you're playing with.

00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:51.875
- Whereas some
games are abstract.

00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:53.375
or some people just don't
want to blast aliens.

00:57:53.375 --> 00:57:55.125
or they don't want
to fight other people

00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:57.583
the idea of. it's
like basketball.

00:57:57.583 --> 00:58:00.375
but without all of
those pesky rules.

00:58:00.375 --> 00:58:03.958
That becomes a very
appealing thing to people

00:58:03.958 --> 00:58:05.291
that would be into sports.

00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:07.416
but wouldn't be caught
dead in an arcade

00:58:07.416 --> 00:58:09.541
But here. this is
the perfect gateway.

00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:12.791
[game announcer yelling]

00:58:17.125 --> 00:58:19.750
John Tobias - The home versions
of the early Mortal Kombat games

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.375
were released by Acclaim.

00:58:21.708 --> 00:58:24.208
- Mortal Kombat!

00:58:24.208 --> 00:58:26.291
- I remember seeing
TV ads for the games

00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:30.333
that partly fueled
the kind of concern

00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:32.500
that parents had
about Mortal Kombat.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.333
because it always emphasized
gangs of like young kids

00:58:35.333 --> 00:58:38.583
running around streets
yelling. "Mortal Kombat!"

00:58:38.583 --> 00:58:39.750
- Mortal Kombat!

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:42.875
- I think parents felt
there was a revolution

00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:44.958
about to happen. because
that's how it was portrayed

00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:46.875
in the marketing materials.

00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:49.625
That somehow their kids were
involved in this weird thing.

00:58:49.625 --> 00:58:50.958
and suddenly they turn around

00:58:50.958 --> 00:58:53.291
and it'd be like a
1984 kind of situatio

00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:55.416
where all of the parents
would be thrown into jail

00:58:55.416 --> 00:58:56.500
and kids would run amuck.

00:58:59.416 --> 00:59:01.791
- You know. the home
games. when they came out.

00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:06.750
they were marketed. I think.
to a younger audience.

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:08.041
- You know. when we filmed it.

00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:09.083
we didn't film it
for a home version.

00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:10.333
We filmed it for arcade.

00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:12.958
And who is. you
know. at the arcade?

00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:15.000
Kids with their own money.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.291
- Actually. when I think back

00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.916
of all of the time
I spent in arcades.

00:59:17.916 --> 00:59:19.375
I don't remember seeing too
many moms walking around.

00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:21.791
- [Reporter] After a $10
million advertising campaign.

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:24.708
Mortal Kombat. debuting
in home video today.

00:59:24.708 --> 00:59:28.750
is expected to sell two
million copies at $50 a pop.

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.708
a horrifying
possibility for parents

00:59:30.708 --> 00:59:32.625
who can't believe the game
makers are fantasizing

00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:35.041
about decapitation and murder.

00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:40.041
- So now moms and dads
are looking at their kids

00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:44.708
playing this game. and they
see heads being decapitated.

00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:47.041
skulls being pulled
off of bodies.

00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:48.250
- I don't know think
we'll have this at home.

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:49.833
- You don't think so?

00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:51.166
- No. they're too violent.
- You look a little startled.

00:59:51.166 --> 00:59:52.583
- Yeah. it's a little
too violent. I think.

00:59:52.583 --> 00:59:53.791
- That's pretty bad.

00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:55.583
That's just plain gross.

00:59:55.583 --> 00:59:57.291
- I'm sure moms were walking
through the living room

00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:58.958
and looking at the
game that their

01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:04.125
kids were playing. and writing
a letter to their Congressman

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.541
like. "I bought
Mortal Kombat thinking

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:08.000
"it was a fun fighting game."

01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:11.666
- It's crazy to me how some
people don't see the humor

01:00:11.666 --> 01:00:13.208
in Mortal Kombat.

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.291
I mean. one of the
taglines is Toasty!

01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.875
What game does that?

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:20.625
I think that humor was
essential to its success.

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:23.333
because without it. I think
it just would have been

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.000
almost violent for the
sake of being violent.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.250
- Seeing Mortal Kombat
held up as a scapegoat

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.708
for societal ills
was a direct parallel

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.250
to what rock-and-roll
had gone through

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.000
through the '50s
through the '70s.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.500
what comic books had
done in the '50s.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.125
It was the latest thing
for the previous generation

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:43.541
to blame society's
problems on and say.

01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:45.750
"These kids today. they're
gonna ruin the world."

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.166
- [Reporter] Children
of different ages.

01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:48.625
And that is exactly what--

01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:53.083
- Many companies would
shudder when they see

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:57.000
their product talked about
in an unfavorable light

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.541
by a US senator.

01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:02.041
- The game narrator instructs
the player to finish.

01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:03.708
and I quote. "finish
his opponent."

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.583
The player may then
choose a method of murder.

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.291
ranging from ripping
the heart out

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:12.250
to pulling off the
head of the opponent

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.250
with spinal cord attached.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.583
- I personally delighted in it.

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:21.583
because we saw a clear
effect every time someone

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:26.208
was making a big deal in the
press about Mortal Kombat.

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:30.208
it was on TV. we saw the sales
in the home product jump up.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.541
And if we happened to have
something in the arcade.

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:35.875
you know. it was probably also
seeing the benefit of a jump.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.958
- And we hope very
much that you step ba

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:40.416
and take into account

01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:44.000
our counter-responsibilities
as citizens here.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.916
and not only as people
who are employed

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:48.416
to maximize profits.

01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:53.125
- Then you had the issue
of Nintendo and Sega.

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:57.958
- We were starting to encroach

01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.375
on Nintendo's share of market.

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:03.750
And one of the reasonswas that we were appealing

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.375
to an older age group.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:08.750
And part of that older age
appeal became Mortal Kombat

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.375
in its original form.

01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:12.250
- the Nintendo version
was very neutered

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.458
The blood was turned
into like a sweat.

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:18.500
- People who played it
knew what was happening.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
So I thought that was
a silly thing to do

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.958
And I thought it
detracted from the game

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:25.208
So I was committed that
we were going to show

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:29.000
all the blood that existed
in the arcade version

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.416
of Mortal Kombat.

01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:31.583
- It had that blood code.

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:33.541
It had two codes.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:37.375
It had the A-B-A-C-A-B-B.
the main blood code.

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.916
and then it had
the builder code.

01:02:38.916 --> 01:02:40.416
down-up-left-left-A-right-down

01:02:40.416 --> 01:02:42.041
for the cheat menu.

01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:44.291
And then you could get Reptile
and do all this other stuff.

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:48.916
And yeah. so the Genesis
version was the version.

01:02:48.916 --> 01:02:51.833
as far as anyone I
knew was concerned.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:54.375
This NES version
was just a wreck.

01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:56.541
- We wanted to be different.

01:02:56.541 --> 01:02:58.083
We wanted to be edgy.

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:00.416
We wanted to make the
point that we weren't

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:04.041
this nice. clean. young kids
company that Nintendo was.

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:07.250
- Sega used the slogan like.
we do what Nintendon't.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.541
Nintendo would never do this

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:09.875
because they're so
family-friendly.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.083
But we do other things.

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:12.416
And there's something like

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:14.625
really delightfully
salacious about that

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:18.958
- We outsold the
Nintendo version by
about five to 10 times

01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:22.625
more than what sold on
the Nintendo system.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:24.500
- Will you ever draw
the line where you say

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.041
it's too violent?

01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:28.875
- Yeah. there's. of course.
we're gonna draw the line.

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.666
sure. yeah.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:35.625
[metallic slicing]
[body parts plopping]

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.625
- [Game] Scorpion
wins. fatality.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.000
- There's an ad for a
poster in the Attract Mode

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.666
for Revolution X.

01:03:46.666 --> 01:03:49.583
And since playing through
that game start to finish.

01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:52.708
I've been one button click
away about four times

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.541
from buying that poster on Ebay.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It's got the girl with
the New World Order.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.791
no was it. the New Order?

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:02.041
But yeah. that game.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.333
I would really like to know.

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:05.958
I'm looking forward to
watching this finished product.

01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:08.208
because I hope you have the
story about how that game

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:11.500
came to be in there.
because...what the hell?

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:21.000
[George Petro] - I got this
speech two times from Neil

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.875
It was like. "Okay. you can
do whatever you want. but."

01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:28.083
[laughs] "it comes from
these three choices.

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:31.541
"sports. driving.
fighting. or gun.

01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:33.791
"You can't do sports.
you can't do driving.

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:34.958
"and you can't do fighting.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.125
"So take your pick."

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:39.333
It was. so I guess we're
doing another gun game.

01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:42.500
It was supposed to be
Generation X with Public Enemy.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.541
That was the original
concept. yeah.

01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:47.333
So two things happened.

01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:50.250
Number one. we got a letter
from. I believe it was Marvel

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.000
that said. "We own
Generation X. so back off."

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.958
- I remember George being
very. very angry about that.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.958
He wanted to put into Generation
I remember him saying.

01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:02.625
"You know what. I'm so
pissed at this. I'm so angry.

01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.541
"I think we should put
some sort of superhero

01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.958
"all in yellow spandex that
you get to shoot a lot."

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:09.041
- The second was
is Public Enemy.

01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.250
who would have
nothing to do with us.

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:11.916
So. don't know why.

01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:16.541
So we had to really like.
okay. strike one and two.

01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:17.916
So what are we going to do now?

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.500
So we changed the
name to Revolution X.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.250
and we started thinking really
hard about who we would have.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.000
We knew we wanted
music in the game.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.750
- Initial premise was that
we were going to get bands.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.875
plural. together.

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:34.000
we do country-western

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.625
do hard rock.

01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:38.750
Do this. do this. and it
was just like. seriously?

01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.625
- Our marketing person. Roger
Sharpe. God love him. said.

01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:46.291
"Jack. how would
you like to go out

01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:48.125
"and speak with Aerosmith?

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.083
"What do you think
of Aerosmith?"

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:53.625
And I'm like. my God.
Aerosmith is awesome.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.708
And I loved their music.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:58.250
I bought their music with my
own money since I was a kid.

01:05:58.416 --> 01:05:59.541
- So we got in front of a camera

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:01.083
and just like made our pitch.

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.583
Jack was really good.

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.916
I was horrible on the pitch.

01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:07.041
It was like. we're
super pasty white.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:09.083
And we're just like.
hey. we're from Chicago

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:10.250
and make video games.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.541
We wanna use you
in a video game.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:15.750
And I go. "This is
gonna go zero far."

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.708
- Hi guys. I'm Jack Haeger.

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.375
- Hi. George Petro.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.708
- And we're from Williams
Bally Midway in Chicago.

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:25.375
makers of exciting and new
pinball and video games.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:28.041
There were things I heard
on the radio at that time

01:06:28.041 --> 01:06:30.750
that were dealing with
the impact of music

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:35.500
on youth culture and how
it literally saved lives

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:40.583
and gave meaning to
every generation.

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:42.333
They can't go to their parents.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.958
because their parents didn't
grow up with computers.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.375
They don't know what's
happening in the world

01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:47.250
or what's gonna happen
in the next 20 years.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.125
It's a real difficult
time to grow up.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:54.625
But the one stable thing that
has always kept kids sane

01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:56.625
is their music.

01:06:56.625 --> 01:06:59.083
- You know. you're this youth
that's getting like oppressed.

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:01.250
and Aerosmith becomes
your guiding light

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.333
They leave clues all
through the world

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:05.333
and they leave these videos.

01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:08.000
You just go to see them
at an underground club.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.500
You get right
close to the stage.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.125
Aerosmith's jamming.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:13.291
All of the sudden. these New
Order troops come on the stage

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:15.291
and push Aerosmith
off of the stage.

01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:17.000
And it's like. what
happened. you know.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.625
and you guys are
like. whoa. come on.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:19.958
you know. get away from me.

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:21.500
And you decide. hey.
I'm gonna fight this

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.250
So you use your gun.
you're shooting everybody.

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:26.791
So we did it. we wrapped
up the video tape.

01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:28.125
sent it to their management.

01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:30.208
And like a week later.
they called. they go.

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.625
"Yeah. the band saw
it. they love it.

01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:32.958
"They wanna do it. they're in."

01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:35.958
So we. um. we're like. what?

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:37.875
- Aerosmith has always
been one of those bands

01:07:37.875 --> 01:07:41.083
that was the most eager
to take digital risks.

01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:44.250
They did a game for PC

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:48.291
that was a virtual
guitar. early. early on.

01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:49.916
This was way before Guitar Hero

01:07:49.916 --> 01:07:52.750
or any of the other guitar
abstraction music games.

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.916
So when Revolution
X became announced.

01:07:54.916 --> 01:07:56.916
all of my friends were
like. "Wow. Aerosmith!"

01:07:56.916 --> 01:07:57.708
I'm like. this is what they do.

01:07:57.708 --> 01:07:59.250
They were the risk takers.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.708
They thought digital
entertainment was fun.

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.916
That seemed like a
perfect fit to me.

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:05.708
Besides. I'm sure they looked
at Journey back in the day

01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:06.875
and said. "We can do that."

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.250
[video game music]

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:10.833
[George Petro] They showed up.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:12.291
We got this big bus that they
came from the airport in.

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:14.291
Steven Tyler was the
first guy off the bus.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.875
He had watched everything.

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:18.333
- There's Steven Tyler up there.

01:08:18.333 --> 01:08:21.375
and George is just saying.
"Do this and do that."

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:23.583
I mean. he's doing
whatever we ask.

01:08:23.583 --> 01:08:24.416
- [Director] Action.

01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:26.083
- Hey. come on in.

01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:29.333
You got your wings.
welcome home.

01:08:29.333 --> 01:08:30.625
- Yeah. we didn't
have a drum set.

01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:32.541
because I remember the
drummer had to air drum.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.416
And we said. we're gonna
build your drum set digitally.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:37.500
Remember where all
your drums are. so.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.875
and he would play
them. because I mean.

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:40.708
he's a professional
drummer. so he just.

01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:43.500
[Aerosmith music]

01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.125
- [Director] Cut! Cut!

01:08:51.375 --> 01:08:54.083
- We had a whole looping
session with the band.

01:08:54.083 --> 01:08:56.291
So we would take all the.

01:08:56.291 --> 01:08:58.000
we took all the footage.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.541
and then we sent it to
the sound department

01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:01.000
and they brought up the footage.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.875
- This is all like combat stuff.

01:09:02.875 --> 01:09:06.875
I mean. like heat of the
battle kind of. "No. no. no!"

01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:08.875
Stuff like that. so you know.
pretty high energy level.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:10.958
and that kind of yelling stuff.

01:09:10.958 --> 01:09:12.500
About that long. too.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.375
Give me just three
or four of them.

01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:18.625
- No. no. no. no!

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:20.208
- [Man] That's great.

01:09:20.208 --> 01:09:20.750
Can you give me one that's like
really deep in your throat.

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:22.291
like a "No!"

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.541
- No!

01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:24.625
- [Man] That's cool. all right.

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:25.541
- Awesome.

01:09:25.541 --> 01:09:26.583
- [Man] Excellent.

01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:27.583
- Excellent.

01:09:27.583 --> 01:09:28.500
- [Man] All right!

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.791
- All right.

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:31.250
- [Man] Rock and roll!

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.625
- I'm not gonna say that.

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:33.500
- [Man] Okay. I'm sorry.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.125
That's just too much.

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:36.958
- I think. oh. like rock and
roll. it's like. come on.

01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:38.875
- [Man] Okay. fair enough.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:39.791
âª Sweet

01:09:39.791 --> 01:09:41.208
- These guys are maggots.

01:09:41.208 --> 01:09:43.291
They're putting
chemicals in all our foo

01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:44.625
âª Emotion

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:46.791
- Aerosmith looks like
they had half an hour

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:49.291
to come in and sit
down and go like.

01:09:49.291 --> 01:09:51.916
you know. it's just
like. "Yeah. all right!"

01:09:51.916 --> 01:09:54.208
And then the keys fly
out of the screen.

01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:55.375
You get the videotape
in put it in.

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:57.000
Here's Steven Tyler going like.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.708
"You did good. now go do this."

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:03.541
That stuff is so corny.
but like kind of amazing.

01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:09.541
- It's a gun game. but what
if the gun shot compact discs.

01:10:09.833 --> 01:10:13.500
And it's a crazy idea. I
know. makes little sense.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.958
- The sound of a CD launching
like a grenade launcher.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.791
[mimics shooting]

01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:21.958
like that is part of the
core experience to me.

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:23.416
And I can listen
to that all day.

01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:26.291
- So much of the
discussion of should it be

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:28.000
Revolution X: Music as a Weapon

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.791
or Revolution X: Music.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:35.041
was it Music as a Weapon or
Music Is the Weapon? I think

01:10:35.041 --> 01:10:38.000
There was this humongous
amount of email

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.458
going backwards and forwards
about whether it should be

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:40.291
Music as a Weapon.

01:10:40.291 --> 01:10:41.916
Who the hell cares?

01:10:41.916 --> 01:10:44.583
- Unfortunately. people have
come to use Revolution X

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:46.166
as a punchline.

01:10:46.166 --> 01:10:50.000
I still unironically
like it [laughs].

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.416
- It doesn't match up to T2.

01:10:51.416 --> 01:10:53.041
It just didn't have the.

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:55.375
T2. who had so much momentum
because of what it was.

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:57.166
the movie. the robots.

01:10:57.166 --> 01:10:58.916
You know. Revolution X
was just kind of our.

01:10:58.916 --> 01:11:00.583
you know. our sort of creation.

01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:01.583
- We had this thing where
we were supposed to take

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.416
a quarter every 45 seconds.

01:11:03.416 --> 01:11:04.416
That was what you
were aiming to do

01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:05.958
with these arcade games.

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:08.125
NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat
did that. actually.

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:10.041
But most of the
other games didn't.

01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:12.625
And you ended up having to
try and make story games

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:15.208
really. really difficult to
be constantly taking money.

01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:16.541
Well. there's only
so much difficulty

01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:18.916
that someone's going to
do to pay for it once.

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:19.958
because you play through once

01:11:19.958 --> 01:11:20.875
and it costs you
an arm and a leg.

01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:21.791
and you don't wanna do it again.

01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:23.041
- But the game just didn't earn.

01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:24.583
I mean. it's all
about the earnings.

01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:26.208
It always is about the cash box.

01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:28.500
How does the cash box. is it
filled or isn't it filled?

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.791
What's my return
on investment?

01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:32.250
I paid 4.000 or
$5.000 for a game.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.708
I would expect the
operators are looking

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:34.666
for a little return
on their investment

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:35.958
in six to nine months.

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:38.583
- We all realized
that we bit off a lot

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:43.333
in combining such major talent
with a cinematic experience.

01:11:45.416 --> 01:11:49.125
And flying by the seat
of our pants game design

01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:51.958
wasn't going to hack
it in the future.

01:11:51.958 --> 01:11:53.375
- As video games are
moving towards movies.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.000
this is definitely a step
in the right direction.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.291
That's what I
think is different.

01:11:57.291 --> 01:12:00.166
It's history. man.
history in the making

01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:02.250
- One thing that I think
really sunk it home

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.958
for a lot of these guys
who were still at Midway

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.625
was that Eugene Jarvis.

01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.625
who used to be one of
their fellow coworkers.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.708
had left Midway.

01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:14.125
And I think that kind of
put in each of their minds

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:19.000
that there's opportunities
for their talent.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.500
- At one point. we were
contacted by Universal Studios.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.958
- They wanted to spin a
story around this new thing

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.541
called GameWorks that they
were trying to start off.

01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.250
- [Announcer] GameWorks.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:34.250
the ultimate
entertainment destination.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.625
Games. drinks. music. and food.

01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.125
- And so they were looking
for people to develop

01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:41.958
their location-based
arcade game.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.583
- So we go on this
ridiculous trip

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:46.416
where the Universal jet that
Steven Spielberg flies on

01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:48.041
is showing up at Midway Airport.

01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:51.000
and we're all to get on
it and like fly out to.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.666
fly out to California.

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:56.583
And it was. it was the
best experience ever.

01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:58.750
Number one. it turns out you
can get to LA in like two hours

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:01.041
if you fly really fast.

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:04.125
We meet with the
president of Universal.

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:06.375
We have lunch with
him in the commissary

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:09.125
Like. here's all these
goofy video game guys.

01:13:09.125 --> 01:13:12.250
- So I was usually the guy
that would have the balls

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.416
to like propose some numbers.

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:16.541
or you know. paint the picture.

01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:18.708
- It was just the
epitome of Mark.

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:20.958
just throwing out
these huge numbers

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:23.375
that they're gonna demand.

01:13:23.375 --> 01:13:26.375
And it was fun. because it
was like this confidence

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:30.583
with these guys that they
realize they were the value.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:34.708
- I remember hearing all of
the rumors of competitors

01:13:34.708 --> 01:13:36.875
courting our guys.

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:39.291
- Some of the guys would
be getting comments.

01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:42.250
innuendos. and remarks
from management

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.750
about your obligation to
the employee agreements.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:47.250
Well. what would
happen if they left.

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:50.000
- If they were gonna
screw us and leave.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.625
we're gonna sue the
crap out of them.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:56.416
because we created this
contractual relationship.

01:13:56.416 --> 01:13:59.291
which prevented them from
working for a competitor

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:02.291
for at least a year
after they left us.

01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:04.875
- And it was more about
making your life difficult

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.708
than it was about the
clause actually being legal.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.000
It was about suing you

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.583
and you having to
defend yourself.

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:11.083
and him having
more money than you

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:12.125
and being able to
outspend you with lawyers.

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.333
just making your life difficult.

01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:15.375
So other employers
didn't want to hire you.

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:16.916
- In the pinball area.

01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:21.625
when a bunch of guys
left our pinball business

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.791
to work for an upstart.

01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:30.333
we unleashed our legal dogs

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:35.083
on everybody associated
with that to sue them.

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.416
take them to court. and make
their lives so miserable

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:42.000
that they would just
eventually throw up their hands

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.291
and say. "We give up."

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.250
- You know. he really felt
ownership over all of us.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.333
You know. he would
yell and say. you know

01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:51.750
"Get your ass back here!

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:53.875
"What are you doing?"

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:57.000
He was pretty strong
in his opinions.

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:00.708
- Although the Universal
deal didn't get penned.

01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:05.500
it did produce the negotiating
point and motivation

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:10.208
for Midway to pay these guys
what they really were worth

01:15:10.208 --> 01:15:12.916
and recognize the value that
they really were bringing

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:17.000
to Midway's role and
placement in this industry.

01:15:21.958 --> 01:15:24.208
[John Tobias] - I remember Ed
and I were in the studio

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:28.958
and Larry Kasanoff was brought
through by Ken Fedesna.

01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:35.916
And Larry was familiar with
Midway through Terminator 2.

01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:38.333
- I heard through the
grapevine that Midway

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:41.000
was testing an arcade
game that was on track

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
to beat our Terminator 2 record.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.666
We couldn't have that.

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:47.041
So partly. just to keep in
touch on a friendly basis.

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.625
and partly out of
competitive spirit.

01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:50.166
I went to play it.

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.500
And I played the game in
Neil Nicastro's office

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.333
on the arcade for 15 minutes.

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:56.791
It was Mortal Kombat. and
I turned to him afterward.

01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:58.333
and I said. "If you give
me the rights to this.

01:15:58.333 --> 01:16:00.458
"I guarantee you. I promise you.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:02.291
"I will make it in every
medium in the world.

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:06.125
"movies. TV. animation.
music. live stage

01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:07.750
"you name it. 'cause
I think this Star Wars

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:09.250
"meets Enter the Dragon."

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.708
And Neil said. "You're crazy."

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:14.750
I went home and I wander
around our arcade in Westwood.

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:17.416
and I was hanging around
the Mortal Kombat game.

01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:20.250
And a little 11-year-old
kid slaps a quarter down.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.958
and he looks up and
he challenges me.

01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:23.958
and then he beats me.

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:25.625
And he was so
empowered. you know.

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:27.875
"You lose. Sub-Zero
wins." and I lost.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.208
and that kid was thrilled.

01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:31.125
And I thought. I'm gonna
make this into a movie.

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:32.750
- I was an aspiring filmmaker.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.291
I grew up in the
north of England.

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:36.333
and then discovered
no one made movies

01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:38.041
in the north of England.

01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:40.083
So I moved to London and then
discovered no one in London

01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.291
made the kind of movies I loved.

01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:43.250
So I ended up moving to LA.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.083
And the first movie I
did when I moved to LA

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:46.750
was Mortal Kombat.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.708
And I had become
really obsessed with it

01:16:48.708 --> 01:16:50.375
when I played it in
arcades in London.

01:16:50.666 --> 01:16:54.333
- Paul Anderson had a
tremendously great. great.

01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:56.791
great manager who kept
calling me and saying.

01:16:56.791 --> 01:17:00.500
"You gotta see this guy's film."

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.625
And I thought. this guy's done
some small. British art film.

01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:03.916
There's no way.

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:05.583
But in Paul's small.
British art film.

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.250
there was one three
minute fight scene.

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.708
And I liked the energy
of the fight scen

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.416
[hard rock music]

01:17:12.416 --> 01:17:14.791
[man yelling]

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:28.375
- It's always a cultural clash
with the video game company

01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:30.791
and the movie people. again.
because the video game people

01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:33.541
are used to not having
to make story decisions.

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:34.833
Left. right. center. fine.

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:37.041
It's what. remember.
you the audience want.

01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:39.750
The movie. you have to make
decisions for the character.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.625
So they were
incredibly involved.

01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:44.041
but it was always a little
bit of that. you know.

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:45.666
odd two cultures
meshing scenario.

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.458
It always is.

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:48.875
It still is with any video
game company and movie company.

01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:50.958
- The first thing I
remember was thinking

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.375
well. how are these
guys gonna change

01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:53.583
what we produced.

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:56.083
- The question in
Mortal Kombat was

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:57.583
what to do with the
finishing moves.

01:17:57.583 --> 01:17:59.333
because they were
extraordinarily violent

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.541
It would have made
the movie Rated R.

01:18:01.541 --> 01:18:04.416
which would have negated a
lot of kids from seeing it.

01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:06.625
And it would have
made you lack empathy

01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:08.125
with the main character.

01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:09.875
If Johnny Cage ripped
people's spines out

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:12.291
in a movie. which is more
real than a video game.

01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:13.625
you wouldn't have liked him.

01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:15.291
- I think they ended
up being PG. right?

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.541
Weren't the Mortal
Kombat movies PG?

01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:18.500
You can't make a
Mortal Kombat movie

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.125
and have it be accurate
unless it's like NC-17.

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.333
And then it's gonna
play in art houses.

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:23.708
and who's gonna go
see Mortal Kombat

01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:26.875
in an art house?

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:29.750
Me. I probably would. but...

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:31.541
- Well. the most difficult
thing in the movie

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:33.750
was actually Goro.

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:38.750
- Good ol' Goro. the
last great physical

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:41.125
animatronic character
didn't work quite as well

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:42.708
as we wanted to.

01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:44.041
So we had to cut down
some of the lines of Goro.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.208
- The producers had
committed to him

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:50.625
before I became
involved in the movie.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:52.250
So they're already building him.

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.708
And you know. ultimately.
I don't know whether

01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:56.333
I would have gone
in that direction.

01:18:56.333 --> 01:18:58.041
You know. we built Goro.

01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:00.708
It was like. it was
a man in a suit.

01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:04.000
who then on his shoulders
wore big. animatronic torso

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.750
with another two arms.

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:08.250
And of course. he just
broke down all the time.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.083
Goro became like the
biggest diva on set

01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:11.458
We're always waiting for Goro.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:16.375
- So we go and we decide
we're gonna show Neil Nicastro

01:19:16.375 --> 01:19:18.000
the movie before it comes out.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.625
So we bring out this. some
bad copy of the movie.

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:22.500
and we show it to him.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.958
He looks at me. he goes.
"Based out of 10. maybe a 3."

01:19:26.958 --> 01:19:28.791
And so. he just hated the movie.

01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:31.625
- And I remember thinking.

01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:34.041
when they did the first trailer
and they used that music

01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.416
and they basically just
showed these characters.

01:19:36.416 --> 01:19:37.250
[Mortal Kombat music]

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:39.250
- [Announcer] Kano.

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:40.791
Liu Kang.

01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:42.541
Raiden.

01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:43.500
Johnny Cage.

01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:45.125
Scorpion.

01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:47.083
Sub-Zero.

01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:48.750
Sonya.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.125
- It's not terribly imaginative.

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:54.000
I was a little disappointed.
to be honest

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.750
And then I saw it
play in cinemas.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.291
And I was sitting in the cinema.

01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.958
and there's a couple of
Mortal Kombat fans. obviously.

01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:01.291
in front of me.

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.791
And they loved it.

01:20:02.791 --> 01:20:04.125
They loved it.

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.916
And what they loved
was that you could s

01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:07.416
they were making a
mental checklist.

01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:08.500
Scorpion. tick.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.791
Sub-Zero. tick.

01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:11.333
Raiden. tick.

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:13.083
And they actually said
that to one another.

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:14.750
It's like. oh.
they're all there.

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.416
- [Man] Mortal Kombat!

01:20:16.416 --> 01:20:20.000
[Mortal Kombat theme music]

01:20:23.125 --> 01:20:25.250
- [Announcer] Kombat begins.

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:29.041
- So now it comes the
most nerve wracking time

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.541
in the life of a movie
producer or director.

01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:33.041
The movie's essentially done.

01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:35.125
and now you're waiting
for it to be released.

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:38.375
- [Reporter] Mortal Kombat
as a video game

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:41.750
is already a two billion.
with a B. dollar business.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:44.250
The take is going up this
weekend with the debut

01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.916
of the feature film
based on the game.

01:20:45.916 --> 01:20:47.791
starring Christopher
Lambert as Raiden.

01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:49.375
- New Line calls me up and says.

01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:50.791
"I've never seen
numbers like this.

01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:52.375
"We're breaking records
all over the world."

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:54.000
You go. oh. thank goodness.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.333
And then you have
a great weekend.

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.625
- I mean. he was a
very smart producer.

01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:00.333
This guy got Mortal
Kombat. you know.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:02.250
and set it up as a movie.

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.791
when a lot of people.
I think. were doubting

01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.708
whether it was good idea to
adapt video games or not.

01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:09.250
- Did Neil ever own up
to his prediction to me

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.625
that I was crazy and it
would be an utter failure?

01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:13.250
I don't think he did.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:14.750
I think he probably
owes me that.

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:19.958
[Neil Nicastro] - We
had a very entrepreneurial

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:25.041
compensation structure so that
if you were running a team.

01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:29.750
and that game became
very successful.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.416
you were gonna make
a lot of money.

01:21:31.416 --> 01:21:35.000
Guys were walking away with
million-dollar checks. plus.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.250
- They had a limit of how
much bonus money

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:39.250
they would ever pay
you over one title.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.416
I think it was $2 million.

01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:42.875
And as Neil explained
it. it's like.

01:21:42.875 --> 01:21:45.000
"Well. I'm not gonna pay you
any more than $2 million.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.291
"because the moment I do.

01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:48.291
"you don't need to
come into work anymore

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.125
"And I want you to carry
on making games for us."

01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:52.083
- Each team was
really competitive.

01:21:52.083 --> 01:21:54.750
Ed Boon and I were
kind of at the top

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:56.541
of the competition scale.

01:21:56.541 --> 01:21:57.791
I don't know if
this is true or not.

01:21:57.791 --> 01:21:59.458
but Ken Fedesna actually told me

01:21:59.458 --> 01:22:03.375
that when it came time
to negotiate contracts.

01:22:03.375 --> 01:22:06.250
Ed wanted to make
sure he had a salary

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:08.791
that was one dollar
higher than my salary

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:13.250
- We were talking about
the compensation structure

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:16.625
and how some may view that as

01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:20.666
creating a bad atmosphere
where you're pitting teams

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:21.666
against each other.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.208
And I could understand
and appreciate that.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.500
Some people think
that is destructive.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.875
But I think those are the
same. you know. thoughts

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:35.583
that think that communist
consciousness works.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:39.041
that we have a
desire to work hard

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:42.291
for the benefit
of our fellow man.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.791
I think that's bullshit.

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:48.708
- Everybody. every
designer. every developer

01:22:48.708 --> 01:22:51.291
on the Williams. and
I'm still to this day.

01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:54.250
I think of them as
the Williams side.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:58.916
were very. went out of their
way to make us feel welcome.

01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:00.458
but in a way that
was very different

01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:05.250
from what we were used
to at old Bally Midway.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:08.041
I mean. guys like
Eugene and Jack Haeger

01:23:08.041 --> 01:23:12.041
and Ed and Mark. all would
come up to us and say.

01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:14.625
"Hey. this is the
way it works here."

01:23:14.625 --> 01:23:17.958
and "Glad to have you guys.

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.250
"You're gonna do
great stuff here.

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:21.000
"but don't go talk to them.

01:23:22.625 --> 01:23:23.958
"They're not doing it right."

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.375
- And it would just push them.

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:26.708
People have that drive.

01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:29.500
It would just push
them to do better

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:34.125
because the people that just
wanna help everybody else out.

01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:37.416
they typically don't
have that burning desire

01:23:37.416 --> 01:23:38.958
to prove something.

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:40.583
- If you look at thehistory of the department.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.250
we started out with nothing.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.500
And we had to build this
whole department. and get.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.125
I mean. we were nobody.

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:50.333
and we were fighting like
the Ataris of the world.

01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:52.875
And there was a point
when we all were together.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:54.625
Like everybody's like clicking.

01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:56.583
We're all working
with each other.

01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.250
And then. you know.
I'll be very honest.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.625
success came and screwed
the whole thing up.

01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:03.583
- Footage came from
the Tokyo Game Show.

01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:05.083
- [Game] Ready. go!

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:08.250
[fighting and punching]

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:12.000
- And the footage was
of Virtual Fighter

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And the moment that was seen.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.875
everybody looked at
each other and went.

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:16.875
"We need to be doing this."

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.125
And then forced their turn.

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:19.750
This was when Mortal
Kombat 3 was happening.

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.500
They turned to Ed. and
Ed's like. "I'm not ready.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.083
"I'm elbow-deep in
Mortal Kombat 3.

01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:24.708
"I'm not doing this."

01:24:24.708 --> 01:24:26.583
And so this other team that
was making a tank game

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.875
decided. we're gonna
make a fighting game

01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:33.000
[inspirational musical burst]

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.958
- We were making a fighting
game in the company

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.250
that made Mortal Kombat.

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.541
And I think that was
a huge challenge.

01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.083
because I think a
lot of people thought

01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:43.625
War Gods was going to be
Mortal Kombat 4. or whatever.

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:44.875
And it was not.

01:24:44.875 --> 01:24:46.875
- You know. it seemed
like thematically.

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:50.500
they were a little closer.
too close to Mortal Kombat.

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.250
- It was unadulteratedly
a ripoff of Mortal Kombat.

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:54.958
They used all exact
control mechanisms

01:24:54.958 --> 01:24:56.541
with the joysticks
and the buttons.

01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:58.333
It was just. it was no
beating around the bush.

01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:00.583
This was Mortal
Kombat. but in 3D.

01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:02.666
[characters yelling]

01:25:02.666 --> 01:25:04.250
- Nobody had it.

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:06.041
Nobody has a corner
on ideas. you know?

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:07.958
Just kind of ideas
come and flow.

01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:10.583
and we needed to do what
was best for the department.

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:14.041
But it could get very
difficult sometime

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:16.791
- People would
walk past an office

01:25:16.791 --> 01:25:19.000
where some of the Mortal
Kombat guys were in there.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.583
If you were on
the War Gods team.

01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:22.500
they would literally shut
the door in your face.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.375
- Did we get any help from
the MK guys on War Gods?

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:26.875
And that answer is zero.

01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:30.291
- It was. it was ugly. [laughs]

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.750
- You know. that's the way.

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:34.000
you know. the way
management pitted the teams

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.333
against each other.

01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:37.333
That kind of didn't
help the situation.

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:39.958
- I think I remember
one of the reviews.

01:25:39.958 --> 01:25:41.333
we all had a good
chuckle at this.

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:44.000
one of the reviews was
War Gods. God Awful.

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:49.000
[dance music]

01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:53.000
[Eugene Jarvis]- Well. we had
been working on Cruis'n project

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.250
for. God. I don't know. maybe.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.166
I guess two-and-a-half.
maybe only three years.

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:02.125
You know. we were
running out of money

01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:07.541
and kind of over budget
and over time [laughs]

01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:12.250
- At the time. Nintendo
was touting their Ultra 64.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.291
[Announcer] - Project Reality.

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:17.583
Leagues beyond any
currently available

01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:19.250
or anticipated hardware.

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:22.250
Project Reality will bring
to home video players

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.000
the same types of
astounding visual effects

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.250
seen in movies.
like Terminator 2.

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.708
- They were making
a push just to show

01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:31.916
that we've got this
incredibly powerful.

01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:36.041
polygon generating
new video game system

01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:40.708
- So the Ultra 64 was really
vaporware at the time.

01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.291
They didn't have anything.

01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:43.958
They were a year away.

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:48.958
So they came to Neil Nicastro
and they came to Williams

01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:51.250
and said. "Listen.
what do you guys have

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.208
- You know. went to
Eugene. and I said.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.208
"Hey Gene. if I can get
you this amount of money."

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:58.958
I think it was "give
me all your rights

01:26:58.958 --> 01:27:00.583
"to the home side of it."

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:02.791
Eugene says "Yes.
if you get me X.

01:27:02.791 --> 01:27:05.208
"I'll be happy with that."

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:08.041
And then we ended up getting
another figure from Nintendo

01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:10.708
that was like a
big multiple of X.

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:13.583
- And so we decided

01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:17.416
rather than going broke. that
we would go back to Midway.

01:27:17.416 --> 01:27:19.750
[laughs]

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:22.250
- So Nintendo was bragging
that it was going to based

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.625
on the N64 and
everything else and stuff

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:27.291
Well. of course. showing
it at the CES Show

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:29.250
was not running on N64.

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.416
It wasn't anywhere near N64.

01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:33.250
- You know. we kinda had to
swallow hard on that one.

01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:35.958
because it was. it
was our hardware.

01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:37.916
It was hardware that
we created in there

01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:40.791
And they were labeling
it the Nintendo hardware.

01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:45.166
- [Announcer] Only
on Nintendo Ultra 64.

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.958
- Nintendo system being
in the Cruis'n game?

01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:51.708
Somebody in their marketing
department made that up

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.375
after the fact.

01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:55.083
[video game music]

01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:56.750
- When the Nintendo
thing came along.

01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.041
it enabled us to come
back and really ha

01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:01.291
a longer runway for
us to finish the game

01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:05.375
And the advantage that
we had by doing that was.

01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:07.208
I'm not saying that we
were doing it in a bubble.

01:28:07.208 --> 01:28:10.625
But we weren't amongst
the Turmells of the world

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:12.625
and the Boons of the
world. and so on.

01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:15.416
that could give us
valuable information.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.333
- And they were kinda
brutal on our game

01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:18.625
I mean. the Cruis'n USA.

01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:22.708
I remember Fedesna was
like. "Yeah. snoozin'."

01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:23.750
That was his term for it.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.875
- I do remember that.

01:28:26.416 --> 01:28:28.708
But I don't remember
who gave it that name.

01:28:28.708 --> 01:28:31.333
But it had to be one
of the other guys.

01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:33.125
It wasn't me that gave
it the name Snoozin'.

01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:35.333
- Here was the guy
that abandoned them

01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:36.583
in the coming back.

01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:40.208
And it was a little bit
awkward for a while.

01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:41.958
- Oh. when that game
came in. it was garbage.

01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:44.125
It was like. it
was such garbage.

01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:46.583
And Eugene knew it. too.

01:28:46.583 --> 01:28:48.083
That's why he came back in.

01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:49.875
He was wise enough
to know he needed.

01:28:49.875 --> 01:28:53.958
you know. he needed that punch.
that he would get Turmell.

01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:55.000
I mean. Turmell would
sit around that ga

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.958
and just write stuff.

01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:58.250
You know. I would talk about it.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.250
- We got that energy.
like that negative vibe.

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:03.000
like. you know. like
ooh. you know. like

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.541
and then we got movin'
and it was cool.

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:08.083
It was really cool to
get that frank input.

01:29:08.083 --> 01:29:14.041
What really hurts is
the truth [laughs]

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:17.500
- The common denominator
in everything that we did

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.541
was that we all
worked for Eugene.

01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:23.250
And we all like. we all
grew up on Eugene's games.

01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:25.375
Ask Mark Turmell. Eugene fan.

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:26.916
Ask Ed.

01:29:26.916 --> 01:29:27.833
You know. we all
worked for Eugene.

01:29:27.833 --> 01:29:29.125
He was our guy. you know?

01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:33.208
He was Stan Lee. man. [laughs]

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:37.208
- Cruis'n was a huge
commercial success.

01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:41.958
But critically. actually.
it took a lot of flack.

01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:46.000
because it was more of a
casual player's driving game.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.416
Actually appealed
a lot to girls.

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:52.791
Like teenage girls loved
the driving mechanic

01:29:52.791 --> 01:29:55.000
and loved. you know.
like pre-drivers.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.083
like practicing
for their license.

01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:00.250
- The startup cost to going
to play a fighting game

01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.250
is high. right. like
everyone's paying attention.

01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.708
and you're having to
play with another person.

01:30:04.708 --> 01:30:06.791
You're probably looking for a
slightly different experience.

01:30:06.791 --> 01:30:08.125
You might be lookingfor a machine

01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:09.791
that's not as crowded
so you can go play

01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:10.958
and kind of be left alone.

01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:12.625
- You know. we just
took all this flack.

01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:15.291
that we were sellouts.
and our game sucked.

01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.958
and there was no skill.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:21.708
And you know what's crazy is
I look at Cruis'n USA today

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:24.750
and from today's
standards. which is.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:27.333
I guess 28-odd years later.

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.333
The game actually is
horribly difficult [laughs]

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:33.291
So if you put it out
in an arcade today.

01:30:33.291 --> 01:30:35.333
people would refuse to
play it. it's so hard.

01:30:36.416 --> 01:30:40.708
[voice speaking on overhead]

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:43.541
[music]

01:30:48.458 --> 01:30:52.125
- When I interviewed Ed and
John about Mortal Kombat 3.

01:30:52.125 --> 01:30:54.250
we had already spoken
a few times before

01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:56.625
and I said. you know.
"You're on your third game.

01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:58.250
"Are you tired?"

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.083
And they actually did
sound a little bit tired.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.833
- [Ed Boon] To some degree.

01:31:02.833 --> 01:31:05.125
we've become like a
Mortal Kombat factory

01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:09.291
in the sense that we
know exactly how to
do the backgrounds.

01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:11.041
We know exactly how
to do characters.

01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:14.583
We know how to do all the
throws. and the filming.

01:31:14.583 --> 01:31:16.125
We're just like
an assembly line.

01:31:16.125 --> 01:31:17.666
- [Dan Amrich] Right.

01:31:17.666 --> 01:31:19.291
- [Ed Boon] So in that respect.
we're like. you know.

01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:20.500
you kinda wish at getting
a chance to do something

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.916
completely different.

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:24.416
- Apparently. there
was at the time a pitch

01:31:24.416 --> 01:31:26.125
for a Star Wars game.

01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:27.291
And when we started
talking about

01:31:27.291 --> 01:31:28.958
what that potential
Star Wars game could be.

01:31:28.958 --> 01:31:30.791
on the record. they lit up.

01:31:30.791 --> 01:31:32.375
They were so happy.

01:31:32.375 --> 01:31:33.875
And I could tell. these guys
need their batteries recharged.

01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:36.375
They needed to shift
gears out of Mortal Kombat

01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:39.208
to keep Mortal Kombat
interesting for themselves.

01:31:39.208 --> 01:31:42.541
And I really believe that
that's what The Grid became.

01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:48.791
The Grid was a six-player
competitive death match game

01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:52.125
with completely
different controls.

01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:54.750
- And then it had all
these sensibilities

01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.625
that came from SmashTV.

01:31:56.625 --> 01:31:58.000
- Good luck.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
You'll need it.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.541
- You've got two minutes
to get five points.

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:04.333
Good luck!

01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:08.708
Mike Mika - It was trying to
be this thing that was creating

01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:10.958
a sport out of this
new kind of interfac

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:12.041
a new kind of way to play.

01:32:14.208 --> 01:32:15.583
It had all the makings
and the trimmings

01:32:15.583 --> 01:32:18.041
of what would be a
big e-sport today.

01:32:18.041 --> 01:32:20.250
but all the way
back in the '90s.

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.208
- We'll get people
here that it's like.

01:32:22.208 --> 01:32:24.041
hey. we're gonna be
on The Grid all night

01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:27.333
If anybody's saying we need
to be off. let us know.

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.833
just because we just
wanna grind out and play

01:32:29.833 --> 01:32:31.333
for six hours of The Grid.

01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:33.791
- The Grid was Ed
Boon having fun.

01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:36.708
He really did. he
let it all out.

01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:38.875
He let himself do
something different.

01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:41.791
And you can see that
there's a joy in that game.

01:32:41.791 --> 01:32:43.791
of him being able to shift gears

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:46.250
and stretch a different
part of his design brain.

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:49.500
I always see it as sort
of Ed Boon's vacation game

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.958
that he worked so hard on

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:53.250
that it was not a
vacation at all.

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:56.000
- We only sold 550 Grids.
it was. approximately.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.333
There was nothing.

01:32:57.333 --> 01:33:00.625
Grid earned terribly
as a single unit.

01:33:00.625 --> 01:33:03.083
If you had four or
the six units togethe

01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:04.750
The problem there was. though.

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.583
you gotta buy four cabinets
or four sets of electronics

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:08.916
and everything else.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.583
So now in order to
get the earnings.

01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:12.208
which you're talking about.

01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:15.083
you had to invest. instead of
X. you had to invest 4X.

01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:18.583
- You know. the operators
expected every game

01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:20.750
that comes out has
to earn. you know.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.208
so much money per week.

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:25.083
There was no way that every
game was going to come out

01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:26.791
and earn two grand a week.

01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:29.083
It just wasn't going to happen.

01:33:29.083 --> 01:33:30.875
- All management
wanted to do was just.

01:33:30.875 --> 01:33:32.500
they wanted to stamp out.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.875
Basically. if they
could have stamped ou

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:36.875
more Mortal Kombats.
you know. in a row.

01:33:36.875 --> 01:33:38.541
that's what they would've done.

01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:41.875
- We went to the well too many
times with the same mechanics

01:33:41.875 --> 01:33:44.500
or not enough innovation.

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.500
- But it was in the late
'90s I saw the warning signs

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.875
that things may be
getting more difficult

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.083
in the coin-op area.

01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:56.208
- The consoles for the home
get more sophisticated.

01:33:56.208 --> 01:33:58.333
The CD-Rom is a hugely
important technology.

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:01.041
And it brings that kind
of arcade-style graphics

01:34:01.041 --> 01:34:02.375
into the home.

01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:06.500
- I could feel that what
we could do as a company

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.500
on the hardware side wasn't
going to be able to approach

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:16.666
that what a whole team of
engineers could pull off.

01:34:16.958 --> 01:34:21.916
- Console gaming really
changed how I felt about games

01:34:21.916 --> 01:34:24.250
because I was able
to take my time.

01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:25.958
I was able to play
games without somebody

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:27.791
looking over my
shoulder and judging

01:34:27.791 --> 01:34:28.916
whether I was good or not.

01:34:28.916 --> 01:34:32.416
And I was able to experiment.

01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:35.875
I was really happy when
consoles came about.

01:34:35.875 --> 01:34:38.000
because then there
were games for me. to

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.375
Whereas in a arcade. there is.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:42.541
you know. if I weren't
good at Street Fighter.

01:34:42.541 --> 01:34:45.958
you know. the whole sort of
experience kind of stopped

01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:47.000
at a certain level.

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.625
- I think the other
thing that had a huge impact

01:34:50.625 --> 01:34:51.833
was the internet.

01:34:51.833 --> 01:34:53.708
So the social aspect
of the arcade.

01:34:53.708 --> 01:34:56.375
where that's where you would
go and trash talk your buddy

01:34:56.375 --> 01:34:59.541
and friend. you could
now find ways to do that

01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:02.500
playing your game. but
also via the internet.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.708
- In fact. I remember an
operator telling me once.

01:35:04.708 --> 01:35:09.208
when the Monica Lewinsky
conversation got published

01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:13.958
on the internet. that he saw
a decline in his audience.

01:35:14.416 --> 01:35:17.541
Like. it seems weird.
but the internet became

01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:19.583
like this entertainment factor.

01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:23.916
- I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.

01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:26.708
- And people stopped
going to arcades.

01:35:26.708 --> 01:35:30.000
- So it was that period
of time where. you know.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.541
you feel yourself being.
you see your future.

01:35:33.541 --> 01:35:36.000
and your future looks crappy.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.500
And you feel

01:35:38.958 --> 01:35:43.208
somewhat paralyzed to
actually make a change.

01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:46.500
I'd say that's probably
the crappiest time.

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.500
- You know. Neil basically
had a meeting and he said.

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.958
"Hey. I think the
days are numbered

01:35:51.958 --> 01:35:53.958
"for the coin-op business."

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:55.250
- So the writing
was on the wall.

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.375
Things started falling
apart very quickl

01:35:57.375 --> 01:36:00.000
And you had this millions
of dollars of overhead

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.791
in coin-op and it
was decided. okay.

01:36:01.791 --> 01:36:03.083
we're gonna get out of coin-op

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:04.416
because there's so
much more money.

01:36:04.416 --> 01:36:06.541
theoretically to be
made. on the consume

01:36:06.541 --> 01:36:07.791
than there was in coin-op.

01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:09.541
And that was the end of coin-op.

01:36:09.541 --> 01:36:12.250
Pinball first. then came Midway.

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:13.750
as far as coin-op was concerned.

01:36:22.333 --> 01:36:25.250
- Games were focused
direct-to-consumer now.

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:28.250
You know. Sony. et cetera.

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:33.000
And it took all of the
arcade mechanics out.

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.250
It took the ways that
we percentaged games.

01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:38.500
the way we would bring
a player through a game.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.500
Certainly. consumer development
is a lot more complex

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.250
and requires. you know.
higher structure in a team.

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:47.916
and more team members.

01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:52.541
But that did change what
Midway was for all those years

01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:54.708
in the '80s and '90s.

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:57.083
- When you look at it sort of
in the grand scheme of things.

01:36:57.083 --> 01:36:58.375
it was fairly short-lived.

01:36:58.375 --> 01:37:01.000
My career at Midway
spanned. I think.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.958
a little bit longer
than maybe a decade.

01:37:02.958 --> 01:37:07.666
And I experienced the
rebirth and then the death

01:37:07.666 --> 01:37:08.708
of an industry.

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.500
- You know. we had
this great thing.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.083
and it was kind of like
the party was over.

01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:15.083
You know. it was just
like. it's two AM.

01:37:15.083 --> 01:37:16.916
Everybody's got a headache.

01:37:16.916 --> 01:37:19.750
And we had. what a ride we had.

01:37:22.958 --> 01:37:24.625
But they're closing
up the disco. man.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:30.541
And you go home with a
headache. and that was it.

01:37:33.375 --> 01:37:36.041
[video game music]

01:37:48.708 --> 01:37:50.083
- There was just nothing
like the experience

01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:51.541
of going to an arcade.

01:37:51.541 --> 01:37:55.625
It was like a dark cave
filled with simulators

01:37:55.625 --> 01:37:59.250
that were like portals
to other realities

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.708
Like I could pilot a
starship over here.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.500
or kill drug dealers over here.

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.375
or be a NBA champion.

01:38:04.375 --> 01:38:06.416
You know. any fantasy
that you could have

01:38:06.416 --> 01:38:07.791
you could go and
put in a quarter

01:38:07.791 --> 01:38:09.541
and live out that fantasy.

01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:11.500
- Whenever you think
of arcade style.

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.916
an arcade-style product.
a fast-paced product.

01:38:14.916 --> 01:38:18.291
I think that was birthed by a
lot of what we were producing.

01:38:18.291 --> 01:38:22.541
- You cannot plan that
coalescing of the talent.

Just the way everybody
came together.

01:38:24.791 --> 01:38:28.416
you know. that made all
these games is so ridiculous.

01:38:28.416 --> 01:38:31.208
Nobody planned that.
Nobody wrote on a

01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:32.583
piece of paper. now I
need a Mark Turmell.

01:38:32.583 --> 01:38:34.250
Now I need an Ed Boon type.

01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:36.250
Now I need a Eugene
Jarvis. or whatever.

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:38.125
- Remember who's
creating these games.

01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:43.208
Guy from Michigan. guy from
California. guy from Illinois.

01:38:43.208 --> 01:38:46.000
And as they're. they
went through their life.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.250
playing all these
different things.

01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:50.333

"Wouldn't it be interesting

Then these guys grow up. and
they come knocking on the door.

for a company like Midway

have Pistons score in

01:40:19.125 --> 01:40:22.541
late periods at a higher rate.
than the Bulls

01:40:22.541 --> 01:40:26.375
Because in that era.
it was Pistons Vs Bulls

[Josh Tsui] So you're a
Detroit fan working in Chicago

01:40:29.875 --> 01:40:34.000
- Yeah. I was a Piston
fan living in Chicago

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.625

era unfold night after night

to make the Pistons

01:40:45.041 --> 01:40:48.125
better than the Bulls.
At least in NBA JAM

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:52.166
- I first discovered the game
when I went to church

01:40:52.166 --> 01:40:55.375
and I was going across the
street to get some candy

01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:57.625
and I ran into this brand
new game that showed up

01:40:57.625 --> 01:40:58.625
called Mortal Kombat

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:01.958
Blew my mind. I saw this
one person playing and...

01:41:01.958 --> 01:41:05.041
it was the perfect balance
between gore and competitiveness

01:41:05.041 --> 01:41:09.250
and a chance for a a nerdy
little Asian kid to actually...

01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:12.250
be toe to toe against all
kinds of different people

01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:14.500
I hated going to church. so
every Sunday...

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.041
I would tell my mom I'm going
to church all of a sudden

01:41:17.041 --> 01:41:20.000
When I would go. I would
go across the street

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.041
and play this videogame.
literally for 2 hours straight

01:41:23.041 --> 01:41:24.583
My mom didn't have a clue.
but all of a sudden...

01:41:24.583 --> 01:41:28.208
She didn't know why I
loved church so much

01:41:28.208 --> 01:41:31.958
- It was the mid 90s and I was
approached by a PC programmer

01:41:31.958 --> 01:41:33.708
about doing a
possible skate game

01:41:33.708 --> 01:41:38.333
I went with him to
pitch to publishers

01:41:38.333 --> 01:41:39.791
and we ended up at Midway

01:41:40.208 --> 01:41:45.916
It was probably the most
defeating meeting I ever had

01:41:45.916 --> 01:41:49.333
The whole meeting
felt contentious.

01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:51.625
it was almost like we
were wasting their time

01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:55.291
They said. "Skateboarding
is not even popular

01:41:55.291 --> 01:41:58.458
"why would anyone want to play...

01:41:58.458 --> 01:42:00.250
...a videogame based
on skateboarding?"

01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:02.333
I've been in plenty
of pitch meetings

01:42:02.333 --> 01:42:04.500
I didn't necessarily
expect everyone to

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.875
or there'd be bidding
war for our game

01:42:06.875 --> 01:42:10.583
but at the same time I didn't
expect to be just beat down

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:15.333
I think I needed to go
through that. it me up to

01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:19.708
for what became Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater
