00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:10.971
(lion roaring)

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:20.814
(pleasant orchestral music)

00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:44.980
[Patou] Once upon a time.

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:49.069
back before I knew how to tie
my shoes. the sun came up.

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:55.407
Now. I know an everyday sunrise

00:01:55.408 --> 00:01:59.078
may not seem like such a
big deal to some folks.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.371
But. imagine for a moment.

00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.167
if instead of rising up like this.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.212
one morning where you lived.

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:12.342
she took a look around and
decided to go back to sleep.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.386
It happened once to us.

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.681
Let me tell you all about it.

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:28.065
♫ Cock-a-doo

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.317
♫ Hoo hoo hoo hoo

00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:32.195
♫ Whoa

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:36.449
♫ Ohdeohdelayhee hee

00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:40.285
♫ Cock-a-doo. what a day

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:41.912
♫ The sun is shining brightly

00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:44.123
♫ Cock-a-doo. sunny day

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:46.125
♫ Down here on the farm

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:48.127
♫ Cock-a-doo. stay away

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:50.003
♫ You big ol' wet ol' rain cloud

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:51.338
♫ Or I'll cry out loud

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.801
♫ With this voice of mine

00:02:56.344 --> 00:02:58.720
[Patou] This was our
rooster. Chanticleer.

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.099
And though it was true that
he like to horse around some.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.643
fact was. that boy could sing.

00:03:04.644 --> 00:03:05.477
♫ Sun do shine

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:08.147
♫ Sun do shine. sun do shine. sun do shine

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:10.315
♫ Well. my daddy taught me how to sing.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.776
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:14.194
♫ Sun do shine

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.029
[Patou] We all had our jobs on the farm.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.158
and Chanticleer's was to wake up the sun.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.786
And when he crowed. up she came.

00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:24.496
♫ Let it shine. let it shine

00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:25.581
♫ Let it shine

00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:27.332
[Patou] Hey. look.
here's me tying my shoes.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:29.001
Hi. Patou. what you doin'?

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.004
I'm trying to tie these doggone shoes.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.130
(laughs) Again?

00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:34.006
(chickens clucking)

00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:35.257
Well. hi ladies.

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:37.135
Oh. he's so handsome.

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.095
[Hen In Polka Dots] Sings like a dream.

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.263
He's a dream.

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:43.141
And he's single. too.

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:47.644
[Patou] He maybe wasn't the
smartest bird that ever lived.

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:51.356
but when he crowed. there was
plenty of peace and harmony.

00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:52.399
Hey!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.527
[Patou] Well. plenty of harmony. anyway.

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:57.487
And lots of sunshine.

00:03:57.488 --> 00:03:59.031
♫ Well. my daddy taught me how to sing

00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:01.658
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.329
♫ Sun do shine. you
better shine. better shine

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.165
♫ Well. the sun do shine. you better shine

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:15.380
♫ You better shine

00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:19.510
♫ You better shine. sun. you better shine

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:26.975
♫ Digidigidigidowdow

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:29.187
(laughing)

00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:33.690
[Patou] There was no doubt about it.

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:37.694
Old Chanticleer kept us
animals up and shining.

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:39.238
[All] Good day. Mr. Chanticleer.

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:41.657
[Patou] But all that
was about to change.

00:04:41.658 --> 00:04:45.077
One morning. before
Chanticleer was even awake.

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:46.078
Hey. Chanticleer.

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.996
[Patou] A stranger snuck onto our farm

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.624
to stop Chanticleer from crowing.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.710
Of course. Chanticleer wouldn't
give up without a fight.

00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.420
But what he didn't know

00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.631
was that this stranger had been sent

00:04:57.632 --> 00:04:59.759
by the Grand Duke of Owls.

00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:01.844
Nasty fella.

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.556
(grunting)

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:11.270
The good news here was that
Chanticleer had won the fight.

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:13.438
The bad news was. the Grand Duke's bully

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.277
had done his dirty deed.
for in all the commotion

00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:21.239
Chanticleer had plum forgot to crow.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.077
And the sun was comin' up without him.

00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:28.954
(gasping)

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:32.833
When Chanticleer saw
this. it broke his heart.

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:36.963
He reckoned maybe his crow
never did raise the sun.

00:05:38.214 --> 00:05:41.883
Look. it's comin' up without him.

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:43.260
You're a phony.

00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:45.220
He's a fake!

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.180
Hey. everybody. cock-a-doodle-doo!

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.682
(laughing)

00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:51.435
[Patou] The Grand Duke's
evil plan had worked.

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:55.397
He had turned us against
our very best friend.

00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:58.942
And without a reason to
crow. poor Chanticleer

00:05:58.943 --> 00:06:03.363
left the farm to look
for work in the city.

00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:07.493
Then came the rain. and
our troubles with the Duke.

00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.250
[Edmond] Who's that. Mom?

00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:17.002
That's the Grand Duke.

00:06:17.003 --> 00:06:20.005
He's the one who's
causing all the trouble.

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:21.798
He sent that mean old rooster

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:24.426
to Chanticleer's farm to pick a fight.

00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:25.595
Hm. how come?

00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.931
Because he didn't like
Chanticleer doing all that crowing

00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.600
and bringing up the sun.

00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:32.477
How come?

00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.690
Well. like most owls. he
likes the darkness and the rain.

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:42.694
I'm not afraid of the dark.

00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:44.863
(gasps)

00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:46.865
Oh. it's you.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.241
You scared me!

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:50.202
Dory. we got big problems.

00:06:50.203 --> 00:06:51.495
Have you looked out there?

00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:52.412
If that rain doesn't stop.

00:06:52.413 --> 00:06:53.914
we're all gonna go
floatin' down the river.

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.957
[Patou] This is my
favorite part of the story.

00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.334
His name is Edmond. of course

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:00.087
he didn't look quite like
this when I first met him.

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:03.423
Anyhow. we weren't the only
folks having our troubles.

00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:06.968
Poor Edmond's family was
having their share too.

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:07.928
[Father] The river's widened too fast.

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:09.638
we gotta reinforce the sandbags.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.764
[Mother] Oh. you think that'll work?

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:12.057
[Father] We'll make it work.

00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:12.891
I'll get the boys.

00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:13.725
Me too!

00:07:13.726 --> 00:07:15.936
You stop right there.

00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:18.063
Aw Mom. I'm one of the boys.

00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:19.815
He meant the big boys.

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:21.108
I'm big enough.

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:22.984
Not yet you're not. darling.

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:24.736
[Radio] The U.S. Weather
Bureau is expecting

00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:25.612
yet another--

00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:26.780
(static)

00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:30.075
Downpour in the areas worst
hit by this week's flooding.

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:31.576
[Older Boy] Dad. Mom. come on.

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:33.245
bring the stuff around to the front.

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.371
[Radio] Governor Dale declared

00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:35.914
a state of national emergency--

00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:37.082
Come on. guys. move it.

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:38.792
I need some help. we've
gotta get the animals inside.

00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:40.043
[Patou] So while Scott and Mark

00:07:40.044 --> 00:07:42.629
got to help protect the
house against the flood.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.297
poor Edmond was left behind where

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:47.134
he'd be safe and out of trouble.

00:07:47.135 --> 00:07:49.386
It's my house too. I wanna help.

00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:52.431
Well then. pray for the rain
to stop. and that'll help.

00:07:52.432 --> 00:07:53.473
[Father] Dory. I can't
find the flashlight!

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:54.724
Coming!

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:56.268
Now you stay here where
it's safe. pumpkin.

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:58.270
I'm gonna help your father
and I'll be right back.

00:07:58.271 --> 00:07:59.104
[Older Boy] Come on. dad.

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.313
[Father] Great. let's go!

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.189
Hey Dad. they said on the radio

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.732
the National Guard might come.

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:04.444
I am too a big boy.

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:15.787
"And without a reason to crow.
Chanticleer left the farm.

00:08:15.788 --> 00:08:17.498
"Then came the rain."

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:21.711
(thunder)

00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:27.800
Mom. here!

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:34.222
How is she. Frank?

00:08:34.223 --> 00:08:38.018
Just start the truck. she'll be okay.

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:38.811
Hey. hey!

00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:41.646
I know what we need here.

00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:43.690
We need Chanticleer.

00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:46.193
(thunder)

00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:48.778
(water rushing)

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:49.779
(gasps)

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.614
Mom!

00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:52.992
Boys. the levee's breaking!

00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:55.828
Chanticleer!

00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:58.498
Chanticleer!

00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:01.458
(explosion)

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:04.544
[Patou] Edmond had the right
idea to call for Chanticleer.

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:08.549
but he never coulda guessed
who was gonna answer.

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:21.771
(heavy footsteps)

00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:25.941
Chanticleer?

00:09:25.942 --> 00:09:28.152
No. it's not Chanticleer.

00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:31.905
Who...

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:33.365
Who are you?

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:37.495
You put your finger in
the Duke's face. remember?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.707
These are expensive. brat!

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:47.171
But that is not why the
Duke is going to eat you.

00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:49.965
Eat me?

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:53.009
Oh dear. now I've gone
and spoiled the surprise.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.804
Oh. always doing that.

00:09:56.472 --> 00:09:59.849
But you see. we creatures of the night

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.563
have worked very hard
to make absolutely sure

00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:07.900
that that bird does not return.

00:10:09.569 --> 00:10:13.698
You. you. with no regard
for the feelings of others.

00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:18.744
had the nerve to call
him back here by name!

00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:24.750
And besides. I positively
loathe rock and roll.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:30.338
(laughing maniacally)

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:31.631
You're not gonna eat me!

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:34.426
[Patou] And that's when
the Duke hit the ceiling.

00:10:34.427 --> 00:10:37.637
If Edmond wanted to bring
Chanticleer back to raise the sun.

00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:41.224
the Duke was gonna have
somethin' to say about it.

00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:43.686
Kittens are more digestible.

00:10:45.104 --> 00:10:46.479
[Patou] Young Edmond was about to have

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.443
the most amazing adventure
he'd ever dreamed of.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.988
(yowling)

00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:57.575
(evil laughter)

00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:14.675
Mom. Dad. wake me up!

00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:17.719
[Patou] This is where I come in.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.553
(chomp)

00:11:18.554 --> 00:11:20.681
(yelling)

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:25.018
You'll pay for this. Patou!

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.436
This does not concern you.

00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:28.104
It does if it's about Chant--

00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:31.150
The light. the owls hate the light!

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.489
(+screams)

00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:39.742
Whew.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:41.952
Hey. hey boy.

00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:44.955
We were this close.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:50.001
Oh. that flashlight biz was
quick thinking on your part.

00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:51.628
What's your name. little fella?

00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:53.213
Edmond.

00:11:53.214 --> 00:11:54.130
Is he gone?

00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:55.632
Yeah. he's gone. but he'll be back

00:11:55.633 --> 00:11:57.842
and he won't be alone. the coward.

00:11:57.843 --> 00:12:01.596
I woulda whopped him if
I'da had my shoes tied.

00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:03.598
But you know something. tying shoes

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:05.934
is harder than dry dog food.

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:07.936
Whatcha wearing shoes for?

00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:09.187
Bunions.

00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:13.317
I got a load of bunions.
and them shoes help my feet.

00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:17.070
Here. let me show you how to tie 'em.

00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:18.071
(gasps)

00:12:18.072 --> 00:12:19.949
Jeepers. I'm all furry!

00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:22.283
Well. kittens are furry.

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:25.203
But. but. I'm a little boy.

00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:26.621
(yowling scream)

00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:27.747
(gulp)

00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:29.625
Did that come outta me?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.212
I'm. I'm a cat. he turned me into a cat!

00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:36.089
Help me. do something!

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.591
I can't be a cat. I'm a boy!

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:39.926
Patou. what'll I do?

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:42.762
Alright. steady boy. keep your pants on.

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:44.724
(gasps)

00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:55.900
Yuck!

00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.903
What am I doing. I'm licking myself.

00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:01.948
(sniffing)

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:02.824
[Peepers] Patou!

00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:03.951
I'm in here.

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:10.457
By my calculations. this
can't possibly be the city.

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:12.752
Let's see. 367 southeast...

00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:16.881
Or is it 676?

00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:20.300
(gasps)

00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:21.926
(laughing)

00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:25.054
It's okay Peepers. it's Edmond.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.431
He's a nice kitty.

00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:27.640
I'm a boy!

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:29.267
And I almost ate a mouse.

00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:30.685
I must be crazy.

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:33.688
You bet your sweet whiskers.

00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:34.482
Wow.

00:13:36.275 --> 00:13:37.358
Ain't no city around here.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:38.486
Oh. sadness.

00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:43.156
Hey. aren't you gonna tie my shoes?

00:13:43.157 --> 00:13:45.950
I can't. I can't help anybody.

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.161
I'm too little.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.331
I'm a scrawny furball runt.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:55.001
Mom and Dad won't even recognize me!

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.212
Mom. Dad. help!

00:13:57.922 --> 00:14:00.049
(thunder)

00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:05.512
Oh. Chanticleer.

00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:06.346
What?

00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:08.348
If he doesn't come back and crow soon.

00:14:08.349 --> 00:14:12.143
it won't shine again and the
rain will keep coming down

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:13.937
and the water will get higher and higher

00:14:13.938 --> 00:14:15.772
'til. 'til...

00:14:15.773 --> 00:14:16.816
We all drown.

00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:21.611
Wowie wow wow wow wow!

00:14:21.612 --> 00:14:23.154
Are we close. are we near the city?

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:24.906
Us magpies are just made for the city.

00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:25.990
Come on already. hurry up. Peepers!

00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.284
We are not looking for the city.

00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:30.453
We are looking for Chanticleer.

00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:32.455
Well he's in the city. isn't he?

00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:33.790
Then he is in the city.

00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:35.375
Girls. they think they know everything.

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:37.544
Why don't you run home. be
a mousewife. make cheese.

00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:40.338
Snipes. you think you're so superior.

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:41.172
"Thuperior."

00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:42.006
Nice lisp.

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.968
My lisp isolates and elevates me.

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:47.095
and makes me a rare specimen.

00:14:47.096 --> 00:14:48.471
Ah. this is flippin' garbage!

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:50.348
(arguing)

00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:51.850
Pipe down. you two.

00:14:51.851 --> 00:14:53.309
The story's true!

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.854
You all laughed at him and he went away.

00:14:55.855 --> 00:14:57.146
You're right. son.

00:14:57.147 --> 00:15:00.984
We done wrong. and that's why
we're searchin' for the city.

00:15:00.985 --> 00:15:03.611
We gotta find Chanti and apologize.

00:15:03.612 --> 00:15:05.071
Then he'll forgive us...

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:05.864
Come home...

00:15:05.865 --> 00:15:07.448
[Chicks] And raise the sun!

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.701
Well. I know where the city is.

00:15:09.702 --> 00:15:11.786
I've been there lots of times as a boy.

00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:12.620
A boy?

00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:15.707
Before that big owl
turned me into a cat!

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:16.541
Owl?

00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:17.876
(snorts) Owl?

00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:21.170
Edmond. would you take us to the city?

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:21.964
I can't.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.300
Look at me. I'm a cat.

00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:27.010
No. a little kitty.

00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:28.137
What can I do?

00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:33.391
I can do lots of things. and
I'm a lot smaller than you.

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:37.270
And furthermore. I could
forgive you for being a cat

00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:39.731
if you would take us to the city.

00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:41.149
Of course. if you're a fraidy-cat...

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.692
I'm not afraid!

00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:44.694
Or like. a scaredy-cat...

00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.571
- Me. scared?
- Hey. guys...

00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:48.323
Lay off the boy.

00:15:48.324 --> 00:15:49.449
Hey. hey guys...

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.408
Okay. okay!

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:52.327
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:15:52.328 --> 00:15:55.914
I'll take you to the city
and find Chanticleer.

00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:57.832
(animals laughing)

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:02.629
And bring him home. and save
Dad and Mom and the farm.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.965
Alright. hope you can swim. guys.

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.343
[Edmond] Oh no!

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:12.472
(coughing)

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:14.724
We don't have to swim.

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:16.060
we'll go by boat.

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:19.979
Oh. this is serious.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.442
Peepers. you'll need
this if those owls return.

00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:25.652
Here!

00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:26.819
Owls?

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.947
I'm sticking with you.

00:16:28.948 --> 00:16:30.573
Well fellas. this is it.

00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:31.616
(gulps)

00:16:31.617 --> 00:16:32.867
[Snipes] The city!

00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:34.577
The lights. the chicks. the food.

00:16:34.578 --> 00:16:37.122
Bye. good luck with the owls!

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:40.583
Owls?

00:16:40.584 --> 00:16:42.795
(whimpers)

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.797
(thunder)

00:16:45.798 --> 00:16:47.632
[Patou] Yep. owls.

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:52.345
While Edmond set our course
for the city in the USS Toybox.

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:55.223
the Duke and his owls
were back in their lair

00:16:55.224 --> 00:16:57.976
stirrin' up some powerful nasty weather.

00:16:57.977 --> 00:17:00.771
(low organ music)

00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:13.658
So he turns on the Duke. and with what

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:16.577
do you suppose he turns on the Duke?

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:17.870
[All] What. Master?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.414
A flashlight!

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:20.748
♫ What a horrible thing to do

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.375
♫ ♫ What a horrible thing to do

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.627
♫ Thing to doooo

00:17:24.628 --> 00:17:27.130
But then. when my back is turned.

00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:29.298
what four-legged flea-bitten louse

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.633
comes sneaking through the window

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.177
and has the nerve to bite me on the leg?

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:35.638
♫ Who. who. who. who. who?

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:36.931
- Who?
- Patou.

00:17:36.932 --> 00:17:37.765
(gasps)

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:38.599
Yes!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.769
♫ Patou. Patou

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.896
Destroy the farm.
destroy the cat. the dog.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.273
or do you want the chicken back?

00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:46.315
♫ No. we hate the sun

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:49.193
♫ The answer's noooo

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:52.613
It'll make my leg feel so much better

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.908
if that rooster never crows!

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:01.080

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.498
♫ We hate the sun

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:03.374
♫ That much we know

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.459
Rain!

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.836
♫ We hate the rooster.
we'll never let it crow

00:18:06.837 --> 00:18:07.670
Never let him crow!

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.047
♫ We hate the sun

♫ We hate the rooster.
we'll never let it crow.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.891
♫ Never let it crow

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.937
Never let it crow.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.942
Aaahhh!

00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:36.407
Uncle Dukey. Uncle Dukey.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.785
(yells)

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.453
I wish you wouldn't do that.

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:43.916
Hunch. I told you never to call me that.

00:18:45.084 --> 00:18:46.209
Yes. sir.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.169
No sir. sir.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.629
But guess what I just saw.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.173
Patou the dog floating in
a toybox down the river.

00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:53.925
and he has this cute little
white kitty with him--

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.886
(yells)

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.015
Hunch. my little pygmy nephew.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.395
Come to your uncle.

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:08.815
(jumbled organ notes)

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:09.608
Ah!

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.320
[Patou] Meanwhile. bound for the city.

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:17.949
Edmond steered us through the
perils of the flooded river.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.826
[Peepers] Starboard ho!

00:19:19.827 --> 00:19:20.785
[Snipes] Starboard who?

00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:21.786
Left or right?

00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:23.704
[Edmond] Uh-oh.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:27.750
Giant tree. a hundred feet and closing!

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.377
Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:31.754
We need wind power!

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:32.672
40 feet!

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:35.216
Well guys. I-I think
I'm slowing you down.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:36.759
Yeah. I'll see you later. guys.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.302
30 feet!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:39.137
Ahh!

00:19:39.138 --> 00:19:41.682
Come on. Patou. pull on this.

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.521
It worked!
- Turn now!

00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:51.275
(screaming)

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.861
This is the right way. guys!

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:58.991
(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:04.370
Okay guys. you heard the Duke.

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:07.666
Total and complete. oh-ho. annihilation.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:10.627
Bombs away!

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:12.880
Aah!

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.132
Hey!

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:18.177
Bombs away. bombs away!

00:20:19.595 --> 00:20:22.180
Edmond. grab ahold!

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:23.639
Ooh ho ho. gotcha--

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.433
Oow!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.643
Get my camera!

00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:28.394
Huh?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.354
What does he want with a camera?

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.565
Get that camera.

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:33.858
Ooh. I gotcha. kitty.

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:34.985
Put me down!

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.695
(growling)

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.280
Say cheese!

00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:40.406
Oooh!

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.450
Ha ha. we got 'em.

00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:43.327
Uh-oh...

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.457
- Oh no!
- Get the lid.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.463
Ahah. adequate pipe.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.762
L-Let me outta here.

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:05.264
I can't breathe!

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.098
Help. I need air.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:06.933
What's wrong with him?

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:08.392
He's claustrophobic.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:12.522
Teeny-weeny tight spaces
make him very. very nervous.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.067
Uh-oh.

00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:16.860
Uh-oh!

00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:20.489
Get him away from the lid.

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:26.870
Help. we're trapped.
we're trapped like rats.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:29.622
We're trapped. we're
trapped. we're trapped.

00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:30.456
Trapped like rats...

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:31.958
Come back here. you crazy bird.

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:36.128
Now settle down. you're rockin' the boat.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.839
I can't breathe...

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:42.844
Don't make me lose my temper. Snipes.

00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:47.432
I need air. I don't wanna swim.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:49.518
Mommy. we're trapped Mommy!

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.396
Settle down.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:54.815
- Patou!
- Oh. no.

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:05.367
Aah!

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:17.004
(coughing)

00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:19.923
That was close.

00:22:22.968 --> 00:22:24.051
Mercy.

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:24.845
Oh no!

00:22:27.973 --> 00:22:30.099
[Peepers] Abandon ship. abandon ship!

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.394
(screaming)

00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:39.401
(coughing and spluttering)

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:43.070
What's that smell?

00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:43.904
Garbage.

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:44.989
Ah. this is pathetic.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.198
I risk my life and what do I get?

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:47.033
Garbage!

00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:48.326
Why. I've never been so--

00:22:48.327 --> 00:22:49.119
Wow!

00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:54.124
The city!

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.001
Wow!

00:22:59.463 --> 00:23:01.089
It's so beautiful.

00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:07.219
Now. all we got to
do is find Chanticleer

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.350
and that's gonna be like hunting
for a needle in a haystack.

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.658
(yawning)

00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:37.333
(clattering)

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:38.126
Ow!

00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:41.587
Uncle Dukey. Uncle Dukey!

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:42.381
I got 'em.

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:48.386
If I killed my nephew. would
that be murder or charity?

00:23:48.387 --> 00:23:50.179
I got 'em. I really got 'em!

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.680
No more kitty. sir.

00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:53.808
Mission. oohoh. accomplished.

00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:54.642
And the dog?

00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:56.520
Gone. wiped out. sir.

00:23:57.396 --> 00:24:01.482
Total and complete. ohoh. annihilation.

00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:02.651
Annihilation.

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.071
How did you do it?

00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:08.406
Adequately.

00:24:08.407 --> 00:24:09.240
Ahe--

00:24:09.241 --> 00:24:10.783
Wait. what's that supposed to mean?

00:24:10.784 --> 00:24:14.370
Well. Uncle. we sucked
them into an adequate pipe.

00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:15.371
A what?

00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:16.622
That's what it said.

00:24:16.623 --> 00:24:18.583
"Danger. adequate pipe."

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:21.169
Oh. dear.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.006
Come to Uncle.

00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:27.842
Aaah.

00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:29.385
You imbecile!

00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:33.515
That's not an adequate
pipe. it's an aqueduct pipe!

00:24:35.434 --> 00:24:37.309
It leads straight into the city!

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.477
(gulps)

00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:41.940
The Duke gives you one last chance. Hunch.

00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:44.317
Them or you.

00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:49.196
Get to the city!

00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:50.197
Oh. not the city. sir.

00:24:50.198 --> 00:24:51.031
Oh no.

00:24:51.032 --> 00:24:52.741
It's too bright. I'll go blind.

00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:54.536
Oh. say it isn't so.

00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:18.601
Chamer. Chanta. Chantilly. Chantz.

00:25:18.602 --> 00:25:19.978
He's not in here.

00:25:23.857 --> 00:25:24.649
Let's go.

00:25:29.988 --> 00:25:31.489
[Patou] You ever get
that feeling when you're

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.034
;lookin' for something that
it's right under your sniffer?

00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:38.329
I know it seems crazy.
but it was almost like

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.458
we could hear his voice calling to us.

00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:45.044
You know. like he was just waiting

00:25:45.045 --> 00:25:47.755
for us to come and ask him back.

00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:52.176
But we looked everywhere.
and we talked with everyone.

00:25:52.177 --> 00:25:55.805
but nobody had heard
of Chanticleer. nobody.

00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:02.520
Funny thing was. he was right
under our nose the whole time.

00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:05.398
Or should I say. we were under his.

00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:16.992
No. Patou. that's not how it goes.

00:26:16.993 --> 00:26:20.455
For the hundredth time. it's over. around.

00:26:22.874 --> 00:26:27.003
under and through. that's
how Patou ties his shoe.

00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:29.589
Now you say it.

00:26:30.757 --> 00:26:32.884
(humming)

00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:40.141
Ooh. there you are!

00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:44.228
Pilot to bombardier. enemy target below!

00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:46.689
I'm going in for a closer look. cover me!

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.734
(makes vroom noises)

00:26:51.695 --> 00:26:52.528
(gasps)

00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:53.822
What was that?

00:26:58.451 --> 00:27:00.579
(giggles)

00:27:01.496 --> 00:27:03.540
Complete attrocitation.

00:27:07.377 --> 00:27:10.170
Alright you guys. we've
left it long enough.

00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:12.756
They're counting on us back at the farm.

00:27:12.757 --> 00:27:14.091
Well. if you ask me--

00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:15.509
We didn't.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.553
Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

00:27:17.554 --> 00:27:18.387
What?

00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:19.763
It's him!

00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:20.598
[Snipes] Who?

00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:22.433
[Peepers] No wonder
we couldn't find him.

00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:24.310
he's changed his name.

00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:26.395
[Patou] Chanticleer is the King?

00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:27.354
[Edmond] The King?

00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:29.898
[Patou] Ooh. your Highness.

00:27:33.653 --> 00:27:35.738
[Patou] Old Chanticleer
may have stopped crowin'

00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:38.532
but he hadn't stopped
using that voice of his.

00:27:38.533 --> 00:27:40.868
♫ Let me be your rooster

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:42.703

[Patou] But not
everybody liked the King.

00:28:26.998 --> 00:28:28.832
Goldie here was jealous of him.

00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:31.418
Less my manager's fee of 60%.

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:35.255
Look. Pinky. I just have to know when.

00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:39.134
Oooh. Goldie. will you not
bother me with this right now?

00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:41.261
You've gotta go on in two minutes.

00:28:41.262 --> 00:28:44.057
But I'm too good for the chorus.

00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:47.935
What's he got that I ain't got?

00:28:47.936 --> 00:28:49.061
A voice.

[Patou] Fortunately
for us. Goldie was a lot

00:28:57.237 --> 00:29:00.906
smarter than she sounded.
and a lot nicer too.

00:29:00.907 --> 00:29:03.200

Lookie. Goldie. when I
found him. he was a nobody.

00:29:11.418 --> 00:29:14.044
Nobody wanted him. nobody cared about him.

00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:16.463
but I picked him up out of the gutter

00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:18.465
and now look at him.

Everybody starts in the chorus. Goldie.

00:29:24.848 --> 00:29:28.351
Of course. you could
give up show business.

00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:30.477

00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:44.283
[Edmond] Now that we found him.

00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:47.703
[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen.

00:29:47.704 --> 00:29:50.622
the King is leaving the building.

00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:51.416
Ow!

00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:53.917
Out of the way!

00:29:53.918 --> 00:29:56.170
Move it. move it. move it!

00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:57.796

Get away from the star!

00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:13.979
[Patou] Chanticleer was a star alright.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.856
but it's hard to be happy without friends

00:30:15.857 --> 00:30:18.150
even if you are famous.

00:30:18.151 --> 00:30:20.944
I reckon he'd be awfully glad to see us.

00:30:20.945 --> 00:30:24.741

Your chicken thinks they
don't want him on the farm.

That's good.

Chanticleer. Chanticleer!

00:40:30.054 --> 00:40:33.181
Oh Goldie. when I left the farm.

00:40:33.182 --> 00:40:35.517
I had such a big hole in my heart.

00:40:35.518 --> 00:40:38.019
You coulda put a John Deere
tractor through there.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.146
Oh. you poor thing.

00:40:40.147 --> 00:40:41.856
My heart is so full I could.

00:40:41.857 --> 00:40:44.859
I could just explode like a bloated lamb.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.905
Oh King. you say the nicest things.

00:40:49.115 --> 00:40:50.865

I'm Sorry. Little Buddy.
but We're just no match

00:41:05.423 --> 00:41:07.549
for that painted feather duster.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.675
Oh yeah?

00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:10.802
Uh. hey. where you goin'?

00:41:10.803 --> 00:41:13.972
Well if I can't talk
to him. I'll talk to her.

00:41:13.973 --> 00:41:17.600
♫ As I kiss and coo

00:41:17.601 --> 00:41:21.397

Sun don't shine for farmers!

"Goldie Pheasant to co-star
in King's new picture."

00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:00.143
You know. I think I'm too
little to get over those gates.

00:42:00.144 --> 00:42:01.437
Well. I'm not.

00:42:03.898 --> 00:42:07.859
[Patou] Hey. I think that's
her trailer over there.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.945
(humming)

00:42:17.828 --> 00:42:18.995
(clears throat)

00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:19.829
Excuse me. ma'am?

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.080
(gasps)

00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:22.541
Oh. who are you?

00:42:24.001 --> 00:42:25.960
Ma'am. I. I--

00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:26.794

There. now what are you
doing in my dressing room?

00:42:40.142 --> 00:42:42.685
Please ma'am. you're the
only one who can help us.

00:42:42.686 --> 00:42:44.687
We have to talk to Chanticleer.

00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:45.980
I mean. the King.

00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:47.357
There's a terrible flood. and

00:42:47.358 --> 00:42:48.858
if he doesn't come home and crow...

00:42:48.859 --> 00:42:51.528
Wait a minute. wait a minute!

00:42:51.529 --> 00:42:55.782
You're the bad little
kitty Pinky told me about.

00:42:55.783 --> 00:42:56.741
Bad. me?

00:42:56.742 --> 00:42:57.701
I'm not bad.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.747
You go away or I'll scream!

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040
(screams)

00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:06.669
Please. if you'd just listen--

00:43:08.087 --> 00:43:10.381
(screaming)

00:43:16.512 --> 00:43:17.762
What happened?

00:43:17.763 --> 00:43:19.514
Ah. she's a woman.

00:43:19.515 --> 00:43:20.307
W-what?

00:43:23.352 --> 00:43:26.354
That's the last straw. I've had it!

00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:28.398
I wasn't talking to you--

00:43:28.399 --> 00:43:30.024
Aah!

00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:33.111
(Pinky laughing)

00:43:33.112 --> 00:43:34.737
Well. well. well.

00:43:34.738 --> 00:43:38.117
The dog. the cat. the bird and the mouse.

00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:41.327
We meet at last. eh?

00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:42.662
(laughing)

00:43:42.663 --> 00:43:43.622
Let us go!

00:43:44.957 --> 00:43:47.750
Max. take 'em to my
trailer. lock 'em up.

00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:51.630
Make sure the King doesn't
get a whiff of this.

00:43:52.798 --> 00:43:54.925
Oh no. what have I done?

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.220
(laughing)

00:44:01.932 --> 00:44:04.643
No dogs. cats. boids or meeses.

00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:06.353
Ahah!

00:44:08.897 --> 00:44:11.649
[Patou] Now I gotta admit.
as bad guys go. the Duke's

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:15.779
nephew Hunch was more a
hoot than he was horrible.

00:44:18.282 --> 00:44:20.450
(gurgling) Oh. boy.

00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:22.285
[Patou] But still. he was a nuisance

00:44:22.286 --> 00:44:24.203
and as we were tied up at the moment.

00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:27.249
we weren't all that happy to see him.

00:44:28.417 --> 00:44:29.209
Ahah!

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.178
♫ I will always think of you

00:44:40.179 --> 00:44:43.765
♫ Ma. I miss your apple pie

♫ But most of all Ma. I miss you

00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:56.278
Look at that. ooh. anticipation!

00:44:57.863 --> 00:44:58.656
Ow!

00:45:03.494 --> 00:45:04.286
Ah. oh!

00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:14.463

[Pinky] Cut. cut. cut!

Murray. what's with the snow here?

00:45:31.313 --> 00:45:32.689
Take five. everybody.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.983
And Miss Pheasant. how 'bout a smile. hmm?

00:45:35.984 --> 00:45:37.985
Oh. it's supposed to be
summer. for cryin' out loud!

00:45:37.986 --> 00:45:39.696
King. may I talk to you?

00:45:39.697 --> 00:45:42.115
Ah honey. don't pay no mind.

00:45:42.116 --> 00:45:43.533
You're gonna do just fine.

00:45:43.534 --> 00:45:44.367
Yeah. but--

00:45:44.368 --> 00:45:45.910
Now. now. no buts about it. honey.

00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:48.706
King. I've done something awful.

00:45:49.832 --> 00:45:51.375
What is it. baby?

00:45:53.419 --> 00:45:55.295
Patou. Snipes. Peepers.

00:45:56.547 --> 00:45:57.839
Goldie. where'd you get this?

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.758
From you. that night we first met.

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:02.552
They were here?

00:46:02.553 --> 00:46:04.263
They're still here.

00:46:07.224 --> 00:46:09.268
Why didn't you tell me?

00:46:10.728 --> 00:46:12.687
'Cause she wasn't supposed to!

00:46:12.688 --> 00:46:14.397
(gasps)

00:46:14.398 --> 00:46:16.942
Goldie. I'm disappointed in ya.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:22.321
I said to entertain
him. not to educate him.

00:46:22.322 --> 00:46:24.073
Entertain me?

00:46:24.074 --> 00:46:25.241
What's this all about?

00:46:25.242 --> 00:46:27.660
Calm down. kid. your
friends are just fine.

00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:28.786
No they're not. King.

00:46:28.787 --> 00:46:30.621
He's got them tied up in his--

00:46:30.622 --> 00:46:31.914
Shut up!

00:46:31.915 --> 00:46:32.708

00:46:36.754 --> 00:46:38.337
Where are they?

00:46:38.338 --> 00:46:40.381
What have you done with 'em?

00:46:40.382 --> 00:46:43.092
Don't hurt him boys.
he's got a movie to make.

00:46:43.093 --> 00:46:44.635
I ain't making nothin' with you.

00:46:44.636 --> 00:46:48.681
Oh but King. I got a lotta
money tied up in this picture.

00:46:48.682 --> 00:46:50.683
I don't wanna lose my money.

00:46:50.684 --> 00:46:53.060
and you don't wanna lose your friends.

00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:54.103
That's blackmail!

Hey. shut up.

King. I'm sorry.

00:47:44.947 --> 00:47:46.280
Don't talk to me. I'm thinkin'.

00:47:46.281 --> 00:47:47.657
Roll sound.

00:47:47.658 --> 00:47:49.158
Speed.

00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:49.992
Where are they?

00:47:49.993 --> 00:47:52.078
They're in Pinky's trailer outside.

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:52.871
Mark it.

00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:55.289

Hang on. honey.

00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:05.676
(engine revving)

00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:09.930
That's not in the script.

00:48:11.181 --> 00:48:13.349
Stop those birds!

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.476
Get them back!

00:48:16.937 --> 00:48:18.522
Look. there it is!

Oh no. no. I've killed him.

00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:46.090
Chanticleer!

00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:47.134
Hi. fellas.

Hey fellas. I'm sorry about this.

00:48:53.557 --> 00:48:55.766
Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.273
Oh no!

00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:05.276
Let's get him out of here.

00:49:05.277 --> 00:49:06.403
Who's there?

00:49:22.628 --> 00:49:24.838
Oh no. not Pinky's Caddy.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.594
Can you drive a car?

00:49:31.595 --> 00:49:32.720
Piece of cake.

00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:34.472
Edmond. you steer.

00:49:34.473 --> 00:49:35.306
Steer?

00:49:35.307 --> 00:49:37.350
I can't. I've never driven a car.

00:49:37.351 --> 00:49:38.517
Edmond. do it.

00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:39.352
We'll crash.

00:49:39.353 --> 00:49:41.730
Don't be such a fraidy-cat!

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.692
Hey!

00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:55.494
Whoa!

00:50:12.135 --> 00:50:14.220
Edmond. open your eyes!

00:50:14.221 --> 00:50:15.347
Uh-oh. look!

00:50:18.225 --> 00:50:19.642
Abomination!

00:50:19.643 --> 00:50:20.435
Oww!

00:50:22.187 --> 00:50:24.814
Come on. Edmond. we
gotta lose that trailer.

00:50:24.815 --> 00:50:25.648
How?

00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:27.692
Edmond. cats are climbers.

00:50:27.693 --> 00:50:28.943
I'm a boy!

00:50:28.944 --> 00:50:29.986
Just climb down there--

00:50:29.987 --> 00:50:31.570
What? I can't.

00:50:31.571 --> 00:50:33.030
Don't be such a sissy!

00:50:33.031 --> 00:50:33.864
I'll fall!

00:50:33.865 --> 00:50:35.741
You're a cat. you won't fall!

00:50:35.742 --> 00:50:36.575
I will!

00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:38.202
Oh. I'll do it myself.

00:50:38.203 --> 00:50:40.330
You're such a scaredy-cat.

00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:51.258

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.652
Peepers!

00:51:13.405 --> 00:51:15.406
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

00:51:15.407 --> 00:51:16.449
Fraidy-cat...

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:17.700
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:51:17.701 --> 00:51:20.746

00:51:44.186 --> 00:51:45.561

00:51:45.562 --> 00:51:48.189
Oh sure. they wanna play chicken. eh?

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.774
Don't worry. boss. I ain't turnin'.

00:51:49.775 --> 00:51:51.610
Idiot. that's my car!

00:51:55.197 --> 00:51:55.989
Whoa!

00:51:57.449 --> 00:51:59.076
Snipes. the brake!

00:52:04.247 --> 00:52:06.499
I think she landed up here.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.292
Peepers!

00:52:08.919 --> 00:52:11.129
Come on. we gotta find her!

00:52:17.719 --> 00:52:19.303
Ooh. my baby!

00:52:19.304 --> 00:52:20.764
My beautiful baby.

00:52:21.807 --> 00:52:23.349
What are you lookin' at?

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.600
Get up there!

00:52:24.601 --> 00:52:25.352
Peepers!

00:52:29.106 --> 00:52:30.649
Oh King. wake up.

00:52:31.525 --> 00:52:32.567
Oh. my shoes!

00:52:35.362 --> 00:52:38.197
(grunting)

00:52:38.198 --> 00:52:38.990
Bozo!

00:52:40.158 --> 00:52:41.450
Snipes!

00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:43.994
We're trapped. we're
trapped. we're trapped.

00:52:43.995 --> 00:52:45.913
Don't look down!

00:52:45.914 --> 00:52:48.625
(metal creaking)

00:52:51.086 --> 00:52:53.796
This is it. fellas. we're goin' down.

00:52:53.797 --> 00:52:55.632
Snipes. do something!

00:53:01.388 --> 00:53:02.597
Don't let go!

00:53:03.557 --> 00:53:05.851
(screaming)

00:53:11.565 --> 00:53:12.858
What a catch!

00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:15.818
Bring 'em in. Murray.

00:53:15.819 --> 00:53:16.611
Murray?

00:53:17.863 --> 00:53:19.071
Murray. who's Murray?

00:53:19.072 --> 00:53:19.905
Peepers!

00:53:19.906 --> 00:53:20.739
Edmond!

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.701
Let's have some help up
here. this is the Quirky X62

00:53:23.702 --> 00:53:26.079
and these things are craaazy!

00:53:27.747 --> 00:53:30.792
The King. he's gone and I'm ruined!

00:53:39.718 --> 00:53:41.260
Oh no no no!

00:53:41.261 --> 00:53:42.888
Oh. yes. yes. yes.

00:53:44.848 --> 00:53:48.767
Gentlemen. go down and
invite our friends to dinner.

00:53:48.768 --> 00:53:50.061
Hoo. hoo. hoo!

00:53:51.104 --> 00:53:53.522
♫ We are the creatures of the night

00:53:53.523 --> 00:53:55.691
♫ And we invite you all for dinner

00:53:55.692 --> 00:53:57.902
♫ There's plenty of food to go around

00:53:57.903 --> 00:54:00.738
♫ When the food is you

00:54:00.739 --> 00:54:01.614
Who. me?

00:54:01.615 --> 00:54:02.615
♫ Yes. you

00:54:02.616 --> 00:54:05.034
♫ We thought a picnic would be nice

00:54:05.035 --> 00:54:07.703
♫ And we're so pleased
that you could join us

00:54:07.704 --> 00:54:09.788
♫ We're glad you're home. trick or treat

00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:10.998
♫ Fa la la la la la

00:54:10.999 --> 00:54:12.041
♫ How sweet

00:54:12.042 --> 00:54:15.127
♫ Now's the time. say your prayers

00:54:15.128 --> 00:54:15.961
♫ Time's up

00:54:15.962 --> 00:54:17.755
♫ Fa la la la la la. how sweet

00:54:17.756 --> 00:54:21.008
♫ Fa la la la la. let's eat

00:54:21.009 --> 00:54:22.969
Please. pass the pork.

00:54:29.517 --> 00:54:30.559
(laughing)

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.229
Excellent. gentlemen. excellent.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.523
(screaming)

00:54:36.483 --> 00:54:39.235
Alright you owls. this is Edmond.

00:54:39.236 --> 00:54:42.947
It's over for you. we've got Chanticleer!

00:54:42.948 --> 00:54:45.158
(cheering)

00:54:48.411 --> 00:54:49.703
Where's my mom and dad?

00:54:49.704 --> 00:54:51.163
I can't see them.

00:54:51.164 --> 00:54:53.457
Don't worry. we'll find them.

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:56.418
(rotors whirring)

00:54:56.419 --> 00:54:58.546
(screams)

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:02.883
Ooh...

00:55:02.884 --> 00:55:03.717
How is he. Goldie?

00:55:03.718 --> 00:55:05.511
(groaning)

00:55:05.512 --> 00:55:07.471
I think he's waking up.

00:55:07.472 --> 00:55:10.266
Good. let's go in for a landing.

00:55:10.267 --> 00:55:11.059
Hold on!

00:55:13.228 --> 00:55:15.021
Ta-da. annihilation!

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.983
Oh!

00:55:21.194 --> 00:55:22.486
(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

00:55:22.487 --> 00:55:23.238
Aah!

00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:33.539
[Peepers] She's going down!

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.750
Abandon ship. abandon ship!

00:55:40.088 --> 00:55:42.299
(laughing)

00:56:01.443 --> 00:56:02.401
Is it time for the show?

00:56:02.402 --> 00:56:03.861
King. you're heavy.

00:56:03.862 --> 00:56:07.240
Show me that stage. and gimme that mic.

00:56:08.825 --> 00:56:10.201
Oooh. where am I?

00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:13.454
Chanti. you're home.

00:56:13.455 --> 00:56:14.247
Huh?

00:56:17.959 --> 00:56:22.088
Ooh. I feel like I've been
hit by a 800-pound mule.

00:56:23.298 --> 00:56:24.131
What's happening?

00:56:24.132 --> 00:56:25.090
There's no time to explain.

00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:27.509
Chanticleer. you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.762
The owls could be here any second.

00:56:29.763 --> 00:56:30.846
Who are you?

00:56:30.847 --> 00:56:32.806
He's a friend. now please. crow!

00:56:32.807 --> 00:56:36.310
Oh. I can't. I don't know if I ever did.

00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:37.519
Of course you did!

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.229
Chanti. we were wrong.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.898
It's your job to bring up the sun.

00:56:40.899 --> 00:56:43.192
It hasn't shined since you left.

00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:44.902
Ah. but look.

00:56:44.903 --> 00:56:46.570
(wheezing)

00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:47.696
Cock-a-doo...

00:56:47.697 --> 00:56:48.490
Doo...

00:56:50.158 --> 00:56:51.450
Uh-oh.

00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:53.869
Aw. guys. it's no use.

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:55.913
All I do now is sing the blues.

00:56:55.914 --> 00:56:57.373
Hmph. "the King."

00:56:57.374 --> 00:57:01.169
We don't want the King.
we want Chanticleer!

00:57:03.338 --> 00:57:04.755
(gasping)

00:57:04.756 --> 00:57:05.589
The Duke!

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.634
(growls)

00:57:18.603 --> 00:57:21.438
(laughing)

00:57:21.439 --> 00:57:25.568
I know it's frightfully
impolite to eavesdrop like this.

00:57:27.112 --> 00:57:31.241
but are you by any chance
having trouble with your throat?

00:57:33.618 --> 00:57:34.828
Nothing to say?

00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:42.377
Cock-a-doodle-doo?

00:57:44.087 --> 00:57:44.879
Stop it!

00:57:46.089 --> 00:57:47.132
Chanti. crow!

00:57:49.092 --> 00:57:49.925
Shut up. you!

00:57:49.926 --> 00:57:51.385
Come on. you guys!

00:57:51.386 --> 00:57:52.886
Show him we believe.

00:57:52.887 --> 00:57:54.096
I told you to be quiet!

00:57:54.097 --> 00:57:57.182
Chanticleer. Chanticleer. Chanticleer.

00:57:57.183 --> 00:57:59.227
Chanticleer. Chanticleer!

00:58:03.148 --> 00:58:04.356
(choking)

00:58:04.357 --> 00:58:08.486
Duke. leave him alone.
it's me you want. not him.

00:58:12.031 --> 00:58:14.242
(laughing)

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.509
Chanticleer...

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:34.303
Chanticleer.

00:58:34.304 --> 00:58:36.014
Very stupid. Patou.

00:58:38.266 --> 00:58:41.519
Chanticleer. Chanticleer. Chanticleer.

00:58:42.937 --> 00:58:43.770
Look here. quiet!

00:58:43.771 --> 00:58:47.567
[All] Chanticleer.
Chanticleer. Chanticleer.

00:58:48.776 --> 00:58:51.321
(all chanting)

00:58:53.239 --> 00:58:55.324
Fools. all of you.

00:58:55.325 --> 00:58:56.117
Silence!

00:58:58.244 --> 00:59:00.371
I'll give you Chanticleer!

00:59:01.664 --> 00:59:05.460
[All] Chanticleer.
Chanticleer. Chanticleer!

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:31.485
(maniacal laughter)

00:59:31.486 --> 00:59:34.279
Look. it's comin' up without him

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.822
You're a phony.

00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:36.657
Are you by any chance having

00:59:36.658 --> 00:59:39.284
a little trouble with your throat?

00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:40.702
You're a phony.

00:59:40.703 --> 00:59:42.829
It's coming up without him.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.540
It's your job to bring up the sun.

00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:47.876
It hasn't shined since you left.

00:59:47.877 --> 00:59:50.420
(gasping)

00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:54.509
Chanticleer. you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:04.352
Cock-a-dooooo.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.567
Cock-a-dooooo.

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:14.862
Cock-a-dooooo.

01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:23.371
(yelling)

01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:37.343
(coughing)

01:00:46.978 --> 01:00:47.854
Hehehehe!

01:00:49.439 --> 01:00:51.899
Hunch. it's me. Uncle Dukey.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:54.068
Uncle Dukey?

01:00:56.112 --> 01:00:56.904
Come here.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:00:59.197
Hunch. no!

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.073
(chuckling)

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:03.285
Animation. it's music to my ears.

01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:05.579
Hold still. you little twerp!

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.790
Aggravation. abomination. alienation.

01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:11.002
(laughing)

01:01:21.638 --> 01:01:24.556
[Patou] Well. our journey
had finally come to an end.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:28.977
Old Chanticleer was back
to stay. the sun was up.

01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:33.107
the rain had stopped. and
the owls were gone for good.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:39.613
Everything seemed to be
turning out just fine.

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:41.991
except for one thing. Edmond.

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.914
We just didn't know how to help him.

01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:08.392
(gasps)

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:10.186
He was a little boy.

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:15.441
Oh. he was a handsome little boy.

01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:18.653
Edmond. Edmond...

01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:25.868
Edmond. Edmond.

01:02:31.207 --> 01:02:31.999
Edmond...

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:40.341
Edmond. Edmond. come on honey. wake up.

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:46.264
(whimpering)

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:51.978
Wake up. honey.

01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:54.397
Mom. Mom!

01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:58.900
Look. I'm not furry anymore!

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:00.318
I'm a boy!

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.863
Lie down. sweetheart.

01:03:02.864 --> 01:03:04.239
Mom. is that the sun?

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.866
Mm-hmm.

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:08.661
Edmond. Edmond. get back into bed.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:10.620
Wow.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.248
Okay. take a look.

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:16.585
Look. Mom. Chanticleer raised the sun.

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:19.171
Hi Edmond. how you doing. son?

01:03:19.172 --> 01:03:22.048
Fine. but what happened
to Chanti and the gang?

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:23.842
Mom. where are they?

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:26.887
Edmond. Chanticleer is just a storybook.

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.930
Those characters are only make-believe.

01:03:28.931 --> 01:03:30.265
Now come on. let's get back to bed.

01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:33.059
No mom. no they're not. I saw them.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.520
I bet they're wondering
what happened to me.

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.314
I wanna tell them I'm okay.

01:03:37.315 --> 01:03:38.607
I'm sure they know.

01:03:38.608 --> 01:03:39.817
You think so?

01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:44.946
They'll be just fine.

01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:46.865
[Patou] Edmond's mom
was right. of course.

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:48.992
but she didn't know why.

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:52.621
She also never knew just what
stopped the rain that night.

01:03:52.622 --> 01:03:54.331
but that just goes to show you.

01:03:54.332 --> 01:03:56.500
with a little help from your friends.

01:03:56.501 --> 01:03:58.585
you can do just about anything.

01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:01.254
Welcome home. Chanticleer.

01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:03.799
Thanks for bringing back the sun.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.261
♫ Cock-a-doooo-doodle-doodle-dooo-dooo

01:04:08.262 --> 01:04:09.387
[Edmond] Chanticleer!

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:10.806
Hey. Edmond!

01:04:10.807 --> 01:04:11.599
Whoowee!

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.851
♫ Cock-a-doo. what a day

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.812
♫ The sun is shinin' brightly.

01:04:16.813 --> 01:04:18.730
♫ Cock-A-doo sunny day.

01:04:18.731 --> 01:04:20.816
♫ Down here on the farm
