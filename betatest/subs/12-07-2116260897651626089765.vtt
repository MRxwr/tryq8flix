00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.740
[Claire] Good question.

183
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.940
I think we've grown out of
high school nicknames now. Tim.

184
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.260
Oh. but you'll never grow out
of that Jughead Jones scone of yours.

185
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.360
[chuckles]

186
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.900
Sorry…um…

187
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.800
So what's been happening
since high school. Justin?

188
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.380
Nothing much. Working.
Nothing too exciting.

189
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.480
Boring.

190
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.700
How about you then? What's news?

191
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.020
You could walk last time I saw you.

192
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.120
Oh. your balls have finally dropped. eh?

193
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.880
Some things have changed.

194
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.900
Are you working. Blucker?

195
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.040
Yeah. I'm a roof tiler.

196
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.140
What. you think that's funny.

197
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.240
I'm in a wheelchair. Claire.

198
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.900
What happened?

199
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
If you don't mind me asking.

200
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.400
I had a crash a few years back.

201
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.920
So you're still friends with Chris then?

202
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.420
Yeah. I suppose so. yeah.

203
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.700
I haven't seen him for ages.

204
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.740
No. he's hard to get a hold of.

205
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.840
[Blucker] Yeah.

206
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.980
So…do you know if anyone else
from school is coming?

207
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.080
No idea.

208
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.800
Well. you're still a barrel of laughs
then. Jughead.

209
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.280
It's good to see you Claire.
let's have a chat and reminisce later.

210
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360
[hip hop music continues]

211
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.120
[exhales softly]

212
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.720
Are you Maria?

213
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.240
Yes.

214
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.940
Cheers.

215
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.900
-What can I get you. darl?
-Just water.

216
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.160
Our son consumed rum…

217
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.280
but our daughter drunk water.

218
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.540
Enjoy.

219
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.020
It's free.

220
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.940
-Yeah. it is.
-Choice.

221
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.100
I never introduced myself earlier.
I'm Dot.

222
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.660
-Emi.
-Wait one second.

223
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.140
Open bar. yeah?

224
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.540
Indeed it is. What can I get you?
Dark. clear. wine. or beer?

225
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.380
I'll have the booziest thing you can make.

226
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.480
That sounds like a challenge.

227
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.200
I know no one here.
you mind if I cling on to you for a bit?

228
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.840
Don't even know the guy
who invited me.

229
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.700
Perfect. What are you drinking?

230
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.980
-Just water.
-What real drink?

231
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.400
Loners like us don't drink water.
we stay loners.

232
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.660
Jesus!

233
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.340
It's a Molotov cocktail the IRA
would be proud of!

234
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.780
-Mm-hm
-You're having one of these?

235
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.420
-No. it's fine.
-Another one. thanks

236
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.520
-[barman] Done.
-No. no.

237
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.220
So let me guess…

238
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.480
you're a makeup artist?

239
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.240
Tattooist?

240
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.180
Not even close.

241
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.280
I study commerce.

242
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.320
Well. you're the most badass
businesswoman I've ever seen.

243
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.420
Thank you…I think.

244
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.340
But what else do you do with yourself?

245
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.280
'Cause a girl in that outfit and lippy
isn't into just business studies.

246
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.060
I like illustration and music.

247
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.540
Those two things mainly.

248
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.420
-You draw?
-Mm.

249
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.520
I bet you're a dab hand.

250
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.800
I love music and art but I'm tone deaf
and blunt pencilled.

251
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.680
What do you do?

252
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.500
Well. I was. or technically. I'm a model.

253
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.020
but there's not much demand
for 35 year old slappers.

254
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.220
You're 35?

255
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.460
I hope I look like you when I'm 25.

256
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.140
Well. how old are you?

257
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.980
19.

258
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.100
Jesus! I could literally be your mother.

259
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.200
Barely even remember being your age.

260
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.340
I'm not even kidding.
I was a bit of a druggy mess back then.

261
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.300
Now I'm just a pissy mess.

262
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.300
Well I'm nearly 20 now. Mum.

263
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.400
Bitch.

264
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.900
I should get back to Mike.
come join us if you like.

265
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.100
I was just about to leave.

266
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.380
Oh. no. you're not.

267
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.580
I'm not going to be the only one here
who doesn't know anyone.

268
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.680
Plus. you haven't even started your drink.

269
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.460
Do you know where the bathroom is?

270
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.560
Come find me after.

271
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.040
OK.

272
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.320

[solemn music continues]

277
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.600
[woman] Do you mind?

278
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.840
Sorry. I didn't think anyone was in there.

279
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.480
Well. I'm done so you can come in.

280
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360
We're all adults.

281
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
[toilet flushes]

[door creaks]

283
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.580
So…

284
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.680
I don't know you.

285
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.480
No. I'm Emi.

286
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.120
Christal.

287
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.280
[snorts]

288
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.560
So how do you know Chris?

289
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.040
I don't really. we just met.

290
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.660
He's here?

291
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.880
No. sorry. I meant. earlier today.

292
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.280
[sighs]

293
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320
You can have that.

294
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.720
I'm fine. thanks.

295
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.360
I won't tell your mum.

296
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.160
What's your connection to him?

297
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.120
Ask him that.

298
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.200

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280
[soft relaxed music]

300
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.200
Is it wrong I wanna hit a crippled man?

301
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.020
Yes.

302
00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.300
You just never normally associate
a paralysed person with being a jerk-off.

303
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.400
[Dot] What about this one?

304
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.040
Na.

305
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.780
This is bollocks! Where is this bloke?

306
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.100
I don't know.

307
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.580
His tunes are depressing.

308
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.780
You got that right?

309
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.460
You mind if I put something else on?

310
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.560
Go for it.

311
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.900
[barman] Pardon the interruption
party people.

312
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.900
would anyone care for a nibble?

313

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.060

-Is there anything else coming?

316
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.740
Ah. yes! I have some seafood
and a few beef kebabs on the way.

317
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.340
Ah. she meant anything
that wasn't once a sentient being.

318
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.980
-[chuckles]
-Come again?

319
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.660
Ah. anything that isn't meat.

320
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.700
Oh! Let me go have a butcher's--
I mean. a look.

321
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.800
Oh. sorry. won't be a sec.

322
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.700
[Dot] How long you been a vegetarian?

323
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.580
Since I started feeling really guilty.

324
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.220
Around eight.

325
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.320
Hm…

326
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.840
It's a big decision for a kid to make.

327
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.260
I was vego once for a year.
but I was so iron deficient.

328
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.660
I was like a walking cadaver.

329
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.760
[laughs]

330
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.900
Yeah. So. um…

331
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.260
So. what's your connection to Chris?

332
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.120
[Dot] We don't have one.
We know Frankie. Well. Mike does.

333
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.340
Who's Frankie?

334
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.460
One of the fellas who lives here.

335
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.560
We work together in the UK.

336
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.840
Oh. nice!
What do you do with yourself. Mike?

337
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.380
I was a graphic designer back then.

338
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.620
Now he's a DJ.

339
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.460
[laughs]

340
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.260
You…

341
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.500
Oh. you're serious.

342
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.540
Sorry. you said that as he put the CD on.
I thought you were joking.

343
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.660
But. a DJ…nice.

344
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.360
What's the deal with Chris
and your friend Frankie then?

345
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.640
This place has only one bedroom.

346
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280
Oh. is he queer?

347
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.580
How would I know?

348
00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.620
No.

349
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.580
Excuse her.

350
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.900
Claire has this thing that Chris is gay.

351
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.180
He's not.

352
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.260
I just didn't get turned down a lot
in high school.

353
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.180
Of course not.

354
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.380
How do you know they both live here?

355
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.980
Well. she doesn't.

356
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:20.080
And I'm pretty sure. that is his ex
or possibly his current girlfriend.

[hip hop music]

358
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.140
I'm really not very good.

359
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.620
