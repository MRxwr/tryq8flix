'Drishyam 2'
[The Resumption]

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Mary...

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.410
Mary...

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.830
Mary...

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200
Mary...

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.290
Mary. open the door!

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.370
Open the door!

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.120
- Hey!
- Sir. don't let him go.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.330
Catch him!

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.330
Sir. he's here.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.370
Stop there!

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.950
Stop there.
- Where are you going?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.250
Stop there.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.410
Come on. walk.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.370
Acting tough?
Come on!

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.250
Come on. walk!

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620
Walk!

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.830
[6 years later]

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.370
Hello?

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.830
What is this. Anto Sir?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.500
What will I do if you say
this at this last moment?

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.250
I had to let go of an awesome
Tamil film which came to me.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.830
Yeah.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.410
Okay.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.370
Phew!

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.330
You woke up?

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.450
What happened today?

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.000
Hangover's gone too soon?

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.330
The release of that Mammootty
movie got postponed.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.120
It would have garnered
a great initial.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.500
Had I known this a week back.
I could have accepted that Tamil film.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.500
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.330
Rani. I'm asking you!

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.910
What do I say. Georgekutty?

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.330
Do you ever listen
to what I say?

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.700
You do everything
as you wish. right?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.500
You have changed a lot.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.540
Why do you say so?

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Of course!

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.370
You sold the property
my dad gave us. Fine!

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.830
From these 5 acres which you always brag
that you earned with so much hard work.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.290
you sold 2 acres. right?

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.870
I begged you not to sell it.
but you didn't listen.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.750
And now you're asking
for my opinion?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.250
Did I lose that
money after that?

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.120
I bought a great property and
built a movie theatre. right?

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.250
Don't talk about that theatre.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.660
You have taken many
loans for it. right?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.540
We had suffered a lot.
because my dad had taken loans.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.910
I am not your dad.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.500
Our theatre is generating
great revenue.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.910
I've saved a fair amount after
paying the loan. as well.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.950
Isn't that enough?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.580
Where's that money then?

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.750
I know... where that money went.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.580
You gave it to get a script
written for your movie. right?

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.790
And where's the script?

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.080
It has been 3 years!

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.250
Well. I...
- But I am happy about it.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.870
Since that story is stuck.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.660
You won't end up making
that movie. right?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.250
Georgekutty.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.580
we have two daughters.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.750
Don't forget that.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.500
Why?
Don't you have anything to say?

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.580
Usually you give so many
justifications and put me down. right?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.910
I'm not saying anything!

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.370
You don't understand
what I say. either.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.290
You're seeing my
self-confidence as my arrogance.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.330
Georgekutty.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.500
in every matter. even when you
say that I don't understand it.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.120
you usually give me
a clear cut answer.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.120
But that's not the
case with this movie.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.750
The day you decided
to make that movie.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.700
me and our children have lost
our peace of mind since then.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.450
Even your alcoholism started when you
decided to make this movie. right?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.290
But I don't booze daily.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.700
When I go for movie discussions.
it's a different mood.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.250
Does everyone in the film industry
make stories after boozing?

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.660
I didn't mean that.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.250
Forget all the money
we lost till now.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.830
We don't need this movie
business. Georgekutty.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.450
Unlike what you think. we
haven't lost a lot of money.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.410
I had an idea for
a story in my mind.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.950
I am trying to sit with
a screenplay writer.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.580
and make a good
script out of it.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.790
But there are some parts which
we're not satisfied with.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.950
We're rethinking about them.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.830
I'm not someone who's desperate to
make a movie somehow or the other.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.950
I am studying about its
production possibilities now.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.250
I'll do it only if
everything falls into place.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.790
Okay.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.870
How much did you spend so
far to write that script?

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.830
So far?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.750
- Don't try to evade my question.
- Let me calculate!

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.750
I gave 1.2 Million to
the scriptwriter.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.790
And for my travel...

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yeah. Around...

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.370
Around 1.5-1.6 Million Rupees.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.750
Jesus!

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.450
1.6 Million Rupees?

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.370
When I ask you to hire
a housemaid for me.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.080
you create a ruckus over here.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.250
I'm stopping this.
Why should I suffer like this?

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.080
Give me Half a Million Rupees.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.750
Half a Million?
For what?

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.080
I also have some
desires and dreams.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.790
- I will kill you today. - I won't
give you money even if you kill me.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.040
Give it to me.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.450
Oh no!

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.370
He is beating up that
poor thing again.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.700
Just go there. Georgekutty.
- Why?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.500
I'm not going to that
drunk rascal's house.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.120
Don't talk like you have
no conscience. Georgekutty.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.910
What's that poor Saritha's fault?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.250
When you're not around.
she's my only source of help.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.160
When Anju had fix recently..
- Not fix! It's fits.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700
Whatever!

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.660
She's the only one who
was here to help me.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.790
Just go!

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.250
What is this?

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.080
What's all that noise. Mom?

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.450
That Sabu is beating up Saritha.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.750
Why doesn't Saritha
Chechi divorce him?

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.700
- I won't give you.
- Give me money.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.660
Move away.
What's the problem?

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.370
I didn't give him
money to booze.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.040
If you want to booze. you have
to earn that money yourself.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.040
- Don't ask your wife..
- It was with my hard earned money...

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.660
... that I bought this land from
you paying an exorbitant price.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.830
This is my property now.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.790
Why do you care if I
fight with my wife?

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.580
No one else has any problem.
Then what's it with you?

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.700
Georgekutty.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.450
just because you killed
a young boy long back.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.000
don't try to mess with me.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.370
I'm not scared of you.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.250
- He's already drunk. is it?
- Yes.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.290
Where did he get it from?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.410
He was celebrating the sale
of a property yesterday.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.910
- It's the left-over from that.
- What are you mumbling?

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.040
Listen. Georgekutty.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.750
you don't have to come here to
interfere in my family matters.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.950
- What will you do if I come?
- Please don't!

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.950
No. Georgekutty.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.910
If you come?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.410
If you poke your
nose into my family.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.040
I will poke my nose into
your family as well.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.580
Shut up. man!

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.700
Here! Go and booze!

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.160
Booze and ruin yourself!

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.410
Move away!

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.870
- Georgekutty!
- Get lost.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.040
Please go. Chetta (brother).
He will never learn.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.370
Why don't you complain
to the police. Saritha?

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.540
Why? He's not going to
stop drinking like that.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.660
Not to stop his drinking.
but this domestic abuse.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.370
If they give him
a strong warning.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.450
he will stop hurting you.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.080
Georgekutty has a point. Saritha.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.200
- Won't they hurt him. Chechi (sister)?
- No.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.660
Isn't it time for you
to leave for work? Go!

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.000
It's all right.
Let it be.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.200
Are you coming for
the prayer today?

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.660
I'll come if it's
in the evening.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.580
Okay.
I wanted to tell you something.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.620
Tell me. Chechi.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.200
No.
I'll tell you in the evening.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.370
- See you.
- Okay.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Dad!

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.330
Sorry.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.580
Your hands will fray.
That's enough.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.120
Anu had called from her hostel.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.910
She's coming in the evening.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.700
Today is Thursday. right?
Doesn't she have classes tomorrow?

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.950
No. They have some retreat
tomorrow. apparently.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.790
So she doesn't want
to attend the retreat?

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.120
Yeah. right!
As if she's very religious!

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.580
Why didn't you tell her?

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.160
She never listens to what I say!

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.290
She has changed a lot.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.950
If I scold her. she starts
grumbling in English.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.290
That's the outcome of sending
her to St. Joseph's school.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.410
The Mammootty movie which was supposed
to release tomorrow. has been postponed.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.910
Is it?
What happened?

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.040
Some issue with the censor board.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.870
I'll drop you off
at college today.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.040
It's okay. Dad. You can drop
me at the bus stand.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.330
What's the status of his case?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.040
I think the police
have given up.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.620
They haven't found
that boy's body. right?

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.000
No. They are still investigating.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.750
They can't give up so easily.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.200
They are still investigating Sukumara
Kurup's case. Then why not this one?

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.870
That boy's parents
went to America.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.500
Then who's so
interested in this case?

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.540
But the cops are really angry.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.330
They were taken for a royal ride. right?

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.290
And that Sahadevan
lost his job as well.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.410
He deserved it.
He was a rascal.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.700
What's the collection?

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.120
I got quite a lot.
The rest. as usual.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.950
Chetta. he has come from MyG.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.790
To install the CCTV.
- What's the status?

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.830
It's done. Sir.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.580
We have connected it to the TV.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.290
- What about the cameras?
- One is here.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.290
The other one is outside.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.700
- What about the theatre?
- That was done 2 days back. Sir.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.620
If you give me your phone.
I'll install it.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.370
- How much time will you take?
- 20 minutes.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.660
Where's the collection?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.870
- How much is there?
- 38.000 Rupees.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160
Deposit it at the bank.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.120
Chetta. the Asian
cable guys had called.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.700
- To talk about the broadband connection.
- We don't need that now.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.000
This whole area has 4G.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.160
Well. since these digital
platforms have come up....

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.330
But how many houses
have smart TVs here?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.700
Let them buy those TVs first.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.790
You do what I say.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.950
Deposit it at the bank.
Go!

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.500
Hey! I heard that it was that
girl who killed that boy.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.450
- Which girl?
- His daughter.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.700
No.
That's not what happened.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.790
That girl and my brother
were in the same school.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.910
- But.. have you seen her now?
- No.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.250
She doesn't talk to anyone.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.410
He said that this dead guy
and this girl were in love.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.540
Is that so?

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.370
He came during the
night to see her.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080
For what?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.580
And when they were at it.
Georgekutty came in.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.120
He killed him on the spot.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.370
- Is it?
- Yes.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.160
I heard another news too.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.200
That boy came to see
her mom. apparently.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.870
- Really?
- I swear.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.910
- Is it?
- Yes.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.660
Ikka. you can take
these bananas.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.200
Is it 'Ethappazham'?
- One bunch.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.620
The other one is 'Njalippoovan'.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.950
- Raghu!
- Yes.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.120
- Keep these two bunches inside.
- Here you go.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.160
The bunches don't look
so lively. Chetta.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.120
That's because I don't
use chemical fertilizers.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.950
Thought they don't look good.
they won't be harmful.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.540
- Shall I get you some tea?
- No.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I'm leaving.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.120
- What's the hurry?
- I have to reach the theatre.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.870
Oh! Tomorrow is Friday. right?

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.370
A new movie will be releasing!

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.750
- How is business?
- It's dull.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.410
Just going on somehow.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040
I'm leaving.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.700
Well. what about these bananas?

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.870
Put a price for it.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.750
and add it to my boy's tab.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.620
The bike is quite old.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.540
Moreover. the price you're
asking for is too high.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.620
I can't sell it for
such a low price.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.790
If you reduce 5000 Rupees.
I'll buy it.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.870
If I reduce 5000 Rupees.
it will be a huge loss for me.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.580
No! If I buy it for your price.
it will be a loss for me.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.160
This is great. Sir.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.160
Sadanandan. as the world progresses.
we should also progress.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.750
But we're the ones
in trouble now.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.790
I mean... now you can see
every move of ours. right?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.950
I would know that
even otherwise.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.950
What do we do now?

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.200
Should we play this average
movie for one more week?

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.370
Will it be worth it?

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.500
Isn't it a family movie. Sir?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.330
The footfalls might
increase during the weekend.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.790
Sir...

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.450
- Someone is here to see you.
- Who is it?

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.700
- I don't know.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.580
See if we can get a good
movie to play during this gap.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.660
Otherwise continue playing this.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.410
I'm going to Ernakulam.
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.750
Is this your theatre. Georgekutty?

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.910
Very nice.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.620
It has been two weeks
since we arrived.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.410
We're going back
day after tomorrow.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.000
We had come last year too.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.620
To perform our son's last rites.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.910
According to our belief.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.950
we're supposed to...

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.540
... do it with his body remains.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.790
If that isn't available.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.790
there's a method where we do
it by imagining that he's dead.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.410
Yet...

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.290
nothing is falling in place.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.830
We're not able to find solace.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.830
We're always fighting at home.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.870
I'm beginning to get scared
whether I would lose Geetha.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.870
We had met an
astrologer during this visit.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.080
See. Georgekutty.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.870
I was not someone who
believed in all this.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.160
But in the present circumstance.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.000
I'm ready to rely on
anything to find solace.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.870
That astrologer said that...

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.080
our son's soul is wandering
without attaining salvation.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.870
and that the only
solution for this would be...

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.120
performing his last rites
with his body remains.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.580
Can you please...

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.080
... tell me where
it is. Georgekutty?

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.290
No one else would know
that I'm taking it.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.450
Even Geetha won't know.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:04.950
You have my word.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.830
You can trust me.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.080
Georgekutty.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.000
we are solely responsible for
all the mistakes of our son.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.160
Do we deserve such a cruel
punishment for that mistake?

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.370
Can you please save
us from this distress?

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.370
- I'll fall at your feet.
- Sir. please don't.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.910
Please don't. Sir.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.410
It's not because
I don't trust you.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.750
Though I wish to help you.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.040
I can't do it.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.000
Please don't come
to meet me again.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.450
Don't take us back to those
memories we're trying to forget.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.910
No. Sir.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.120
I am helpless.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.660
I'll never be able to help you.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.950
Georgekutty...

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.790
Let's do that during
the lunch break. no?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.830
Where are you going?
Don't you have class?

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.330
Ma'am is on leave today.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.250
So we're all going
to the library.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.790
- Okay. go.
- Okay. Ma'am.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.040
- So Arjun was saying that...
- I already completed it.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.950
- we should do that during..
- One minute. Anu!

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.080
Go.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.830
- There's a good news.
- What?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.540
- The fund for the short film is ready.
- Have your parents allowed?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.540
No. I have a cousin
brother in Dubai. right?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.120
He has promised to help me.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.040
- Are you going for the retreat tomorrow?
- No. I'm going home.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.290
Shall I also come with you?

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.330
Yeah. right!

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.910
My mom will kick you out!

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.910
Have you told them about us?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.290
Ever since that incident
happened to my sister.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.250
mom gets really worried whenever
she sees us talking to any boy.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.910
How can I tell her
about you then?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.120
I want to see that house and surroundings
and set a mood for the short film.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160
That's why.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.910
Aren't you coming to the library?
- I'll join you guys.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.330
So you're going to make our
story into a short film?

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.370
No.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.080
But that was my inspiration.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.200
- Nice.
- Shall I narrate that idea?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.540
Tell me.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.080
A rainy night with
thunder and lightning.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.080
A teenage girl who's
sleeping in her bedroom.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.410
She wakes up with the flash of a
lightning that falls on her face.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.790
She gets up to go
to the washroom...

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.200
and sees something.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.870
She wakes up from her
dream suddenly. in shock.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.250
She looks outside and gets
shocked seeing something.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.410
What did she see?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.950
You're feeling curious. right?

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.200
- Yes.
- I haven't fixed what she sees.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.450
I can end it either in a
thriller-horror mood or in a comic mood.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.500
- How is it?
- Impressive.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.160
- So your inspiration was my sister's
dreams which I told you about? - Yes.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.700
- When did you come from Dubai?
- Two days back.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.910
I'll call Dad.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.830
- Why don't you come inside?
- No. I'll wait here.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:21.870
Okay.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200
George!

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.660
Why are you sitting outside?
Come inside.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.250
What's the status of our movie?

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.540
Sir. the climax I
narrated the other day?

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.580
We don't need it. Sir.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.660
What happened?

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.160
I discussed it with some people.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.870
Everyone gave me the
same opinion as yours.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.040
There are many risk
elements in it.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.450
What about our first climax?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.370
They didn't like that too.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.000
Don't be angry with me. Sir.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160
Shall we...

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.750
... think about
another possibility?

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.410
Cinema has been my childhood dream.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.540
From whatever I've seen
in life and in the movies.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.660
I put together some
thoughts and made a story.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.080
So it shouldn't be just
another ordinary movie.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.040
I am particular that it should
be an extraordinary movie.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200
Very good.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.620
Did you get any idea
for a different climax?

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.790
I have some thoughts
in my mind. Sir.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.830
Then tell me.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.330
I know that it's ironic for a writer
to ask for ideas from the producer.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700
But...

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.500
your thoughts have
so much life in them.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.830
Sir...

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.580
Chechi...

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.950
You just got back?

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.950
My regular bus didn't come.
That's why I got late.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.000
- I'll just wash my face and come quickly.
- Okay.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.370
Hey! I've told you so many times
not to be so friendly with that family!

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.750
How many times have I
told you to stop boozing?

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.790
This is also like that.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.410
I don't like them
entering my property.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.620
This is my property as well.
I am fine with it.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.160
I'm seeing how you have changed.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.160
I'll set you straight.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.370
Come back.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.120
I'll teach you a lesson.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.290
Don't mind that. Chechi.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.660
He keeps blabbering like that.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.790
Come. let's go.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.790
Ours was a love marriage which
my parents didn't approve of.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.500
I'm suffering because
of their curse.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.370
I am also worried.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.540
Georgekutty has also
started drinking now.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.290
Why are you laughing?

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.910
Can that even be
called drinking?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.410
You should see how Sabu drinks!

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.500
Small things lead to
big changes. right?

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.910
My dear Chechi. Georgekutty Chettan knows
very well where to start and where to stop!

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.750
Is this what you
wanted to tell me?

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.290
No.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.450
You had told me about an alliance
for Anju recently. right?

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.160
Oops. I forgot about that.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.120
I'll ask them and get
back to you today itself.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.040
What is Georgekutty
Chettan's opinion?

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.660
No. I haven't spoken to
Georgekutty about this.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.620
I thought I'll tell him after
getting the groom's details.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.370
Before he spends all our
money for making that movie.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.660
we have to get Anju married.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160
You should. Chechi.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.080
You shouldn't delay it any further.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.450
It's better that
Anju moves from here.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.080
What is Anju's opinion?

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.160
I haven't spoken to her
about this till date.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.450
She also wants to
move from this town.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.830
But she's scared to
stay alone in a hostel.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.870
Otherwise we could have sent
her somewhere far to study.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.410
She was such a happy
and vibrant girl.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.620
Don't worry. Chechi.
Everything will be all right.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.160
Mom. Dad had called.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.750
- He asked you to call him back.
- Okay.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.700
Hey! I don't think I
can come back today.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.290
I'll reach in the morning.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.500
What is this. Georgekutty?

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.410
Me and the children
are alone here.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.250
You ask Saritha to come over.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.410
- You're boozing there. is it?
- No!

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.910
Vinayachandran Sir is
going back tomorrow.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.080
So we're going to
have a discussion now.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.910
Where will you stay then?

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.160
I'll stay at a lodge here.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.290
Has Anu reached?

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.580
Yes. she's here.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.080
She has been in front of
the TV ever since she came.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.160
Okay.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.290
I'll talk to her once I am back.
Bye.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.250
Anu. you've been watching
this for a while now.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.700
Stop it and go take a bath.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.700
Let me finish this. Mom.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Stop watching this disgusting
film and go take a bath.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.500
- This is so annoying!
- Anu!

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.450
Listen to mom.
Go take a bath.

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.370
Oh my God! She's so annoying.
I can't believe this.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.120
What did she say in English?

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080
Leave it. Mom.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.830
Chetta...

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.080
Will your movie
happen anytime soon?

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.330
Why do you have a
doubt about that?

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.370
It has been around 2-2.5 years now.
That's why.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.370
Well...

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.830
It has been long since I
stopped acting in dramas.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.750
You have rekindled
my desire now.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.410
Will it be an empty promise?

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.870
I've heard that film industry
people cannot be trusted.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.450
But I'm not from
the film industry.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.700
I'm just going to enter
the film industry. right?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.000
I didn't mean you. Georgetta.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.200
If it's further delayed.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.950
what if our scriptwriter Vinayachandran
makes this movie with someone else?

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.290
No. no!
Rajan!

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.410
This has been a
lifelong dream of mine.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.620
So...

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.330
I won't allow anyone else
to snatch it away from me.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.910
Have you heard about
something called 'Copyright'?

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.160
Yes! I've heard about it.
Oh no!

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.250
I don't want it.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.410
I have to get back on duty. There will
be people in the office till 7 PM.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.160
- This is not our first time. right?
- I'll pour it.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160
Very little.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.620
This is Vodka.
There won't be any smell.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.160
What problem do you night
duty guys have anyway?

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.750
You can sleep under the
guise of standing guard. right?

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.580
That's because you came
early today. right?

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.370
If it was past 7 PM. we could
have gone to my room. as usual.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.160
- You could have taken a bath as well.
- No.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.080
We'll sit in the car today.
That's better.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.080
Well. where did I stop?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.830
- Copyright!
- Yes! Copyright!

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.580
If this story has been
printed in someone's name.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.120
somewhere. in some
way or the other.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.120
then that story will have
a copyright.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.120
Whoever takes that story after that.
he will be in a fix.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:53.370
So?

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.790
I've already printed our story
as a novel and published it.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.790
Oh no!

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.290
But if people read it as a novel. won't
they lose the thrill of watching the movie?

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.580
But this is not a
suspense thriller. right?

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.500
It's just a simple family story.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.040
And not many people
are going to read it.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.580
There will be a couple of copies in
some book stalls in my town. That's all.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.290
You're quite a genius!

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.540
Don't think you can
escape by flattering me.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.290
Did you forget what
I asked you to do?

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.450
I am enquiring.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.410
Everyone has work now since
there are many TV serials now.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.870
But all of them have this
excitement when it comes to cinema.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.830
We need different. fresh faces.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.040
They should perform well too.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.660
When I make a movie. I want to
give opportunities to newcomers.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.910
I am particular about that.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.200
So it's not your trick
to reduce the expenses?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.540
I understood!

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.830
We shouldn't reveal our trade
secret to anyone. Rajan.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.910
Now. the second thing.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.660
You want a producer as
your partner. right?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.830
I am trying to find one.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.830
The guy from Dubai hasn't
reached yet. That's why.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.370
Okay then.
I am leaving.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.290
Oh!

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.410
So you came to enquire about all
this and not to meet me. is it?

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.870
I wanted to meet you.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.910
I had to meet you.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120
Haven't you heard it?

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.870
[Reciting a local proverb]

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.910
Do you have to leave today
in this condition?

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.660
No. It's totally fine.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.290
I'll go straight to Hotel Athira.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.370
I'll take a bath there.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.410
A friend of mine is
editing a movie there.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.410
I have to see that.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.750
Why do you have to see
the editing of a movie?

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.620
When we're going to do a business.
we need to study all aspects of it.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.620
So if you learn direction as well.
you can save that money too. right?

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.830
I shall think about it.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Yeah. right!

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080
Rajan!

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.330
Hey! I'm leaving.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.910
See you next time.
It's time.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.330
Hey! Hey!
- Let me go.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.830
Aren't you scared to
sleep alone. Saritha?

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.410
There was a time when
I used to be scared.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.450
That's all gone now.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.950
And... we'll be scared only when
we have something to lose. right?

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.660
That's true.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.700
I have slept alone so many
times back in the day.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.290
Georgekutty used to sleep at the
cable TV office on most days.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.870
Me and the children
would be alone here.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.750
Now I'm not able to do that.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.040
And... Georgekutty doesn't
stay away like that now.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.910
It must be after
that incident. right?

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.500
Yes.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.750
Did you call them. Saritha?

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.330
Well...

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.250
We'll look for a better
alliance. Chechi.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.660
What happened?

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.410
Didn't you say that
it's a good alliance?

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.870
Well...

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.370
Whatever it is.
you can tell me.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.660
Chechi. they...

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.410
They had enquired in
our neighbourhood.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.330
And?

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.250
What is it. Saritha?
Tell me.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.450
Chechi. it has been only
two years since I came here.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.830
And I've been the
closest with this family.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.950
It's the same for us too.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.700
I consider you as
my younger sister.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.450
Chechi...

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.750
If someone says
something about us.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.410
we might be the last
ones to know about it.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.830
Sometimes we may not
even know about it.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.410
Who said what?

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.080
Well...

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.660
There's a strong rumour in town...

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:21.160
... that there was an illicit relationship
between our Anju and that boy.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:28.080
and that Georgekutty Chettan saw
them in a compromising position.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.700
and that's why Georgekutty
Chettan killed that boy...

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.250
They say that the boy was innocent...

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.830
... and it was our Anju
who invited him home.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.870
No.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.870
These are all lies.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:40.870
Anju hasn't done anything wrong.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.910
He was a pervert.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
That's why she...

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.830
Don't cry. Chechi.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.290
Those who spread these
rumours will rot in hell.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.410
Don't they have
daughters at home too?

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.450
Chechi. people will talk
all sorts of things.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.660
We needn't listen to all that.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.410
We will find a nice groom for Anju.
That's all.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.830
Chechi...

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.450
Chechi?

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.000
Has Rani woken up?
- She's in the toilet.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.910
What happened to you?

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:37.370
Sabu?

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.080
You wives are the ones
who encourage such people.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.910
You spoil them by
tolerating everything.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.160
Complain at the police station.
They will take care of the rest.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.620
Will you tell them or should I?

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.160
- Would they hurt him?
- No.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:53.910
I'm telling you. right?

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040
Okay then.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.660
- Shall I get you coffee?
- Black coffee is fine.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.580
Milk would aggravate
your hangover or what?

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:06.830
Well. I...

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.830
Hey! Stop!

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:21.660
What is this attire?

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.660
Go and change it.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.040
- Good morning!
- Morning!

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.000
- When did you come?
- In the 5:30 PM bus yesterday.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.000
Hey! I asked you to go change!

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.830
Mom. this is our house.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.080
It's just us here. right?

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:35.580
This is a night dress.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.250
You should use it only in
your room in the night.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.450
Everyone wears this
at home now. Mom.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.540
Not in this house.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.040
This house is not so progressive.
Go change it!

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.290
Don't you always say that
one should go with the tide?

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.250
Sorry.

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.250
Stop talking
back and go change.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.370
- Dad. look at this.
- Go and change. dear. Go!

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.700
Such crap. I don't know
what's wrong with her.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:55.750
See!

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:58.870
How many times have I told
you not to grumble like this?

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.160
If you have something to say.
say it aloud!

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.620
There's no point
hearing it aloud.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.620
It's St. Joseph's school English.
You won't understand.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.040
Get lost!

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.450
Get lost?

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.200
When you go to take the curry.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.700
why don't you bring
some for everyone?

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.950
Did anyone want it?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.250
Why don't you ask that?

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.200
Are you bothered
only about yourself?

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.410
What is this. Mom?

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.660
Do you want it?

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.700
I'll bring it.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.040
No.
- Do you want it. Dad?

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.870
What's the problem then?

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.250
Georgekutty...

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.700
do we need this movie business?

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.040
What's most important for us right
now is Anju's marriage. right?

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.160
Mom. I don't want to
get married so soon.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.580
I want to study further.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.200
Not right away. dear.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.120
Only if we start considering now.
it will happen in a couple of years.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.790
I want to work for a couple of
years after completing my studies.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.540
We can think about it after that. Dad.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:05.950
Don't worry. dear.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.290
You can get married
after getting a job.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.200
- But Georgekutty. what I'm...
- Let's discuss this later.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.160
Dad... who's the hero in our movie?

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.870
Shall we cast Dulquer Salmaan?

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.410
We can discuss this also later.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.370
Eat your Idli.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080
Georgekutty...

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.870
What I told you earlier...
You should take it seriously.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.580
What?

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.250
About Anju's marriage.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.040
Why do you feel so.
all of a sudden?

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.750
Do you have any idea what
people are talking about us?

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.040
I don't know.
Do you know it?

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:56.870
I know.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.250
Sir...

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.160
What's the status of
Georgekutty's case?

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.160
Whatever said and done.
Georgekutty is really smart.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200
It has been 6 years.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.370
Police haven't found
even a clue yet.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.370
Right. Sir?

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.370
Sir. have you dropped the case or...

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.000
... is the investigation
still going on?

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.750
Is it because that boy's
body hasn't been found yet?

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.790
You won't get sleep without
knowing that or what?

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.330
- That irked him.
- Raghuetta. one tea please.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.330
What's wrong with you guys?

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.450
Don't mess with policemen
and earn their enmity.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.040
This is fun. Ikka.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.450
- Right?
- We're all Georgekutty's fans.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.200
He is our star. right?

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.620
What's the point
talking to these guys?

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.250
Well. they are still
investigating the case.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.620
Last week I had met Monichan.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.620
Which Monichan?

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.080
The guy who used to work at
Georgekutty's cable TV office.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.950
- The guy who fought with him and left?
- Yes.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:02.450
Our new Circle Inspector
had gone to his house.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.620
And he enquired many details
about Georgekutty to him.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.660
What details?

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:08.790
I don't know any more details.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.330
But the investigation
is still going on.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.410
What Sohan Chettan
said is correct.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.870
5-6 months back. police was investigating
whether someone had seen Georgekutty

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.370
... in a suspicious
circumstance during the night.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.080
But so many people would
have seen him like that.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.620
He used to do his cable TV
repairs during the night. right?

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.950
But the police
can't touch him now.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.700
He's a big businessman now. right?

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
That's not the case.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.000
Georgekutty is innocent.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.370
That's why the cops are
unable to do anything.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.540
Innocent. it seems.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.080
It was him who killed that boy.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.500
- I am sure.
- That's what everyone is saying.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.330
- Ikka..
- But what can they do without evidence?

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.000
Jose?
When did you reach?

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.580
Is your jail term over or
are you out on parole?

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.830
My jail term is over. I got a
reduction. I'm coming from there.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.290
- Shall I get you tea?
- Yes.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.620
Raghu!

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.660
One glass of tea!

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.910
There was a news that they
will give a handsome reward..

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.500
... for those who would help
them find evidence in that case.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.160
Who will give it?
That boy's family?

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.250
Must be the Government.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.830
What's the matter. Ikka?

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:02.830
Well. that...

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.080
- Hey! An auto rickshaw!
- It's an accident!

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.080
- Come fast.
- Is it from this stand?

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.500
Can't you look
where you're going?

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.160
- Help them up. quickly.
- Come on.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.580
Help him up.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.750
- Don't crowd around. Move.
- It's Saji.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.790
Help him up.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.540
There are two people
at the back too.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.660
Take them out carefully.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.370
Move away. please.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.000
Careful!
Lift it up!

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.250
Are you leaving. Dad?

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.370
I wanted to ask you something.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.080
Georgekutty... you forgot your phone.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.450
You go inside. Mom.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.160
It won't be right
if you're here.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.000
I need to know what won't be
right if your mom is here.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:47.910
Let Mom sit there.
Ask me. dear.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
I'm not asking.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.120
- What is it. dear?
- Ask him. Anu.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.410
No. Mom will ruin it.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.410
Then it must be
something crooked.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.000
Ask me. dear.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.160
I'm in a hurry.
I'm leaving.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:01.950
What's the matter. dear?

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.370
Ask him. Anu.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.580
Even if you ask Dad.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.410
he won't take a decision
without asking Mom.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.450
Hey!

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.000
Shall I go for a sleepover
with all my friends next week?

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:18.370
What's that?

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.830
She means. can she go stay
over at a friend's place?

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.580
I told you that it would
be something crooked.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.330
No need to go for sleep...

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.580
Don't go for that anywhere!

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.370
I won't be alone.
There will be many other friends too.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.910
[Police Siren]

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.870
Whose...

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.200
Whose house are you going to?

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.910
Reshma's house.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.870
- Where is her house?
- At Koothattukulam.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.540
What does her father do?

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.870
He's a big contractor.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.450
How many of you are going?

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.910
Around 7-8 of us.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.040
Why are you enquiring all that?

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.250
Are you going to send her?

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.540
What will all of you do over there?

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.620
We will play games...

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.700
Some of us will cook...

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.080
Basically. we want to chill out.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.790
That means. to have some fun.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.450
What about that girl's parents?

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.700
They will be at home.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.540
My friends meet up at different
houses like this often.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.120
Does that girl have brothers?

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200
What if she does?

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.370
How old would they be?

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.950
Dad. please.
Just this one time.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.370
I'll never ask this again.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.500
Do one thing. dear.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.500
Ask them to come here this time.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.660
How's my idea?

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.330
What happened?

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.080
It's not like you think. Dad.

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.790
If they come here. we'll have
to spend quite a lot of money.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.410
What did you think about me?

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.200
I'm a theatre owner and
producer now. right?

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.410
The theatre is fully on loan!

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.870
I can't cook for all of them!

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.620
Didn't she say that
they will cook?

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.290
Why are you worrying about it?

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.790
You'll get one day of rest.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.410
Did you see the
state of our house?

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.160
They are from rich families.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.410
How will all of them
sit in this house?

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.200
And our kitchen is
really modern. right?

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.540
- How many times have I told you
to renovate this house? - Hey!

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.330
Where are you taking this to?

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.540
No. Dad.
Mom has a point.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:16.950
They are from rich families. right?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.750
We shouldn't have such an
inferiority complex. dear.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.910
True friends are those who love us
even after realizing our limitations.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.910
They don't have any
such problems. Dad.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.370
They've asked me several times
whether they could come here.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.410
It was me who...

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.040
Come here.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.000
She should have
born as a boy.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.250
- This mom!!
- Hey!

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.870
You bring them here.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.500
Don't worry about the expense.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.370
It will be a change
for your sister.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.500
How's that?

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.540
Okay?

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:48.950
Hi.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.540
Why are you here?

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.500
Me and my son don't
need you anymore.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.580
Mary. I...

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.870
You got drunk and
killed my brother...

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.450
... and now you want
to live with me again?

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.200
You'll be cursed. you scoundrel!

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.910
I didn't do it deliberately. Mary.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.700
It was a mistake.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.790
It was me who made a mistake.
not you.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:09.910
Get out. you dog!

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.700
Don't ever come here again.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.330
How dare you!

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.410
Oh Jesus!

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.620
Don't worry. Jose.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.870
Everything will be all right.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.040
What you need now is a job.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.250
What job can I get in this town?

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:33.370
That's also true.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.120
There's no point doing
agriculture here.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.700
Why don't you try
outside our town. Jose?

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.450
Staying away from
here now is like...

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.250
If I have to win my family back.
I should be here. right?

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.790
Georgekutty who runs a
cable TV network here.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.830
has started a movie theatre.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.750
I don't think there are
vacancies over there too.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.120
Yet. I'll try asking him.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.750
Otherwise. why don't
you start some business?

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.700
I would need a lot of
money for that. Ikka.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.410
To be frank. I have 10 cents of
land in my name. which I can sell.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.000
But nobody is quoting a good price.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.830
Ikka. is Raghuvettan here?
One tea. please.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.450
- Raghu. one tea.
- Okay.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.200
Look.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.790
He is a broker.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.410
He's not originally
from this town.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:16.160
Try talking to him.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.450
What if he has some
good clients in hand?

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.370
Circle Inspector Philip Mathew!

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:34.910
What's her name?

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.620
Let me note it down.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:41.330
Husband's name?

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.250
Address?

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.080
That's okay.
I'll find out.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.540
Will you supply
Marijuana to school kids?

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.410
- No. Sir. I didn't do it.
- Who all were with you?

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.580
- No one was with me. Sir.
- I saw many people running away.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.410
- No. Sir.
- Playing tricks with me?

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:57.410
No. Sir.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.040
- No. Sir. It's not me.
- Not you?

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.580
Antony...

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.620
- Yes. Sir.
- Who is he?

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.200
He's part of the gang which supplies
marijuana to school kids. Sir.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.410
All the others got away.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.660
We could catch only him.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.000
Antony. you should enquire
about these two people.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.450
- Saritha. Sabu.
- Sir.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.620
Saritha works as a sweeper
at the civil station.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.700
Her husband. Sabu Augustine.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.620
He's a car broker or
something like that.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.450
Find out where their house is.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.660
This is behind our
Georgekutty's house. Sir.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Which Georgekutty?

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.120
- From that Varun case?
- Yes. Sir.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.040
Enquire about them and ask
them to come and meet me.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080
Okay. Sir.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.200
Is this size fine. Mom?

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.450
Yes. that's fine.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.160
But we need some more beans.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:43.290
Go bring it.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:51.080
Our younger offspring
has sent a huge list.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.120
What list?

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.500
A list of things to
buy for Saturday.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.660
Very nice!

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.200
You brought it upon
yourself. right?

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.200
Now suffer!

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.950
- Dad!
- Huh?

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:04.830
What?

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:06.250
Dad...

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:08.160
2 policemen are coming
through our field.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.500
Why are you getting
scared for that?

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:12.750
You sit here.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.370
Sit here!

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.410
I've told you earlier as well.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.660
Unnecessary tension
will lead us to danger.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.250
Why are they coming
through our field?

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:28.790
I don't know.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.120
Is that where you...

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.950
Don't be scared.

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.580
They will ring the bell now.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.750
You should go and
open the door then.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.910
Me?

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:46.910
[Doorbell rings]

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.500
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.750
Then obey what I say.
Go.

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:55.870
Just go.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.120
Go!

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.330
Georgekutty...

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.540
Dad...

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.370
They have come looking for mom.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.660
Okay.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.700
You can go inside.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.410
We got a call from the
Sub-Collector's office in the morning.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.620
to talk about Saritha who
works there on daily wages.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.910
and her husband who beats her
up after getting drunk.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.450
We've been asked to
enquire about it.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.160
We have come as part
of that enquiry.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.750
When I asked her.
she said...

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.410
... that you and your wife
are aware of all this.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.870
And she told me something
secretly. as well.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.200
You were the one who asked
her to inform the police.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.370
Is that true?

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.870
It's true. Sir.
I told her.

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.000
We can't trust anyone these days.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:13.660
Many are misusing the protection
provided by women's laws.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.790
So we just came to ask
around and see if it is true.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.790
Is she saying the truth?

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620
Yes. Sir.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.000
Is it something she told you.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.410
or have you seen it happening?

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.700
I have seen it happening.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.870
Hey! Call her.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.580
He doesn't know that you
had asked her to do this.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.290
It's fine for me even
if he knows it. Sir.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.290
But he needn't know it.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.330
That would be better for her.
Understood?

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.330
Hey! I will forget all
that happened until now.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:45.910
If I hear that
you've hurt her again.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.330
you'll see my true colours.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:48.700
No. Sir.
I won't do it again.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:49.790
Good for you then.

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.700
Both of you should come to the station
and meet CI Sir tomorrow morning.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:53.750
Okay Sir.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.200
You may go.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:57.950
If he hurts you again.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.950
you know the police
station's number. right?

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.410
Call us directly.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.080
You needn't make calls through
the Sub-Collector's office.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200
Understood?

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.290
Yes. Sir.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.200
Okay then.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200
Bye. Georgekutty.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.290
See you!

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.120
After killing my son.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:34.870
you're sleeping peacefully?

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.660
Where is my son?

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.660
How did you kill him?

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.040
I'm asking you!
Tell me!

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.250
Don't think you can escape!

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.410
I'll leave only after
knowing the truth.

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.330
[Bell ringing]

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.080
Dear...

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200
Anu...

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.370
Dear...

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.410
It's Mom.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.950
Dear...

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.870
- It was just a dream.
- Nothing to worry.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.370
Forget it.
It's nothing.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.000
Dad and Mom are here. right?

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.040
It was just a dream.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:17.290
Don't be scared.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:18.500
Don't be scared.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.580
There's nothing to worry.
She has improved a lot.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.790
The frequency has
decreased considerably.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.580
Will you wait outside. dear?

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.580
What's the reason for this seizure?

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.410
Maybe because the
police came home.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.750
That must have triggered it.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.750
Didn't I tell you not to send her?

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.290
That's not a problem.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.950
It's better that Anju gets
accustomed to such situations.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.080
How long can we hide
her from all this?

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.120
Now....

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:55.250
what about counselling?

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.700
Let's wait and see.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.950
However much we say that we've
overcome the fear in our minds.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.580
it keeps getting
triggered like this often.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.330
It won't go away one fine day.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.330
It will take time.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.000
Something that both of you should
be careful about is that...

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.660
... since Anju has a history
of having seizures.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.290
... this shouldn't lead to another
seizure. at any cost.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.410
What's your opinion about
getting her married. Doctor?

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.000
It might do good for her.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.290
Or it might not do
any good for her.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.700
That depends on
the circumstances.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.620
We're making her sleep
alone even now.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.370
That's good.
I had told you. right?

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.910
Let her handle herself.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:34.250
Only Anju can
overcome her problems.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.040
We just have to create an
atmosphere for that. That's all.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.700
We can't blame her. Jose.

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.370
You killed her brother. right?

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.120
Did I do it to kill him. Mom?

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:50.660
What's the point in saying that?

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.750
You have orphaned two families.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.000
Your greed for money is
the reason for all this.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.040
Don't say that. Mom.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.450
I didn't ask for it.

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.330
It was them who promised me.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.700
And when I was in need of money.
they took me for a ride.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.580
What's the point in saying that now?

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.910
A life was lost!

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.410
She's not angry with you. Mom.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:13.250
You should talk to her.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.830
She lets me inside her house.
because she's good at heart.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.080
But do you think she'll let you
inside the house. if I tell her?

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.450
In these 6 years. when
her family had abandoned her.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.910
it was you who
helped her. right?

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.620
She will listen to you. Mom.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.200
What about my son?
Don't I have rights over him?

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.040
Don't talk too much
about your rights now.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.450
Find a source of income
for yourself first.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.370
This is not your house now.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:37.580
This is your brother's house.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.160
I myself am a burden here.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.330
You should understand that.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:42.250
I'll go and meet Mary.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.080
Don't expect a sudden
change from her.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.450
Let's see.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.540
- Why are you late?
- What do I say?

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.910
Ask her directly. She takes
too much time to get ready!

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.870
- Yeah. right! He's kidding.
- Where's Thomas?

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:13.120
He'll come now.

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.660
- Roy! How are you?
- Nice Sari! Where did you buy it from?

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.120
- Fine.
- From a friend's boutique.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.660
- Hi Uncle.
- Please come inside.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.830
- Isn't Kevin here. Aunty?
- He has gone outside.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:22.410
He'll be back soon.
Come.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.790
- How are you doing?
- Great. Uncle.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:25.200
Rita. I don't see
anything on the table!

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:26.580
I'm really hungry.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.950
Get us some snacks.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.250
I'll bring it right away.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.660
His trip has been postponed.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.750
What happened?

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.620
Two of my friends can't
make it this week.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.080
So we pushed it to
the end of this month.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.000
- Didn't get anything new. right?
- No. Uncle.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.200
Even if that girl knows something.
would she say it?

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.500
The one who committed the
crime would never say it.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.200
Because who will be in trouble
because of that? That person indeed.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.410
But that's not the case with
people who know about it.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:51.660
They can make mistakes.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.120
As years pass.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.620
the possibility of getting it
from them. keeps increasing.

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:56.790
What's the reason?

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.540
- Their fear..
- .. would reduce.

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.120
- Confidence...?
- ...would increase!

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160
It will increase.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.080
This would be their
last year together.

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.120
Just try. son.
That's all.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.120
I just said it when I heard that
you're studying with that girl.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.290
Now don't lose focus on your
studies because of this.

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.330
No. Uncle.

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.540
He's a big fan of crime thrillers.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.000
That's his spirit as well.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.660
His dream is to become a
police officer like you.

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:20.830
Is it?

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:21.910
Yes.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.660
Meena is alone there. right?

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.870
That's why Rajesh
asked me to go there.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:27.450
When are you leaving. Mom?

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.120
As soon as I get the Visa.

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.750
Rajesh said that I would get
the Visa within one week.

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:34.290
- When is her due date?
- 25th of next month.

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:38.450
So I can see you again only
after six months. right?

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.580
Rani...

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:40.910
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.160
- I'll call you in the evening. Mom.
- Okay. dear.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.450
Mom is going to Qatar.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.620
Rajesh's wife Neena's
due date is next month.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.410
She will come back
only after six months.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.250
That's good.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.750
She will have a change from
the grief of Dad's death.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.830
She doesn't listen when
we ask her to come here.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:59.620
Unnecessary false pride.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.540
What happened?

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:06.200
I don't know.
I don't feel so good.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.290
I feel that I might
end up being orphaned.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:09.330
There you go again.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.910
So me and children
are no one to you?

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:14.540
I am leaving.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.250
Unnecessary negative thoughts!

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.870
'Same old dawn'

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:45.700
'Same old darkness'

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:51.620
'The same sunlight'

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:56.870
'The same shadows'

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:07.370
'An unknown future awaits..'

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:17.950
'And the life goes on...

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:22.950
.... and on'

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:47.120
'Are the nightingales still singing?'

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:57.250
'Will the dark memories
vanish like a rain drying up?'

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:08.330
'Or have our silences become
too heavy with burden?'

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:18.290
'The future is waiting..'

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:28.330
'This life endlessly moves on..

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:35.250
... and on'

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.250
I think my days are numbered now.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.540
Don't talk like that. Pathrose Chetta.

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.200
I am happy anyway.

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.040
I could see you all. right?

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.580
My family survived only
because of your father.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.620
My daughter had come recently.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.250
She had asked me to convey
her regards to you. Sir.

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.290
That's my daughter.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.790
It was Sir who educated
her and got her married.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:35.410
'Will the footprints of this
journey ever be erased?'

00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:45.910
'Will we drown in the
depth of nightmares?'

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:56.750
'Have we turned into mere
disguises and fakes?'

00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:06.580
'The future awaits...'

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:16.950
'This life endlessly moves on...

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:22.500
... and on....

00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:28.450
... and on'

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.580
Anu!

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.500
What were you talking?

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:15.750
Nothing.

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:16.870
Lying to me?

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.250
Don't stare at me.

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.410
I saw everything.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.830
I saw you showing him the
woodshed and the window.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.330
- What did you tell that boy?
- We weren't talking about that.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.950
Then what did you talk?
Tell me.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.330
Are you trying to get
your sister killed?

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:30.910
What happened?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.660
Are you crying on
such a nice day?

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.700
What happened?

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.870
We'll talk about it later.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.870
Go inside.
Be with them.

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:42.790
Dear...

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:43.830
Wash your face and go!

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:47.870
What's the matter?

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:53.870
Hey! Drop me home on the way.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.750
Okay. Text me once you reach.
- Yeah. sure.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.160
Bye. Anu.
- Bye. Uncle.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.040
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.450
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.700
- Okay.
- See you.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.620
Come. Anu.

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.000
- I'm going to bed. I'm really tired.
- Georgekutty...

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:18.750
What is it?

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.830
Shouldn't we know
what all she told him?

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:22.120
No.
What can she say?

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:25.120
We will not discuss about this.

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:26.750
Nothing has happened so far. right?

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.330
Nothing will happen hereafter too.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
It's Sunday. right?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.330
Aren't you going to Church?

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:32.450
Aren't you coming?

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.200
I have to go to Ernakulam.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080
Saritha...

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:04.790
Saritha!

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.450
How come you're going for
the Noon Mass today?

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:20.080
I waited for a long
time in the morning.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.370
Anu's friends were
here yesterday. right?

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.450
They left only in the morning.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.330
- So you had a blast?
- Of course.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.080
Georgekutty has
gone to Ernakulam.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.450
- He will come back only tomorrow.
- Should I come over?

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.700
- If it's not too much trouble.
- Oh yeah! It's too much trouble!

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.330
But I'll adjust.
Right?

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.660
Sabu doesn't like
me very much. right?

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:45.870
He doesn't like me.
How will he like you then?

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.370
Don't mind all that.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.830
- Okay then.
- Bye.

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.910
I'm saying this realizing
the magnitude of his mistake.

01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:00.620
You should forgive him.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.120
You should start your life afresh.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.370
For the past 6 years.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.540
you know how me and my
son survived. right?

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.450
I lost my brother.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.000
My family abandoned me.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.750
I am living only for my son now.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.950
What was his fault. Mom?

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:28.160
You can come here
anytime you want.

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:30.580
But with him...

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.250
I can't. Mom.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.620
I can understand your grief.

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:41.660
If you believe that he
did it deliberately.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.790
I won't come here to talk
about this. ever again.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200
You need to be patient.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.620
It will take time.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.200
Chechi?

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:28.830
Aren't you sleeping?

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:33.450
What happened to you?

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.080
I had noticed in
the morning too.

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:36.450
Some kind of a change.

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:42.580
It was raining like this.
on that night too.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.790
I am scared of such nights now.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.410
Stop saying all
that and lie down.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.200
After yesterday's incident.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.200
I feel that some kind of
danger is approaching us.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.200
Georgekutty does not
understand my problem.

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.750
Georgekutty is not
ready to listen to me.

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:10.620
Georgekutty is able to take
everything very lightly.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.000
But I'm not able to do it.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:16.540
So you should let him know
about your troubles.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.620
Open up to him.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.040
He will understand.

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.830
I tried several times.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:23.790
Whenever I am about
to say something.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:26.700
he scares me saying that we
shouldn't talk about it here.

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:23.410
This is Sabu.
This is Saritha.

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:25.910
Sir... they?

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200
Shadow police.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.950
They are originally
husband and wife.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.250
- Sit down. Philip.
- Sir.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.250
- Recognized him. right?
- Yes. Sir.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:35.790
They have been staying
there for the past 2 years

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:37.500
and observing Georgekutty
and his family.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.620
We have bugged
Georgekutty's house.

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:41.290
His bedroom...

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:42.750
dining room.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:43.910
and that elder girl's room.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:44.910
- Right. Sabu?
- Yes. Sir.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.620
We have been recording
their conversations. Sir.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.250
Anything that's
beneficial for the case?

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:53.040
They never spoke about Varun
or this case in their house.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.620
The main reason for that is because
Georgekutty had forbidden them from it.

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.540
Rani Chechi was restless...

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.750
- Sorry Sir. I got used to that name...
- Go ahead.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.870
That restlessness was evident in
Rani and their elder daughter Anju.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.500
Our attempt was to create an
atmosphere for them to talk about this.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.000
And there has been a
minor breakthrough now.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.790
From here on. the three of you will
be my core team in this investigation.

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:14.790
Sir!

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.000
You will keep all
information confidential.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.750
and you will report only to me.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:20.120
- Sure. Sir.
- Now...

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.370
.. before I proceed.

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.620
there's a trajectory of
events so far in this case.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.040
I'll present it.
Listen.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200
That is...

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.370
a youngster called Varun.

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:34.250
got killed while threatening Anju by
showing her a naked video of hers.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.830
As per the younger
daughter's statement.

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:38.830
she had seen her mother and sister burying
something in a sack. during the night.

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:41.040
Georgekutty wasn't at home then.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:45.080
So it must be Georgekutty's elder
daughter or wife who had done it.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.580
but we don't have
any clarity in it.

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:49.200
Then we found out that the
body was shifted from there.

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:50.910
When was it shifted?

01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:52.290
Where was it shifted to?

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:53.580
Who shifted it?

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.830
Who all among that
family know about this?

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:59.120
These were the solid
questions before us.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.500
In this.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.330
it is now clear that...

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.160
it was Georgekutty's elder
daughter who committed the murder.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.700
Georgekutty's wife told that to Saritha.

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:11.250
I got it by chance. Sir.

01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:12.410
These are all lies.

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:14.410
Anju hasn't done anything wrong.

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:16.250
He was a pervert.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.500
That's why she...

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:21.910
Yesterday.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.120
Saritha got another
information as well.

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.330
So you should let him know
about your troubles.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.290
Open up to him.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.700
He will understand.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.410
I tried several times.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:35.500
Whenever I am about
to say something.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.370
he scares me saying that we
shouldn't talk about it here.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.660
Do you know the reason for that?

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.870
Georgekutty Chettan has a
clear idea about everything.

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:45.910
You don't have that.

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:47.700
That's why you are scared.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.290
If my guess is right.

01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:50.660
Anju also has this problem.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:51.750
Am I right?

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:53.290
Yes.

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:55.870
This is where I
can't agree with him.

01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:59.250
He doesn't allow you
both to talk about this.

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.450
If you don't talk about
this among yourselves.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.120
how would you understand things?

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:07.450
Shall I tell you something which I
understood from the public opinion?

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.290
As long as that body is not found.

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.410
police can't do anything to you.

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:15.000
Then why are you scared?

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.290
Are you scared whether Anu
told that boy where it is?

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.200
No. I'm not scared about that.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.870
Georgekutty shifted it the next day
without letting any of us know.

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:32.620
Georgekutty says that it's safer
that we don't know about it.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.000
This is our minor breakthrough.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.580
The crucial point in this
case was to find Varun's body.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.910
Police investigated
all the possibilities.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:49.250
They rummaged Georgekutty's property
and dug every suspicious place.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.040
Knowing that he renovated the
floor of his shop back then.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.200
they dug over there too
and didn't find anything.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.790
Georgekutty had a lot of
possibilities to get rid of it.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.200
For example.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.330
if he travels for 3 hours from
his house. it's a forest area.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.700
Police investigated that possibility
as well. as far as they could.

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:11.950
With the court's permission. him and his
family were summoned and questioned twice.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.040
On top of not finding anything.

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:18.160
the court warned the police not to approach
the court again. without a solid proof.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:22.370
With that. the police became hesitant to
investigate this case. fearing humiliation.

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:25.080
Because the media and the
public began celebrating it.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.500
But I...

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.290
I had been following
this case secretively.

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:33.120
I appointed Saritha and Sabu.
as part of that.

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:36.750
How far can we believe the statement that
the body was shifted on the very next day?

01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:37.870
We can believe it.

01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:38.950
Because.

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:41.160
to find whether we could
find any human body remains.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.950
we had sent the soil from that pit
for examination. on that day itself.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.790
Not even a single trace was found.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.250
If so. what's the importance of the fact
that it was shifted the next day. now?

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:50.290
That date itself!

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.540
August... 3rd.

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.250
Now listen to me carefully.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:58.290
Varun Prabhakar was killed...

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:00.160
... on August 2nd.

01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:04.330
Georgekutty and his family claim that
they went for the retreat on that day.

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:06.540
On August 2nd. at night.

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:08.160
Georgekutty's wife...

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.950
and his elder daughter.
bury Varun's body together.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.750
Georgekutty who reached
the next morning.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.080
finds Varun's car.

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:21.120
and dumps it at a quarry in
Mullasshery. past Thodupuzha.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:23.750
He returns to Thodupuzha town.

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:26.870
and collects hotel bills and
tickets from the movie theatre.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:31.040
After that. he takes the evening
KSRTC bus and gets back home.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.200
Georgekutty. who reached
home around 9 PM.

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:37.000
digs that body out from there.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.790
after his family went to sleep.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160
If so.

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:43.120
at what time did Georgekutty
dig that body out?

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:46.790
Sir. even if he sent his family to sleep
early. his neighbours have to sleep. right?

01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:47.830
Moreover.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.660
the place where they buried the body
can be seen from the main road.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040
Around...

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.540
... 12 AM.

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.620
- Okay?
- Yes.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.620
To dig that body out
and put it in the Jeep.

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.450
he would need at
least one hour. right?

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120
What's the time then?

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:03.870
1 AM.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.580
That is. August 4th.
early morning.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:08.950
1 AM.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.580
To dig a pit and bury
the body somewhere else.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.450
wouldn't he take at least
one and a half hours?

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.160
After this.

01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:20.750
Georgekutty has to reach
home at least by 4:30 AM.

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:22.660
Then...

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:24.910
if Georgekutty who left
with the body at 1 AM.

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:27.540
has to reach back
home by 4:30 AM.

01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:31.000
the time that Georgekutty took to
dispose the body and come back.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.370
that is his crime time.

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:34.500
would be three hours..
Sorry. three and a half hours.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.870
In this. he took one and a
half hours to bury the body.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:39.830
The remaining...

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:41.330
... two hours.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.540
Up and down travel.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:44.870
That means. one hour
up and one hour down.

01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:47.040
If this assumption is right.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:48.750
Georgekutty...

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.540
would have buried the body within
a 50 kilometer radius of his house.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160
What do you say?

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.500
How can we be sure that he
came back by 4:30 AM itself?

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.040
It could be 5 or 6 AM. right?

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:02.330
The next morning.

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:04.040
that is. on August 4th morning.

01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:07.330
Georgekutty and family took the
5:45 AM bus to Thodupuzha.

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:08.370
To recreate the day.

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.500
On those days. that is
on August 4th and 5th.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.950
his children didn't go to school.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.620
So if they have to
take the 5:45 AM bus.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.660
that family has to wake up
at least by 5 AM. right?

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.950
In that case. if he has
reached at that time.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.750
wouldn't they know
that he had gone out?

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:22.750
So...

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:24.950
Georgekutty should reach
back. at least by 4:30 AM.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.700
But Sir. a husband and wife would
be sleeping in the same room.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.120
If the husband
gets up and leaves.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.620
the wife would know it
at some point. right?

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.120
Sir. after that incident.

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.950
Rani was sleeping in her children's
room. for almost six months.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080
Moreover. their elder daughter Anju.

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:40.750
used to cry out of fear on many nights.
Rani has told me that.

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:45.660
Sir. I think that there won't
be a 50 kilometer radius.

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:47.290
These time spans you mentioned.

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:50.080
are what a man requires
in a normal situation.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:51.540
But at night.

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.160
in a frightened state of mind.

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:57.120
he can never do all these
things at this pace.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.200
Absolutely!

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:00.250
He might not have gone far.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.040
Maybe he left at 11 PM.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.370
and came back by 3 AM.

01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:04.450
Quite possible.

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:06.700
Sir. did we enquire about
his movements at night?

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:07.750
We did.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.450
But it didn't yield any results.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.750
We didn't have a
solid date with us.

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:14.330
Moreover. since he used to
go out for cable TV repairs.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.750
many people have seen
him during nights.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.700
Now we have a solid date.

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.200
Conduct a secret investigation
based on that date. Philip.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.200
Sir.

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.250
In the meanwhile.

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:24.790
you two push her hard.

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:25.830
- Yes. Sir.
- Yes. Sir.

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.330
Georgekutty's complete focus
is on that film production now.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.330
He has an over-confidence
that he would never get caught.

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:33.950
That's good for us.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.500
Who said it's good?

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:37.660
I don't like his acting.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.660
And the editing
wasn't up to the mark.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.620
I can direct a movie
better than this.

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.620
Hello?

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:44.910
Hello?

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.660
He hung up?

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:49.950
Talking about movies to me?

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.910
I spoke over the phone
with the guy in Dubai.

01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:55.750
He's interested to be a
partner in the production.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.450
He will be here in two months.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.410
He said we can
discuss it in person.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.750
Finally. the biggest dream of my
life is going to be a reality.

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:06.910
Rajan...

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.870
If us humans desire something deeply.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.290
if we make up our mind to do it.

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:13.790
we will be able to achieve it.

01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:15.500
I am an example for that.

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.250
But you need luck as well.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.750
Don't talk negatively.

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:20.040
This is your problem. Rajan.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.910
We should never
think negatively.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.080
We should have only
positive thoughts.

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:25.910
Then only good things
will happen to us.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:27.620
Wait and watch. Rajan!

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.700
I am going to rule Malayalam Cinema.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:35.870
- Aravindan. right?
- Yes. Sir.

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.040
- Aren't you the newspaper
agent of this area? - Yes.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.000
- For how long?
- Around 15 years.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.540
At what time do you
get the newspapers?

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.250
It reaches the town at 3 AM.

01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:45.910
My boys collect it from there.
and distribute it to the houses.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.040
I need the details of the
boys who were with you.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.120
during the month
of August in 2013.

01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:04.120
[Rajakkad
Milk Co-operative Society]

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.040
- When do you start collecting milk here?
- From 5 AM in the morning.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.620
I need a list of people
who give you milk at dawn.

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.700
Not the current list.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.750
The list from August. 2013.

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:13.790
Okay. Sir.

01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:16.790
So the people here are
co-operating well?

01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:18.370
Yes. Sir.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.580
When this incident happened.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.040
all the people were
sympathetic towards them.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.370
There was a constable
called Sahadevan.

01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:28.080
Since he beat up
Georgekutty's younger daughter.

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:30.160
the entire public became hostile.

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:32.750
Not a single person co-operated
with the investigation.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.830
The reason for this
change is jealousy. Sir.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.330
Georgekutty's growth...

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.950
No one has liked it very much.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.580
Especially their neighbours.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.410
They firmly believe that it was Georgekutty
and family who killed Varun. now.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.200
But it has been 6-7 years. Sir.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.200
Even if someone
has seen something.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.120
would they still remember it?

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080
Just give it a try.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.700
If we're lucky.

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.830
what if someone remembers
seeing something?

01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:59.790
Jose...

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.500
You were supposed to meet your friend
in Coimbatore for a job. right?

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.040
He has gone to Chennai.
He will call me when he gets back.

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:08.910
Start providing for her
and son. at the earliest.

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:11.120
Everything will be
solved on its own then.

01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:18.250
Which is this
Kanjirathingal house?

01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:20.290
There are many people who are
from Kanjirathingal family here.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.500
Purushan. who used to distribute
newspapers. 5-6 years back?

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.450
He's bedridden now after an accident.

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.700
Oh! Purushan's house.

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.000
It's a little ahead from here.

01:17:28.450 --> 01:17:30.040
One. two...

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:31.910
The fourth house on
the left from here.

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:32.910
No. Sir.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.450
I spoke to newspaper agents
and milk sellers.

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.080
No one remembers seeing him.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.910
It has been 6 years. right?

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.790
Most people are not
able to remember it.

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.250
Then... on August 3rd.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.910
there was an annual day celebration
of a club near Georgekutty's house.

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:49.830
A drama was performed
that night. in that club.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.870
By the time it got over.
it was around 12 AM.

01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:55.160
From Georgekutty's
neighbourhood.

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:58.250
and from places where Georgekutty
could have gone at night.

01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:00.000
around...

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.660
60 people had gone
to watch this drama.

01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:06.410
We're meeting each one of
them and enquiring. Sir.

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:27.870
- Ramesh?
- Yes. Sir.

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.830
We're coming from your
friend Reji's house.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.660
On August 3rd. 2013.

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:36.660
did you go for the annual day
celebration of Reji's Companion Club?

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:39.330
Your son was also with you then.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.870
While watching the
drama that day.

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.700
Reji's brother came
and took him along.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.160
That must be true. but I don't
remember the date correctly.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.540
Reji said it was on August 3rd.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.580
Then it must be true.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.080
When did the drama
get over that day?

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.830
After 12 AM. I guess.

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.000
How did you come back home?

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:56.120
By foot or by car?

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.200
We came by foot.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:00.200
While coming back. did you see
Georgekutty going anywhere with his Jeep?

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:03.000
- By Georgekutty. you mean...?
- Yes.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.160
- Is it something related to the case?
- Yes.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.660
Did you see him that day?

01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:08.750
While coming back...

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:09.790
No. Sir.
I didn't see him.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.830
Didn't Rijo have an
asthma attack that day?

01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:16.200
Yes. Around 4 AM.
early in the morning.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.250
That's right. Sir.

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.540
Around 4 AM in the morning.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.120
I saw Georgekutty's Jeep
going back inside his compound.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:28.330
Didn't I tell you not to take
him out during the night?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.250
I think it's because
of the cold weather.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.200
The inhaler won't
be enough for this.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.750
Call some doctor.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.870
Why didn't you say this when the
police investigated this earlier?

01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:01.580
Police never asked me about this.

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.120
And I work in a bank.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.790
I was posted in
Kozhikode back then.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.540
Since my family is here.
I used to come only on weekends.

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:11.500
Where does that road go?

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.330
That's a shortcut to the junction where
Georgekutty's cable TV office is situated.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.750
It's been only 3 years
since that road was tarred.

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:19.830
Back then. the condition
of that road was very poor.

01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:22.040
What all are there
on that roadside?

01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:24.290
There's a Church called
St. Joseph's Church.

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:26.700
Then there are many rubber
plantations of different sizes.

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:43.040
Would it be in those
rubber plantations?

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.700
I thought about that
possibility as well.

01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:47.540
But the rubber trees there
are at least 15 years old.

01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:50.200
So. six years back.

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:51.830
those trees were being
tapped regularly.

01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:54.160
If someone has made a
new pit in such a place.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:56.540
the tapping workers
would notice it. right?

01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.540
See. he didn't get
time to plan it out.

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:02.250
So he would have buried it
only in a familiar location.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.330
Sir. I have a doubt.

01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:06.370
- Saritha..
- Sir.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:10.290
Didn't you understand from that
Rani's conversations that..

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.910
Georgekutty is confident that
the police would never find it?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Yes. Sir.

01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:18.500
So. he would have buried it at a place
where no one would expect it to be.

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:19.950
Like?

01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:22.000
St. Joseph's Church cemetery.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.870
It's really close to
Georgekutty's house.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.500
A place where no one
goes during nights.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.750
Sir. if this is true.

01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:33.250
we will be in a fix.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.370
There's one way to
find out if it's true.

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.620
The Church wasn't very
crowded today. right?

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:50.660
Yes.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.290
Chechi. they are not
coming in search of you.

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:03.500
Don't get so scared.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.620
Why are you so afraid of them?

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.580
Raghu Chetta.. one tea. please.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.500
I don't see you around
these days. Jose.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.080
I don't get out
of my house much.

01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:26.830
I don't have to see or hear people's
taunting looks and words. right?

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:28.540
That's all your imagination.

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:30.700
You made a mistake.

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:31.830
That's over.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.160
You still have a life ahead of you.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.160
I'm not going to commit
suicide out of depression.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:38.290
I need to make some money
and win back my family.

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.120
That won't be possible
if I stay here.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:42.500
Like you said. I need to
find a job in some other town.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.000
Very good decision.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.410
- See you. Ikka.
- Okay.

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:49.080
How are you doing.
Georgekutty Chetta?

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:51.160
You've started a movie theatre. right?

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.620
Is your case over?

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.040
That Sahadevan was trying
to trap you. right?

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.450
- Hey..
- Georgekutty Chetta...

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.620
- Shall I get you some tea?
- Yes.

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.250
- Who's that. Ikka?
- Jose.

01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:09.080
It was about his job. that I
spoke to you the other day.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.250
The late George. who used
to work at the toddy shop?

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:13.620
His elder son.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.700
- Is he settled outside?
- No.

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:16.750
He was inside.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.290
Inside the jail.

01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.330
No wonder!

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.620
He's asking me if I have
started a movie theatre.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200
Rani Chechi...

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Yes. Saritha.

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:37.290
What happened. Saritha?

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.080
Did Sabu hurt you again?

01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:40.290
It's not that.

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:43.620
That's enough. dear.
Go inside.

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:50.750
What is it?

01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:56.250
I think Georgekutty Chettan buried
that boy's body in the cemetery.

01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.000
We saw the police there
in the morning. right?

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.830
They had come to
search the cemetery.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.330
The Priest didn't allow it.

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:04.000
He sent them back.
asking for a court order.

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.250
It was Shanthi who
told me about it.

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:08.370
Word is spreading all over town.

01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:11.540
Don't get worried. Chechi.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.950
Inform Georgekutty
Chettan immediately.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.370
Don't tell him over the phone.
Call him here and tell him.

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:20.790
You should clean it like
this after each show.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.700
Start the next show
only after that.

01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:24.290
[Phone ringing]
- When people come in.

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.040
the place should be clean.

01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.790
- Hello?
- Georgekutty...

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:30.250
You must come home immediately.

01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:31.580
I'll come after
the evening show.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620
No. Georgekutty.

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:33.750
You must come now.

01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:34.870
It's really urgent.

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:35.950
Tell me the matter. Rani.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.330
I can't tell you over the phone.

01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:38.950
Come fast.
Please. Georgekutty.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.950
- Please.
- Hello? Rani?

01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:55.160
Hasn't he reached yet?

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.620
No.

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.040
What if he doesn't come?

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:03.830
Will we be in trouble?

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:07.160
What if she didn't believe
what you told her?

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.000
Yeah. right.
He will come at least at night.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040
They will talk then.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120
Look.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.160
He's here.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.580
Come. come.

01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:33.410
What is it?

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:34.450
Come.

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:35.790
What's the problem. dear?

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.120
- What problem?
- Go inside. dear.

01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:39.410
What is it. Mom?

01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:41.580
If you're supposed to know.
we'll tell you. Just go.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.620
Come. Georgekutty.

01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:44.450
Come.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.750
Police are going to search
the tombs in our cemetery.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.500
Who told you that?

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.830
Saritha.

01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:58.750
Shanthi told Saritha about it.

01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:00.870
Word is spreading in
the neighbourhood about it.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.950
While coming back after
the morning Mass.

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:05.660
I had seen a Police Jeep
coming to the Church.

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.790
Did you shift it there?

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:09.040
What all are you saying?

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.370
Is this why you created
all this ruckus?

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.540
- Aren't you feeling scared?
- No.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:16.790
So it's not there?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.950
I've told you not to talk
about it in this house.

01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:20.950
We need to talk.

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:23.750
I can't be tensed
all the time like this.

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:25.580
When I didn't say
anything over the phone.

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:28.290
weren't you tensed
until this moment?

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:31.660
That has been my condition
for the past 6 years.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.750
Every time I hear that the police
has gone somewhere for a search.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.660
I get shocked sitting here.

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:41.750
I swear on my children!
It's not over there.

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:49.290
I know that you are doing
all this for our safety.

01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:53.450
But I'm unable to live in tension.
without knowing anything. Georgekutty.

01:26:54.370 --> 01:26:57.160
At least for my peace of mind.
can you please tell me?

01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:01.700
Do you believe that I'm foolish
enough to tell this to someone else?

01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:08.660
I was thinking that the
police had dropped this case.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.410
But if they are still investigating it...

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.700
Rani...

01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:18.500
Every time a new C.I. takes charge.
they will investigate it once.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.700
Their investigation will
continue until we die.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.040
When you speak openly like this.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.790
I feel so relieved.

01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:33.290
Why aren't you telling me where
you have buried it. Georgekutty?

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.830
Don't you trust me?

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.370
If you don't trust me.

01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:42.450
you needn't tell me.

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:48.450
Rani...

01:27:58.290 --> 01:27:59.290
Until this moment.

01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:01.950
I have never done anything.

01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:05.000
which my mind has said no to.

01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:13.910
So I won't say this to you.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.870
No one is going to find it.

01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.540
Trust me!

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.580
Raghu. one tea please.

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.700
- A strong one.
- Okay.

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:53.910
- Soman...
- Raghu Chetta...

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:55.160
Tea for two more people.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.080
Hi Soman.

01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:00.830
- I had come to your house yesterday.
looking for you. - When?

01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:02.750
Around 2 PM.

01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:04.330
I was at the Church then.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.660
Why? Have you converted?

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.620
[Jose] When is the bus to Thodupuzha?
[Sulaiman] Where are you going?

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.040
[Jose] I'm going to Coimbatore.
I told you about a job. right?

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.330
Police is digging up the Church cemetery.
- Why?

01:29:12.370 --> 01:29:14.080
For Georgekutty's case.

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.200
- Have they found it?
- Yeah. That's what I heard.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.290
Huh? At the Church cemetery?

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:21.080
- That's awesome.
- What's the point?

01:29:21.370 --> 01:29:24.250
The Priest sent the cops back since
they didn't have a court order.

01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:25.830
What's wrong with him?

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.580
Why should he mess
with the police?

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:30.040
They will be back in two
days with the court order.

01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:32.040
- Yes.
- What all are happening here!

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.290
Ikka. your friend will go
to jail this time for sure.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.830
I've heard this so many times.

01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:39.830
I hear it every year...

01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:43.200
.. that they are digging at some place or
the other and will arrest him immediately.

01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:45.080
You're the only one in this town

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.290
who believes that Georgekutty
is innocent. Ikka.

01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:48.330
I also heard so.

01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:49.910
That Sahadevan tried to trap him.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040
That makes it two of you.

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:54.200
Josetta. even we thought
so in the beginning.

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:57.040
Georgekutty deceived
everyone intelligently.

01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:58.790
Just think about one thing.

01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:02.790
That younger girl told the police that
she saw them burying something at night.

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.450
Police went and dug up that place.
on that basis.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:07.660
But what did they get?
A calf.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.410
Will any of us bury
a calf at midnight?

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.040
That too. when it's
raining heavily?

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.790
You're talking as if you were
with them when they buried it.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.700
- Ikka. the cops told me this.
- Yeah. right!

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:20.120
As if everything the
cops say are true!

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:21.910
I don't know anything in detail.

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:24.660
I've only heard about this from
friends who visited me in jail.

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:27.370
Anyway. I think Georgekutty
will be caught this time.

01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:30.620
The cops have been searching rigorously
all over town. for the past few days.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.620
Yes.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.410
What's the point in telling him?

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:35.700
Ikka. it's not a joke.

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:39.330
They were enquiring whether someone
had seen Georgekutty going in his Jeep.

01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:42.120
on August 3rd night
or August 4th morning.

01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:44.370
[Jose] Is it the bus. Ikka?
[Sulaiman] I think so.

01:30:44.370 --> 01:30:46.540
They're giving a reward for
those who give information.

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.540
I heard that the reward
is around 25 Lakhs.

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.620
- Don't bluff. man!
- No. brother. It's true.

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:15.540
They were enquiring whether someone
had seen Georgekutty going in his Jeep.

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.830
on August 3rd night
or August 4th morning.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.250
Georgekutty deceived
everyone intelligently.

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.620
I heard there's a
handsome reward.

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.290
for those who give information.

01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:25.660
I heard that the reward
is around 25 Lakhs.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.830
When he's saying
it so confidently...

01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:32.620
No. Sir.
It wouldn't be there.

01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:36.040
Anyway. that cemetery should
be under our observation.

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:38.870
- Especially during the nights.
- Sir.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.080
Since it's him. we can't
predict what he would do.

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:45.290
Sir. can't we do anything with the
audio recordings which we have with us?

01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:48.370
There's no reference to that boy's
name or even to a dead body. in it.

01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:49.450
It won't stand legally.

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.450
Moreover. when it comes
to audio recordings...

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.540
They have just the value of
secondary evidence in court.

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:58.540
Shall we concentrate on
Georgekutty's junction?

01:31:58.660 --> 01:31:59.660
Yes. Sir.

01:31:59.910 --> 01:32:01.580
What all possibilities
do we have there?

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.330
Sir. it's a call from the station.

01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:04.620
I think it's an emergency.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:05.870
- They have been calling several times.
- Take it.

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:08.410
Do you know the people there?

01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:09.450
Yes. Sir.

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.700
What is it. man?

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.200
Don't you know that I'm in a
meeting at the I.G.'s office?

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120
Who's that?

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.370
What's his name?

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.410
How far is that
junction from his house?

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:20.290
Sit.

01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:22.700
If we take the main road.
it's around 12 kilometres. Sir.

01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:23.950
There's a shortcut as well.

01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:25.910
That would be around
8 or 9 kilometres.

01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:27.580
Are there any deviations
from that shortcut?

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.620
Sir...

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:29.950
Someone has come to our station.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.290
claiming that he knows where
Georgekutty buried the body.

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:33.910
- Where is it?
- He didn't say that.

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:37.040
He's waiting at the station. saying that
he would speak only to higher officials.

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.040
Can we believe him?

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.830
So many people have
come like this. right?

01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:41.370
Should we let him go without
listening to him. Sir?

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:42.410
Of course not.

01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:45.080
Ask them to bring him here.

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.790
I'll go to Ernakulam after
dropping her at the college.

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:48.830
Will you come back today?

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:49.950
I might.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.040
I'll call you.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.000
- Is it for the movie. Dad?
- Yeah.

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:55.370
- Dad! Is it for the movie?
- Yes.

01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:57.450
- Here's your bag.
- Will it start anytime soon?

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.910
Everything takes its
own sweet time. my dear!

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:03.910
What's your name?

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.040
Jose.

01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:07.450
Where did you see
Georgekutty at?

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.370
I'll tell you. Sir.
What will you give me?

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.870
What's your intention?

01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:13.700
I need some money. Sir.

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:15.290
- How much?
- Half a Million.

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:18.080
Didn't I tell you that he's a fraud?
Send him away.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.950
At 3:30 AM on August 4th.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.790
I saw Georgekutty leaving from
a place with a shovel in hand.

01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:24.120
with my own eyes. Sir.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.660
Police arrested me within
half an hour after that.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.410
I fought with my
brother-in-law at 12:30 AM.

01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:38.580
I hit him with an iron rod which I
found there. He died on the spot.

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:41.160
I got scared and ran away.
That's when I saw this.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.160
I am not a fraud. Sir.

01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:46.450
Had he come on his bicycle?

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.540
No. in his Jeep.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.410
The Jeep was parked on the road.

01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:52.910
I saw it and got scared thinking
that it was a Police Jeep.

01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.080
I won't say anything more. Sir.

01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:57.580
I need a confirmation
about the cash.

01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.700
Okay.

01:33:58.790 --> 01:34:00.250
We'll give you 10.000 Rupees.

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.540
That's not enough.

01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.910
Please don't mind. Sir.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.200
I have to rebuild
my shattered family.

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:07.450
For that. I need half a Million.

01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:10.290
Let me see if I can make you
say it without paying you.

01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:11.910
You can do whatever you want. Sir.

01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:13.790
Police brutality doesn't
affect me anymore.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.620
I made a mistake. Sir.

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:17.450
I shouldn't have come to you.

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.950
If I had gone to Georgekutty.
I could have quoted any price.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.080
Philip...

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:31.700
I'll give you the money.

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.040
But in a couple of days' time.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.830
Until then. you shouldn't
step out of here.

01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:38.410
Or if you're planning
to play some trick...

01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:40.580
I'm not foolish enough to
play tricks on you. Sir.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.370
This has half a Million.

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:04.700
Now tell us.

01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.040
Where did you see Georgekutty?

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.500
At the police station
where you sit. Sir.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.540
Back then. that police station
was under construction. right?

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.540
I saw Georgekutty
coming out from there.

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.540
Shit!

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.040
- Acting smart. are you?
- No! No! No!

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:34.870
Now it makes sense.

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:38.660
Now. it makes sense.

01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:41.830
This was his confidence.

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.290
It's not because I
don't trust you. Sir.

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.410
Even if I wish to help you.

01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:48.540
I can't do it.

01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:53.160
Unbelievable!

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:55.700
Absolutely unbelievable!

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.540
Are you able to believe this?

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.040
No one can believe
this so easily. Sir.

01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:03.000
In such a situation.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.700
based on the statement
of a criminal.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.790
how can we demolish
a police station?

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.580
I cannot allow this!

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.000
What if he's trying
to fool the police?

01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:15.540
Sir. I'll compensate all the losses
that the force would face because of it.

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.750
I'll rebuild the police
station to its old form.

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:18.750
Geetha...

01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:20.540
Money is not the
only issue here.

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:23.000
Police has faced a lot of
humiliation in this case already.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.330
Now once again?

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.870
That too. by demolishing
a police station?

01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:27.870
Sir. we needn't demolish
the station fully.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.540
We just have to
dig up that floor.

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.290
I had spoken to its contractor.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.870
They started its work
from August 4th. indeed.

01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:35.580
- If so...
- Agreed.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.000
What if we don't find
it after digging?

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.750
That's what worries me.

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:43.080
If that happens.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.910
there will be many
political problems as well.

01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:45.910
We'll find it. Sir.

01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:46.950
It is there.

01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:48.290
I told you. right?

01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:50.620
There are neighbours who've seen
Georgekutty's Jeep passing by.

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.080
That's how we arrived
at that point.

01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:54.410
If we look at it that way.
this statement is trustworthy. Sir.

01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:55.830
Sir. you can trust me here.

01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:58.500
All the humiliation we
faced so far in this case.

01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:59.660
will be over with this.

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.580
Okay.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.790
- You'll take full responsibility for this.
- Of course. Sir.

01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:06.250
And one more thing.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.700
- This should be done covertly. without
the media knowing about it. - Yes. Sir.

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.950
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes. Sir.

01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:14.120
All our movements should
be very secretive.

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.950
Hire more people.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.950
and finish the work in one
or two days if you can.

01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:19.450
Now as per rules.

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:22.160
an officer in a DySP rank
should be present there.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.540
The Mahassar should be prepared by
the RDO or the Executive Magistrate.

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.500
If we get the
skeleton from there.

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.580
forensic department would
take it to their office.

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:32.330
At the earliest..
If possible. the next day itself.

01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:33.790
we should get hold
of that report.

01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:35.500
Once we get that report.

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:38.040
we have to approach the
court for the DNA test.

01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:41.540
Everything should be done in a
fast and in a legally sound manner.

01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:43.250
By the time the
media comes to know.

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:44.790
our side should be strong.

01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:47.910
Do you firmly believe
that it would be there?

01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:48.950
Yes.

01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:50.120
We won't go wrong this time.

01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:55.870
Raghu Chetta...

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.200
- What can I get to eat?
- Idli. Dosa. Puttu.

01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:59.250
What do you want?

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.830
- Idli.
- Idli?

01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:01.830
- How many?
- Two.

01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:02.870
Just two?

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.290
Ikka...

01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:07.370
Stock up extra supplies.

01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:08.950
You're going to have a
boom in your business.

01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:10.200
What is it. Sir?

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.750
The police station's
floor is damaged.

01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:14.080
So we're removing all
that and laying new tiles.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.330
It will go on for one week.

01:38:15.370 --> 01:38:16.370
When is it starting?

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.500
Today.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.080
Where's that eye-witness from?

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.120
He stays nearby.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.000
He was in jail for killing
his brother-in-law.

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.790
He's not very trustworthy.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.410
Morning!
- Good morning. Sir.

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.330
Have my assistants reached?

01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:40.700
They reached in the morning.

01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:41.870
What's the status?

01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:43.830
Work has begun.

01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:44.910
We have hired more people.

01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:46.540
to dig up all the rooms together.
- Okay.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.790
They will have to go
at least 5 feet deep.

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:52.080
Digging should start from the centre
of the room and move to the sides.

01:38:52.450 --> 01:38:53.620
In such situations.

01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:54.830
it's usually found
at the centre.

01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:55.870
Okay Sir.

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:58.450
- Any developments?
- No. Sir. They have just started.

01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:01.410
If you see anything. send
the workers out and call us.

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:02.660
- Okay?
- Sure. Sir.

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.540
Sir. this is DySP Raghuram Sir.

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:07.000
- This is the Executive Magistrate.
- Namaste. Sir.

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.080
Are you new here. Sir?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.540
I knew Deepak. who was
posted here before you.

01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.950
- Deepak got a transfer to Thrissur.
- Okay.

01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:14.370
Let's sit there. Sir.

01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:19.000
One. two. three. four...

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.410
Snake! Snake!

01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:21.750
- Dad. snake!
- That's foul play.

01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:23.330
It just hit my hand
and changed position.

01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:25.120
- This is correct.
- Yes. it's correct.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.080
You have changed a lot now. Dad.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.160
How have I changed?

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.950
Without going to the theatre.
you're always after Mom now.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.870
Aren't you bored even
after all these years. Dad?

01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:34.870
Hey!

01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:36.080
You're talking too
much these days.

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.910
- Don't fight. Play!
- Come on.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.080
Play.

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:40.910
- Am I right. Dad?
- No.

01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:43.410
Then why don't you
go to the theatre?

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.200
Since Anu has come.

01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:47.250
This is how my life would be.
hereafter.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.750
That's why I've installed
the CCTV on my phone.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.500
While playing with you here.

01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:54.500
I can run my business.
- What will you do when you do the movie?

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.000
He'll install CCTV
at the location.

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.120
No one's going to
make a movie here.

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.580
I'll be right back.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:01.700
- Play and go.
- I'll be right back.

01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:02.950
Hey!

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.500
Give it.
- One. Here you go.

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:06.250
God!

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.790
Hey! Where are you going?

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.080
To have some lime juice.

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.540
You can't go outside. We'll buy it for you.
- You'll buy it?

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:19.410
- But I want to smoke. Sir.
- We'll bring it.

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:21.120
You can go out only
in the evening.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.660
In the evening?
What about lunch then?

01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:24.830
We'll bring it here.

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.830
I want to pee. Sir.

01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:29.080
There's a space
behind the station.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120
Go there.

01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:32.450
Okay.

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160
Hold this.

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.500
We sent you to get it quickly.

01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:41.620
- Where were you?
- Keep quiet.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.410
- It was really crowded there.
- Fix the drinks.

01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:56.660
What kind of work is this?

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:58.370
They're not even
letting us step outside.

01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:00.000
I won't be coming tomorrow
if this is how it is.

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.750
Hey! We won't have
to come tomorrow.

01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:03.330
This is not for tile work.

01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:05.750
- Why should we dig 5 feet deep for that?
- Then?

01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:07.450
They are trying to
find something else.

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.870
Ravi. do you know
what's happening here?

01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:10.910
Hey!

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.290
Do you know who all are sitting
there in the shed? - No.

01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:15.000
DySP. Executive Magistrate.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.750
and the police surgeon.

01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:18.870
- Drink it fast.
- So the matter is serious.

01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:20.950
Of course.
I heard them talking.

01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:23.200
They are looking
for some dead body.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.200
- Dead body?
- Yes.

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.080
They brought us here so that
the locals won't know.

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.540
Why wouldn't they get people to
dig pits from this town otherwise?

01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:32.080
Hey! We needn't bother
about this too much.

01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:34.370
Let's do our work. get
the money and leave.

01:41:34.410 --> 01:41:35.870
It's our luck. if
we get the money.

01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.950
- Well. since they are cops...
- That's true.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.370
Will this be Georgekutty's case?

01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:44.370
But what's the point in
digging up the police station?

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.660
Bro! What if he has
buried the body here?

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:49.330
How can he bury it in
the police station?

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:50.700
What foolishness!

01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:51.910
Dude!

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.870
This police station was
under construction then.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.910
That's true. dude.

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:57.330
It was being constructed then.

01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:58.410
That's right.

01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.950
He is brilliant anyway.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.700
To bury it in a police station...

01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.750
I don't have any hope that
we will get it from here.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.910
I've gone to so many places
like this. for this case.

01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:10.910
That's how I got acquainted with Deepak.
who was here before you.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.790
This time. the I.G. is also really hopeful.

01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:16.080
- Were you involved in this case?
- Not now.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.750
During the beginning of this case.
I was the C.I. in Thodupuzha.

01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:21.580
Back then. when the police went
to his house looking for the body.

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.040
they found the body of a calf.

01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:24.370
I've heard about it.

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:26.620
When we realized that he
had shifted it from there.

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:28.080
we examined that pit again.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.080
To see if we can get that
boy's hair or something.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.250
But we didn't get anything.

01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:32.830
I was part of that investigation.

01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.950
So. can we get the DNA
from someone's hair?

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Yes.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:38.950
But we can't get it once
its root is destroyed.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.750
It takes a couple of days after the death.
for the hair to detach from the body.

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:44.450
Maybe that's why you
didn't get it then.

01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:46.790
If we find the
body from here now.

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:48.040
can we get DNA from that hair?

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.950
If there are bones.
why do we need hair?

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.870
- That's right.
- No point getting it now.

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.200
It's lunch break.

01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:54.910
We've arranged food
for all of them here.

01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:57.040
- Do you want to go out to eat. Sir?
- No.

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.410
- We can eat here. Right?
- Yes.

01:42:58.790 --> 01:43:00.200
What's happening?
Will we find it?

01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.330
[Phone ringing]

01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:16.950
Hello?

01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.330
No. I haven't left yet.
I'll leave in half an hour.

01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:21.160
Okay. I'll bring it.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.830
That's enough. dear.
Let me go to the cable TV office.

01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:49.330
Why? Isn't the CCTV working now?

01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:53.450
Okay.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:54.910
No. I didn't get any call yet.

01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.160
I'll call you if I
get any information.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.160
Sir!

01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:01.830
I'll call you later.

01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.700
They have found it.

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.540
Come.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.040
Dad!

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.370
- Shall we go for a movie tonight?
- Georgekutty Chetta!

01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:23.620
Have you buried that boy
in the police station?

01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:26.160
They are digging up the
station's floor now.

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:31.700
Go!

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.580
Georgekutty. what he said...?

01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:52.870
Don't be scared.

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.250
Nothing will happen
to the three of you.

01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:00.120
Lock the door and stay inside.

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.790
Don't open the door.
until I come back.

01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.410
What's the depth of that pit?

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:34.370
From the west side of the room.
around...

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:08.290
Georgekutty! Georgekutty!
Open up!

01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:09.750
Have you escaped?

01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:12.290
Mom!
[mob shouting]

01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:13.950
Isn't anyone home?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.200
Georgekutty!

01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:20.370
[mob continues shouting]

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:12.330
- Brother!
- What is it?

01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:14.330
I heard that the police
station here was dug up?

01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:15.450
What you heard is true.

01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:19.200
The officers took whatever they
found from there. last evening.

01:47:21.370 --> 01:47:22.580
A new breakthrough in

01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:25.700
ex-I.G. Geetha Prabhakar's son
Varun Prabhakar's disappearance.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.330
Police found body remains which are
suspected to be that of Varun Prabhakar.

01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:30.370
Dad!

01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:33.330
The body remains were found buried
at Rajakkad Police Station.

01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:34.370
What is it. dear?

01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.580
Look.

01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:39.500
Georgekutty and family who were
acquitted from this case earlier.

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:43.160
have come under the shadow of
suspicion again. with this incident.

01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:51.750
[media asking questions]

01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:55.870
[indistinct questions]

01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:20.200
This is Sabu and Saritha.

01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:24.290
They are the owners of the house
and property you're staying at.

01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:29.580
It was two years of their hard work.
which led us to our initial breakthrough.

01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:30.910
Thank you.

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:33.120
Thank you very much.

01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:35.620
- Sir. can we go?
- Okay.

01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:36.750
Bye.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.870
What's our next plan. Sir?

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.620
We've filed a petition
to question Georgekutty.

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.200
The hearing is at 1 PM today.

01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:50.410
We're speeding up things.

01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:51.580
That's right.

01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:53.290
You shouldn't give
him time to think.

01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:56.830
- Have you got the forensic report?
- Yeah.

01:48:58.370 --> 01:48:59.370
Here it is.

01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:03.290
Male...

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.250
aged between 14 and 20.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:07.540
There's a crack in the skull.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.200
So. the cause of death
should be a blow on his head.

01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:25.540
We have to send this
for a DNA test next.

01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:27.950
For that. I would need
blood samples from you both.

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:38.410
[District Court.
Thodupuzha]

01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:43.120
I strongly object this
petition. Your Honour.

01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:46.040
It is devoid of any merit
and may kindly be dismissed.

01:49:46.450 --> 01:49:49.790
The Honourable Court permitted them
to question this whole family together.

01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:51.700
two times before this.

01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:52.950
Then what happened?

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.290
What incriminating
evidence did they find?

01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:56.870
This is an unending ordeal...

01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:58.870
.. and an abuse of
process of the Court.

01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:59.950
Okay. okay.

01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:01.790
GP...

01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:03.580
she has a point.

01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:06.620
After the police questioned
them twice before this.

01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:07.950
were there any developments?

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.200
Your Honour.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.200
the mystery behind Varun's
disappearance has come to an end.

01:50:12.450 --> 01:50:14.120
When it is a police investigation.

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.580
the suspects may have to be
questioned several times.

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:20.160
These developments are the results of
the interrogations which happened earlier.

01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:21.290
Your Honour.

01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:23.910
this case has reached
its final stage.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.290
It is now clear that
Varun was murdered.

01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:29.250
There's an
eye-witness who saw...

01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:32.040
Georgekutty leaving from the police
station where the body was found.

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.540
on August 4th. 2013. at 3:30 AM.

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.910
Georgekutty and family
have to be questioned

01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:44.330
for the further
proceedings of the case.

01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:45.580
May not be. Your Honour.

01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:48.200
This is to harass my client
and family deliberately...

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.750
Please wait. Miss Counsel.

01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:50.950
Let him submit.

01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:53.750
How much time would you require?

01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:56.330
Your Honour. at least two
days would be required.

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:58.120
No. no!
Two days are not possible.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.160
Your Honour...

01:50:59.870 --> 01:51:01.160
I can grant one day.

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.910
From 8 AM to 6 PM.

01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:04.950
Your Honour.

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.660
they must be questioned
at least for two days.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.870
Didn't you say that you
have evidence with you?

01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:12.160
So question them for one day.

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.410
and inform the Court
about the developments.

01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:17.080
After that. I'll grant more time.
if necessary.

01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:22.250
Ask your client to be present where the
police asks him to. at 8 AM tomorrow.

01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:24.200
Yes. Your Honour.
Much obliged.

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.120
I will be waiting outside.

01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:44.160
None of you know anything.

01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:45.620
That should be our stand.

01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:46.910
Stay firm on that.

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080
Got it?

01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:49.660
There's nothing to worry.

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.080
Go in confidently.

01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:03.950
You are quite smart!

01:52:06.290 --> 01:52:07.290
At the police station?

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.830
That too. right beneath
the C.I.'s feet?

01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:16.290
When the police was looking for that
body all over town for 5-6 years.

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.120
you were enjoying it. right?

01:52:22.330 --> 01:52:24.620
How did you get the idea to
bury it at the police station?

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.040
I'm asking you!

01:52:28.450 --> 01:52:31.410
How did you get the idea to
bury Varun Prabhakar's body.

01:52:31.410 --> 01:52:33.500
at the police station which
was under construction?

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:38.700
Sir. I haven't buried
anyone's body anywhere.

01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:41.620
So. on August 4th. 2013.
at 3:30 AM.

01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:44.540
why did you go to that police
station which was under construction?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.290
I haven't gone there. Sir.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.950
You didn't remain
free for so long.

01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:57.080
because of your intelligence.
unlike what you think.

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.660
You were just plain lucky!

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.830
There was an eye-witness who saw
you coming out from that station.

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:09.750
Because you were lucky.

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.330
he went to jail immediately.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.120
Do you know him?

01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:20.910
- You've never seen him?
- Sir...

01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:24.080
I've seen him. but I
don't know who he is.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:25.160
This is Jose George.

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:27.790
He was in jail serving
life imprisonment.

01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:29.750
for the crime of killing
his own brother-in-law.

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.200
He was released recently.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:34.200
When did you kill your brother-in-law?

01:53:34.290 --> 01:53:36.290
On August 4th. 2013.

01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:37.290
Time?

01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:38.330
At 12 AM.

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.540
After that.

01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:41.700
while running back
home in fear.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:44.250
you reached in front of the police
station which was under construction.

01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:45.290
- Right?
- Yes.

01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:48.200
When you looked inside hearing
some sound. what did you see?

01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:51.500
This Georgekutty Chettan coming
out from that police station.

01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:56.790
What was the time then?

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:58.580
Around 3:30 AM.

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:04.830
That is. on August 4th. at 3:30 AM.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
- Right?
- Yes.

01:54:06.330 --> 01:54:09.000
- Did he have anything in hand?
- He had a shovel.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Now tell me.

01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:13.910
On that day.

01:54:14.290 --> 01:54:15.290
at that time.

01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:16.580
why did you go there?

01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:18.950
I haven't gone there at
that time on that day. Sir.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.830
- He is lying.
- Where were you then?

01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:21.870
At home.

01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:24.580
We went for a retreat at
Thodupuzha on August 2nd.

01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:27.200
We got back home
only on 3rd night.

01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.370
Since we were tired after the trip.
all of us slept soon after.

01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.620
On 4th morning...

01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:32.950
Geetha!

01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:35.040
Let her!
Let her vent it out.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.080
Let her vent it out.

01:54:42.250 --> 01:54:44.370
Your game ends today.

01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:59.200
You will kill my son and bury him...

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:00.500
.. huh?

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.950
- We don't know anything.
- Shut up!

01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:07.660
We have understood everything.

01:55:10.290 --> 01:55:12.330
You exposed your
daughter to us yourself.

01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:16.870
Philip...

01:55:17.290 --> 01:55:18.290
Run it.

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:22.700
No.

01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:23.750
These are all lies.

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:25.830
Anju hasn't done anything wrong.

01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:27.870
He was a pervert.

01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:28.950
That's why she...

01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:35.250
What did you think about us?

01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:38.120
Who bought that property from you?

01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.620
It was me!

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.660
Have you understood who we are. now?

01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:06.620
Say it again!

01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:08.500
The story of your retreat!

01:56:10.450 --> 01:56:12.580
I won't spare any of you.

01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:15.870
The pain that we went
through for 6 years..

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.120
I'll let you know
what it feels like!

01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:27.790
Why did you call my
son to your house?

01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:30.830
Tell me!

01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:33.040
I haven't called anyone.

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.700
- Why did you kill my son?
- Hey!

01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:38.870
Move away!

01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:40.200
- Leave my daughter.
- No.

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.160
Madam!

01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:44.080
Please leave her.
She is not well.

01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:47.750
Why did you kill my son?

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.290
- Tell me.
- Madam...

01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:52.870
Madam. I'm saying the
truth. She's not well.

01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:53.910
Tell me!

01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.200
- Why did you kill my son?
- Please listen to me. Madam.

01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:58.870
She is not well.

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.040
- Tell me.
- Sir. please tell her.

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.330
Why did you kill him?

01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:03.750
Leave me.

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.660
Sir. please tell her.

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.040
Sir...

01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:09.750
- Why did you do it?
- I'm saying the truth.

01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:11.450
I won't let you go
until you say it.

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.580
- Tell me.
- I'll tell you.

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:13.660
- I will tell you.
- No!

01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:16.450
I will make her say it.

01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.700
Tell me.

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.700
You better tell me!

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.950
Why did you kill my son?

01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:27.910
Tell me!

01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:29.450
- Dear!
- Oh no! Dear!

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.120
- My child is not well.
- Dear...

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Oh no!

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Get up!

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:36.250
Putting up a performance?

01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:37.290
Get up. I say!

01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:39.700
Sir. take my child
to a hospital.

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:42.000
She suffers from epilepsy. Sir.

01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:44.250
- Hey! Bring a doctor.
- It's all her acting.

01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:46.160
Prabha. she is just acting.

01:57:46.330 --> 01:57:48.250
- I need to be near my daughter.
- Leave him.

01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:50.450
Don't think you can
escape with this.

01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.410
- I won't spare anyone.
- Saritha. come here.

01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:53.660
- Take her to the next room.
- Sir!

01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:55.120
We have to take
her to a hospital.

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.410
- Move away!
- I'll also go with her.

01:57:56.410 --> 01:57:58.160
- Hold him!
- I'll take her. Sir.

01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.500
Sir! Sir!

01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:01.200
- You should let me go with her.
- Stop it!

01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:04.120
Don't expect any
mercy in this case.

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.200
You played a game with your
younger daughter back then.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.000
Nothing like that will work here.
Understood?

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.080
Sir. I will tell you.

01:58:10.450 --> 01:58:11.450
I'll tell you everything.

01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:14.250
Sir. I...

01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:15.910
... need to talk
to you in private.

01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:17.950
Sir...

01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:28.580
Where is my daughter?

01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:29.790
I want to see her.

01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:31.830
Your daughter is fine.
The doctor is here. She's okay.

01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:33.620
- I need to see her. Sir. Please.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:34.910
Enough with your tricks!

01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:37.000
If you want to confess
something. say that.

01:58:37.450 --> 01:58:38.790
Or we have our own methods.

01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:43.540
Sir. I killed that boy.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.120
I buried his body at
the police station.

01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:49.700
Why did you kill that boy?

01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:57.580
Sir. on August 2nd.

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.750
Rani and the children
had gone to Rani's house.

01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:04.250
When I got back home
from the cable TV office.

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:06.700
I saw someone hiding
near my house.

01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:08.200
Thinking that he was a thief.

01:59:08.410 --> 01:59:11.040
I went to him with an iron
rod which I found nearby.

01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:13.660
He tried to escape
as soon as he saw me.

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.290
Sir. in the heat of the moment.

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:17.500
I hit him.

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.290
Under the impact of that blow
on his head. he fell down.

01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:24.250
That's when I
realized it was a boy.

01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:26.410
Once I realized
that he was dead.

01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:28.080
I put his body into a sack.

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.290
and buried it in my field.

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:31.540
When I went to the
junction on the next day.

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:33.870
I came to know that the flooring
work of the police station

01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:35.250
is going to start on Monday.

01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:38.830
Realizing that it
would be a safer place.

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:40.790
I decided to shift
the body there.

01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.910
Rani and children came back
home by Sunday evening.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.370
I made Rani sleep in the
children's room that night.

01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:50.200
and shifted that body to
the police station myself.

01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:53.200
Then what did your
younger daughter see?

01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:54.330
Sir.

01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:56.830
she saw them burying
our dead calf.

01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:00.620
Trying to save
your family. right?

02:00:01.410 --> 02:00:02.790
I have lived so far.

02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:07.290
realizing that you all will know everything
and find the body sooner or later.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.290
All the evidence which proves
what I told your right now.

02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:11.790
is with me. Sir.

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.660
That iron rod with my fingerprints.

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:16.370
That boy's clothes.

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:17.500
Shoes.

02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:19.830
I have hidden all of them
at a secret place. Sir.

02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:21.580
When did you remove his dress?

02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:23.910
When I shifted him to the station.

02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:25.330
Why did you remove it?

02:00:26.410 --> 02:00:27.410
I told you. right?

02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.870
If you find the truth someday...

02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:33.080
As an evidence.

02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:38.870
You wait here.

02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:40.620
Sir...

02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:46.950
No.

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:48.620
You shouldn't spare
his family too.

02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:51.120
- Geetha. we got what we wanted. right?
- No.

02:00:51.450 --> 02:00:53.830
That entire family should
suffer for killing my son.

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.500
I lived so far.
to see that happening.

02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.450
Didn't you fall at his feet?

02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:00.200
Did he show any
mercy towards us?

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:03.040
Now we needn't show any
leniency towards them.

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.910
Why do you have so
much sympathy for them?

02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:06.580
Geetha. this is
not about sympathy.

02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:07.830
Let him go to jail.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.410
I'm just asking whether we
should be cruel enough...

02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:12.290
... to send an entire
family to jail.

02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:14.250
And that girl is a patient.

02:01:14.290 --> 02:01:15.620
This is all their drama.

02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:17.500
Why don't you
understand that. Prabha?

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:20.040
She's the one who...

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:23.000
I won't spare her.

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:24.540
Geetha...

02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.450
Mr. Prabhakar. I
don't understand you.

02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:29.250
Sir. I just told what
I felt was right.

02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:32.910
Geetha...

02:01:33.370 --> 02:01:34.870
I am going to
accept his request.

02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:36.120
- Thomas!
- For the time being.

02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:37.700
For the time being.
Because...

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.160
if we charge Anju with murder.
we will have two problems.

02:01:41.290 --> 02:01:42.290
One.

02:01:42.330 --> 02:01:45.120
we don't know how much evidence
we can collect. as of now.

02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.580
Moreover. when this crime happened.
that girl wasn't an adult.

02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.620
So the case is juvenile.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.330
If we don't have strong evidence. that girl
can easily go Scot-free from the court.

02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:54.330
Not just that.

02:01:54.370 --> 02:01:55.620
As Georgekutty says.

02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:58.790
if he has collected evidence to
prove that he has done the crime.

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.790
his wife and elder daughter
would become innocent. naturally.

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.330
Usually. in such circumstances.

02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:06.160
you know this as good as I do...

02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.700
we should be able to find the remains
of the clothes of the deceased.

02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:12.160
Forensic department says that
they haven't found it here.

02:02:12.370 --> 02:02:16.410
So. we can believe that he removed
the clothes to keep it as evidence.

02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:19.750
So. for the time being.

02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:21.120
like he asked.

02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:22.620
we will avoid his family.

02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:24.580
and proceed based
on his confession.

02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:27.700
Once we make the case strong after
collecting all the evidence using him.

02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:29.540
before we file the charge-sheet.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.750
we can charge his wife
and elder daughter

02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:34.000
with conspiracy and
destruction of evidence.

02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.290
and make them the co-accused.

02:02:35.370 --> 02:02:36.750
We can let that
younger child go.

02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:38.120
Since she's a minor.
it won't stand in court.

02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:41.620
It was Georgekutty who
played all these games. right?

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:43.000
Let him go to jail first.

02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:45.950
Thomas...

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.290
See to it that the video of that girl
which Varun shot. isn't part of the case.

02:02:48.330 --> 02:02:49.620
That's already avoided.

02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.080
It's not part of his story either.

02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:53.580
Though he said that to
protect his daughter.

02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:54.790
it became beneficial for us.

02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:02.790
Shall I say what's on
your mind now. Prabha?

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.910
You're thinking whether
we are betraying him.

02:03:06.330 --> 02:03:08.040
Yes.
We are betraying him.

02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:10.700
6 years back. he told us that...

02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:12.500
to protect his family.

02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:14.200
he would do anything.

02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:16.410
And that he has only fair
decisions before him.

02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:21.080
Whatever I am doing right now.

02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:22.870
are fair for me.

02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.540
Will you arrest him today?

02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:29.700
Not today.

02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:31.410
We'll record his statement
and send him back today.

02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:33.540
The arrest will be after we
file the application tomorrow.

02:03:36.450 --> 02:03:38.290
If everyone had the
ability to think like you.

02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:40.290
this world would have been a
much better place. Mr. Prabhakar.

02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:42.040
This is not just an
ordinary case for me.

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.580
It's a personal mission I took up.
for my friend and colleague.

02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:46.950
This is a war.

02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.660
A war that he began.

02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:51.540
Everyone wishes to win
their own personal wars.

02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:53.910
Even me!

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:05.370
No. Rajesh.
You don't have to come.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.080
It's all fine here.

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:08.910
Tell Mom as well.

02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:10.950
Okay.
I'll call you later.

02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:39.870
Georgekutty...

02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:45.660
What is it?

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.620
All this happened because of me!

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:51.120
Hey!

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.450
There's no fault
of yours in this.

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.950
I was sure that this would
happen one day or the other.

02:04:59.830 --> 02:05:00.830
Saritha...

02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:03.870
I considered her
as my own sister.

02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:13.160
I didn't realize that
she was betraying me.

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.620
They were just doing their duty.

02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:37.540
Have the children slept?

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:39.580
No.

02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:48.290
Haven't you slept yet?

02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:55.620
Dad... Instead of me. you...

02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.410
Don't think about all that now.

02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:06.700
Stay strong.

02:06:09.370 --> 02:06:11.750
We've gone through so
many huge problems.

02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:15.000
This too shall pass.

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.080
It will.

02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.160
Will they arrest
you tomorrow. Dad?

02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:23.910
I don't know. dear.

02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:40.080
I just came seeing the crowd.
That's when I heard about it.

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.450
Chetta. what's happening?

02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:42.950
They have come to arrest him.

02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:16.000
I'm at the guest
house near the court.

02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.370
Keep me posted. okay?

02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:18.660
Okay Sir.

02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:24.450
Are we going to ask for the permission
to question Georgekutty now?

02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:26.250
No. Today it's judicial custody.

02:07:26.290 --> 02:07:27.700
Tomorrow we will
apply for custody.

02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:29.500
After questioning him.

02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:30.910
and collecting the evidence.

02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:32.040
we will file the charge-sheet.

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:33.410
That's it.
Game over.

02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:34.450
- Okay.
- Sir.

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.450
Mr. Vinayachandran is
here to meet you. Sir.

02:07:39.450 --> 02:07:40.580
Who?

02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.950
Vinayachandran. who writes
scripts for movies.

02:07:43.330 --> 02:07:44.500
Why does he want to meet me?

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:46.830
He said he wants to talk
to you about Georgekutty.

02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:50.830
Ask him to come.

02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:54.950
Good morning. Sir.

02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:57.200
- I am Vinayachandran.
- I know.

02:07:57.540 --> 02:07:58.700
I have seen your movies.

02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:59.950
Please sit.

02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:04.450
This is Geetha.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:05.620
This is Prabhakar.

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:08.330
You're not so active
in movies now. right?

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:12.290
After my wife's death.

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:13.540
there was a gap.

02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:16.290
And the whole process of
making movies has changed now.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.330
To be frank.

02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:19.870
I am outdated.

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.700
That's when George..

02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:24.750
No. Georgekutty.

02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:27.370
He had introduced
himself as George to me.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.660
That's when he came
to meet me in Chennai.

02:08:30.250 --> 02:08:31.250
When was that?

02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:34.410
I think it was in 2016.

02:08:34.450 --> 02:08:35.450
Yes. it was in 2016.

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:37.370
Hadn't you heard
about this case then?

02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:40.330
- Yes.
- Yet you didn't recognize him?

02:08:43.870 --> 02:08:45.620
You look really familiar.

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.160
I had come to your movie
sets a couple of times.

02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:52.000
We got acquainted. as well.

02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:54.000
I didn't have a beard back then.

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:55.620
Maybe that's why.

02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:57.370
I think I have seen
your face somewhere.

02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:58.410
What's the matter?

02:08:58.750 --> 02:09:01.700
Please don't consider me as someone
who wants to get into cinema somehow.

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:03.540
I have a story with me.

02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:05.700
I'll narrate it
within 15 minutes.

02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:06.790
Please.

02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:08.200
He narrated that story to me.

02:09:08.410 --> 02:09:09.700
in 15 minutes.

02:09:10.410 --> 02:09:11.950
I was really impressed.

02:09:12.450 --> 02:09:14.660
Such a story hasn't come out
in recent times.

02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:16.950
When he said that he
will produce it himself.

02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:18.160
I fell for it.

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:20.330
I agreed to write the
script for that movie.

02:09:20.370 --> 02:09:23.660
He paid me an advance of
Rs. 100.000 immediately.

02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:26.910
He had a couple of conditions.

02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.410
Only after we're both
satisfied with the script.

02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:32.410
shall we start the other
works of the movie.

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:36.290
Hero. heroine and director
should have a market value.

02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:39.370
We should find talented newcomers
and give opportunities to them

02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:41.250
to play the rest
of the characters.

02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:44.790
He had all the important parts
of the story with him already.

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:48.040
Yet. that script took a
long time to get completed.

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.160
Since there was a
lot of research work.

02:09:50.410 --> 02:09:52.450
and many disagreements
between us.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.580
I was enjoying even the
disagreements with him.

02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.040
Because.

02:09:58.450 --> 02:10:01.160
Georgekutty was someone with
a great cinematic sense.

02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:04.410
So it took around 2 years.

02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:06.250
for that script to be completed.

02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:10.080
What was that story?

02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:12.410
I will give you a gist of it.

02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:15.200
The story happens in Idukki.

02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:17.580
Krishnakumar.

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:19.080
He's a businessman.

02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:21.870
His wife's name is Ambika.

02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:25.750
Their only son. Jyothish
is around 17-18 years old.

02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:26.790
Jyothish!

02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:29.080
We sent you to college to study.
and not to take part in politics.

02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:30.870
He studies in a college nearby.

02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:33.790
This youngster has all the
hastiness of his age.

02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:40.080
Jyothish is active in college politics.
And his opponent is... Binuraj.

02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.330
Binuraj is the local Legislator's son.

02:10:45.450 --> 02:10:49.830
Opposite parties end up fighting each
other often in college politics. right?

02:10:50.250 --> 02:10:51.250
Once.

02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:54.040
during a fight that
ensued between them...

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:57.160
You're just acting tough because you
have the support of your dad's goons!

02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:59.250
Come alone if you dare!

02:10:59.290 --> 02:11:01.200
I will come. Where should I come?
To your house?

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:02.200
I will come!

02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:05.200
To prove his courage.

02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:08.790
Binuraj reaches Jyothish's
house. that night.

02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:14.080
During the fight which
happens between them...

02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:16.080
when Krishnakumar and
Ambika were not at home.

02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:17.290
Binuraj gets killed.

02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:22.500
When Krishnakumar and Ambika
get back home in their car.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.790
they see Jyothish who's sitting and
crying near Binuraj's dead body.

02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:30.250
It was the local
Legislator's son who died.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.910
Realizing the fact that his
son's life would be over.

02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:35.950
if this news comes out.

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:40.500
Krishnakumar sends his wife
and son to his wife's house.

02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:44.200
and buries Binuraj's dead body.

02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:48.370
at the Legislator's new party office
which is under construction.

02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:00.910
This is the first
half of the story.

02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:04.830
How Krishnakumar. who
firmly believed that

02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:07.370
the police would find
it one day or the other.

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:11.950
creates all the evidence to
prove that he is the killer.

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.870
and how their life turns miserable
fearing the arrival of the police.

02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:15.950
makes up the second half.

02:12:16.450 --> 02:12:18.910
Police finds Binuraj's body.

02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:24.700
and Krishnakumar confesses to that crime
and goes to jail. in the climax.

02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:30.250
So he was going to make
a movie out of his life.

02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:33.410
So it's true that he had predicted
that all this would happen.

02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:36.700
You met each other in 2016.

02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:39.450
The script was
completed in 2 years.

02:12:40.290 --> 02:12:41.950
Why hasn't it been made
into a movie yet?

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.200
Maybe because he fears that
it would help the police.

02:12:44.250 --> 02:12:46.200
if this story comes out
before they catch him.

02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:47.250
No. That's not the case.

02:12:47.290 --> 02:12:50.000
We were not satisfied with its climax.
That's why.

02:12:50.410 --> 02:12:53.250
But he had published
that story as a book.

02:12:53.370 --> 02:12:55.870
so that we don't lose the
copyright of that story.

02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:03.370
- When?
- Around 6 months back.

02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:06.700
- Is it available in the market?
- Yes.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.750
But not many copies
have been printed.

02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:10.580
It was for copyright
purposes. right?

02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:12.450
- In whose name is it published?
- My name.

02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:13.660
Who made the payments for it?

02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:15.620
Though George paid the cash.

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:16.750
all the bills are in my name.

02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:19.620
- What about your payments?
- He's extra decent when it comes to that.

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.080
He gave me my entire
remuneration. as installments.

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:23.330
Cheque or bank transfer?

02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:25.250
He paid everything in cash.

02:13:25.450 --> 02:13:27.620
- Though I asked for some in white..
- Okay. okay.

02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:31.000
Didn't you say that you were
not satisfied with this climax?

02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:33.450
What were the further developments?

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:35.870
We were discussing other
possibilities for the climax.

02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:37.080
[Phone ringing]
- One second.

02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:40.290
Philip?

02:13:40.330 --> 02:13:42.250
- Sir. there's a small problem.
- What?

02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:56.540
Your Honour.

02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:59.950
in cases like these where there's
not even an iota of evidence.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.790
a custodial confession is a regular
weapon which the police resorts to.

02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.620
Absolutely inadmissible!

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:07.950
It's a statement they recorded
by threatening my client.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Is it?

02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:12.660
Yes.

02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:13.750
Damn!

02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:15.450
Why is he saying so now?

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:19.370
He's not going to escape
even if he says that.

02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:25.830
I fear it's the
beginning of something.

02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:35.500
Your Honour.

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:38.620
if there was an Oscar award
for custodial violence.

02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:42.160
these artists dressed in Khaki
would have won many of them.

02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:46.080
It is their theory that Georgekutty
was inspired by watching movies.

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:47.700
to commit this crime.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:50.330
In reality. it was not
Georgekutty who was inspired.

02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:52.870
but it was the police who
got inspired here.

02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:55.700
Georgekutty's statement
which they have submitted.

02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:57.250
has the same confession...

02:14:57.250 --> 02:15:02.120
...which is there in this novel published six months
ago. called 'Drishyam' (Visual).

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:03.370
['Drishyam' by Vinayachandran]

02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:13.080
The police have used the same confession the Hero made at
the climax of this novel

02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:15.870
So he has begun his game!

02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:20.660
- Did you expect this?
- No.

02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:22.790
Like he said.

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:24.790
it's just a beginning.

02:15:29.370 --> 02:15:30.790
After the script was completed.

02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:33.290
he came to my apartment once.

02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:40.080
When I discussed this
story with some people.

02:15:40.450 --> 02:15:41.830
everyone liked the story.

02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:45.000
But they had strong
disagreements over the climax.

02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:47.540
No one is interested in the
hero surrendering to the law.

02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:48.580
The hero should win.

02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:50.870
If the hero goes to jail.
won't that family be shattered?

02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:52.160
They have such questions.

02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:53.950
Even the hero is doing a crime. right?

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:55.750
Doesn't he deserve a
punishment for that?

02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:57.120
When I thought about it.

02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:59.500
isn't this life the greatest
punishment they can get?

02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:04.160
This life full of guilt. living in
fear of the police. every moment.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
That's also true.

02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:09.410
I have some ideas in my mind.

02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:13.410
But I can work it out only if
I get some more information.

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:15.540
- Will you do me a favour. Sir?
- What is it?

02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:17.200
This story happens in Idukki. right?

02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:20.410
If such a skeleton is
actually found from there...

02:16:21.450 --> 02:16:24.580
Can you find out what the
police procedures would be?

02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:30.200
Like he demanded.

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:33.950
with the help of a higher
police official whom I knew.

02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:35.910
I collected that information.

02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:37.660
Based on that information.

02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:40.910
Georgekutty narrated an
alternative climax to me.

02:16:41.370 --> 02:16:45.120
But when I pointed out some
risky elements in that climax.

02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:47.250
Georgekutty decided to
drop that idea. himself.

02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:49.200
What was that climax?

02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:50.830
To be frank.

02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:54.410
it was the fear about that climax.
which brought me here.

02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:00.830
[Phone ringing]

02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:10.750
Yes. The skeleton of Varun. who went
missing. is found from the police station.

02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:11.950
Agreed.

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.250
But what about the only
eye-witness to this incident?

02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:16.580
He's a criminal.

02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:19.790
A highly improbable and
suspicious chance witness.

02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:20.790
Your Honour.

02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:23.660
the probability of events
in this case might be...

02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:26.750
Varun may have been in love
with my client's daughter.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.700
Varun's parents may have
opposed it strongly.

02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:32.950
Varun may have left his
house after a fight.

02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.450
Anyway. he went missing.

02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:37.450
Out of the grief and anger
that Varun went missing.

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:40.700
Varun's mother. ex-I.G.
Geetha Prabhakar.

02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:43.700
brutally harassed my
client and his family.

02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:46.250
But she failed in what
she set out to do.

02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:49.700
Later. the police finds Varun's
skeleton from somewhere.

02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:51.450
They keep it as a secret.

02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:53.910
Because. if this
information comes out.

02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:56.370
for harassing my
client and his family.

02:17:56.370 --> 02:17:57.910
and for trying to
incriminate them.

02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:59.500
the police would
be held answerable.

02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:03.450
In the meanwhile. the police
gets to know about that book.

02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.660
From an idea which they
got from that book.

02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:08.370
they decide to trap
Georgekutty and his family.

02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:09.870
As part of that.

02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:12.620
they cook up a story that
they recovered Varun's body.

02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:16.040
from the police station
near Georgekutty's office.

02:18:16.450 --> 02:18:17.450
After that.

02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:20.700
police created the circumstantial
evidence as per their requirement.

02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:24.040
Since the police station is a
place which is under their control.

02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:26.250
the outside world is never
going to know this truth.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.290
After that. they get someone
with a criminal background.

02:18:29.370 --> 02:18:30.620
who's under their control.

02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:31.750
to be the eye-witness.

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:34.540
Your Honour. this is what
actually happened here.

02:18:34.910 --> 02:18:35.910
Your Honour.

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.580
my friend and colleague. Advocate Renuka.

02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:41.790
has conceived this in her imagination..
- GP!

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:44.330
I don't understand
what's happening here.

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:47.950
As per DNA reports.
this skeleton is not Varun's.

02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:54.540
No!

02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:07.700
What was that damn climax?

02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:16.580
The hero. who firmly believed that...

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:20.160
... someday. the police would unravel
the secret which he had buried.

02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:24.120
begins his attempts to resist it.
from that day onwards.

02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:28.200
During that time period.

02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:32.540
the hero's attempt was to find
a youngster of a similar age.

02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:35.580
who had died due to
a blow on his head.

02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:38.790
[Youngster meets tragic end with a
blow on his head in a family feud]

02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:43.370
The hero's search for a youngster
from a particular religion.

02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:44.910
finally bore fruit.

02:19:46.410 --> 02:19:50.000
During that youngster's
funeral rituals.

02:19:50.290 --> 02:19:52.080
the hero found someone.

02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:00.700
The hero befriended that man.

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.370
Thereafter.

02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:05.750
through regular meetings.

02:20:06.330 --> 02:20:08.660
he firmly established
that friendship.

02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:13.660
The hero found out about the time period
which a body takes to turn into a skeleton.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.330
from that man.

02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:19.370
The hero helped that man who was
in a severe financial problem.

02:20:19.410 --> 02:20:21.250
by giving him money
and won his trust.

02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:23.290
So...

02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:27.040
once that youngster's body
turned into a skeleton.

02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:29.370
the hero told him
about his requirement.

02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:35.700
That man gave that youngster's
skeleton to his provider.

02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:38.870
In the meanwhile.

02:20:39.250 --> 02:20:45.160
the hero somehow finds out
about the further procedures.

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:48.540
in case the police finds
that youngster's body.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.330
If they find such a skeleton
from Idukki district.

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:54.250
it will be taken straight
to Kottayam Medical College.

02:20:55.330 --> 02:20:58.620
Its gender. age and cause of
death would be determined by...

02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:00.580
... the forensic surgeon
who works there.

02:21:01.330 --> 02:21:04.120
There's a rule that these tests
have to be conducted in daylight.

02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:07.870
The skeleton would be sent to Trivandrum
for the DNA test. only after this.

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.660
The hero who understands
these procedures.

02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:16.830
begins his attempt to
establish a friendship

02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:19.160
with the security guard of
the forensic department.

02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:21.120
[Forensic Medicine
Police Surgeon's Office]

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:25.000
The hero follows him and
befriends him.

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:28.870
While establishing that
friendship further.

02:21:29.370 --> 02:21:32.120
the hero identifies
that man's weaknesses.

02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:35.790
Cinema was my dream.

02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:40.290
My dear Sir. you should give me a
chance to act in your movie.

02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:43.290
Come. come.

02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:44.370
Come in.

02:21:46.500 --> 02:21:48.040
There are no cameras here. right?

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.580
Don't worry. Sir.
There's nothing to fear over here.

02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:55.000
Only me and some mosquitoes
would be here at night.

02:21:57.040 --> 02:21:58.040
And thus.

02:21:58.370 --> 02:22:00.330
after bringing that man
also under his control.

02:22:01.290 --> 02:22:05.250
the hero began waiting
for the arrival of the police.

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:07.910
Years passed.

02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:10.200
Finally.

02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:12.580
the police discovered that secret.

02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:33.080
Rajan. it's me.

02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:34.120
Yes. Georgetta.

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.500
I am coming to Kottayam.

02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:36.950
- Okay.
- We should hang out today.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
- Will you get me a bottle?
- Okay! Okay!

02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:48.950
In this climax.

02:23:49.330 --> 02:23:51.040
there are many risky elements.

02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:53.870
The hero should be
really lucky. as well.

02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:55.870
It's a movie. right Sir?

02:23:56.330 --> 02:23:59.910
What's wrong if the hero turned out
to be lucky or had blessings from God?

02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:04.120
What does the hero have to lose. when
he's ready to surrender to the police?

02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:06.540
He can make an attempt. right?

02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:10.040
What if luck is on his side?

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.370
You hadn't seen this result or what?

02:24:14.410 --> 02:24:15.910
I was told that it
wasn't ready yet.

02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:17.250
Sir. it came just now.

02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:20.250
Can I meet your I.G.?

02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:23.160
- Yes. He's in the guest house nearby.
- Ask him to come immediately.

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:25.330
- I want to meet him in my chamber.
- Yes. Sir.

02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:29.500
Your client is permitted to go.
on personal bond.

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:30.950
Much obliged. Your Honour.

02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:34.620
A humble submission. Your Honour.

02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:37.750
Your Honour may kindly
direct the police...

02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:41.200
not to proceed against the petitioner
and his family. for the time being.

02:24:41.250 --> 02:24:43.830
as they are approaching the
Honourable High Court of Kerala.

02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:47.080
to quash the entire proceedings
in connection with this crime.

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:39.620
But how is it even possible?

02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:43.660
How can an ordinary man like him.
do something like this?

02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:44.830
He can. Sir.

02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:48.000
Let me tell you something.
friend to friend.

02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:50.950
Police have been behind
this for two years.

02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:55.250
And mind you. this is not an investigation.
but a re-investigation.

02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:00.330
We never got any kind of
systemic support in this case.

02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:03.830
80% of the cases in this country.

02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:06.540
are failing because of the
absence of this systemic support.

02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.500
And that man!

02:26:09.410 --> 02:26:11.950
That man is a classic criminal
and he's Scot-free now.

02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:13.750
Thanks...

02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:16.540
... to all of us.

02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:19.540
What an extraordinary man!

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:23.000
Waiting for years
just to try his luck.

02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.330
Everyone knows
what the truth is.

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:27.200
But...

02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:29.000
.. can't prove it.

02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:31.250
In reality.

02:26:31.950 --> 02:26:34.870
both these families deserve justice.

02:26:35.370 --> 02:26:38.370
But we will never be able to
deliver that justice to them.

02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:40.580
Now.

02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:42.200
off the record. Thomas.

02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:46.120
Unsolved cases are
not new in our system.

02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:31.830
Whatever justifications
he may have.

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.580
he can never walk with
his head held high.

02:27:34.700 --> 02:27:36.700
in front of that
youngster's parents.

02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:39.870
He must atone for his sins.

02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:42.410
The story hasn't ended yet.

02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:46.370
This climax...

02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:48.500
... has a tail end. as well.

02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:18.000
[Geetha Prabhakar
96338 29771]

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:49.540
Is it over?

02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:51.500
Yes.

02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:57.870
I am giving you
what you asked for.

02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:00.410
Sorry for hurting you again.

02:29:01.450 --> 02:29:03.870
Can you leave us alone.
at least now?

02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:06.660
Geetha..

02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:10.700
his mind has taken a pledge
to protect his family.

02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:12.870
We cannot win.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:18.160
We...

02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:21.160
Why don't we end this here?

02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:33.700
It's like a case that is closed.

02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:35.620
but will never close.

02:29:36.910 --> 02:29:37.910
Actually.

02:29:38.290 --> 02:29:40.160
we were not observing him.

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:42.200
He was observing us!

02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:46.080
I am sure.

02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:48.370
From this moment onwards.

02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:52.700
he would be preparing himself
to resist our next arrival.

02:29:54.580 --> 02:29:55.580
In a way.

02:29:56.950 --> 02:30:00.160
isn't that the greatest
punishment he could get?
