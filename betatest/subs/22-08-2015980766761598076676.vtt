Do you think you could win?

13
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.080
Then you really think China could win

The U.S. Department of Defense

22
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.160
called us to join the Senkaku exercises

23
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.160
as a member of the

24
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.990
It's always been a U.S.-Japan
exercise. Why ask us to suddenly join?

25
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.750
That's what I said. sir.

26
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.540
But they said circumstances
changed and we can't have everything.

27
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.580
They asked so blatantly. sir.

28
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.250
But the peace talks are coming up...

29
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.370
Minister.

30
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.830
Let's say it's too short of a notice
and that we can't join this time.

31
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.830
Yes. Mr. President.

32
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.080
You had a briefing for me on Dokdo?

33
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.410
Yes. sir.

34
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.130
It's a growing situation.

35
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.700
You must be informed. sir.

36
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.830
Let's talk inside.

<i>Case Report on Dokdo</i>

38
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.290
A month ago. on June 25th to be exact.

39
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.410
a Coast Guard patrol vessel captain
turned himself in to the NSO.

40
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.040
<i>I met a woman about two months ago.</i>

41
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.910
She's a pretty Japanese-Korean woman.

42
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.910
<i>We dated. and she took
me to the casino a few times.</i>

43
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.620
I ended up hundreds
of thousands in debt.

44
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080
I asked her to lend me some money.

45
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.830
She said she'll give it to
me under one condition.

46
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.370
When a Japanese patrol
ship soon sails around Dokdo.

47
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.660
she said to attack it
without any warning shots.

48
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.750
We worked with the NIS to
investigate the woman first.

49
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.790
Her real name is Ito Hideko.

50
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.160
She works for

51
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.370
Yamato Foundation. the bank
for right-wing Japanese extremists.

52
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.870
She came to Korea and approached
people with connections to Dokdo.

53
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.700
Apart from the Coast Guard captain.

54
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.950
she had affairs with several
senior naval officers.

55
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.410
Lt-Col CHOI at Navy HQ.

56
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.870
The NIS brought him in for questioning.

57
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.890
<i>FORGIVE ME</i>

58
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.490
But he killed himself.

59
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.990
What have you found?

60
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.160
We know she's working
for the Yamato Foundation.

61
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.080
We'll keep investigating
through the NIS.

62
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.200
But we fear...

63
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.450
We could see a repeat of
the 2006 Dokdo War. sir.

64
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.950
When a Japanese patrol ship
trespassed our waters at Dokdo

65
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.700
and our Coast Guards drove it out?

66
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.040
Yes. sir.

67
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.910
But behind the patrol ship

68
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.410
was a task flotilla deployed
in nearby international waters.

69
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.080
If we had attacked the patrol ship.

70
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.740
the flotilla would have attacked
our Coast Guards and Navy.

71
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.900
The situation was at
the very brink of war. sir.

72
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.320
If the U.S. hadn't intervened quickly.

73
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.150
a confrontation between the two
navies would've been inevitable.

74
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.190
What if

75
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.240
there is a confrontation at
Dokdo as Japan intends this time?

76
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.110
With just our Navy and Air Force...

77
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.530
We'd be defeated.

78
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.210
<i>Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Japan</i>

79
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.860
80 years ago.

80
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.110
when the U.S. cut off our oil supply

81
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.990
Japan had no choice
but to go to war with them.

82
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.570
So began the Pacific War

83
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.990
which ended with the
atomic bombing here.

84
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.190
However. great Japan did not give up

85
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.030
but rose again!

86
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.950
This time. it was our economy.

87
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.900
Only 3 decades ago.
for half the price of Tokyo.

88
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.820
we could buy all the land in the U.S.

89
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.820
Japan was the reigning
global economic power.

90
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.070
But we were exploited
by the U.S. again.

91
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.240
The Plaza Accord and
appreciation of the yen

92
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.530
pushed us into a deep decline
that even Koreans scoff at!

93
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.900
The U.S. may be our ally.

94
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.360
but we must recall how America
influenced Japan in the last century!

95
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.280
The author of 'Japan: The
Future of Our Great Nation'.

96
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.280
Shinzo Mori. Let's give him a big hand!

97
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.490
Damn Yankees!

98
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.320
Pitting us against China?

99
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.030
We won't be used by them any longer.

100
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.450
It's our turn to use them.

101
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.570
Yes. sir.

102
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.690
As the U.S. wants.

103
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.900
we'll pretend to prepare
a war with China.

104
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.740
But we'll reclaim our stolen territory.

105
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.570
Yes. sir.

106
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.860
Our invasions of Korea.

107
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.320
the Sino-Japanese War.
the Russo-Japanese War.

108
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.400
and finally. the Korean War.

109
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.030
the expansion of Japanese
reign always began in Korea.

110
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.280
Through war with Korea.

111
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.450
the dormant Japanese
spirit will be awakened.

112
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.900
Yes. sir.

113
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.530
<i>The Blue House (South Korea)</i>

114
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.990
The U.S. will take all
the nuclear warheads.

115
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.570
in exchange for

116
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.530
signing a peace agreement and
ambassador-level diplomatic relations.

117
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.990
There is some
disagreement on some details.

118
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.650
but I think they'll be worked out
after the summit tomorrow. sir.

119
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.460
<i>Chief Secretary</i>

120
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.190
The Foreign Minister
is on the line. sir.

121
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.990
Yes. Minister YOON.

122
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.650
Let's listen together.

123
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.030
<i>Mr. President.</i>

124
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.650
<i>The U.S. State Department
just postponed the summit. sir.</i>

125
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.240
Did they say why? I thought
the big picture was set.

126
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.030
<i>They cited issues with the nuclear
weapon handover procedures.</i>

127
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.820
What procedures?

128
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.320
<i>North Korea wanted a
deadline for inspections as well.</i>

129
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.450
<i>The U.S. apparently refused.</i>

130
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:37.240
<i>So North Korea said no
handover until inspections are done.</i>

131
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.030
Did they give a new
date for the summit?

132
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:44.110
<i>I'm afraid not. sir.
Nothing was mentioned.</i>

133
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.310
Minister YOON.

134
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.980
Please arrange a call
with President Smoot.

135
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.270
<i>Yes. sir.</i>

136
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.940
<i>I'll inform you once it is arranged.</i>

137
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.520
Where'd you find the chips?

138
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.650
Is it because the summit
has gone belly up?

139
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.730
It's not gone belly up.
It's been postponed.

140
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.770
How can a teacher say that?

141
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.440
A math teacher should still
use more appropriate words. no?

142
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.940
Sorry.

143
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.450
It's been postponed before.
Be patient. It'll work out.

144
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.490
Exactly...

145
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.200
What are you reading so intently?

146
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.250
A copy of the Armistice.

147
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.790
68 years ago. this agreement
stopped the Korean War.

148
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.160
An armistice. a cessation of arms.

149
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.950
I hoped a peace agreement
would replace this.

150
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.620
KIM Il-sung and NAM
Il were North Koreans.

151
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.790
Mark Clark and William
Harrison were Americans.

152
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.250
Peng Teh Huai represented China.

153
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.790
Wait. no South Korea?

154
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.370
Though we've been invited this time.

155
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.580
South Korea won't be signing anywhere.

156
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.250
I know you majored in math.

157
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.660
but shouldn't you know we weren't
a signatory to the Armistice?

158
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.040
What's the area of a circle
with a 10cm diameter?

159
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.120
25π square cm.

160
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.580
You know π is 3.1415926. right?

161
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:12.330
Why try to save a country when you
can't solve the area of a tiny circle?

162
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.660
Why you!

163
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.370
Stop wallowing in self
pity and come to bed!

164
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.700
Ouch!

165
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.360
This soup is delicious.

166
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.110
It really hits the spot.

167
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.690
Would you like some more?

168
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.150
No. thank you. I've had plenty.

169
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.860
Experience is a great teacher.

170
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.950
You gentlemen didn't come
here this early to try my cooking.

171
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.490
Young-hee? Are you finished?

172
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.900
- Yes.
- Let's go. We'll be late.

173
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.490
Goodbye. dear.

174
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.900
- Bye. Dad.
- Bye.

175
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.400
Thank you for breakfast.

176
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.070
Have a great day.

177
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.150
Shall we talk in the sitting room?

178
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.320
Dad!

179
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.900
- Yes?
- I polished your shoes.

180
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.490
Right.

181
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.950
Where's my wallet?

182
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.690
Here.

183
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.610
$50?

184
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.780
Mom!

185
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.820
If you take it. your dad will be
arrested for accepting bribes.

186
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.030
Let's go.

187
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.490
- See you later.
- Bye.

188
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.150
Young-hee. have fun!

189
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.450
I've checked through the back channels.

190
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.900
President Smoot will
not schedule a video call

191
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.740
unless we agree to participate
in the Senkaku exercises. sir.

192
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.860
Please tell them we'll take part.

193
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.860
Yes. sir.

194
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.610
What about the luncheon tomorrow
with the Chinese Ambassador?

195
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.490
He's coming to thank you for
not partaking in the exercises.

196
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.780
Oh my...

197
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.990
I have updates on the Yamato
Foundation investigation.

198
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.190
We've been monitoring its accounts.

199
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.740
$1 billion was deposited. recently.

200
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.950
We've confirmed that half of it

201
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.450
was withdrawn in cash. sir.

202
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.240
Where did the money go to?

203
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.070
We're looking into it. sir.

204
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.530
But we know who
transferred it to Yamato.

205
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.450
It's Chen Longfei. a
Chinese real estate mogul.

206
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.780
A Chinese mogul gave money to
right-wing Japanese extremists?

207
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.950
Yes. sir.

208
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.450
We dug deeper and found the
Chinese public security bureau

209
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.030
held him for months for tax evasion
and illegal foreign currency transfers.

210
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.490
Meaning.

211
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.360
it was the Chinese government
that sent the money not Chen Longfei.

212
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.900
But it doesn't make sense.

213
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:39.150
Why would the Chinese government
be funding Japanese extremists?

214
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.570
A confrontation at Dokdo would mean

215
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.110
the end of the
U.S.-Japan-Korean alliance.

216
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.400
Then the biggest
beneficiary would be...

217
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.950
China.

218
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.450
<i>East Sea International Waters</i>

219
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.400
Hurry up! Take them!

220
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400
Get them!

221
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.860
Hurry! Catch!

222
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.110
Save Min-chul first!

223
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.190
Grab hold tightly!

224
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.530
Pull!

225
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.570
<i>Yamato Bank</i>

<i>First Officer of the Paektu SSBN</i>

227
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.740
<i>Captain of the Paektu SSBN</i>

228
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.870
Sighing brings you bad luck.

229
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.250
Try to relax and sleep.

230
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.040
Sorry. Let's sleep.

231
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.790
I said it's bad luck!

232
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.370
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

233
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.250
It wasn't a sigh.

234
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.750
You know I exhale longer.

235
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.660
<i>The Foreign Minister is on the line.</i>

236
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.200
<i>The Foreign Minister is on the line.</i>

237
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.870
Yes. Minister YOON.

238
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.950
No. I was awake.

239
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.250
3 p.m.?

240
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.040
Eastern Standard Time...

241
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.080
It's fine. The sooner the better.

242
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.430
Good morning. sir.

243
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.050
<i>National Security Council</i>

244
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.490
You came early.

245
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.490
You as well. sir.

246
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.450
Once we said we'll join the exercises.
they arranged the call right away.

247
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.450
But the Senkaku exercises
are not this important.

248
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.790
Is there something more to it?

249
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.660
Things have become rocky with Japan.
Maybe the U.S. wants to mend ties.

250
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.250
I hope that's all it is.

251
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.910
A stronger tripartite alliance

252
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.490
will only help keep China in check.

253
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.830
When North Korea is taken care of.

254
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.620
China will be the Americans'
primary concern.

255
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.490
<i>We are on? Yeah.</i>

256
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.120
<i>President HAN.</i>

257
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.450
<i>Thank you for accommodating
the time difference.</i>

258
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.120
President Smoot.
Thank you for your time.

259
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.490
<i>And let me just say</i>

260
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.990
<i>that you made the right decision
to join the Senkaku Exercises.</i>

261
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.040
<i>You are the key to our
tripartite alliance. President HAN.</i>

262
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.490
<i>protecting our interests in the region.</i>

263
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.540
<i>bringing peace and
prosperity to Japan and Korea.</i>

264
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.450
Mr. President?

265
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.160
Mr. President?

266
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.330
Dear? What time is it?

267
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.910
It's almost 8 o'clock.

268
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.080
5 more minutes...

269
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.910
I'm sorry. sir.

270
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.160
I'm glad we share the
same Korean heritage.

271
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.160
We share the same language and tastes.

272
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.660
My appointment as ambassador
as a Korean-Chinese.

273
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.830
means that the Chinese government
values friendship with South Korea.

274
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.580
Yes. of course.

275
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:57.160
I know the U.S. asked you to partake
in military exercises off Diaoyu.

276
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.330
Our government extends our gratitude

277
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.950
for maintaining your
neutrality by refusing to join.

278
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.830
Thank you.

279
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.410
We will be taking part
in the exercises after all.

280
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.040
It's just a routine exercise. The
Chinese government need not worry.

281
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.250
President HAN.

282
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.330
Are you aware what
this exercise signifies?

283
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:41.290
It means the U.S.-Japan forces
will go to war against China!

284
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.830
Why would your forces join in?

285
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.620
South Korea's participation

286
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.450
means a declaration
of war against China!

287
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.290
It's not a declaration of
war. It's just an exercise.

288
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.750
Mr. President.

289
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.580
After the first summit
with North Korea.

290
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.330
do you know what
the Americans did first?

291
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.790
They dispatched the marines to
the American consulate in Taiwan.

292
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.750
Then U.S. destroyers commenced
operations in the Taiwan Strait!

293
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:20.040
Then the American trade
war against China began!

294
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.870
If North Korean nuclear issues
are fully resolved in the summit.

295
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.250
how do you think the
U.S. will act towards us?

296
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.790
Mr. Ambassador.

297
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.330
We apologize for the tight schedule.

298
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.580
Mr. President?

299
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.540
The Foreign Minister has
urgent matters to report.

300
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.330
Mr. Ambassador.

301
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.410
My apologies. I'm afraid I must go.

302
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.580
Stay out of the exercise.

303
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.160
Listen.

304
00:22:53.450 --> 00:23:01.450
I say this as your friend. not
an ambassador from China.

305
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.410
<i>Foreign Minister</i>

306
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.990
It appears it didn't go well.

307
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.160
<i>U.S. State Department</i>

308
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.080
<i>will soon call with the set
date for the summit. sir.</i>

309
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.910
<i>The new date of the postponed
North Korea-U.S. summit is August 1st.</i>

310
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.750
<i>The world awaits the announcement
of where it will be held.</i>

311
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.700
<i>- President Smoot wrote on Twitter...
- The Unification Minister is on the line.</i>

312
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660
Yes. Minister.

313
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.580
<i>that U.S. will transport all
North Korean nuclear weapons...</i>

314
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.910
I understand.

315
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:44.990
Thank you. Minister.

316
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.080
Why? Another early morning meeting?

317
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.660
The summit's location has been decided.

318
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.120
All the best. Mr. President!

319
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.040
Mr. President!

320
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.870
It's President HAN!

321
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.290
Hello. Mr. President!

322
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.900
American military transport
aircrafts will come for the nukes.

323
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.030
It'll unease people in Pyongyang.
so they decided on Wonsan.

324
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.690
It seems Americans welcome the end
of the North Korean nuclear problem.

325
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.150
But the U.S. Congress
says no peace agreement

326
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.280
before inspections are complete.

327
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.860
The White House are also concerned
about President Smoot's safety.

328
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.780
That sounds nice.

329
00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:50.320
No one in the Blue House
seems worried about my safety.

330
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.570
What was it again?

331
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.690
'Commie! Live in North
Korea and don't come back!'

332
00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.690
It was on the Blue
House petition board.

333
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.280
No...

334
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.030
<i>Typhoon Aere. which
was headed to Shanghai.</i>

335
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.990
<i>and Typhoon Dianmu.
which was headed to Kyushu.</i>

<i>- and wind speeds of over 90m/s.</i>
- Mr. President.

338
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.820
<i>U.S. Air Force Weather Agency
calls super typhoon 'Steel Rain'</i>

339
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.190
Yes. Prime Minister.

340
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.360
Yes.

341
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.320
Even the weather isn't cooperating.

342
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:27.030
Please do your best to make sure
the typhoon doesn't cause damages.

343
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.170
<i>WHERE IS TYPHOON STEEL RAIN HEADED?</i>

344
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.790
I'll see you when I get back.

345
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.820
<i>...and is expected to go
past Dokdo and Ulleungdo.</i>

346
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.400
Everything is ready. sir.

347
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:45.650
<i>Wonsan Kalma Airport</i>

348
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:53.570
<i>Wonsan Airport VIP Room</i>

349
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.490
Would you care for one?

350
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.240
No. thank you.

351
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.900
Though smoking indoors
is prohibited in South Korea.

352
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.990
it's not here. So. excuse me.

353
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.030
Sure.

354
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.740
What is it? Is something funny?

355
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.860
Someone recently told
me sighing brings bad luck.

356
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.320
Anyway.

357
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.990
it'll be a good day.
What's worrying you?

358
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.280
Know how much time and money
we poured into our nuclear weapons?

359
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:38.030
And opposition to this
summit was always a given.

360
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.070
But recently. it has died down.

361
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.820
Thanks to your persuasiveness...

362
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.490
We don't persuade
here. We simply decide.

363
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.490
Recently. China promised us aid
irrespective of our nuclear weapons.

364
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.400
and warned us to stand up to the U.S.

365
00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.320
It's caused some unrest
among my military officers.

366
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:07.190
<i>A strong typhoon is
headed north from the south.</i>

367
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.280
<i>Two typhoons have merged.</i>

368
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:18.530
<i>The super typhoon will bring
stronger winds and rain than usual.</i>

369
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:24.190
<i>High wave warnings are in
place in the eastern coast.</i>

370
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:30.280
<i>Therefore. each sector of the
Republic must take measures</i>

371
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.900
<i>to prevent damage from the heavy rain.</i>

372
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.830
<i>In particular. urban management
and construction sectors must...</i>

373
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.660
<i>Supreme Guard Commander</i>

374
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.860
Welcome.

375
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.110
How are you doing?

376
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.530
Welcome. President Smoot.

377
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:15.980
Good to see you again.

378
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.850
Oh! What a nice little...

379
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.310
The DPRK honor guards welcome you!

380
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.270
Colonel YOO. speaking!

381
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.690
This way. sir!

382
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.390
<i>Wonsan Kalma International Hotel</i>

383
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.610
Mr. Chairman.

384
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.570
You'd better come to Washington
and sign the peace agreement there.

385
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.820
There's a lot of people
who are up in arms about

386
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.070
me signing this agreement
way too early. you know.

387
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:27.570
And I know that here in North Korea.
it's whatever the Chairman says goes.

388
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.900
In Washington. it's a
whole different story.

389
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.780
You know we got the
bureaucrats. politicians. the press...

390
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.530
Hardliners are not
exclusive to America.

391
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.240
We have many here. too.

392
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.740
I'm gonna be honest with you.

393
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.690
I envy you.

394
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.450
You're a dictator. You
can do anything you want.

395
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.490
You can drag your enemies out of their
beds in the middle of the night 3 a.m.

396
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.360
Have them shot. Boom! Boom!

397
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.450
I mean. it's a beautiful thing.

398
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.030
And politics is show business.

399
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.740
And that's what I do.

400
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.320
Show business.

401
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.990
So I'm gonna take your nukes back home.

402
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.860
I'm gonna put on a good show.

403
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.610
You are gonna sign the agreement.

404
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.900
We'll normalize ties.

405
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.110
And then you and I are gonna
make a lot of money together.

406
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.240
It's a beautiful thing.

407
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.650
You gotta trust me here.
I know what I'm doing.

408
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.490
President Smoot.

409
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.240
I. too. can only do so much.

410
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.070
Without a diplomatic agreement.
you can't take our nuclear weapons.

411
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.280
Well...

412
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.110
Who do you think is gonna take the
flak when I go home empty handed?

413
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.190
Not me. You!

414
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.240
So you'd better think
about this very carefully.

415
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:49.990
Mr. Chairman.

416
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.530
Is he allowed to smoke in here?

417
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.320
Excuse me. please.

418
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.780
No smoking.

419
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.530
30 years ago.

420
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.070
South Korea sought ties
with the Soviets and Chinese.

421
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.320
Swallowing our pride.
we turned to the U.S.

422
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.110
But you ignored us

423
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.070
and said we're a failed state.

424
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.400
That's why we chose nuclear weapons.

425
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.860
With them. you'd pay attention to us!

426
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.900
It took 30 years for
you to sit down with us.

427
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.860
In exchange for your signature here.

428
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.990
we're giving up what we
labored 30 years to build!

429
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:33.240
Is that so much to ask for you to sign?

430
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:35.990
Are you finished?

431
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.860
You're not listening to me.

432
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.990
I told you I want to sign it.

433
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.900
But there's the Neocons
who want nothing to...

434
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.400
They want nothing more to do

435
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.820
then to blow the fuck out of
your stupid. little fucking country.

436
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.780
How dare you!

437
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.400
So you know. I'd
appreciate a little gratitude.

438
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:54.490
Because right now.

439
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:58.240
I'm the only thing keeping you
and your fucking people alive.

440
00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.530
Please. please. please.

441
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.860
Why don't we take a break?

442
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.030
No need! Goodbye to you both!

443
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.030
Fucking spits all over me?

444
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.320
Fuck you.

445
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.150
What's his fucking problem?

446
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.950
You know?

447
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.400
Just wanna make some money?

448
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.860
Mr. Chairman.

449
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.110
If we pass this final hurdle.

450
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.780
the Korean Peninsula
will no longer be used

451
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.190
for foreign ambition and conflict...

452
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.030
Stop beating around the bush!

453
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.150
Do whatever the U.S. tells
you. Isn't that your point?

454
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.240
Let me ask you this.

455
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.490
Are you really interested
in our people's future?

456
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.780
Aren't you doing this
to improve your ratings?

457
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.490
Please leave.

458
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.450
Mr. Chairman.

459
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.110
The South Korean President
serves just one 5-year term.

460
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.860
The only reason I'm here

461
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.570
is because we almost went to war again.

462
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.780
I'm doing my best to prevent war.

463
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:22.650
Please remember that
when you sit down at the talks.

464
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.310
Nuclear inspections take a
long time and have limitations.

465
00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.310
If North Korea cheats and hides a
few nuclear warheads. we're screwed.

466
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.270
If you focused on peace.
not nuclear weapons.

467
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.200
I think it'll be easier to resolve.

468
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:50.580
If you open an embassy here.
it'll make inspections much easier.

469
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:55.510
This situation would be much easier to resolve
if you focused on peace. not nuclear weapons.

470
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.930
If you open an embassy in North Korea.

471
00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:57.760
An embassy. another embassy.

472
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.550
your staff will have a
base for their operations.

473
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:00.050
Okay.

474
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.580
That will make inspections much easier.

475
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.330
Mr. HAN. Do you really think
the U.S. is holding all the cards?

476
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:10.130
Mr. HAN. Do you really think
the U.S. is holding all the cards?

477
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.680
Oh. sorry.

478
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.490
What do cards matter if
you're carrying a big stick?

479
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.620
What do cards matter if
you're carrying a big stick?

480
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.490
North Koreaʼs carrying a big stick.

481
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.380
Few years ago. after the
North Korean tell that...

482
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.990
Well. you're wrong.

483
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.830
North Korea's carrying a big stick.

484
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.830
After their 6th nuclear and ICBM test.

485
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.250
America was going to go to war.

486
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.950
Jesus Christ would've
bombed North Korea too.

487
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.660
He talks too fast.

488
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.160
Thanks to me. we're negotiating
now without a nuclear war.

489
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.040
Isn't that a great achievement?

490
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.490
Somebody get me a coke. Now.

491
00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.160
Where's Coke?

492
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.490
I am well aware of your efforts.

493
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.910
If everything goes well. the
Nobel Peace Prize will be yours.

494
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.580
The Nobel peace prize
will definitely be yours.

495
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.250
Yeah. and I deserve
it because you know.

496
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.750
Let's say that the nukes are
out of the question. Mr. HAN.

497
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.120
I deserve it. right?

498
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.540
Mr. HAN.

499
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.410
Let's say the nukes
are out of the question.

500
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.790
If we give indulgence to
North Korea. China's ally.

501
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.750
how would that benefit the U.S.?

502
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.700
Why should we let
North Korea off the hook?

503
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.700
Then North Korea would
act in China's best interest.

504
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.700
It'd be like a free pass.

505
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.290
Where's ketchup?

506
00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.120
We'd be letting the enemy walk free.

507
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:48.540
If they think. they can deal
with us apart from China.

508
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.790
it'd be a strategic mistake.

509
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.290
North Korea's mistaken.

510
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.040
It doesn't work like that.

511
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.450
But if they break alliance
with China and join us.

512
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.250
what's a few nuclear
warheads between friends?

513
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.370
Have some doughnuts.

514
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.870
Put a little weight on yourself.

515
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.620
You should gain weight.

516
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.370
God bless America.

517
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.080
Oh god.

518
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.390
<i>Waters off Sinpo Port (North Korea)</i>

519
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.290
A big typhoon is headed
our way. It's so windy. sir.

520
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.160
Are we ferrying money again?

521
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.750
Even if it's on the Chairman's
orders. it doesn't feel right.

522
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.850
Naval officers transporting money...

523
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.260
What you feel doesn't matter.
It's the Chairman's orders.

524
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.330
Never mind.

525
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.080
We will stop in Wonsan.
then head to the East Sea.

526
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:39.790
Wonsan?

527
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.870
The Chairman wanted to inspect
our sub before commissioning.

528
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.660
- Does that mean...?
- Comrade JANG.

529
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.200
Do you still hold a grudge
against the Chairman?

530
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:49.830
No. sir.

531
00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.620
He wants to use the nuclear
weapons to protect our Republic.

532
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:54.750
And...

533
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.410
Let's dive. sir.

534
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.080
Prepare to dive!

535
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.570
Prepare to dive!

536
00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.290
<i>Director of GPB</i>

537
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.900
Of all people. how could
you turn against the Republic?

538
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.850
<i>Supreme Guard Command: Defense and
security agency for the head of state</i>

539
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:12.140
Besides the Supreme Guard Command.
what unit could pull off a coup?

540
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.130
Exactly!

541
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.220
That's why we put you there.
but you dare attempt a coup?

542
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.960
<i>Minister of the People's Armed Forces</i>

543
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.130
Use your brains!

544
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.380
If we hand over all
our nuclear weapons.

545
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:42.710
seek reform and open
up. what will happen to us?

546
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.050
Our Republic is different
from Vietnam or China.

547
00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.790
They can reform and open up. Why?

548
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.550
Because they can
survive even if they fail.

549
00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.590
But us?

550
00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:01.710
If we reform and open
rashly. the country will collapse!

551
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.960
We'd be taken over by South Korea.

552
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.170
Am I wrong?

553
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.880
Our only hope is our blood ally China!

554
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.590
Soon. China will surpass
the U.S. in every way.

555
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.290
We must endure!

556
00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.880
We must wait until they do.

557
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:44.960
Evac! Evac!

558
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.290
Secure Mogul!

559
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.670
Secure a way out!

560
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.590
Let's go!

561
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.420
President HAN! It's a coup!

562
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.920
Blackout!

563
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.380
Find an escape route!

564
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.500
Find an escape!

565
00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.840
Move. move. move. move!

566
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.090
Clear a path! Clear a path!

567
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.050
Let them go!

568
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.250
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

569
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:19.590
Move!

570
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.500
Cover him!

571
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.840
Come tight! Go!

572
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.920
Protect the Chairman!

573
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920
Secure the back!

574
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.290
Tighter!

575
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.550
Stand down! Stand down!

576
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.920
We'll be escorting you three.

577
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:29.840
Listen. You know.

578
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:36.710
I'm sorry. but if you think taking
me hostage is gonna help you out...

579
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.170
You're wrong. I mean...

580
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.840
The United States America
does not negotiate with terrorists.

581
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.000
Be quiet. I don't understand you.

582
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.920
He said the U.S. does
not negotiate with terrorists.

583
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:53.920
We're soldiers protecting
our Republic. not terrorists. sir.

584
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.790
He says they are
soldiers. not terrorists.

585
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:06.340
You speak English?

586
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.170
Why not?

587
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.630
Fuck... Could have told me.

588
00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.050
Well. that's even more serious
you can tell him because...

589
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.960
North Korean military
taking me hostage?

590
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.290
That's a declaration of war.

591
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.190
<i>Wonsan Port (North Korea)</i>

592
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:30.370
This is the Paektu. our first
ballistic missile submarine!

593
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.500
It's powered by a nuclear reactor
with nuclear missiles as well.

594
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880
Escort them.

595
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.130
This way. sir.

596
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.460
- Mr. Chairman!
- Sir!

597
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.050
Comrades in Arms!

598
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.710
Escort them to the captain's cabin.

599
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.550
What's happening. sir?

600
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.840
He's from the GPB.

601
00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.420
Escort them to the cabin.

602
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:49.840
Follow me. sir.

603
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.340
You two stand guard outside.

604
00:42:55.250 --> 00:43:00.050
Isn't he General JANG Ki-sok.
former head of Submarine Command?

605
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.220
That's right.

606
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.790
Hwaseong 14. 15: North Korea's ICBM.

607
00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.420
He was demoted after opposing
the Hwaseong 14 and 15 ICBM tests.

608
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.250
Why'd he oppose the test launches?

609
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.090
He said if we wanted to use ICBMs.
we need to deploy SLBMs first.

610
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.290
or we would be attacked.

611
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.000
Accused by the party

612
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.880
of self-interested opposition
to their plans. he was demoted.

613
00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.750
That's why he's a First Officer now?

614
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.550
I don't know what he's thinking.

615
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.500
but he's the best submarine
strategist. brother.

616
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.050
We're not brothers when on duty.

617
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.960
Submarines have 3 basic problems.

618
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.920
First. the space is very tight.

619
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.920
It's cramped. but try to rest.

620
00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.290
General JANG Ji-sok.

621
00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:59.340
Yes. sir.

622
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.340
Are you with them. too?

623
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.420
It's not Ji-sok. but Ki-sok.

624
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.460
And I'm a major. not a general.

625
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.790
You demoted me. sir.

626
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:13.960
Rest. sir.

627
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.590
Can's too small.

628
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.170
Room. room's too small.
Everything too small!

629
00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.290
Hey. you!

630
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.340
Yeah. I'm talking to you.

631
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:55.210
What's the plan? These
guys. They are your guys. huh?

632
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.880
What's the plan?

633
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.550
He's got a bed. You got
a... You've got a chair.

634
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.050
Where's my chair?

635
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.920
The can? I can sit in the can?

636
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.380
Please. sit here.

637
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.090
Oh! Thank you.

638
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.290
Very kind of you. sir.

639
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:12.210
Too small.

640
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.750
Bearing 20 degrees. range 6.000m!

641
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.630
Assumed U.S. sub detected.

642
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.500
Bastards. This isn't your own backyard!

643
00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:25.710
Never mind.

644
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.460
Say hello and send out a ping.

645
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.170
They're just here to
guard their President.

646
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.050
We'll give away our location!

647
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.250
Never mind.

648
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.420
We found them now. They
likely knew our location earlier.

649
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.090
Send the ping.

650
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.050
They've pinged back. sir.

651
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.550
They have no idea what happened.

652
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.960
Captain. Take us to our destination.

653
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.500
Yes. sir.

654
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.460
What are you doing?

655
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.350
<i>The White House
National Security Council</i>

656
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.650
<i>A coup has broken
out here in North Korea.</i>

657
00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.230
<i>and it appears President Smoot.</i>

658
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.730
<i>the South Korean President. and
the North Korean Supreme Leader</i>

659
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.590
<i>have been taken hostage.</i>

<i>Members of the U.S.

661
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.420
<i>have also been locked up.</i>

662
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:30.210
<i>and members of the press. like myself.
are being kept in a separate room.</i>

663
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.140
<i>Now. judging by the fact
that we no longer hear gunfire.</i>

664
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.500
<i>the coup seems to have succeeded.</i>

665
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.020
Find out which duties can be
executed by the Vice President

666
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.940
when the President has been
captured by an enemy but is still alive.

667
00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.150
<i>Who's on the phone!</i>

668
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.270
<i>Hand over your phones!</i>

669
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.940
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

670
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.810
<i>FAX Jennifer is reporting
from North Korea.</i>

671
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.690
<i>President Smoot has
been captured as hostage</i>

672
00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.810
<i>with North and South Korean leaders.</i>

673
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:02.280
<i>Blue House NSC</i>

674
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.730
Humint in Pyongyang found

675
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.890
the Supreme Guard
Command started the coup.

676
00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:08.910
<i>Prime Minister</i>

677
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.890
What about the border?

678
00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.850
There's no movement.
They're not part of the coup.

679
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.310
Declare a state of emergency
across all forces.

680
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.150
and please get more intel
from Humint in the North.

681
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.020
Yes. ma'am.

682
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.480
Now meanwhile. North Korean
ground forces near the Armistice Line

683
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.150
have only just begun
showing signs of movement.

684
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.850
Another problem

685
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:33.020
is the Chinese troops assembled along
the bridge between China and North Korea.

686
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.440
Now. they moved into position
before even the front-line corps did.

687
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:40.230
China knew the coup was gonna happen.

688
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:41.980
If they're on the bridge now.

689
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.060
it's only a matter of time before
they cross into North Korea.

690
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.810
Madam Vice President?

691
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:51.310
When the President is incapable of
discharging his duties as commander-in-chief.

692
00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.520
then this authority
is transferred to you.

693
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.310
Given he's a prisoner right now. it's
safe to assume he is incapacitated.

694
00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.770
So you're saying I have
supreme operational command?

695
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.060
Yes. ma'am.

696
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.060
Okay.

697
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.020
How do we keep the Chinese
from entering North Korea?

698
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.850
We have to send them a clear message
that entering North Korea means war.

699
00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.730
To do that. we'll have
to strike North Korea first.

700
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.020
But what if something
happens to the President?

701
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.230
If we just sit here doing nothing. out
of concern for the President's safety.

702
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.020
future historians will devote pages

703
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.060
in their books to the incompetence
of the people in this room.

704
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.850
Mr. Secretary!

705
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.150
Find out what retaliatory options
we have against North Korea. ASAP!

706
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.810
Meet me in the hallway.

707
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.650
You bet.

708
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.270
All due respect Joanne.
what the hell are you doing?

709
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.560
They have our President.
our colleagues. our reporters.

710
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.560
Think with me.

711
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:52.230
What is the worst
thing that could happen?

712
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.020
Well. that's obvious.
Losing our President.

713
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.440
That's right.

714
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.560
And if that worst thing were to happen.

715
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:02.730
what would we have to lose?

716
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:06.560
If something were to
happen to the President.

717
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.520
our party would have itself

718
00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.690
the first ever President to
die a hero in a foreign country.

719
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.850
And what about Kagemusha?

720
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:23.060
Neocons think the Chinese
are the Nazis of the 21st century

721
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:27.020
and that we are destined to go
to war with them sooner or later.

722
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.890
Better to do it when we can win.

723
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.940
Don't you agree?

724
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.480
You heard from Chinese
Ambassador Liang Wei

725
00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:01.980
about America's plans for Operation
Kagemusha. have you not?

726
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.890
It's highly improbable.

727
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.690
Why would Japan go
to war against China?

728
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.480
The Japanese don't do
things to their disadvantage.

729
00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.940
Administer the injection.

730
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.150
Motherfuckers! Mother!

731
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.730
What are you doing!

732
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:24.270
Oh! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

733
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.270
You. especially you!

734
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.730
Tell him to stop
resisting and sit still!

735
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:30.310
Hey!

736
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.770
It is just a drug.

737
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.690
It will make you happy. Okay?

738
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:36.020
Relax!

739
00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.520
Fuck you. man!

740
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:50.980
American will is stronger than
all of your North Korean drugs.

741
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.020
Give him one more.

742
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.020
So go fuck yourself!

743
00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.650
I'm gonna fuckin'...

744
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.560
I'm gonna... fuck you...

745
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.560
Explain Operation Kagemusha.

746
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.770
Explain Operation Kagemusha.

747
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.230
The objective of Operation Kagemusha

748
00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.150
The goal of Operation Kagemusha

749
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.390
is a regime change in China.

750
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.100
is a regime change in China.

751
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.390
A U.S. submarine

752
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.600
sinks a Japanese fleet off Senkaku.

753
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:45.980
Japan blames it on China
and orders a counterattack.

754
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:56.560
The U.S. submarines sink
Chinese submarines and destroyers.

755
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:03.020
And guess who takes
the credit for it all?

756
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:05.770
Guess who takes the credit for it all?

757
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.440
Japan.

758
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:16.650
And in the air we provide
intelligence. and we provide air power.

759
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.520
And the Japanese air force.

760
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.980
they emerge superior.

761
00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.650
What is this shit?

762
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:31.100
It feels so fucking good.

763
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.230
Oh. yeah! What is the
point of it all? I ask you.

764
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:43.350
China will be crushed into a
million porcelain pieces of dust.

765
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:50.390
The arrogance that made China think it
could ever be a contender in the ring.

766
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:52.560
China will be crushed to dust.

767
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:55.480
I mean. because what
did they invent? Eh?

768
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:58.690
The Chinese! What
the fuck did they invent?

769
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.350
Noodles?

770
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:03.940
And we invented the atom bomb.

771
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:11.020
Japan's gonna become the greatest
arms' market in the whole wide world.

772
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.440
Yeah. and the America just
keeps getting greater and greater.

773
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.480
And America will become greater.

774
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:21.020
Do you see now?

775
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.440
This is the true nature
of the Yankee bastards.

776
00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:29.270
They fabricated an attack
to start a war in Vietnam.

777
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:32.190
Now. they'll start one
between China and Japan

778
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:35.730
and bind our blood
ally in chains of defeat.

779
00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.150
Why?

780
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.560
Because we chose to give
up our nuclear weapons

781
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:44.650
and turned our back
on our ally of 70 years!

782
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.890
Comrade!

783
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.560
How much did you get
paid by the Chinese for this!

784
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.440
Yes. I've been paid!

785
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:53.810
But you got it wrong. sir.

786
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.190
<i>It wasn't by the Chinese.</i>

787
00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.150
<i>I got $500 million from the Japanese.</i>

788
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.810
<i>Of course.</i>

789
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.300
Should we report what's
coming from the cabin?

790
00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.370
<i>the Chinese promised restoration
of mutual aid and treaty...</i>

791
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:06.200
Leave it!

792
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.020
It's not our place to interfere.

793
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.600
<i>...as well as economic aid!</i>

794
00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.790
China promised me!

795
00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:19.430
So.

796
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.510
we should do our best

797
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.140
to stop a Sino-Japanese
war. shouldn't we?

798
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.140
Goodnight. then.

799
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:56.970
What's that sound?

800
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.640
What did you do?

801
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.140
Let's hope

802
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.850
not everyone on this sub is a traitor.

803
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.590
There's a typhoon
passing over the East Sea.

804
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.920
so deploying an aircraft
carrier will be impossible.

805
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.130
And it's too stormy to
dispatch the Seventh Air Force.

806
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.090
Now. there is one other option.

807
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:27.670
An artillery attack by ground
troops deployed in South Korea.

808
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.380
The President's been taken hostage.
and you're suggesting we fire cannons?

809
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:34.920
We need to strike back before
they even know what hit them.

810
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.840
And make it resoundingly clear

811
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.090
that no good will come from
provoking the United States of America.

812
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.420
Ma'am. We did plan an
operation some time ago.

813
00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.840
Prompt Global Strike.

814
00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:49.590
Prompt Global Strike?

815
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:52.710
We attack with a Minuteman ICBM.

816
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:56.460
but instead of a nuclear warhead.
we use a conventional one.

817
00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:59.630
Now it is expensive. but it's
very fast. impossible to stop.

818
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:01.840
and perfect for
demoralizing your enemy.

819
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.790
How long would the operation take?

820
00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.250
Just say the word.

821
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.290
and a warhead will be dropped
over North Korea in half an hour.

822
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.380
And our target?

823
00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.500
The bridge.

824
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.090
On the North Korean side.

825
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:13.960
where the Chinese are
assembling their troops.

826
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.590
We blow it up. keeping the Chinese
from crossing into North Korea

827
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.340
and sending a clear
warning to both sides.

828
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.210
Do it.

829
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.670
All right. There's just one problem.

830
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.130
If we fire an ICBM.

831
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.790
Russia and China might think
it's a nuclear attack and fire back.

832
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.500
They once mistook one of
our missile tests for an attack.

833
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:37.460
and we barely avoided
an all-out nuclear war.

834
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.670
So this time.

835
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.550
we're gonna have to
give them a heads up.

836
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.920
Aren't they allied with
the North Koreans?

837
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.210
Look. If we fire without warning.

838
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:53.670
the entire human race could
be obliterated in under an hour.

839
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.420
We got the evidence.

840
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:07.210
Since we saved China. keep
your promise to help North Korea.

841
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.960
Understood.

842
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:12.250
I'm sure it will go as planned.

843
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.550
I'll see you next time in Pyongyang.

844
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.130
Comrade!

845
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.960
Transmit this to the
Chinese PLA frequency.

846
00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:22.210
Yes. sir!

847
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:27.630
During the 2008 financial crisis.

848
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.960
the U.S. moved its Pacific
fleet to Afghanistan and Iraq.

849
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:36.000
Then China sent some nuclear
submarines to the Pacific.

850
00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:38.920
The U.S. was furious when it found out.

851
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.460
but there wasn't enough money.

852
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.130
The U.S. proposed to Japan
to block Chinese expansion.

853
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:49.880
The U.S. would block south of
Taiwan and Japan to the north.

854
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.460
Japan took the offer

855
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:58.590
as an approval for a 'normal'
war-making Japanese state.

856
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:03.750
Japan built its forces. claiming it's
due to North Korean nuclear threat.

857
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:05.420
But in reality.

858
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.840
Japan and the U.S. did
it to keep China in check.

859
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.170
But since we declared
we'll give up our weapons.

860
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:15.790
Japan loses justification
for militarization. right?

861
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.130
When the U.S. started pressuring Japan

862
00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:21.460
to cut the act and
face off against China.

863
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:26.290
Japan chose to rather
fight South Korea on Dokdo

864
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:30.960
or revive the North
Korean nuclear threat.

865
00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:35.090
With help from China. apparently.

866
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:38.050
How are you feeling?

867
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:39.920
You okay?

868
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:41.710
Water.

869
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.290
Very thirsty.

870
00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.420
But what does China get from all this?

871
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.340
China averts the war
they're destined to fight.

872
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.590
Destined? What do you mean?

873
01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:09.550
When a rising power and
ruling power come into conflict.

874
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.380
historically. it led to war 80%.

875
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.130
Tensions between a rising China

876
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.710
and a ruling America are no different.

877
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.170
It's all in the book.
'Destined for War'.

878
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.500
More water. please.

879
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
The current situation is the result of
trying to define the frontline of war.

880
01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.170
Thanks.

881
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.880
Will it be Senkaku or Dokdo?

882
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.880
What are you two talking about? Eh?

883
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:45.920
The world does not
revolve around you. America.

884
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:49.630
And I'm gonna make America great again.

885
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:54.690
Pax Americana! America first.

886
01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.050
God bless America.

887
01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:58.960
President Smoot.

888
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.050
You say you'll make
America great again.

889
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.340
But America has been
great since its founding.

890
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.410
A country built to uphold freedom
of conscience and religion.

891
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.160
The first country to claim
independence from colonial rule.

892
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:15.990
The first to establish a republic
based on separation of powers.

893
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:20.700
America's greatness lies in the
ideals that birthed and sustained it.

894
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.040
not in its might.

895
01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.790
Say it in English.

896
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:34.370
He can't understand.

897
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:42.200
Ah... I can understand it well.

898
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:46.080
but speaking doesn't come easy.

899
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:50.040
South Korean cramming
education has far to go.

900
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.580
I guess I shouldn't say that.

901
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.290
Do you really understand English?

902
01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.040
I can understand 100%.

903
01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580
90%.

904
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.250
85%.

905
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.790
80...

906
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.620
80%. I understand that much for sure.

907
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.120
Fuck! Didn't your
mothers ever teach you

908
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.040
that it's rude to talk like this in
googly gook in front of a guest.

909
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.580
Come on! What's he saying?

910
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.540
But...

911
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:38.910
He said...

912
01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.620
Repeat what you said again. slowly.

913
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.410
President Smoot.

914
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.970
President Smoot.

915
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.890
Yeah.

916
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:52.800
You say you’ll make U.S.A. great again.

917
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:54.510
The United States of...

918
01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.910
<i>Moscow. Russia</i>

919
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:58.260
Yes. I understand.

920
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:59.550
Good luck.

921
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.930
<i>ICBM Facility. USA</i>

922
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.610
<i>Beijing. China</i>

923
01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.050
Madam Vice President.

924
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.760
We're concerned about your
situation and send our condolences.

925
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.140
But we've received
some unusual information.

926
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.010
Could you explain this?

927
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:33.670
<i>A U.S. submarine is gonna
sink a Japanese boat in Senkaku.</i>

928
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.050
No! This is bullshit!

929
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.710
This is a conspiracy!

930
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:40.840
And you can bet that the
North Koreans are responsible.

931
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.710
The U.S. just fired an ICBM near
the border of China and North Korea.

932
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:57.960
Is it a nuclear attack?

933
01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:00.920
No. it's a conventional
ballistic missile.

934
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:04.750
Get the U.S. Secretary
of Defense on the line.

935
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.500
We have been a strong alliance.

936
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.790
You should've notified
us before the attack.

937
01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.790
Telling us afterwards is improper
communication between allies.

938
01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.960
Anyway. we appreciate your cooperation.

939
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.420
Shit.

940
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.090
The President has told the
North Koreans everything.

941
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:32.750
The Korean government says

942
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.090
there is reason to believe Japan
and China are also in on the coup.

943
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:37.670
Japan and China?

944
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.670
The Chinese Government
apparently transferred a billion dollars

945
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.710
to a powerful Japanese tycoon.

946
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.960
Million years America
could ever agree...

947
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:49.130
The U.S. fired a
missile at our Republic!

948
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.590
An ICBM at that!

949
01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:55.500
Was it nuclear?

950
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:56.960
Next time.

951
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.090
it probably will be!

952
01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:02.710
Your country fired an
ICBM at my country!

953
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:07.750
Well. sir. with all due respect.

954
01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.340
If you don't get me
off the sub right now.

955
01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.710
we're all gonna die.

956
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:12.630
- Start it.
- Yes. sir.

957
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:15.340
I mean. if it wasn't for
him. and uh his coup.

958
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.710
we would all be entering
a whole new era right now.

959
01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:19.170
But instead we are all gonna die.

960
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.340
Tell him to read it.

961
01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.340
Say what I'm saying.

962
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.500
I am in talks with North Korea.

963
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.550
Do not attack without my order.

964
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:30.040
I am safe and I have not been harmed.

965
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.540
Excuse me. No. I'm not saying that.

966
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:35.330
Not in front of a
camera. There's just no...

967
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.830
Okay. would you repeat that please?

968
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.490
I am in talks with North Korea.

969
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.620
I am in talks with North Korea.

970
01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:45.830
Do not attack without my order.

971
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:49.580
<i>No attacks are to be
made without my order.</i>

972
01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.790
<i>I repeat.</i>

973
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:52.370
<i>I am safe.</i>

974
01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.870
Tell the CIA to verify the South
Koreans' intel as soon as possible.

975
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:05.690
Comrade PARK!

976
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:12.020
Tell me what you were going to
do for the Japanese for the money.

977
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.060
Let's go. sir.

978
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.310
Stay out of it!

979
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.020
This is my final order
for Commander PARK.

980
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:21.350
Fine.

981
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:25.230
I can indulge you one
last time for old times' sake.

982
01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:31.190
Japan asked us to torpedo one
of its patrol ships near Dokdo.

983
01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.650
They want to carry out
Operation Kagemusha on Dokdo?

984
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.190
For a few pennies.

985
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.270
you'd sell your compatriots?

986
01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:47.770
They colonized us and is responsible
for the war that split us in two!

987
01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:48.770
That's not all.

988
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:52.060
<i>Japan did not only ask for a torpedo.</i>

989
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:55.770
<i>They said if South Korea falls.
it'd be good for both them and us.</i>

990
01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.730
<i>They asked to fire a nuclear
missile at South Korea.</i>

991
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:05.440
Since I got my $500
million. I'll fire a torpedo.

992
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.150
They said if a war breaks out on Dokdo.

993
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:12.190
Japan will win and South Korea's
military forces will be annihilated.

994
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:14.560
Wouldn't that be good for our Republic?

995
01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.850
A peace treaty was within reach!

996
01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:21.020
What peace after being
enemies for 70 years?

997
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.650
What really matters
is our nuclear missiles.

998
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.230
I'll be firing one as well.

999
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.520
Not so fast!

1000
01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.770
President HAN!

1001
01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.690
I wasn't finished talking!

1002
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.850
Yes. I'll fire the missile.

1003
01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:42.060
Not at South Korea. but at Japan.

1004
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.730
If I fire it at Japan.

1005
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:49.310
who cares about the UN sanctions!

1006
01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:52.560
China promised us a
generous $10 billion in aid.

1007
01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:55.850
And $5 billion more
every year after that.

1008
01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.980
Comrade Chairman!

1009
01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.600
$5 billion can restart food
distribution to our people.

1010
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:02.020
Commander.

1011
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:09.020
If you fire at Japan. the
U.S. will nuke North Korea.

1012
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:12.770
But we have President Smoot.

1013
01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.210
What's he saying now?

1014
01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:19.450
Japan wants him to fire a
nuclear missile at South Korea.

1015
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:22.410
But China wants him to attack Japan.

1016
01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.990
so he decided to fire on Japan instead.

1017
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:27.540
However. he said.

1018
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:31.540
North Korea is safe as
long as you are his hostage.

1019
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:36.540
Safe? Because I'm your hostage?

1020
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.540
I don't think so.

1021
01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.220
See. you have no idea how
many people in America

1022
01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.890
hate my guts.

1023
01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:48.470
And Republicans will look the other way

1024
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:50.680
and Democrats will
probably throw a party.

1025
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:54.470
The Neocons will celebrate
with a campaign donation spree.

1026
01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.260
Well. that will be the end of you.

1027
01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.680
- What is it?
- A word. sir.

1028
01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:05.090
<i>- You're safe if you</i>
- They heard everything. sir.

1029
01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.800
<i>take me in the White House in 24 hours.</i>

1030
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.720
You let everything be heard?

1031
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.430
I couldn't interfere...

1032
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:15.470
Lock up the weapons
and check on the men.

1033
01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.010
<i>Good guys. Come on!</i>

1034
01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.220
Shake my hand.

1035
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:27.930
On this submarine.

1036
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:31.010
I have the U.S. President. you.

1037
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:34.300
and the Chairman as hostages.

1038
01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:40.590
And we're hundreds
of meters underwater.

1039
01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:43.430
Don't mess with me.

1040
01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:07.010
From our sub?

1041
01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.390
Didn't you hear?

1042
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.510
Yeah. you know.

1043
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:28.300
You nuke an American
ally. America nukes you back.

1044
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.350
China? Does he really think
China has got what it takes

1045
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.260
in a nuclear war?

1046
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:37.050
Hey. I'm talking to you!

1047
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.970
You wasted all our time

1048
01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:42.550
weighing your options back and forth.
forth and back and for what? I mean.

1049
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:44.970
if you just gave us your fucking
weapons in the first place.

1050
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.010
we wouldn't be here
right now. would we?

1051
01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:50.850
We are here because of
America's selfish arrogance.

1052
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:54.900
We expected you to just
keep the same pace with us!

1053
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:58.570
Consider our circumstances! But no!

1054
01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:02.040
You just wanted our complete surrender!

1055
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:07.180
How many times have you promised one
thing and then you do another thing. uh?

1056
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:11.890
You sound like America
always keeps your promises.

1057
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:15.900
But you are the one who
never keep your promises.

1058
01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.320
You know what? We have rules.

1059
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.240
We don't bend to dictators like you!

1060
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.400
Go fuck yourself!

1061
01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:21.190
Fuck you!

1062
01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:21.860
Fuck you!

1063
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:22.650
Fuck you!

1064
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.450
Yeah. fuck you!

1065
01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:23.950
Fuck you!

1066
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:25.400
- You can't even keep your fingers in line.
- Shut up!

1067
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.400
Shut up!

1068
01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:30.320
We're all too late!

1069
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:33.110
Mr. Chairman.

1070
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.860
To talk to Americans. try to
understand the way they talk.

1071
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.690
You waited decades
for talks with the U.S..

1072
01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.950
but didn't bother to learn how
best to communicate and negotiate?

1073
01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.860
President Smoot.

1074
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.780
You should remember.

1075
01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.320
In human history.

1076
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.450
the greatest weapon
of a great empire is

1077
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:03.900
tolerance

1078
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:05.690
and...

1079
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.290
Engagement?

1080
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:11.610
Engagement!

1081
01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:14.110
Engagement!

1082
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.820
Engagement!

1083
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.240
President HAN.

1084
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:37.780
That you must endure
this trouble on my account.

1085
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.030
I apologize.

1086
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.280
President Smoot.

1087
01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.240
Yeap.

1088
01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.400
This is...

1089
01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:52.070
all my fault.

1090
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:54.820
Yeah. well... Okay!

1091
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.950
Yeah. Let's get it out!

1092
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:01.190
I mean. what the fuck makes
Dokdo so important anyway?

1093
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:05.880
I mean. what makes it so fucking
important that South Korea and Japan

1094
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:10.280
gotta go to war over some shitty
little rock in the middle of the ocean?

1095
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.860
Please translate.

1096
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:19.320
Dokdo is the first territory Japan
seized when it occupied Korea.

1097
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:24.990
Dokdo is the first seized territory
when Japan invaded Korea.

1098
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:25.990
Yeah.

1099
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:31.030
Till Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.
which started the World War II.

1100
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.610
and that paved the way
for your independence.

1101
01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.730
And you know. I mean. we've
been pretty good allies to you guys.

1102
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:38.850
America's the good guys. Right?

1103
01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:40.100
You're right.

1104
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:41.480
Good guys!

1105
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:44.940
When the U.S. won and
Korea got its independence.

1106
01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.940
signatories to the Cairo and
Potsdam Declarations made it clear

1107
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:52.600
that Dokdo was Korean territory.
and prohibited Japan from it.

1108
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.390
The United States won the war

1109
01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.390
and due to the Cairo Declaration
and Potsdam Declaration.

1110
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.600
Korea won its independence

1111
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:06.730
and Dokdo became a
Korean territory again.

1112
01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:10.190
And Japan was never
allowed to come near.

1113
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:13.310
What's Japan's deal with
it? They got a claim or what?

1114
01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:15.150
During the Korean War.

1115
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.560
in the case that Korea
fell to communism.

1116
01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:24.050
Dean Rusk. Assistant Secretary of State.
wrote Dokdo may not be Korean territory.

1117
01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:25.770
Japan is using that to claim Dokdo.

1118
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.650
During the Korean War.

1119
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:31.440
in the case that Korea
fell to communism.

1120
01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.480
Dean Rusk. U.S. government man.

1121
01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.270
Who?

1122
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:35.270
Dean Rusk.

1123
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:41.230
Ah.. wrote a memo that Dokdo
did not appear to be Korean territory.

1124
01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.690
Japan uses his personal
memo to back up their claims.

1125
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:46.940
Okay. okay. okay.

1126
01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.060
I mean...

1127
01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.310
I mean. where is this Dodko place?

1128
01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:54.390
Dokdo.

1129
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.150
Dokdo!

1130
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.310
Dodko. Where is it?

1131
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:57.350
Dokdo!

1132
01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.060
Dodko.

1133
01:14:58.150 --> 01:14:58.650
Dokdo!

1134
01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:00.100
Dokdo. Dock-do.

1135
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:01.310
Dokdo!

1136
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.890
There!

1137
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:02.730
There.

1138
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:12.190
Japan is...

1139
01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:15.730
Stop talking. please!
I'm tired of translating.

1140
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.440
President Smoot?

1141
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.150
Can we all shut up?
Together. okay? Uh? Uh?

1142
01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:23.850
Yeah. yeah... I'm tired. man.

1143
01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:27.150
You guys fuck me up. you know? Man.

1144
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:31.560
Hey. hey. No smoking. Okay?
We are indoors. Come on.

1145
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:33.060
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1146
01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:36.390
Erectile dysfunction for
fuck's sake. Come on. man.

1147
01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.980
You're killing me here.

1148
01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.230
Come on!

1149
01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.980
This is my submarine!

1150
01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.060
- Second-hand smoke!
- I'm tired!

1151
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.350
I will just have a few. Okay?

1152
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.600
- You're killing me here!
- Only one!

1153
01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:49.600
It's a fucking nuclear submarine!

1154
01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:50.730
I am tired!

1155
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:51.560
All right.

1156
01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.480
You wanna smoke indoors?

1157
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.480
I'm gonna take a fucking shit

1158
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.390
and I'm gonna leave
the door open. All right?

1159
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.600
- Come on! Stop.
- How about that?

1160
01:15:58.650 --> 01:15:59.440
Stop!

1161
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:04.940
See ya.

1162
01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.940
What are you doing?

1163
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.730
Would you prefer to smell that?

1164
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:20.480
That's how you make a deal.

1165
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.730
One's smoking. the other's farting.
I'm always stuck in the middle.

1166
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:31.250
Rise to periscope depth.

1167
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:33.810
- Periscope depth!
- Yes. sir!

1168
01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:46.390
I don't see anything.

1169
01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:48.940
Comrade.

1170
01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.310
Radio a message here.

1171
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.650
Tell them we've arrived.
but we don't see the tuna.

1172
01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:19.100
<i>Tuna catching postponed due to typhoon.
Tuna will appear once it passes.</i>

1173
01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:23.190
Dive to maximum operating depth.

1174
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:25.230
Set depth for 90 meters.

1175
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:37.190
I'm kinda thirsty. you know.

1176
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:38.890
Can't drink that.

1177
01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.970
Are you guys hungry? Huh?

1178
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.760
Hey!

1179
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:47.050
You hungry?

1180
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:49.760
Hungry!

1181
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:52.930
Officer!

1182
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.140
Hungry!

1183
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.180
Officer!

1184
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:56.510
Officer!

1185
01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.010
The American President is hungry.

1186
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.390
- Bring some food and water.
- I want some burger...

1187
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:06.470
Fries.

1188
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.050
Chocolate milkshakes.

1189
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.140
Hey. I haven't finished...

1190
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:14.720
What kind of food do they serve here?

1191
01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:17.090
They are requesting food and water.

1192
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:30.930
Eat comfortably.

1193
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760
Sit.

1194
01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.010
The Chairman is on our sub. right?

1195
01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.640
Didn't you hear him?

1196
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:53.220
Back then.

1197
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.930
Wasn't it the Chairman's
voice on the intercom?

1198
01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:00.550
But wasn't it strange?

1199
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.260
The Chairman mentioned
a traitor and yelled.

1200
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:05.470
Something about
shooting a nuke at Japan.

1201
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:06.350
Right.

1202
01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:08.850
It sounded like.

1203
01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.510
the Chairman's not
here for an inspection.

1204
01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.050
but he's being held prisoner.

1205
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:17.890
The Chairman? A prisoner?

1206
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:20.680
By who?

1207
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.720
If we fire a nuke at Japan.

1208
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.050
our country will be attacked too.

1209
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.470
What do we do?

1210
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:33.090
What if we rescue the Chairman?

1211
01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.880
Wouldn't we be made
heroes of the Republic?

1212
01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.750
We'll be heroes for sure.

1213
01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.710
What were you talking about?

1214
01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:58.170
If you want to see
your mothers. stay put.

1215
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:02.550
Sir!

1216
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:08.210
Are we really firing a
nuclear missile at Japan?

1217
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.550
They said if we do.

1218
01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.050
the U.S. will fire one at us.

1219
01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:18.750
Then we won't see our mothers. sir.

1220
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:25.290
No.

1221
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.050
Yeah!

1222
01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.000
The sub is new. but it stinks.

1223
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.550
Stench is another problem
with submarines.

1224
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.790
It's because the old man farted.

1225
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.790
Thank you.

1226
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:44.380
What's he saying?

1227
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.130
You smell!

1228
01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:47.920
Oh. no!

1229
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:50.210
Oh. he smoky. smoky!

1230
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.920
You have my sympathy. Mr. President.

1231
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.290
Such trouble for you.

1232
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:59.630
The food isn't much. but please enjoy.

1233
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:03.750
Wait...

1234
01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:11.090
Wow! This tastes like shit.

1235
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:14.710
What is this?

1236
01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.250
That is sokdojeon-tteok.

1237
01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:21.170
Made of corn flour. salt. and sugar.

1238
01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:26.050
And this is injokogibap.

1239
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.000
Are you okay?

1240
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.630
Are you all right?

1241
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:47.670
Are you okay?

1242
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:53.050
Are you okay?

1243
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:05.090
What is this?

1244
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:14.000
"Whatever you hear outside
don't come out. sir."

1245
01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.130
Wait. what does it say?

1246
01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:28.340
Whatever sounds you hear outside
of cabin. do not leave. okay?

1247
01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:34.250
Hey. what are you doing? Hey. hey!

1248
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:36.250
That is fixed!

1249
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:47.380
That will keep them out.

1250
01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:57.590
You don't mind if I
eat your food. right?

1251
01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.550
I'll never smoke.

1252
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.790
Good kid.

1253
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:05.790
He's a good kid.

1254
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.920
Come on. eat.

1255
01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:19.960
You'll damage the sub!

1256
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.460
Don't spill as you eat.

1257
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:45.670
They haven't caught on. sir.

1258
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:54.460
You boys. cover fire from here.
Make sure they don't go in the cabin.

1259
01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.420
Stop!

1260
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.380
Let's save the Chairman with our lives!

1261
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.420
You'll get killed!

1262
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:23.670
Stay put!

1263
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.380
Come back!

1264
01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:39.000
No!

1265
01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:40.500
Are you all right?

1266
01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:45.920
Don't be swayed! Keep your posts!

1267
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.090
Move them over there.

1268
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:10.340
Myung-chul! No!

1269
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.090
Get him!

1270
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:22.840
Bullets!

1271
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:26.280
Die!

1272
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.620
Follow me. sir.

1273
01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.160
Oh. shit.

1274
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:07.540
How many steps!

1275
01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:10.330
Captain! Inspect all the equipment!

1276
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.330
Inspect all the equipment!

1277
01:26:12.450 --> 01:26:13.540
Inspect the equipment!

1278
01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.870
Propulsion system. clear!

1279
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.620
Communication system. clear!

1280
01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.450
Don't mind me.

1281
01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:28.580
In case of an emergency.
while the Chairman is here.

1282
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:31.750
a rescue sphere was installed
above the torpedo room.

1283
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.250
They'll use the maintenance passage.

1284
01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.660
Down there.

1285
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:37.410
It's through there.

1286
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:40.620
Go after them.

1287
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:42.620
If you can't seize them alive.

1288
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.370
you may kill them.

1289
01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:49.790
Chul-woo...

1290
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:56.250
Trust me and hang on.

1291
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.910
The rescue sphere is up there.

1292
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:09.330
You can take it and
go up to the surface. sir.

1293
01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.950
There is a rescue sphere.

1294
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:12.830
Huh?

1295
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:14.540
Oh well. that's good. Let's go!

1296
01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:16.450
- Come on!
- Hey. hey. hey! Wait. wait. wait.

1297
01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:17.190
What?

1298
01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.490
The problem is...

1299
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:22.030
It was made for the Chairman
to escape in an emergency.

1300
01:27:22.150 --> 01:27:23.860
Only one can get in.

1301
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.780
We have bad news.

1302
01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.320
Only one person can get in.

1303
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.070
Oh. fuck! Fuck!

1304
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.740
Hey. hey. hey! Where
do you think you're going?

1305
01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:36.110
Let's take the chair out.

1306
01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:40.610
- What's he saying?
- He said take the chair out.

1307
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:43.530
- Why?
- Make more space.

1308
01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.360
For how many?

1309
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.570
I think...

1310
01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:48.820
Two?

1311
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:50.030
Two?

1312
01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:54.690
But there's three of us.

1313
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.780
Hey. hey. hey! Be careful!

1314
01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.860
Burst in!

1315
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:04.360
Mr. Chairman! Escape. sir!

1316
01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.490
Open up!

1317
01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:07.610
Open up now!

1318
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:12.570
Are you all. okay?

1319
01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.690
Step aside. please!

1320
01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.240
Almost done. sir.

1321
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:35.030
Comrade!

1322
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:37.150
Is that a grenade?

1323
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.990
That's a fucking grenade!

1324
01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.610
It's a grenade!

1325
01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.280
I'm gonna change and be a
good man. I'll do anything you say.

1326
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.990
Just get me out of this situation.

1327
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:48.780
Hold it tightly.

1328
01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:51.490
Done.

1329
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:52.950
Got it?

1330
01:28:58.150 --> 01:28:59.070
It's ready. sir.

1331
01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.530
Come up. sir!

1332
01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.280
Oh! Thank you. dear Lord.

1333
01:29:03.650 --> 01:29:05.320
Okay. now.

1334
01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:09.280
I don't think the three of us
are gonna be able to get in there.

1335
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.190
So we gotta make a choice.

1336
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.860
Who's coming with me?

1337
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:16.610
You two!

1338
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.860
I'm the commander here!

1339
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:19.070
Mr. Chairman!

1340
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.950
I'm not doing this
because you're special.

1341
01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.610
You have to stay alive to finish
the summit and fix this mess.

1342
01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:31.740
Please go up.

1343
01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.280
Yeah. we gotta go. Come on.

1344
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:34.990
It's not time for talking.

1345
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:38.280
He insists us to get in.

1346
01:29:39.190 --> 01:29:43.610
We have to be alive to prevent
war and finish our negotiations.

1347
01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:46.530
And he's absolutely
right. You're a smart guy.

1348
01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:49.610
We gotta prevent war. We
gotta finish the negotiations.

1349
01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.780
Soon as I'm on land. him and me.

1350
01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.610
we're gonna sign that peace treaty.

1351
01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:56.530
Nuclear non-proliferation deal.

1352
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:59.570
We're gonna have peace in our time.

1353
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.320
And I thank you President HAN.

1354
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:07.690
for your contribution
and your sacrifice.

1355
01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.110
You are a brave man.

1356
01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.860
Here.

1357
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.280
You're gonna need that!

1358
01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:33.900
Mr. Chairman.

1359
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.450
Don't fight with the U.S.

1360
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:47.900
Please get the peace treaty done.

1361
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:53.400
Now. go.

1362
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:59.740
Come on. kid!

1363
01:31:13.690 --> 01:31:17.820
Smoot. you'd better keep your promise.

1364
01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:39.570
Thank you for letting them go ahead.

1365
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:56.780
Fire! Fire in the kitchen!

1366
01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.280
Don't be swayed!

1367
01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.820
Let's call a truce!

1368
01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:10.110
If the fire burns up all the oxygen.

1369
01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.150
<i>we'll all die!</i>

1370
01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:22.950
If you give us medicine. I will.

1371
01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:33.320
Yeah. okay...

1372
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.320
What's the number for
the White House? Fuck!

1373
01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:46.030
+1-202-456-1111. Okay!

1374
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.820
Why?

1375
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:51.240
Wait a minute. How do you know
the number to the White House?

1376
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:53.190
That's on Google.

1377
01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.110
I Googled it.

1378
01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.950
YouTube. too!

1379
01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.030
The President just called.

1380
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:04.030
He's escaped the North Korean submarine.
He's with the Chairman now.

1381
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.230
The call disconnected after that.

1382
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:07.490
We tried calling back. but
we couldn't get through.

1383
01:33:07.650 --> 01:33:08.940
Shut up!

1384
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:11.700
All right. Where did he call from?

1385
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:14.120
Somewhere in the
middle of the East Sea.

1386
01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.250
Nearby some island.

1387
01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:18.830
Dukdo? Dokdu? Dokdo?

1388
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:19.450
Okay.

1389
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:21.540
Dispatch rescuers to
the sat phone location.

1390
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:22.620
Immediately!

1391
01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.540
Yes. ma'am.

1392
01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:46.950
Be careful!

1393
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:03.410
Thank you.

1394
01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:15.150
We got the first-aid kit.

1395
01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.410
<i>It's the Virginia-class
sub from before!</i>

1396
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:38.620
<i>Bearing 30 degrees. Range 3.000m!</i>

1397
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:40.700
<i>It's on the surface. sir.</i>

1398
01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.870
Rise to periscope depth.

1399
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.870
The submarine is here to
rescue President Smoot.

1400
01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.620
Don't worry. The Chairman
will be rescued too.

1401
01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.040
What is it?

1402
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.790
They'll try to sink the
American submarine.

1403
01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.540
It's the only way for
the coup to succeed.

1404
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:12.830
Sir!

1405
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:16.290
Call the Vice President
and tell her to give

1406
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:18.790
the Japanese Prime
Minister this message.

1407
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.410
That North Korean submarine
you bribed to do your dirty work

1408
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:24.830
is going to fire a nuke at you.

1409
01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:32.330
Prepare to fire the torpedo.

1410
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:36.330
Not at the submarine. sir?

1411
01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.330
Fire it.

1412
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:50.080
Prepare the torpedo launch.

1413
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.330
Torpedo 1!

1414
01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:56.410
Again!

1415
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:02.790
Torpedo 2!

1416
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:05.490
Something is wrong!

1417
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:07.410
Torpedo 3!

1418
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:11.830
Torpedo 4!

1419
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.620
Torpedo 8!

1420
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:17.160
Shit! Torpedo 8 is activated!

1421
01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:18.620
No. 8 is working.

1422
01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:20.830
I'll launch it. sir.

1423
01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.660
Shit! The torpedo is stuck!

1424
01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:32.660
What's wrong?

1425
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:33.910
Why isn't it fired?

1426
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:35.290
The torpedo is stuck!

1427
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.990
If the door doesn't open.
it will explode inside. sir!

1428
01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.040
If it doesn't shoot out
now. it'll explode inside!

1429
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:58.500
Brace for impact!

1430
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:59.250
Away from the walls!

1431
01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:00.130
Yes. sir!

1432
01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:06.960
Check the status.

1433
01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:08.000
Yes. sir!

1434
01:37:08.710 --> 01:37:11.210
Our torpedoes are programmed

1435
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:15.130
to self-detonate even if
they miss their targets.

1436
01:37:16.090 --> 01:37:19.340
So we can still inflict damage.
even if the enemy isn't hit.

1437
01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:23.840
The President and the North Korean
Chairman have both been rescued safely.

1438
01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:27.750
What about our President?

1439
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:29.840
President HAN

1440
01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.960
remained on the North Korean submarine.

1441
01:37:33.670 --> 01:37:34.880
The President claims

1442
01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.670
the North Korean submarine is
gonna fire a nuclear missile at Japan.

1443
01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:40.790
What?

1444
01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.420
But the President has
ordered us not to help Japan.

1445
01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:47.760
It's the Prime Minister.

1446
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:49.620
<i>Japanese Minister of Defense</i>

1447
01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:50.830
Yes. Prime Minister.

1448
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:52.840
Yes. sir!

1449
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:55.880
Turn around! Call everyone
to the Defense Agency!

1450
01:37:56.290 --> 01:37:57.630
Call the JMSDF Chief of Staff.

1451
01:37:57.710 --> 01:37:58.250
Hurry!

1452
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.460
<i>Japan Maritime
Self-Defense Force (JMSDF)</i>

1453
01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:10.750
<i>Japanese Self-Defence
Forces Military Satellite</i>

1454
01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:23.960
<i>Japanese Oyashio-Class Submarine</i>

1455
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:31.000
<i>Japanese Soryu-Class Submarine</i>

1456
01:38:31.630 --> 01:38:34.550
Where was President Smoot rescued?

1457
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:37.050
It was just off Dokdo. ma'am.

1458
01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:43.340
Where is our closest naval unit?

1459
01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.670
On standby at Ulleungdo
because of the typhoon.

1460
01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.090
However.

1461
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:53.790
our submarine
flotillas are operational.

1462
01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:58.000
I'm over Takeshima.

1463
01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:00.050
but the winds are too strong!

1464
01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:04.670
<i>Find the sub and destroy it! Our
nation's survival depends on it!</i>

1465
01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:05.750
Understood.

1466
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.170
Drop the sonobuoy!

1467
01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.710
Drop the sonobuoy!

1468
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:26.380
Deploy the active sonar system!

1469
01:39:26.630 --> 01:39:28.340
Deploy the active sonar system!

1470
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.950
Patrol plane dropped an active sonar!

1471
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:53.940
Emergency dive!

1472
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.640
<i>Go below the sonic layer depth!</i>

1473
01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:58.290
Emergency dive! Set depth for 220m!

1474
01:39:58.590 --> 01:39:59.630
Comrade!

1475
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:01.750
Why are you listening to that traitor?

1476
01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.130
Commander!

1477
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.090
Brother.

1478
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:08.460
If you want to live. listen to him.

1479
01:40:10.210 --> 01:40:12.340
Dive to depth 220m.

1480
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:14.460
- Rudder down!
- Rudder down!

1481
01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:29.590
Submarine detected!

1482
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:32.710
From its acoustic signature.
it's not American!

1483
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:34.790
It must be the North Korean sub!

1484
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:35.880
Destroy it!

1485
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.000
Ready to engage!

1486
01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:39.920
Fire the torpedoes!

1487
01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:41.420
Fire the torpedoes!

1488
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:55.460
Prepare to fire 2 sonar decoys.

1489
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:57.270
Prepare to fire sonar decoys!

1490
01:40:58.350 --> 01:41:00.850
Control room! How far
to the sonic layer depth?

1491
01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:04.020
Currently at 160 meters!

1492
01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.690
<i>10 meters to sonic layer depth!</i>

1493
01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.980
<i>60m to optimal depth
to avoid detection!</i>

1494
01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:10.730
Fire sonar decoys!

1495
01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.350
Fire sonar decoys!

1496
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:21.190
Maintain parallel
altitude angle. Full ahead!

1497
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.230
Maintain parallel
altitude angle! Full ahead!

1498
01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:35.350
Explosion confirmed. but
unsure if it was the sub!

1499
01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:40.350
I detect a signal on sonar. but it
may not be the North Korean sub!

1500
01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:43.650
An American sub is also nearby!

1501
01:41:44.690 --> 01:41:45.770
<i>I repeat.</i>

1502
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.520
<i>Destroy it at once!</i>

1503
01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:50.770
Copy.

1504
01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.310
Deploying all depth charges.

1505
01:42:12.650 --> 01:42:13.980
<i>It's a depth charge!</i>

1506
01:42:15.690 --> 01:42:17.270
<i>600 meters behind us.</i>

1507
01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:19.600
<i>400 meters!</i>

1508
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:22.190
<i>200 meters!</i>

1509
01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:24.060
<i>Depth charge...</i>

1510
01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:25.770
<i>Coming directly overhead!</i>

1511
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:27.600
Hard right rudder! Bearing 90 degrees!

1512
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:29.980
<i>Hard right rudder! Bearing 90 degrees!</i>

1513
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:31.190
<i>Hard right rudder!</i>

1514
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:32.480
<i>Hold tight!</i>

1515
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:44.190
We're getting away from the explosions.

1516
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:49.590
<i>Set course for Sim Hung Thaek Seamount.</i>

1517
01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:54.270
Explain why we should go there.

1518
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:56.940
A patrol aircraft came
here in a typhoon!

1519
01:42:57.150 --> 01:43:00.060
It means all enemy subs in the
East Sea are on the hunt for us!

1520
01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:01.980
<i>They're dying to get us!</i>

1521
01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:04.190
<i>If you don't want to be fish bait.</i>

1522
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.060
we must hide where terrain is
complex and it's hard to be detected.

1523
01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:15.730
<i>The U.S. military wouldn't send an
aircraft in the middle of a typhoon.</i>

1524
01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:17.560
<i>The Korean navy. as well.</i>

1525
01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:20.190
That means it's a Japanese plane.

1526
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:22.390
It must've flown
through a typhoon here.

1527
01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.440
because Japan knows you'll
fire nuclear missiles at them.

1528
01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.270
<i>Commander PARK!</i>

1529
01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:30.650
<i>You won't get any more
money from the Yamato.</i>

1530
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:32.770
Let's think of how to get out alive.

1531
01:43:32.850 --> 01:43:35.650
<i>Cut the bullshit. Mr. President!</i>

1532
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:37.850
The only way to ensure our survival

1533
01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:42.020
is for us to uphold our
alliance with China and fight!

1534
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:43.600
Got that?

1535
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:49.310
Give me the launch key.

1536
01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.850
Chul-woo...

1537
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:42.060
Rise to nuclear missile firing depth.

1538
01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:45.230
But at this depth.
they can't find us. sir.

1539
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:46.980
If we rise any higher.
we'll get caught.

1540
01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.770
You dare disobey me?

1541
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:51.940
Only I give the orders! Is that clear?

1542
01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:54.150
Do it.

1543
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.540
Rise to firing depth.

1544
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:02.910
Set to ascend to 30 meters.

1545
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:09.620
<i>Heroic soldiers of the Paektu!</i>

1546
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:12.580
Once we achieve our mission.

1547
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:16.590
China has promised us
generous economic aid

1548
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:22.760
and help revive our blood alliance
to fight against the imperialists.

1549
01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.120
Now. we'll fire

1550
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:31.490
a nuclear missile at Japanese invaders
who tormented us for centuries!

1551
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:37.950
I trust you'll join me in fighting
for our country and our people!

1552
01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:44.630
To the glorious victory of
the heroes of the Paektu!

1553
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:48.990
Commander PARK! Are you insane?

1554
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:51.380
If you fire at Japan.

1555
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:55.500
the U.S. will have to
counterattack as an ally!

1556
01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.290
Since President Smoot knows.
China will deny everything!

1557
01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.380
<i>Shut up!</i>

1558
01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:04.750
Would you trust your enemy of 70 years?

1559
01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.750
Or your blood ally?

1560
01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.660
How much longer to firing depth?

1561
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.630
On-coming torpedo detected!

1562
01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:14.840
Range 4km!

1563
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:17.630
It appears to be from a submarine!

1564
01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:19.380
There's another one!

1565
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:21.590
Range 3.900 meters!

1566
01:46:29.630 --> 01:46:30.670
Control room!

1567
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.840
How far are we from the seamount?

1568
01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.130
Whose submarine is it?

1569
01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.130
I think it's a Japanese
Oyashio-Class sub!

1570
01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:44.590
Control room!

1571
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:46.500
Don't do anything
foolish. Answer me now!

1572
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:48.460
How far to the seamount?

1573
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.590
Sim Hung Thaek Seamount.
Bearing 45 degrees. Range 800 meters!

1574
01:46:55.290 --> 01:46:56.590
What are you doing!

1575
01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:00.050
I said ascend and fire the missile!

1576
01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:04.000
If we don't get away now.
the torpedoes will kill us. sir.

1577
01:47:05.290 --> 01:47:06.290
Shut up!

1578
01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:09.460
<i>Full ahead to the seamount!</i>

1579
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.710
<i>Prepare to fire sonar decoys!</i>

1580
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:16.590
Prepare to fire sonar decoys!

1581
01:47:16.670 --> 01:47:18.210
Set depth to 250m!

1582
01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:20.000
Set depth to 250m!

1583
01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:31.500
- Torpedo range?
- It's within 2.000m!

1584
01:47:31.630 --> 01:47:33.710
- How far to the seamount?
- 400m. sir!

1585
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:35.960
- Current depth?
- 160m!

1586
01:47:36.130 --> 01:47:37.710
Torpedo range 1.400m!

1587
01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:40.590
200m to the seamount. depth 190m!

1588
01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:42.920
Torpedo range 1.100m!

1589
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.670
Hard right rudder. bearing
90! Pivot around the seamount!

1590
01:47:46.130 --> 01:47:47.210
Hard right rudder!

1591
01:47:47.410 --> 01:47:48.490
Hard right rudder!

1592
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:57.040
Fire sonar decoys!

1593
01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.490
Emergency blow!

1594
01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:03.950
Ascend to 130m and rest
on the seamount peak.

1595
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:06.700
Emergency blow to 130m!

1596
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.490
Tell me when they pass under our bow.

1597
01:48:52.450 --> 01:48:53.490
It's coming.

1598
01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.330
It's right beside us.

1599
01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:01.580
Now. sir!

1600
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:03.120
Flood forward trim!

1601
01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.750
Everyone hold tight!

1602
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:05.750
Flood forward trim!

1603
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:06.990
Flood forward trim!

1604
01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:19.580
Fire torpedoes!

1605
01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.370
10 seconds to impact!

1606
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:23.580
9 seconds!

1607
01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.870
We can't sink it!

1608
01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.200
If you do. it's war at Dokdo!

1609
01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.290
5 seconds! 4 seconds!

1610
01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:31.830
Self-detonate it!

1611
01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.160
Self-detonate!

1612
01:49:46.410 --> 01:49:49.250
The Japanese sub wasn't hit.

1613
01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.540
It's ascending.

1614
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:55.040
Thank you.

1615
01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:56.660
Never mind.

1616
01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.660
North Koreans always say.
'Never mind'. It hurts our feelings.

1617
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:07.870
It sounds so cold. Can't
you just say. 'It's okay'?

1618
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:12.080
Let's go to Ulleungdo.

1619
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:15.160
Our flotilla will be waiting there.

1620
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.490
To you they may be 'our'.

1621
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:20.790
but not to us.

1622
01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.870
We're not sure to follow you yet.

1623
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:27.700
Think the traitors will
follow you anywhere?

1624
01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.450
Take position.

1625
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.750
Left 20.

1626
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:36.660
Left 20.

1627
01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:38.990
- Right 50.
- Right 50.

1628
01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:41.040
- Left 10.
- Left 10.

1629
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:43.370
Open it.

1630
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:51.410
Three. two. one.

1631
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:56.950
<i>6 km southeast. Depth 300m.</i>

1632
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:59.160
Something is approaching.

1633
01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.750
Could be a sperm whale...

1634
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.490
The speed and course?

1635
01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:06.490
Speed. 20 knots.
Course. straight for us.

1636
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:08.290
That's no whale!

1637
01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:17.620
It's a Japanese Soryu-Class
sub! Hide behind the seamount!

1638
01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.450
Rise to nuclear missile firing depth!

1639
01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:25.660
But it's safer here. sir. If
we go up. we'll be targeted.

1640
01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.830
I won't repeat myself again.

1641
01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.660
Go and treat it.

1642
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:37.660
Rise up now!

1643
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:43.830
If we go up any higher.
we'll be targeted!

1644
01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.750
I hear torpedo launch tubes opening!

1645
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:49.950
They've fired. sir!

1646
01:51:51.150 --> 01:51:54.070
Control room! Go behind the seamount!

1647
01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:59.740
We've reached firing depth.

1648
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:03.950
Get back in trim.

1649
01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:13.740
Torpedo range 5km! Time
to impact 250 seconds!

1650
01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:15.400
<i>You sons of bitches!</i>

1651
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:17.030
<i>Don't just stand there!</i>

1652
01:52:17.190 --> 01:52:19.030
<i>245 seconds to impact!</i>

1653
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:20.740
<i>Are you deaf?</i>

1654
01:52:21.110 --> 01:52:21.900
Take cover!

1655
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:24.860
<i>Listen to me! Move!</i>

1656
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:26.650
<i>235 seconds to impact!</i>

1657
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.610
<i>We'll all die!</i>

1658
01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:30.690
<i>Come on!</i>

1659
01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.690
<i>230 seconds to impact!</i>

1660
01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:34.150
<i>Go to the seamount!</i>

1661
01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:37.030
<i>Go behind the seamount!</i>

1662
01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:39.070
We've reached firing depth.

1663
01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:42.740
But while the missile is fired.
we won't be able to move.

1664
01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:46.320
We may fire one. but they'll
be no time for a second!

1665
01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.900
One is enough to make our
nation a powerful socialist state.

1666
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:52.900
Open the launch tube.

1667
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:58.570
Opening vertical launch tube.

1668
01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:10.990
I'll start the countdown. sir.

1669
01:53:12.690 --> 01:53:13.740
10 seconds.

1670
01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.570
9 seconds.

1671
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:18.490
8 seconds.

1672
01:53:19.530 --> 01:53:20.740
7 seconds.

1673
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:22.530
6 seconds.

1674
01:53:23.610 --> 01:53:24.450
5...

1675
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.110
Commander!

1676
01:53:26.150 --> 01:53:27.610
Are you insane?

1677
01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:32.740
If you fire that missile.

1678
01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:37.450
it won't be just the Japanese.
but North Koreans...

1679
01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:39.780
No!

1680
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:44.360
The future of the Korean
people will be gone!

1681
01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:48.820
Let's try to survive together!

1682
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:51.860
But if someone must die.
let it be just us here.

1683
01:53:56.150 --> 01:53:58.900
Don't threaten me!
You don't have the guts!

1684
01:54:02.190 --> 01:54:03.950
Prepare to fire again!

1685
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.900
First Officer. sir!

1686
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:15.570
Calm down. men!

1687
01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:33.950
Time to impact. 120 seconds!

1688
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.150
Emergency dive! All hands to the bow!

1689
01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.190
Emergency dive! All hands to the bow!

1690
01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.240
All hands to the bow!

1691
01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:41.780
Let go.

1692
01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:43.150
Be careful.

1693
01:54:45.690 --> 01:54:46.860
To the bow!

1694
01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:48.950
Go! Go! Go!

1695
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:50.570
Hurry up!

1696
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:52.070
Hold on tight!

1697
01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.320
Are you all right?

1698
01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:03.490
Never mind.

1699
01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:09.820
Where are they running to?

1700
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:12.320
The heavier the bow
is. the quicker we dive.

1701
01:55:12.850 --> 01:55:14.310
Set depth to 250m!

1702
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:15.730
Set to 250m!

1703
01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.150
Go behind the peak. then level off.

1704
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:23.390
Going behind the peak. sir!

1705
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:29.020
35 seconds to impact!

1706
01:55:32.230 --> 01:55:33.770
Levelling off. sir!

1707
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:35.730
Back to positions!

1708
01:55:36.850 --> 01:55:37.810
Run! Run!

1709
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:39.560
Hurry!

1710
01:55:39.690 --> 01:55:40.650
Fire stern torpedo!

1711
01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:42.020
Intercept it!

1712
01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.440
Firing stern torpedo!

1713
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:45.150
Fire!

1714
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.480
Take care of yourself.

1715
01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:55.520
What's the range
between ours and theirs?

1716
01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:57.230
Only a few seconds away.

1717
01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.730
6 seconds. 5. 4...

1718
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.020
Self-detonate!

1719
01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:20.190
There's another one headed here!

1720
01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.480
10 seconds!

1721
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:22.810
No. 9 seconds to impact!

1722
01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:24.480
- Fire stern torpedo!
- Firing stern torpedo!

1723
01:56:26.230 --> 01:56:27.230
Detonate!

1724
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:40.650
Take positions!

1725
01:56:40.770 --> 01:56:42.150
Take positions!

1726
01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.890
Go! Go!

1727
01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:07.980
Report the damages.

1728
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:09.730
The ballast tank is damaged.

1729
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:11.690
If we don't surface now. we'll sink.

1730
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:13.060
Can it be repaired?

1731
01:57:13.190 --> 01:57:14.060
Negative. sir.

1732
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:15.850
We'll have to dock first.

1733
01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:19.100
Stern torpedo room has been hit!

1734
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:23.390
Water is flooding in! Evacuating
and closing hatch doors!

1735
01:57:24.850 --> 01:57:26.390
Everyone get out!

1736
01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:31.650
Get out! Run!

1737
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.100
Enemy sub is approaching.

1738
01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:37.060
At 4.500 meters!

1739
01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.560
A torpedo hatch is opening.

1740
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:45.310
It's from 3 seconds ago.
They've already fired.

1741
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:49.150
I'll cancel the countdown.

1742
01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:56.020
I think this is the end. Mr. President.

1743
01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:05.100
Is communication possible?

1744
01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:07.520
Only low-frequency transmissions.

1745
01:58:07.690 --> 01:58:10.770
Do you know the ROK Navy's frequency?

1746
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.190
I have it memorized. sir.

1747
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:18.150
It's set to the ROK Navy. sir.

1748
01:58:32.190 --> 01:58:35.600
This is President HAN Gyeong-jae.

1749
01:58:37.730 --> 01:58:40.190
I charge the South Korean military

1750
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:45.560
to continue to protect our
land and preserve peace.

1751
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:50.690
Madam Prime Minister.

1752
01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:57.390
Please look after our country well.

1753
01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:21.270
<i>3 more submarines approaching.</i>

1754
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:25.190
I hear on-coming torpedoes. sir.

1755
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:32.890
Long live our unified Korea!

1756
01:59:36.230 --> 01:59:38.100
My grandchildren

1757
01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:44.940
and my daughter live in Hamheung.

1758
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:49.940
A peace agreement will mean
better lives for them too. right?

1759
01:59:54.650 --> 01:59:56.690
Let's pray it to be.

1760
01:59:59.390 --> 02:00:01.810
How does one pray?

1761
02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:04.480
Like this?

1762
02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:15.190
<i>This is the South Korean Navy.</i>

1763
02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:18.810
<i>You've entered our waters.</i>

1764
02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:22.270
<i>Ascend immediately!</i>

1765
02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:27.940
<i>This is the South Korean Navy.</i>

1766
02:01:28.890 --> 02:01:31.020
<i>You've entered our waters.</i>

1767
02:01:32.730 --> 02:01:34.810
<i>Ascend immediately!</i>

1768
02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:44.990
The Japanese submarine
is retreating. sir!

1769
02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:49.160
The 3 submarines are of the ROK Navy!

1770
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:58.620
Turn on the loudspeakers!

1771
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:07.090
Members of the ROK
Navy. it is a pleasure.

1772
02:02:09.450 --> 02:02:13.070
The Paektu Submarine will ascend.

1773
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:23.780
Begin ascent!

1774
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:34.320
<i>Now. for some good news.</i>

1775
02:02:34.450 --> 02:02:40.780
<i>Typhoon Steel Rain has passed Dokdo
and is headed toward Hokkaido. Japan.</i>

1776
02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.320
<i>The strongest typhoon on record...</i>

1777
02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.190
Minister of Defense.
Deploy all forces to Dokdo.

1778
02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:49.490
Yes. ma'am.

1779
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:00.950
The Prime Minister promised
your legacy will continue.

1780
02:05:01.150 --> 02:05:04.570
He said you need not worry.

1781
02:05:05.110 --> 02:05:08.650
I knew the Chinese and Korean
bastards weren't to be trusted.

1782
02:05:10.190 --> 02:05:12.280
Please give him my apologies

1783
02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.950
for my missteps.

1784
02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:18.240
About those missteps...

1785
02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:22.450
You're the only one who
can take responsibility.

1786
02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:26.400
So he asked that you do!

1787
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:56.780
Well. maybe you should get out.

1788
02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:58.900
President HAN? Please join us?

1789
02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.190
Fantastic.

1790
02:06:04.610 --> 02:06:07.150
Sometime. we should
go on a boat trip together.

1791
02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:13.070
I invite you to visit Seoul.

1792
02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:27.820
<i>Steel Rain 2: Summit</i>

1793
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:32.330
<i>The leaders of South and North
Korea have arrived together.</i>

1794
02:07:32.410 --> 02:07:34.150
<i>Please welcome them with a big hand!</i>

1795
02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:35.370
Welcome.

1796
02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:39.410
How is your injury coming along?

1797
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:41.830
It's much better. Thank you.

1798
02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:46.080
After you. Mr. President.

1799
02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:56.750
My fellow Koreans.

1800
02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:01.870
Over the past few years.
many people asked me.

1801
02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:05.490
'Can unification really happen?'

1802
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:11.950
I always gave a vague
answer and said. 'It'll work out.'

1803
02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:17.490
But today. I can answer
with complete conviction.

1804
02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:25.120
Unification can't be achieved by
the will or power of one President.

1805
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:31.490
nor by determination and power
just of politicians and officials.

1806
02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:36.120
We recently saw the end of a
war that began 70 years ago.

1807
02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:39.910
A peace agreement between the
U.S. and North Korea from 30 years ago.

1808
02:08:40.410 --> 02:08:42.490
has been finally completed.

1809
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:48.040
It may take a few more
decades to build peace

1810
02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:52.250
and for South and North Korea
to trust and understand each other.

1811
02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:59.200
The path to unification will
require tremendous effort.

1812
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:04.410
Beloved citizens.

1813
02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:09.160
I can say one thing with certainty

1814
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:14.590
that without your efforts.
nothing will happen.

1815
02:09:17.010 --> 02:09:19.300
So I ask you now.

1816
02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:27.570
Are you willing to realize
unification in our time?
