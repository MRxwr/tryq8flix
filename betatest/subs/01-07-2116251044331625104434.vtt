Interesting.

21
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:02.373
a little bit different than what

22
00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:03.541
I imagined...

23
00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:04.917
Oh! Sorry... That's an old...

Hey...

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:07.503
(unclear rambling)
Looks like more of an accurate

27
00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:08.254
portrayal.

28
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:08.963

Yea!... a little bit different

34
00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:17.304

35
00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:18.556

Callbacks

41
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:24.478
Could we...
lose that possibly?

42
00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:25.062
For...?

43
00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.397
For us?...
We were kinda thinking of a

44
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:27.648
cleaner...

51
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:35.739
(clears throat)

52
00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:36.991

58
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.217
You smell that?

59
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.472
That's the Holidays

60

62
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.357
On my way back...

63
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.111

67
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.453

68
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:25.581
Everyone's...

69
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.085
Everyone's going home to see their families.

70
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:31.587

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:54.610
God. what the fuck was that?

80
00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:57.196
Are you kidding me?

81
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.782
*bangs fist on railing*

82
00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:01.784
music fades in...

83
00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.960
(music grows)

84
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.297
(music blares)

85
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.448

(laughs)

102
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.141

going!

104

(Door Opens)

113
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:33.685

114
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.563
(Door Opens)

115
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.691

Well. my beautiful Artists!

Oh. Fuck this shit!

121

Ok. so...

124
00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.129
We. uh...

125
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.257
Let's go over rehearsal from yesterday. We changed up a few things...

126
00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:05.676
Yea. we changed some of the blocking.

127
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.010
Yes. that's right.

128
00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:09.221
I think I came this way. and...

129
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:11.223
instead of him just grabbing his keys off the table...

130
00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:13.225
I--I put my hand over his to... um...

131
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.604
Yes! I see...

132
00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.606

133
00:07:19.982 --> 00:07:21.984
Oh. hey. What's up. man?

134
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.777
Hi

135
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:24.903
So. uh...

136
00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.531
I saw the Cast List...

137
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:31.160
Mm-Hmm... What about it?

138
00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:35.831
Well. I...

139
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.501
... I was wondering "What The Fuck". man?

140
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.754
Excuse me?

141
00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:45.382
Look. I don't know what kind of show you're trying

142
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.384
to put on here. but it was my part and you just...

143
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.594
gave it away.

144
00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:52.306
I don't know what you're talking about.

145
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.933
You know how hard I worked on that part?

146
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.935
How I gave it my all day in & day out?!

147
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.731
Y-Y-You know! I am the perfect guy to play Willy Loman

148
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.983
But you just... CUT ME OUT!

149
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.112
Ok...

150
00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:11.658
What do you want from me. Doug?

151
00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:12.910
What you can do for me...

152
00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.370
Is Re-Cast the show!

153
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.163
(sarcastic chuckle)

154
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:17.581
"Recast The Show"

155
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.709
Who the Fuck you think you are?

156
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.294
Are you fucking kidding me?

157
00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:23.629
Are you?!

158
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.881
You fucking audit my class!

159
00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.925
Technically you shouldn't even be here.

160
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.093
Well. technically I have been acting since

161
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.387
before you were born.
Technically I can kick you out

162
00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:33.847
of here so Fucking FAST

163
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:35.599
You'll never know what hit you!

164
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.642
(chuckles) You're bluffing

165
00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.185
Oh! Am I?

166
00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:38.810
Pfft!

167
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.146
Look at you.

168
00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:44.066
You fucking has been...

Oh. sure. you've been in things here and there.

170
00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.237
Yea.

171
00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.781
But you. my friend. are no leading man.

172
00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.282
You're pathetic! (Pats on Shoulder)

173
00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:55.244
Look...

174
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.287
We're going more Modern with the Show

175
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.956
Therefore. I Cast younger. Ok?

176
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:00.540
This shit happens all the time.

177
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.416
Doug

178
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.292
But you wouldn't know anything

179
00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.210
about it…

180
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:04.753
Would you?

181
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.171
Pfft!

182
00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:07.923
LINE!!

183
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.633
No wonder you're all alone...

184
00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.094
You know what you are?

185
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.013
You're a washed up old man waiting to die.

186
00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:17.641
And I just can't believe you

187
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:19.184
haven't done us all the favor

188
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.727
and already kill yourself.

189
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.897
What are you waiting for. Doug?

190
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:27.943

YOU'LL NEVER WORK IN THIS TOWN

199
00:09:46.295 --> 00:09:47.129

200
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:48.463

207
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:03.687
Somebody call an Ambulance!!

208
00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.689

209
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.609

210
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.446
over phone Hello?... We need help. someone's having a heart attack!

211
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.375
Now. we could do this the easy way...

212
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:27.836
Or the hard way...

213
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.088
Its all up to you.

214
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.759
I can be any way you want me to be.

215
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.969
In fact. I'll tell you what we're gonna do here.

216
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.765
We're gonna find out if this really works

217
00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:42.351
Maybe you can use it on your parole hearing. eh?

218
00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.313
My dreams have all been taken away from me

219
00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:48.315
because of you!

220
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:51.401
And I am sick! Of all the bullshit!

221
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.862
Sick of all the lies!

222
00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.241
Sorry (clears throat)

223
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.786
I mean. maybe you can use it on

224
00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:02.329
your parole hearing…

225
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:03.872
... get an early release.

226
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.457
What d'ya think about that?

227
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.834
Its all over for me.

228
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.003
You mean it?

229
00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:15.050
Its all over.

230
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.599
Would you like to see it... any other way?

231
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.687
You're listening to the sweet sounds of KJBB

232

(laughter continues)

243
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.979
(laughter stops)

244
00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.259
Where the hell am I?

245
00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.596
The Where matters not. its the Why

246
00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.598
you should be concerning yourself with

247
00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.935
What do you want with me?

248
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.480
I have nothing. I'm a Nobody.

249
00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.690
True.

250
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.233
But that's all going to change.

251
00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.943
Soon. the world will now the name

252
00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:26.152
Doug Bridgers!

253
00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.822
One of the Greatest Actors to grace Stage or Screen

254
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.199
I'm here to ensure you don't stray

255
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.784
From the path to Stardom.

256
00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:34.786
As I've had to do many times in the past

257
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.413
I'm intervening.

258
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.998
So a Genius isn't forgotten in his own Era.

259
00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.175
Are you not Doug Bridgers?

260
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.761
Did I get the wrong fucking guy?!

261
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.973
(examining)

262
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:56.641
No!

263
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.726
You're him.

264
00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.227
You're THE Doug Bridgers.

265
00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.646
Well. before your prime mind you

266
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.648
My boy. we have work to do!

267
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:04.691
Look at you!

268
00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.026
Pitiful. Has been. Never was...

269
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.195
Living in Squalor. Rejected…

270
00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.864
Passed over. Pathetic!

271
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.241
I'm a Big Fan!

272
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.869
I know your story all too well...

273
00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.871
The times & places change

274
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.873
But it all ends about the same.

275
00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:25.545
I guess so.

276
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:26.880
Yes! I'm quite familiar

277
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.257
of the sordid details of your Career’s path

278
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.217
As well as the tumultuous Home Life

279
00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.803
Intertwined. woven in the Looms foretelling.

280
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.681
Once. filled with Promise & Hope

281
00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.642
Your talent & potential Overshadowed by

282
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.103
Better Looking. Better Connected & now...

283
00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.105
Younger Actors...

284
00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.274
Taking the leading parts while you're

285
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.276
time & time again in supporting roles.

286
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.236
You tried...

287
00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.238
Gallantly. at first

288
00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.698
to hide the resentment.

289
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.700
Humbly feigning appreciation.

290
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.328
It made you bitter. Angry.

291
00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.330
Honestly it affected your work

292
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.332
Made it Darker.

293
00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.334
I'm partial to this chapter.

294
00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.463
You turn that misery into some real compelling performances.

295
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:10.673
Still...

296
00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:11.674
Unappreciated by everyone

297
00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:12.675
Directors. Fellow Actors.

298
00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:13.760
Critics...

299
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.346
Everyone...

300
00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.348
Feeling pitiful...

301
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.016
Hollow...

302
00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.309
The drinking helped

303
00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.770
But when that became too much of a problem

304
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.772
She came into the picture.

305
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.733
Cleaned you up. put you back on your feet.

306
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.528
With Her by your side. you re- doubled your efforts...

307
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.655
Auditioning as hard as ever...

308
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:34.864
Struggling through the two-faced

309
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.157
Backstabbing…

310
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.159
... nature of the Beast

311
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.911
Making even some small success...

312
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:41.287
... with a television role

313
00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.790
But Forgettable Flashes Fade Out Fast!

314
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.376
The money came and went and before long

315
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.378
She did too...

316
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.338
The rift between you grew...

317
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:53.299
You. being emotionally unavailable for Her

318
00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:55.009
She. blaming your craft.

319
00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.845
A Sacrifice you'd never make.

320
00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.888
Lost again. the comforts of the Drink

321
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.890
came back & before long you find yourself

322
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.892
out month to month living

323
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:03.935
in a piss smelling hovel

324
00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:04.978
killing yourself about how you

325
00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.062
could have done it better

326
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.022
Blaming yourself for...

327
00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:10.024
(Doug cries)

328
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.777
For Fuck's Sake!

329
00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.697
Would you look at yourself?

330
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.993
Frankly. its disgusting.

331
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.370
They say never meet your heroes...

332
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.750
Enough already!

333
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.169
Save the water works for the Big Screen!

334
00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.214
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF BRIDGERS!! (slap)

335
00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:36.259
Honestly. you left me no choice.

336
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.221
Cheer up. friend.

337
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.931
I'm here to tell you...

338
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.933
Your story's not a tragedy.

339
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:46.102
Its not?

340
00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:46.978
No.

341
00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.355
Its a comedy.

342
00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:51.774
And I know the punchline.

343
00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.568
A comeback tale for the ages...

344
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.278
The Big Break that is the SPARK

345
00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:57.280
that lights is all up for you!

346
00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.452
I'm sorry. what is this?

347
00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:04.454
Who the fuck are you?

348
00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.165
Always the wrong questions.

349
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.125
With many moniker over the Millennia.

350
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.460
Its hard to keep track.

351
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.462
If you must. you can refer to me as Balthazar

352
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.797
But the important element is that

353
00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:16.799
everything you've been working toward...

354
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.052
All that you have ever desired...

355
00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.054
is within your grasp if you simply listen

356
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.097
... and trust me.

357
00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.059
oh yea?

358
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.353
So... Why Now?...

359
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.149
I mean. after all the shit I've endured...

360
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:35.818
Been fucked over...Every effort...

361
00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.070
has been shunned...

362
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.238
So why now? Why me. huh?

363
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.949
Because you are in possession

364
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.534
of the greatest gift ever bestowed on mankind

365
00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.120
the power to Entertain!

366
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.122
Once for a brief moment in time.

367
00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:51.125
a Performer emerges inhabited by the Flame.

368
00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.295
When that Fire is fed properly. it can grow

369
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.839
It can grow into an all consuming Inferno.

370
00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.759
Undeniable. Inescapable...

371
00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.470
burning so bright. it draws all focus!

372
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.473
You. my boy. are such a chosen vessel.

373
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.434
The Fire resides within you.

374
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.895
With it. you will blaze a path for Glory...

375
00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:14.065
The Prodigal Phoenix!!

376
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.358
You'll show them all. Doug...

377
00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.819
You'll show them all!!

378
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:23.408
Hey...

379
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.284
Hey!

380
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.578
Hey. wait up!!

381
00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:29.580
(echoing running steps)

382
00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:42.969
(Echo)

383
00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:30.141
(Ocean Sounds)

384
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.800
AAAhhh!

385
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.802
The crashing waves!

386
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:07.261
As if Poseidon himself applauds

387
00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:08.763
your talent...

388
00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:11.724
Can you hear it within the maelstrom. Doug?

389
00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:14.894
The thunderous. roaring audience...

390
00:23:15.478 --> 00:23:17.480
Its intoxicating!

391
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.482
A siren's call!

392
00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:20.900
Driving many a-Thespian to a

393
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.318
depraved & demented madness!

394
00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:25.446
This quest for the...

395
00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:27.448
veneration the audience can provide has

396
00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:28.991
left scores of unworthy

397
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:30.576
unknowns..

398
00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:33.037
destitute. miserable dying

399
00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:35.039
lonely paupers deaths.

400
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:36.749
This is not what fate has in

401
00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:38.042
store for you.

402
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:40.336
So. what say you. Douglas?

403
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.338
Will you set a course for

404
00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:43.631
Destiny?

405
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:47.218
You know I smoked a little grass

406
00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:48.302
in my time

407
00:23:49.554 --> 00:23:50.555
But I don't think I'm prepared

408
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:51.556
for whatever

409
00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.724
Devil fleshed...

410
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:55.726
Fairy Bullshit you got there...

411
00:23:57.812 --> 00:23:58.896
Your Puritanical Prudishness is

412
00:23:58.896 --> 00:23:59.981
really

413
00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:01.065
preventing you from having a

414
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:02.150
good time...

415
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:03.860
Besides. this is merely some of

416
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.111
the Bard's own herb.

417
00:24:08.114 --> 00:24:09.240
Its more of the symbolism than

418
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.366
the act of smoking...

419
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.577
Do you not trust I have your

420
00:24:12.577 --> 00:24:13.953
best interests in mind?...

421
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.081
Yea...
Well. all the same...

422
00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:19.208
I think i'll pass.

423
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:21.002
Very well. then. I suppose we

424
00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:22.003
should...

425
00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:23.004
get you back to it. then. shall

426
00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:24.005
we?

427
00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:07.650
(Rumble)

428
00:26:26.544 --> 00:26:27.670
Doug. let's be clear...

429
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.630
I know I'm your Manager and all...

430
00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:31.507
But you need this.

431
00:26:32.216 --> 00:26:33.759
It'll only help your career.

432
00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:35.052
Well...

433
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:36.846
What's left of it.

434
00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:39.098
Technology...

435
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.599
Demand for social media...

436
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:42.059
This shit's here!

437
00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:43.436
You need to learn to love it if

438
00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:44.437
you want get in the game.

439
00:26:44.562 --> 00:26:46.147
Alright. alright...

440
00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:47.148
See...

441
00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:48.858
Right now. we're small fish

442
00:26:48.858 --> 00:26:50.860
in a Giant Fucking Ocean!

443
00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:52.236
... So?...

444
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.154
Well...

445
00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:55.197
In order to get the better roles.

446
00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:57.199
you need to catch the bigger fish.

447
00:26:57.283 --> 00:26:59.285
Which means be more competitive.

448
00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:00.745
Its gonna be harder to get the

449
00:27:00.745 --> 00:27:01.662
roles you WANT.

450
00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:02.788
That's all.

451
00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:04.457
Right now...

452
00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:05.833
I can probably get you a decent

453
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:07.209
student film that pays...

454
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:08.127
Like...

455
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:10.671
AFI or something...

456
00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.384
You gotta crawl before you can walk

457
00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.053
You know. a lot of this you can

458
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:18.179
tape yourself with your phone.

459
00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:20.931
You know. start a Youtube

460
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.017
Get yourself out there...

461
00:27:24.518 --> 00:27:26.520
So. when am I gonna get my Big Break?

462
00:27:27.897 --> 00:27:28.647
Well...

463
00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.775
There's this party this weekend

464
00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:31.817

465
00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:32.902
filmmakers are throwing...

466
00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:35.363
Some... short release party...

467
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:36.364
No thanks.

468
00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.991
Are you kidding?

469
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.201
You know. a lot about this

470
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:41.202
business is Networking

471
00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:42.203
I can't do this shit all by

472
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:43.204
myself.

473
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.500
Besides...

474
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.168
There's gonna be a lot of people there.

475
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.461
And its guaranteed to be one

476
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:51.462
hell of a night!

477
00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:53.714
Actors everywhere. Models

478
00:27:53.714 --> 00:27:54.715
everywhere...

479
00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:57.885
And do you know what that means?

480
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:00.262
NETWORKING!!

481
00:28:03.224 --> 00:28:05.226
Who knows. something could happen...

482
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:08.813
You really think so?

483
00:28:08.813 --> 00:28:10.064
Of course!

484
00:28:10.064 --> 00:28:11.065

489
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:55.234
Doug: "You don't like that do you?

490
00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:57.820
Nah... Hurts doesn't it. mother fucker?!

Hurts doesn't it. mother fucker..."

493
00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:06.036
"Not in the house. Charlie. No

494
00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:07.246

495
00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:11.500
He wasn't supposed to be here...

496
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.210
No one was supposed to be there. Charlie...

497
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.044
Not in the house!

498
00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:16.797
He wasn't supposed to be there.

499
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:18.549
No one was supposed to be there.

500
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:19.967
Charlie. not in the house!"

501
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.100

503
00:30:14.897 --> 00:30:16.899

505
00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:19.360
(clears throat)

506
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.486
Sue: Alright. Doug... Uh.

507
00:30:20.486 --> 00:30:21.612
whenever you're ready.

508
00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:24.865
You know what being a Cross
Country Trucker really is all

509
00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:25.824

510
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:28.410
Its about going cross country...

511
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:31.080
Ok... Uh...

512
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.456
Director: Whenever you're ready... Doug: Ok. Uh...

00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:34.458
Director: Go right into it...

514
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.752
Director: Action!

515
00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:45.553
Can I start over?

516
00:30:45.553 --> 00:30:47.555
Director: What?

517
00:30:49.515 --> 00:30:50.933
90% of the time. they're on Uppers.

518
00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:52.059
'cause they gotta go all the way through.

519
00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:53.561
You know. gotta go from one coast to the other coast

520
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:54.228
That's the problem. Cause most

521
00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:55.563
of the time they don't even
realize it...

522
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.481
Most of the time they don't even

523
00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:58.482
realize they're even SPI---

524
00:30:58.899 --> 00:31:00.901

You come in there. and get in my way...

I'm trying to save a life! You understand that?!

529
00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:15.165
I'm trying to save this woman

530
00:31:15.165 --> 00:31:17.334
I mean. she's on my table! I am operating on her

531
00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:19.336
And you come in there and start bothering me?

532
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:20.629

533
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.463

536
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:27.511
You just seem to be... its its

537
00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:29.638
Very angry...You know?

538
00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:30.889
And your relationship with this

539
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.182
person is a little more to it...

540
00:31:32.975 --> 00:31:34.977
Give me a little...different levels...

541
00:31:34.977 --> 00:31:36.312
Its kind of one note.

542
00:31:36.312 --> 00:31:39.690
I mean. you understand he's upset...

543
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.067
She's entered his operating room...

544
00:31:42.318 --> 00:31:44.528
Its just its too loud and its too one note.

545
00:31:44.528 --> 00:31:45.487

546
00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:47.489
How dare you come into my E.R.

547
00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.491
and start telling me what to do. It is...

548
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:51.493
My Operating Room...I--I...

549
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:52.494
don't expect you to understand

550
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:53.495
that. you're new here.

551
00:31:54.288 --> 00:31:56.290
You don't understand what's going on.

552
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.292
in this E.R. but right now

553
00:31:58.292 --> 00:32:00.711
I am in charge. I am the GOD HERE

554
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:02.630
You understand that? So--So...

555
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.632
Don't come in interrupting...

556
00:32:04.632 --> 00:32:06.634
my operation. when in fact...

557
00:32:06.634 --> 00:32:08.135
Director 2: make it Fantastical!

558
00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:10.012
Excuse me?

559
00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:12.598
Make it more Fantastical.

560
00:32:13.891 --> 00:32:15.893
Fantastical?...

561
00:32:16.894 --> 00:32:18.270
... Do you have questions about that?

562
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.064
Do you understand what that means?...

563
00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:23.984
Ok. (clears throat)

564
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:58.435
Right on Red... Right on Red!

565
00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.979
Jesus...

566
00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:05.150
(radio chatter)

567
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:17.538
Come on! What are you waiting
for?

568
00:33:17.538 --> 00:33:18.205
(Honks Horn)

569
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.832
Let's go!

570
00:33:20.249 --> 00:33:22.251
Jesus. it says "Stop" not "Park"

571
00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:48.360
Ugh! Jesus Christ!

572
00:33:50.237 --> 00:33:51.572
You coulda made it!

573
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.365
Come on. no guts no glory. Let's
go!

574
00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:54.032
(Honks Horn)

575
00:33:56.702 --> 00:33:57.619
The one time you DON'T want to

576
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:58.537
get in front of an asshole & you

577
00:33:58.537 --> 00:33:59.455
do...

578
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:01.457
Of course.

579
00:34:06.003 --> 00:34:08.005
Seriously?...

580
00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:13.260
(You! Get the fuck outta the car!)

581
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.262
(You wanna be tough?!)

582
00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:17.264
(Get outta the fuckin' car.)

583
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:18.432
I'll fuckin' kill you!

584
00:34:18.432 --> 00:34:19.600
Get the fuck outta the car!

585
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.602
GET OUTTA THE FUCKIN' CAR!!

586
00:34:21.602 --> 00:34:22.519
You got something' to fuckin' say

587
00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:23.979
Get out of the fuckin' car & say it!

588
00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:24.480
Excuse me?!

589
00:34:28.358 --> 00:34:29.568
You got a fuckin' problem?

590
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:31.570
No. ...What's that?

591
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.572
NO! You want a fuckin' piece of me?

592
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:35.032
Oh. fuck off.

593
00:34:35.032 --> 00:34:36.158
What the fuck did you say to me?!

594
00:34:36.158 --> 00:34:37.409
You heard me FUCK OFF!!

595
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.411
(Enter Acid Jazz)

596
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:12.569
Fuck you. man!

597
00:35:54.278 --> 00:35:59.157
(sirens)

598
00:36:26.268 --> 00:36:28.270
(more sirens)

599
00:36:42.618 --> 00:36:46.455
(claps) Bravo!! Bravo!!

600
00:36:46.455 --> 00:36:48.457
Remarkable Performance.

601
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:50.459
Well done!

602
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:52.461
What do you care?

603
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.922
(Balthazar slurps coffee)

604
00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:57.090
MMMMM!! I must say. Doug.

605
00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:59.217
This is a damn fine cup of coffee.

606
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:01.219
Place is a bit of a shit hole. though...

607
00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:05.807
MMMM!!

608
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:07.351
Real Grade-A Dominicano shit!

609
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:09.019
I do love a good dark roast...

610
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:11.355
OOOOhhh That is one nasty shiner

611
00:37:11.355 --> 00:37:12.856
you’ve got there. boy...

612
00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:14.858
Making new friends?...

613
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:16.860
So what now?

614
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.862
Keep plugging away just to be shit on?

615
00:37:20.656 --> 00:37:22.950
I can't keep going like this...

616
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.452
Oh. honestly. Doug. lighten up!

617
00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:27.454
Its not the end of days...

618
00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:30.165
So you stank up a few audition rooms

619
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:32.167
No shortage of that in Hollywoodland.

620
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:33.669
plenty more on the horizon!

621
00:37:33.669 --> 00:37:35.671
Fuck you. this is bullshit

622
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:37.506
You know. all this is all so

623
00:37:37.506 --> 00:37:38.757
fucking unfair!

624
00:37:40.217 --> 00:37:41.635
If they just give me a chance...

625
00:37:41.635 --> 00:37:42.302
What do I have to do? Crucify

626
00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:44.972
some mother fuckers?
Crucify some mother fuckers?

627
00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:46.848
Tsk. tsk. tsk...

628
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.141
Honestly. Doug. you needn't

629
00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:49.142
stoop to such

630
00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:51.019
lowly behavior... Besides.

631
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:52.521
Its not your style.

632
00:37:52.521 --> 00:37:54.523
Its mine.

633
00:37:56.149 --> 00:37:57.567
I can be intimidating.

634
00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:59.277
(Sarcastic laughs)

635
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:00.529
Douggie. Sweetie!!

636
00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:02.531
You can play those roles.

637
00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:03.532
And I know you're referring to

638
00:38:03.532 --> 00:38:04.533
your showdown.

639
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:06.159
with your Acting Coach

640
00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:07.035
I wouldn't call that successful

641
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:09.204
coercion.
Did you get what you want from

642
00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:10.455
that little altercation?

643
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:12.874
Mother Fucker gave the role to someone else.

644
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:15.335
The petty complaints of a bitter old man.

645
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.505
Its sad. Doug. but nobody gives a fuck

646
00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:19.756
about the theater anymore.

647
00:38:20.132 --> 00:38:21.216
You want to play Willy Loman?

648
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:22.759
Play him on the Big Screen!

649
00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:24.052
Or the Small Screen.

650
00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:26.054
Or the even Smaller Screen...

651
00:38:26.346 --> 00:38:28.348
Honestly. Doug. don't you understand?

652
00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:30.350
The adoration potential for these

653
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.352
technological terrors is

654
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.354
substantially larger!

655
00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:35.689
You need exposure. friend!

656
00:38:35.689 --> 00:38:37.315
And the theater just simply doesn't have the

657
00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.901
audience capacity for a Doug Bridgers performance.

658
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.362
So. I'm supposed to get on Instagram?

659
00:38:42.696 --> 00:38:44.114
Take selfies?...

660
00:38:44.114 --> 00:38:46.116
Make myself look like a....

661
00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:47.909
desperate asshole?!..

662
00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:49.327
That's gonna make me a star?!

663
00:38:49.453 --> 00:38:50.370
"The only thing you have in this

664
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:51.288
world is what you can sell."

665
00:38:51.288 --> 00:38:52.205
--Arthur Miller

666
00:38:52.205 --> 00:38:54.207
There's your fucking Arthur Miller!

667
00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:56.209
In this case. Doug. you are the product.

668
00:38:56.543 --> 00:38:58.545
And you have to convince these bastards

669
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:00.797
That this...

670
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:03.091
decomposing. lamentable.

671
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:04.843
common looking ol' gas bag

672
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.136
is worthy of purchase.

673
00:39:06.136 --> 00:39:08.138
You've got to sell yourself. my boy!

674
00:39:08.138 --> 00:39:09.139
No--no!

675
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:10.766
That's where Gil comes in.

676
00:39:11.183 --> 00:39:12.684
I'm the talent. he's the Manager.

677
00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:13.769
That's how it works.

678
00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:15.771
Don't be so naive. Doug!

679
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.523
Its obvious that Gil isn't concentrating

680
00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:19.649
on your career.

681
00:39:19.649 --> 00:39:22.527
Perhaps he has more promising Irons in the fire...

682
00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:23.820
Distracting him.

683
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.989
Gil is looking out for Gil.

684
00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:30.619
So. what's your deal?

685
00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:32.037
Nothing.

686
00:39:32.037 --> 00:39:34.039
I'm merely a fan or torturing--

687
00:39:35.082 --> 00:39:38.085
Tortured Artists.

688
00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:43.882
(Phone Vibrates)

689
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:50.472
Hello? Gil (over phone): Doug?

690
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.224
Doug! Its me. Gil.

691
00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:53.266
Where are you?

692
00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:54.226
Hey. I'm at the Galleria.

693
00:39:54.226 --> 00:39:55.227
I'm in a meeting with a high

694
00:39:55.227 --> 00:39:56.228
profile Director

695
00:39:56.228 --> 00:39:57.729
We are gonna get you some work!

696
00:39:57.729 --> 00:39:59.731
Really? With who?

697
00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:00.690
You'll see!

698
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.692
Its all part of the plan.

699
00:40:02.692 --> 00:40:03.693
Just listen. you remember that

700
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:04.694
party I told you about earlier?

701
00:40:04.694 --> 00:40:05.904
Yea?...

702
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:07.906
Go to it! Get there any way you can!

703
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.492
Your Career lies in the balance...

704
00:40:10.617 --> 00:40:12.285
Yea. yea. I'll be there.

705
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:13.870
Now your heads in the fucking game!

706
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.872
Look. I gotta go...

707
00:41:30.322 --> 00:41:36.870
(Rumble)

708
00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:12.447
(Doorbell)

709
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:18.119
Oh Hey!! HI!!

710
00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:19.871
Oh. so good of you to come! Yaassss!!

711
00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.873
Oh man! This place

712
00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:23.875
looks much nicer than your old one...

713
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:24.834
I know right!?

714
00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:25.919
I love your floors!

715
00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:26.920
Thank you. they cost me a

716
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.921
fucking fortune to install.

717
00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:29.673
WOW! They look great!

718
00:42:29.673 --> 00:42:31.675
I'll show you around. come on!

719
00:42:42.352 --> 00:42:44.354
(House usic)

720
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:57.158
(fire crackling)

721
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:25.603
Do you play? --What?--

722
00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:28.356
No. I was just...

723
00:43:33.528 --> 00:43:35.530
I have no idea...

724
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.532
Its just. uh...

725
00:43:37.532 --> 00:43:39.534
Me and music...It. uh...

726
00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:42.996
... I like how it sounds

727
00:43:44.414 --> 00:43:46.416
I love to listen to it...

728
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:48.418
It makes me feel... Alive!

729
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:54.090
Do you play?

730
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.092
I know a thing or two...

731
00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:59.137
But i'm not exactly selling out Carnegie Hall...

732
00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:01.765
Yea...

733
00:44:01.765 --> 00:44:03.767
Well. I bet no one here is a Child Prodigy...

734
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.687
My boyfriend is...

735
00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:11.941
But he's not here right now.

736
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.362
I'm Candice.

737
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:18.573
Doug.

738
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:21.076
Nice top meet you. Doug.

739
00:44:22.744 --> 00:44:24.746
And you.

740
00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:28.541
(clears throat)

741
00:44:30.377 --> 00:44:32.379
So...

742
00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:35.048
Who do you know around here?

743
00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:37.467
Oh. Uh... My Manager.

744
00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:39.469
He's around here... somewhere...

745
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:41.471
(somewhere)

746
00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:44.808
Oh. Well. ok.

747
00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:47.977
Yea. you know... He invited me. so...

748
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:50.480
I thought I'd come check it out.

749
00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.274
And who is your Manager?

750
00:44:53.775 --> 00:44:54.776

791
00:46:32.582 --> 00:46:34.584

792
00:46:34.584 --> 00:46:36.586

He just disappeared/

795
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.800
Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing HAPPENS

796
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.802
Nothing Happens... And then 6 months later...

797
00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:47.305
He found me on Facebook. He...

798
00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:49.307

799
00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:51.309

802
00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:58.149

805
00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:04.614
[laughs] I can't figure out

806
00:47:04.614 --> 00:47:06.616
Why they do that?

807
00:47:06.616 --> 00:47:08.618

811
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.543
thinking you're stupid!

812
00:47:16.543 --> 00:47:18.545
I finally meet this Female Casting Director

813
00:47:19.462 --> 00:47:21.464
And... turns out she

814
00:47:21.464 --> 00:47:23.466

815
00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:25.468
And I thought "well. this will lead to a job. right?"

816
00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:27.470

817
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.764
Who Can I trust in LA?

818
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.642
I mean. I can't trust anybody.

819
00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:34.769
Nobody cares about your unless

820
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:35.979
you're somebody.

821
00:47:35.979 --> 00:47:37.105
And you're not somebody unless

822
00:47:37.105 --> 00:47:38.231

823
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:41.359
So how do you become somebody?

824
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.360
If you're not somebody?

825
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.361
It just doesn't work.

826
00:47:43.903 --> 00:47:45.446
No matter how hard you try

827
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:47.448
You can't make yourself somebody

828
00:47:47.448 --> 00:47:49.450
It just doesn't work like that

829
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:58.001

00:57:55.848 --> 00:57:56.849
party!

940
00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:03.355
(is this the guy you're taking

941
00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:04.356
about?)

942
00:58:06.025 --> 00:58:07.860
Doug!

943
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.862
Are you alright?

944
00:58:10.779 --> 00:58:11.780
You okay. buddy?

945
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.781
Oh god!

946
00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:13.782
You're making me look like a

947
00:58:13.782 --> 00:58:14.783
fool Doug...

948
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:24.710
Are you alright?

949
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.842
I better take him home.

950
00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:35.679
(phone vibrating)

951
00:58:53.113 --> 00:58:55.115
Yea? Over Phone: Jesus Christ. Doug

952
00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:57.117
What The Fuck. man?

953
00:58:57.117 --> 00:58:58.452

Over Phone: Don't you ever

954
00:58:58.452 --> 00:58:59.119

955
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.121
Its 2 in the afternoon!

956
00:59:01.121 --> 00:59:03.123
Ok. so?... I. ugh...

958
00:59:07.711 --> 00:59:09.046
Yea. no shit!

959
00:59:09.338 --> 00:59:10.923
Well. congratulations!!

960
00:59:10.923 --> 00:59:11.924
You're gonna miss your audition

961
00:59:11.924 --> 00:59:12.925
if you don't hurry the fuck up!

962
00:59:14.677 --> 00:59:16.053
Wh... What are you talking about?

963
00:59:16.053 --> 00:59:17.680
I got you an audition last night with

964
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.682
acclaimed Director. Oliver Crow.

965
00:59:20.224 --> 00:59:21.767
When did this happen?...

966
00:59:21.767 --> 00:59:23.769
Last night! You don't remember?

967
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:26.272
No...

968
00:59:27.481 --> 00:59:29.483
... Did you get my email?

969
00:59:29.858 --> 00:59:31.610
I just woke up...

970
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:33.112
Jesus Christ. Doug!

971
00:59:33.112 --> 00:59:33.654
I sent it to you last night..

972
00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:36.240
What the fuck were you doing?

973
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:38.367
I was... drinking again...

974
00:59:38.367 --> 00:59:40.369
I know!!

975
00:59:41.203 --> 00:59:43.205
Look. I sent you an email with instructions

976
00:59:43.205 --> 00:59:45.207
for your audition later. Do yourself a favor

977
00:59:45.207 --> 00:59:47.209
and read it 'till it gets into your head.

978
00:59:47.835 --> 00:59:49.837
Ready or not. this is the big time.

979
00:59:49.837 --> 00:59:51.839
Well. it sure doesn't feel like it...

980
00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:56.427
Well. uh. look. Douggie...

981
00:59:56.927 --> 00:59:57.928
You got a few hours to do this.

982
00:59:57.928 --> 00:59:58.929
alright?...

983
00:59:59.555 --> 01:00:00.848
And I'm serious.

984
01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.309
This literally has the opportunity

985
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:05.311
to change your life.

986
01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:09.315
(moans & groans)

987
01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.699
(sniffs)

988
01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:25.039
Oh. fuck this...

989
01:00:51.357 --> 01:00:53.359
Hello?...

990
01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.449
Can I help you?

991
01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:02.159
Yes. uh. my name is Doug Bridgers

992
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.160
I'm here for my audition with

993
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.161
Oliver Crow...

994
01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:06.789
And do you have an appointment?

995
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.957

996
01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.460

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:15.756
Is at 3...(?)

999
01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:19.885
(tapping on iPad)

1000
01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.596
(heavy breathing in & out) ... Hmmm...

1001
01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.224
Hmm...

1002
01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.726
Uhhh...

1003
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.854
Nope. I don't see you anywhere.

1004
01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:34.233
You gotta be kidding me...

1005
01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:35.234
Sorry. sir. but I'm not kidding

1006
01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:36.235

1007
01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:38.237

1009
01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:43.117
Well. sir. if your name isn't on the list...

1010
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.869
You may not enter.

1011
01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:52.418
(tapping on laptop)

1012
01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.505
I'm sorry. there must be some mistake.

1013
01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:59.258
We don't seem to be...

1014
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.802
... Communicating.

1015
01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:03.387
My name is Doug Bridgers...

1016
01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.389
I have an addition...

1017
01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.391
And sir... I'm telling you...that--

1018
01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:10.018

1019
01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:13.105
Yes. sir.

1020
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.026
Doug!.. Please. come in.

1021
01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:19.403
So you're the "Golden Boy" Gil &

1022
01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.404
my Meathead Producer

1023
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.196
were talking about.

1024
01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.823
They've been talking about
me?...

1025
01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:23.824
They sure were! They think

1026
01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:24.825
you're Legendary!

1027
01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:26.410
Walk with me.... They were

1028
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.411
talking about

1029
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:28.871
how--what a remarkable talent

1030
01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:29.872
you are...

1031
01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.206
and how you been around the

1032
01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.207
block more than once

1033
01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:34.209
and how we need to collaborate

1034
01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:36.211
work together. and...

1035
01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:37.838
They seem to think that you & I

1036
01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:38.839
and our talents

1037
01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:41.175
We can make one powerful film.

1038
01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:43.343
Oh. yea? So what do you think?

1039
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.722
I still need to see it.

1040
01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:48.307
You're a little shorter than I

1041
01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:49.308
expected...

1042
01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:51.059
You're also a little early.

1043
01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.061
Not what I expected at all.

1044
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.022
That's a good thing. right?

1045
01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.524
Welcome to my Chambers.

1046
01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:59.526
This is it!

1047
01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.528
This is ground zero!

1048
01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:06.533
If you don't mind just taking
that mark whenever you're

1049
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:07.201
comfortable...

1050
01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:30.557
Alrighty... lets get started.

1051
01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:31.558
shall we?

1052
01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.728
Yea. sure. Alright!

1053
01:03:39.233 --> 01:03:41.235
You know. when we first met...

1054
01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:44.196
I wasn't sure what think.

1055
01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:47.199
Excuse me? ... Yeah!

1056
01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.160
You were fucking wasted.

1057
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.372
Aaaaannnd Action!

1058
01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.436
(Doug Screams)

1059
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.531
(Sounds from the Hollywood Streets)

1060
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:45.591
(door opens)

1061
01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.537
Bad day. Doug?

1062
01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:18.248
Fuckin'-A!

1063
01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:21.335
As if this day could get any

1064
01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:22.336
shittier.

1065
01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.421
No sense in crying over a little

1066
01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.797
spilled Irish Coffee.

1067
01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.258
My truck is gone...

1068
01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.259
I had to walk home to this

1069
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.260
shithole.

1070
01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.262
Which I'm being evicted from...

1071
01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:35.724
Another rejection...

1072
01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:37.601
Just like everything else in this

1073
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.603
God Forsaken Town...

1074
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.981
So I don't need you Antagonizing me.

1075
01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:44.274
(Balthazar laughs)

1076
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:45.859
Don't be so dramatic. Doug.

1077
01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:47.861
save it for the set! Besides.

1078
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.863
some people walk miles everyday.

1079
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.448
Not in L.A..

1080
01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.450
that's not an option.

1081
01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:55.827
"take the Metro. take the bus..."

1082
01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:58.330
"get a bike" Get fucked!

1083
01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:01.875
Without a vehicle. I can't go to my gigs.

1084
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.877
I can't go to my auditions.

1085
01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:06.213
Everything I've been working for

1086
01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.631
has come to a grinding halt.

1087
01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:10.050
I'm exhausted...

1088
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.302
I'm done.

1089
01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:15.138
I don't ever want to hear you

1090
01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.140
FUCKING SAY THAT AGAIN!

1091
01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.309
That is the filthy. repugnant speech

1092
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.311
of the loser. of the forgotten!

1093
01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:22.646
Sure. you're down...

1094
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.232
But you're not out!

1095
01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.942
You're Doug-bloody-Bridgers!

1096
01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:28.944
Soon to be Legend in his own time!

1097
01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.779
So the world keeps shitting on you.

1098
01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:32.781
We'll get you an umbrella!

1099
01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:34.783
No ride? Put that lay about Manager

1100
01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:36.785
to use. have him drive you to and fro.

1101
01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.329
you knuckle down and work harder than you ever have before!

1102
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.582
Are you fucking kidding me?

1103
01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:45.627
I've put in Overtime.

1104
01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:47.879
Developing Backstories for

1105
01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:48.880
Characters who get

1106
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.882
3 lines--if I'm lucky.

1107
01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.761
Ive put in... hours learning

1108
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:56.221
dialogues...

1109
01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:58.223
Speech Impediments

1110
01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:00.475
Memorizing Monologues...

1111
01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:01.476
Dialogues of entire fucking

1112
01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:02.477
scripts.

1113
01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:03.478
in case they want me to read for

1114
01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:04.479
someone else.

1115
01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.399
I put blood. sweat and tears

1116
01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:08.734
into

1117
01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:10.068
these Characters for nothing.

1118
01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:12.654
If I'm supposed to be this...

1119
01:07:13.447 --> 01:07:15.449
"Great Acting Legend". how come

1120
01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:17.451
No one else knows about it?

1121
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.912
Its because I'm not special...

1122
01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.375
What else could I have done?

1123
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:27.753
What's with this past tense talk?

1124
01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.504
There is no "could have done".

1125
01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:31.506
Only what you are going to do Now!

1126
01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:32.632
And there is no other path for

1127
01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:33.800
you but back on that horse.

1128
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.802
I've been deluding myself this whole time.

1129
01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:39.139
Maybe I... Could have been happy as a...

1130
01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.726
As a Carpenter. or Craftsman...

1131
01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:45.896
... You know...

1132
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.440
Actually making something with my hands.

1133
01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.401
Something real & fulfilling.

1134
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.987
Oh. certainly. Builder Doug!

1135
01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.239
Let's explore that path. shall we?

1136
01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.241
I'm sure it sounds wonderfully simple and

1137
01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.243
romantic to you. but what it means is

1138
01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.245
early hours with arduous. monotonous labor

1139
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.539
Rewarded with a pittance of a salary.

1140
01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.917
And maybe a few beers as you drag your

1141
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.919
beaten corpse into your recliner in time

1142
01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.921
to turn on the TV and watch. and

1143
01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:11.922
fantasize about the glory and

1144
01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:12.923
glamour

1145
01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.925
of the Entertainer's world.

1146
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.051
You awaken to find yourself in

1147
01:08:16.051 --> 01:08:17.219
the same spot

1148
01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:19.221
Unloved. unappreciated...

1149
01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:21.515
The endless cycle starting anew.

1150
01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:22.390
sending you through the

1151
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.266
sickeningly similar

1152
01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:24.643
motions yet again.

1153
01:08:24.643 --> 01:08:25.644
The majority of people can hack

1154
01:08:25.644 --> 01:08:26.645
this life.

1155
01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:27.896
they know no other and ignorance

1156
01:08:27.896 --> 01:08:28.897
is bliss.

1157
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.273
You know why this is not your

1158
01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.358
lot. my boy?

1159
01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:33.193
Because the fire within you will

1160
01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:34.194
not let you

1161
01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:35.862
Settle for mediocrity.

1162
01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:36.863
It needs you to fuel it and

1163
01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:37.864
allow it to burn

1164
01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:39.866
as brightly and hotly as it can

1165
01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:42.077
Any other path results in you

1166
01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:43.203
swallowing a gun barrel (and you

1167
01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:44.371
know this to be true)

1168
01:08:45.247 --> 01:08:47.249
The illusion is the happy. simple

1169
01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.251
life you think you could have had.

1170
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.462
If it were going to happen to me.

1171
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.464
It would have happened years ago.

1172
01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.635
Now. all they want are...

1173
01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:01.388
hip. buff empty headed pretty boys

1174
01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:03.390
and that ship has sailed.

1175
01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:06.726
Doug. that particular ship was never in

1176
01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:08.728
the harbor for you to begin with.

1177
01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:09.896
But that's for an entirely

1178
01:09:09.896 --> 01:09:11.064
different breed altogether.

1179
01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.065
You're not competing in their

1180
01:09:12.065 --> 01:09:13.066
meat markets.

1181
01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.318
Yours is a talent that improves with age.

1182
01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.320
informed by hardship & struggle.

1183
01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:18.905
proper experience.

1184
01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:20.907
There are no shortcuts. though. the path

1185
01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:22.158
is different for everyone.

1186
01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:23.410
Unless. of course. you are

1187
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:24.411
willing to go the...

1188
01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:27.289
fallacious approach. I suppose...

1189
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:29.291
Fallaci--

1190
01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:30.667
I'm not sucking anyone's dick!

1191
01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.669
And no one is asking you to. Doug.

1192
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.671
Calm down. But...

1193
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.672
you must be willing to do

1194
01:09:35.672 --> 01:09:36.673
whatever it takes.

1195
01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.675
Sacrifices must be made!

1196
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.386
Fine. I submit!

1197
01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.888
Take my soul!

1198
01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:44.472
I'll sign my name in blood!

1199
01:09:44.472 --> 01:09:46.016
Sell my first born if I have to.

1200
01:09:46.016 --> 01:09:48.018
I don't give a shit. just make it happen.

1201
01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.020
(Balthazar laughs) No. no no. Doug!

1202
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.771
What you're referring to are

1203
01:09:51.771 --> 01:09:53.023
works of pure fiction

1204
01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:54.524
I assure you.

1205
01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.359
There is no down on the cross roads.

1206
01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:57.819
No "Golden Fiddle"

1207
01:09:57.819 --> 01:09:59.321
No Faustian Bargain!

1208
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:00.655
The only thing I have to offer

1209
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.823
you now is wisdom.

1210
01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.199
And trust me when I tell you.

1211
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.284
You have come too close to what

1212
01:10:04.284 --> 01:10:05.410
you deserve

1213
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.412
for you to Quit now.

1214
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.414
I know you want to leave behind

1215
01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.415
an immortal legacy that

1216
01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:11.416
stretches to the far corners

1217
01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:12.626
of the map...

1218
01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:14.628
to be worshipped by adoring fans.

1219
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.464
some who have only seen you on a screen.

1220
01:10:17.464 --> 01:10:19.466
In order for this to be realized.

1221
01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.885
We need to show them the depths of your soul.

1222
01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.094
where the infernal monster

1223
01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.304
dwells magnificent

1224
01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:26.306
and horrifying. and unlike anything

1225
01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.308
they have ever seen before.

1226
01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:29.309
You've been told to make bigger.

1227
01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:30.310
bolder choices...

1228
01:10:31.019 --> 01:10:32.646
I say. take it further...

1229
01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:33.605
Give them both Gun barrels and

1230
01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:34.564
blow them away!

1231
01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.566
Show them bat shit crazy!

1232
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.693
Give them a glimpse fo Doug's

1233
01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:39.986
internal inferno!

1234
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.405
Set yourself above the rabble.

1235
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.157
by venting all of your passions

1236
01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.159
into a unique take.

1237
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.161
Hold nothing back.

1238
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.163
Give no quarter...

1239
01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.165
Burn it down Bridgers!!

1240
01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.750
(laughs)

1241
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.752
And when you're not on set. you charm

1242
01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.754
And you schmooze

1243
01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:58.755
Swallow your pride while eating

1244
01:10:58.755 --> 01:10:59.756
their shit

1245
01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:01.967
Until you become so integral they

1246
01:11:01.967 --> 01:11:03.969
wouldn't dream of pissing you off.

1247
01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:05.095
And then you can tell them all

1248
01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:06.262
to get fucked!

1249
01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.264
Behave however you want.

1250
01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.265
They'll keep calling you a

1251
01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.266
genius no matter what.

1252
01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:12.185
Don't play their game. Doug.

1253
01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.520
Be the game!

1254
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.522
Make them conform to your rules.

1255
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:16.731
Everything you've been working

1256
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:17.732
to is impending.

1257
01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.110
Don't give up now! Either you

1258
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.112
slap destiny on her ass. stick

1259
01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.113
your tongue down her throat and

1260
01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:24.114
make a bloody move...

1261
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.992
Or regret... and despair...

1262
01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:30.704
and spiral out into obscurity.

1263
01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:32.914
the choice is yours.

1264
01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.916
Okay!

1265
01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.837
So... How long do I have to wait?

1266
01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:41.339
As long as is necessary. my friend.

1267
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.092
And in the meantime.

1268
01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:46.094
you might need to try some new things.

1269
01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:48.054
Keep working hard. Douglas. I

1270
01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.055
assure you...

1271
01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.308
What you deserve is coming.

1272
01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:55.603
Deal! (laughs all around)

1273
01:11:58.023 --> 01:12:00.025
... Hypersensitive... ?...

1274
01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:21.588
Oh! Take me!!

1275
01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.174
YES!!

1276
01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.703
(phone rings)

1277
01:12:59.334 --> 01:13:00.543
Hello?

1278
01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.545
Doug Bridgers. Oliver Crow!

1279
01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:05.090
Oh. hey Oliver. how's it going?

1280
01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:07.926
Doing great. thanks.

1281
01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:09.219
Hey. so I watched to your

1282
01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:10.553
audition tape from yesterday

1283
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:11.679
and.. I absolutely loved it.

1284
01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.847
Great work. man!

1285
01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:15.183
Really? Thanks!

1286
01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:16.810
Anytime!

1287
01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:17.811
Hey. so I sent it over to my

1288
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.813
Producer buddy and he said he

1289
01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:21.815
liked it a lot and you're perfect for a part

1290
01:13:21.815 --> 01:13:23.817
What d'you say we get you in there bout

1291
01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.068
2'oclock?

1292
01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:27.070
Uh--yea--yea. that sounds great!

1293
01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:28.446
Great! Great!

1294
01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:29.447
Alright. I'll see you then.

1295
01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:30.448
alright? Bye now.

1296
01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.876
[Unintelligible Cafe Sounds]

1297
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:51.052
... stay with me for the weekend...

1298
01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:54.389
How old is she?

1299
01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:58.893
[Unintelligible]

1300
01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.117
I just wanna make beautiful music. that's all

1301
01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.119
Makes sense. It does.

1302
01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:18.121
Now I heard about a situation

1303
01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:20.123
where a woman was vulnerable last week and you stepped in

1304
01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:23.084
That's why we're having this meeting today.

1305
01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:25.086
I looked into your work and think you're a very exceptional actor.

1306
01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:28.047
Thank you!

1307
01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:30.049
But I want to know more about

1308
01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.051
you personally.

1309

[Cafe Sounds]

1310
01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:43.980
I actually moved from North Carolina.

1311
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.982
Oh. really?

1312
01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.984
Yea. so I was raised in Philly

1313
01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.986
But I went to college in DC and...

1314
01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.988
If we can get together. figure out

1315
01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.990
how to identify the origin of our fears

1316
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.992
we can step from Happiness...

1317
01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.494
And every person that steps from Happiness...

1318
01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.496
Then you can live a Happy life!

1319
01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:02.874
This can totally get rid of Depression...

1320
01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.710
This totally answers a question on Medication

1321
01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:08.213
So. the character you play

1322
01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.925
You know. your acting skill

1323
01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:13.927
This little conversation we're having

1324
01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.929
I really think you'd be a great addition to the family

1325
01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:17.931
And I can set it up Next Wednesday

1326

1327
01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.357
(snapping fingers)

1328
01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:29.359
Hey. Hey!!

1329
01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.569
You listening to me?

1330
01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.571
Yea. of course!

1331
01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.573
All I'm saying is nothing new. anyway.

1332
01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.742
You want the better roles. you

1333
01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:38.743
need an agent!

1334
01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.287
There's only so much I can do.

1335
01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:42.288
What if I don't have an agent.

1336
01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:43.289
that's where you come in?...

1337
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.583
Like I said...

1338
01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.585
There's only so much I can do.

1339
01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:51.798
I don't know if you noticed. but

1340
01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:53.800
I Need work. I need money.

1341
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.802
Then get a real fucking job!

1342
01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.804
Its not the end of the world.

1343
01:15:57.804 --> 01:15:59.555
We all do other things.

1344
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.557
I just need more auditions. what so hard

1345
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.559
for you to understand?

1346
01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:06.104
I can't really promise anything.

1347
01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:09.274
Well. try and make something happen!

1348
01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:13.945
What's up your ass?

1349
01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:20.034
I'm broke. Gil.

1350
01:16:20.702 --> 01:16:22.704
And I'm being evicted.

1351
01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:28.293
How'd the audition go?

1352
01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:38.344
Fine. I guess...

1353
01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.056
I'm meeting with him later today.

1354
01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:44.058
See?

1355
01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.060
Put in the work! I'm telling you!

1356
01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:50.315
Relax!

1357
01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.317
These things are pretty standard.

1358
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.194
Who knows.

1359
01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:56.195
You may get a phone call at the

1360
01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.196
last minute.

1361
01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.198
am I right??

1362
01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:00.491
Yea. I guess.

1363
01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:01.784
These things happen all the time

1364
01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:04.495
And when they do call you...

1365
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.664
do exactly what they say.

1366
01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:08.666
Go where they tell you to go...

1367
01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:11.044
As long as you get paid!!

1368
01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.129
Yea. but... sometimes..

1369
01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:15.131
(Doug stutters)

1370
01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.133
For the love of god! Just...

1371
01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:22.013
Do what they say...

1372
01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.874
(music in)

1373
01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:51.459
My Friend!

1374
01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:52.460
Hey. you shoulda called me!

1375
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.461
No no no no--

1376
01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:54.128
I would have had somebody pick

1377
01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.463
you up.
Oh. no sweat!

1378
01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:58.132
So. what's up?

1379
01:17:58.132 --> 01:17:59.133
So my fucking Producer!

1380
01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.426
I sent him over all the... all

1381
01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:01.761
the auditions...

1382
01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:02.762
and some of them from your

1383
01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:03.763
Manager sent them over..

1384
01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:05.139
I decided we're gonna get you in

1385
01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.557
on a Screen Test.

1386
01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:07.809
Really?

1387
01:18:07.809 --> 01:18:09.811
Here. Let me know when you're ready.

1388
01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:11.479
Its really hard to convince

1389
01:18:11.479 --> 01:18:12.480
these guys. you know?

1390
01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.108
And I spent so much time on this project

1391
01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:16.109
I think you're gonna knock it

1392
01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:17.110
out of the park!

1393
01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:19.779
Thing is. I got these Producer Heads

1394
01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:21.489
trying to tell me how to make my film.

1395
01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:23.491
You gotta find a middle ground somehow

1396
01:18:23.491 --> 01:18:24.158
and these guys just wanna take

1397
01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.493
over everything.
…Ok. now wait a minute

1398
01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:26.494
They can't do that. Its your

1399
01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:27.495
vision. right?

1400
01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:29.497
Right. So... So why are they getting in the

1401
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:30.623
way of your vision?

1402
01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:32.625
These guys are. like. wannabe Hollywood

1403
01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.627
So I tell them about my script and they're IN

1404
01:18:34.961 --> 01:18:36.963
And I'm...

1405
01:18:36.963 --> 01:18:37.964
I don't even feel like its my

1406
01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:38.965
film most of the time...

1407
01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:40.967
But... Who am I to say?

1408
01:18:40.967 --> 01:18:41.968
I'll tell you who you are!

1409
01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:42.969
You're the visionary.

1410
01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:44.095
You're the Director--You're the

1411
01:18:44.095 --> 01:18:45.263
guy who's gonna make it happen.

1412
01:18:48.099 --> 01:18:50.101
Alright. you ready for this?

1413
01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:54.105
Alright. Camera Speeds...

1414
01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.774
AAaaannnnd Action!

1415
01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:58.985
Its the most frustrating thing ever

1416
01:18:58.985 --> 01:18:59.986
When you have an idea and people

1417
01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:00.987
want to change it.

1418
01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:01.988
Hey. I've lived my whole life

1419
01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:02.989
like that.

1420
01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:04.991
I've had that vision. just like you

1421
01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:06.242
of being an artist. and trying

1422
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:07.493
to nurture that...

1423
01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:09.495
And what happens? There's always someone

1424
01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.289
in the fucking way! Always!

1425
01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:12.290
I want this to stay true to its

1426
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:13.291
roots. You know?

1427
01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:14.125
A grungy... Realistic struggle

1428
01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.877
of Man.
--But now--!

1429
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.962
CUT! Alright. great...

1430
01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.964
Ummm...this time. can we try it again?

1431
01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:21.966
Let's just do a little bit more

1432
01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:22.967
energetic. a little more

1433
01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:23.968
excited. pumped up...

1434
01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:25.386
When they came on board. did

1435
01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:26.637
they know about this?

1436
01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:29.390
I mean. to a degree.

1437
01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:31.517
AAAAnnnd Cut! Ok. Ummm...

1438
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.353
Can we just do it again? Doug?

1439
01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:36.397
Let's try a little bit more smooth...you know?

1440
01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:38.399
A little more cool...

1441
01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:41.736
AAAAnnndd Action

1442
01:19:41.736 --> 01:19:43.738
And then they hear me talking'

1443
01:19:43.738 --> 01:19:44.614
about the script for five

1444
01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:45.490
minutes... They probably haven't

1445
01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:46.365
read the god damn thing

1446
01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.659
Hey. look. I'm in all the way.

1447
01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:50.661
So. you make this happen. you know i'm there.

1448
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:52.663
Dedication. Doug: We're on the same page.

1449
01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:54.665
Do not. do not question it.

1450
01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:55.333
Whatever you need me to do. I'm

1451
01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:56.000
there for you.

1452
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:56.667
Great!

1453
01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.128
AAAAAnnnd Cut! Ok Excellent.

1454
01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:01.589
Uh. this time. let's run it again

1455
01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:03.591
Do it like you want to fucking murder them.

1456
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:05.551
You're gonna fucking rip their

1457
01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:06.552
head off. Alright?

1458
01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.554
Alright. And--Action!

1459
01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.806
You call that a Blowjob?!

1460
01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.808
We're gonna try this one more time...

1461
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:13.809
I wanna see it like you're

1462
01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:14.810
trying to intimidate him.

1463
01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:16.854
Like you wanna murder them. I'll tell you this

1464
01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:18.856
I've had this recurring dream.

1465
01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.317
I wake up in this Malibu apartment.

1466
01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.736
Just beautiful...Ocean side view!

1467
01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:24.987
got a beautiful blonde bombshell

1468
01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.280
passed out across my chest

1469
01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.741
And there's 2 more half naked

1470
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.743
TENS serving me coffee.

1471
01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:34.205
I look outside. right?

1472
01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:35.164
There's another one catching a tan

1473
01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.207
You know what this tells me?

1474
01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:39.252
Success is right around the corner.

1475
01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.046
Right around the corner! You and me?

1476
01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:43.297
We're gonna do this.

1477
01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:45.299
I'm telling' you. this could be ours.

1478
01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.301
This film

1479
01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:49.303
It has to work. its gonna work.

1480
01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:52.932
I put too much time into it for it not to.

1481
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.433
So. you...

1482
01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.435
You just gotta be perfect.

1483
01:20:57.937 --> 01:20:59.313
Absolutely.

1484
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:00.731
I wanna get back to the roots of

1485
01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:01.732
what Art is supposed to be.

1486
01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:04.277
So. whatever happens after this project.

1487
01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:05.278
You know. I just want you to

1488
01:21:05.278 --> 01:21:06.279

Wh... Why not?

1543
01:23:22.081 --> 01:23:24.083
Why not? Because I run a legitimate

1544
01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:26.085
Business. Because I got paying

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.086

01:23:27.086 --> 01:23:28.087

(knocks) Who could that be?

1570
01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:21.408

1571
01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:23.410

1572
01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:25.579

1573
01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:33.587
What are you doing here?

1574
01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.591
Can I come in? No!

1575
01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:39.885
Look. we need to talk.

1576
01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:40.886
I don't want to hear it.

1577
01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:41.887
Please. just listen to me

1578
01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.139

Fine!... Come in...

1580
01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:08.455
Who the fuck is this?

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.833
I should go. No!

1582
01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.835
You Stay!

1583
01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:14.503
What you have to say to me. you

1584
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:15.629
can say in front of him.

1585
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:19.633
Whatever...

1586
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.471
Look...

1587
01:26:24.722 --> 01:26:26.724
I came here today to tell you...

1588
01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:30.769
You win.

1589
01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:32.438
You're stronger than me. you

1590
01:26:32.438 --> 01:26:33.439
always have been.

1591
01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:36.734
And... I can't...

1592
01:26:36.734 --> 01:26:38.736
Live like this...

1593
01:26:39.445 --> 01:26:41.447
Without you.

1594
01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:44.575
There. I said it.

1595
01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:48.329
Ok...

1596
01:26:48.746 --> 01:26:51.874
This isn't some kind of pissing contest. Doug...

1597
01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:54.668
And to be completely Frank.

1598
01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.045
I have no idea what you're

1599
01:26:56.045 --> 01:26:57.129
talking about.

1600
01:27:05.054 --> 01:27:07.056
I don't... know why I came

1601
01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:09.058
here today...I just...

1602
01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:12.811
I had nowhere else to go.

1603
01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:16.148
I've completely run out of options...

1604
01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:20.069
I have...

1605
01:27:20.069 --> 01:27:22.071
Nowhere else to go. no one to turn to...

1606
01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:24.615
How is that my problem?

1607
01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:26.867
Hmm?

1608
01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.830
I don't think I'm safe anymore.

1609
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.502
I don't feel like myself anymore.

1610
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.296
My whole life...

1611
01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.298
I just wanted to BE somebody.

1612
01:27:41.966 --> 01:27:44.760
So I could give you whatever you wanted.

1613
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.762
(Ex-Wife chuckles)

1614
01:27:47.388 --> 01:27:48.973
You didn't have to be famous

1615
01:27:48.973 --> 01:27:50.975
to get my that. Doug.

1616
01:27:50.975 --> 01:27:52.977
All I wanted was a normal life. that's all...

1617
01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:55.771
You couldn't give it to me...

1618
01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:57.773
So I had to move on.

1619
01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:02.778
So. where do we go from here?...

1620
01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:05.364
I mean. what will I do?

1621
01:28:06.532 --> 01:28:07.533
Why don't you ask

1622
01:28:07.533 --> 01:28:08.534
your imaginary friends?

1623
01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.497
I don't know what you're talking about...

1624
01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:16.208
God. Doug. I have known you a long time

1625
01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.460
You talk to yourself...

1626
01:28:19.378 --> 01:28:20.379
And to be completely frank.

1627
01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:21.380
you've always acted like

1628
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.172
a fucking crazy person. now why

1629
01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:23.007
don't you tell me

1630
01:28:23.007 --> 01:28:24.008
why you're really here. or get

1631
01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.009
the fuck

1632
01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:27.011
out of my house.

1633
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:31.932
... So. this is it? --Yes!

1634
01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:33.934
I'm afraid so.

1635
01:28:36.854 --> 01:28:38.564
Good!

1636
01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:40.566
I hope you're happy.

1637
01:28:40.566 --> 01:28:41.734
You know. knowing you has been a

1638
01:28:41.734 --> 01:28:42.943
real nightmare!

1639
01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:46.071
I shoulda just left you on that bathroom floor

1640
01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:48.073
to bleed to death.

1641
01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:50.534
(Ex Wife laughs)

1642
01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:52.953
What's so funny? --You're delirious!

1643
01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:55.914
You think I tried to kill myself?

1644
01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.916
Oh my god. you're fucking insane!

1645
01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.919
No. no. I know what I saw!

1646
01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:01.670
You know. I was having a nice.

1647
01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:02.421
easy day and then I come home to

1648
01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:03.213
you

1649
01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.548
a bloody mess on that bathroom
floor!

1650
01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:05.215
OK!!

1651
01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:08.844
Why are you here?

1652
01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:11.889
I need your help!

1653
01:29:11.889 --> 01:29:14.266
Go see a Psychiatrist. I'm not interested.

1654
01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:16.268
No. you see. I don't know what to do!

1655
01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.520
But be honest with you & come clean.

1656
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:21.023
Why won't you listen to me?!

1657
01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:23.025
Because I am not fucking interested.

1658
01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:25.152
Why not?!

1659
01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:27.905
You're such a Monster!

1660
01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.533
Not the man I wasted my life with...

1661
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:32.951
Oh. so now its my fault? Huh--Is

1662
01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:33.952
that what you're saying?

1663
01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:34.953
YES IT IS!

1664
01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:35.954
You coming here?!

1665
01:29:36.455 --> 01:29:38.457
It is your fault!

1666
01:29:38.457 --> 01:29:40.459
Yours...

1667
01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.005
Who do you think you are?

1668
01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:48.175
You think you're something special?

1669
01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:50.886
Well. you're not.

1670
01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:53.055
Time to get with reality. Doug. you're nothing!

1671
01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:55.641
You're a Nobody!

1672
01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.309
Don't you fucking get it yet?

1673
01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.394
Time has passed you by!

1674
01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:01.897
It happens. people die. life goes on!

1675
01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:04.316
And in the end. you will never do anything

1676
01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:05.317
remarkable. so you might as well

1677
01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:06.318
just... give it all up!

1678
01:30:06.652 --> 01:30:08.654
Or even better yet. do us all the favor and

1679
01:30:08.654 --> 01:30:10.656
fucking kill yourself.

1680
01:30:10.656 --> 01:30:12.658
Disappear!

1681
01:30:12.658 --> 01:30:13.659
Because the truth is. Doug.

1682
01:30:13.659 --> 01:30:14.660
nobody cares about you

1683
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.662
and nobody ever will. You are a drain

1684
01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:18.664
on everyone and everything

1685
01:30:18.664 --> 01:30:20.124
And you always will be.

1686
01:30:20.124 --> 01:30:22.126
I have done y fair share of torture.

1687
01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:25.129
but now you'r worthless to me.

1688
01:30:25.838 --> 01:30:27.840
So. if you'll excuse us...

1689
01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.175
We'd like to... have our dinner.

So we can enjoy the rest of our evening.

1691
01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:34.179
If you will just...

1692
01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:41.520
... Let me ask you something...

1693
01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:43.939

1694
01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.941

1695
01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:47.943

1703
01:31:05.043 --> 01:31:07.045

1707
01:31:11.425 --> 01:31:13.427

1718
01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.584

1719
01:32:30.837 --> 01:32:32.839

Doug: How much more Potato Salad did they request?

1852
01:46:38.768 --> 01:46:40.770
Well...I'm not sure.

1853
01:46:41.187 --> 01:46:43.189
I just know that eventually...

1854
01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:46.818
You can have too much Potato Salad...

1855
01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:49.153
Hey. man. what the fuck. Seriously?

1856
01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:53.324
'Cause I've...

1857
01:46:53.324 --> 01:46:55.868
Worked way too hard to be disrespected

1858
01:46:55.868 --> 01:46:57.870
like this...to be

1859
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:59.872
Tossed around like some god damn rag doll.

1860
01:47:01.249 --> 01:47:03.543
I'm a mother fuckin' STAR GOD DAMMIT!!

1861
01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:06.796
Now you get someone in here that can

1862
01:47:06.796 --> 01:47:08.798
read these god damned lines...

1863
01:47:08.798 --> 01:47:10.967
Or am I supposed to stand here with my dick out?

1864
01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:12.927
and try to entertain you...

1865
01:47:12.927 --> 01:47:14.929
And fail miserably. probably. right?!

1866
01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:15.805
Aint that what you expect from me?

1867
01:47:16.264 --> 01:47:18.975
Is that what you want?
I mean. is that what you enjoy?

1868
01:47:20.268 --> 01:47:22.270
Honestly?! Lemme ask you you--

1869
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:24.272
Just fucking tell me if that's what you want!

1870
01:47:25.273 --> 01:47:27.275
Because I can handle that!

1871
01:47:27.275 --> 01:47:29.277
But this bullshit with his wrestling

1872
01:47:29.277 --> 01:47:31.195
and and his eating crap!

1873
01:47:31.195 --> 01:47:33.197
You don't disrespect people like me.

1874
01:47:33.197 --> 01:47:35.199
you fucking understand that?!

1875
01:47:41.873 --> 01:47:46.210
(Executives & Oliver laughing)

1876
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:17.033
Man. this is amazing!

1877
01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.582
(Silence)

1878
01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.549
Uh. we're done here. Thank you.

1879
01:48:34.717 --> 01:48:36.719
(Doug stammers)

1880
01:48:38.262 --> 01:48:40.264
Oliver: Thank you for coming. Doug.

1881
01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:54.987
(Smacking knee. snap finger)

1882
01:48:54.987 --> 01:48:56.989
That's the fucking guy

1883
01:48:57.907 --> 01:48:59.909
Despite his freakout...

1884
01:49:00.618 --> 01:49:03.037
Fuck it. whatever. that's the guy!

1885
01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:09.085
Look. all I'm saying is this:

1886
01:49:09.085 --> 01:49:11.087
Either make a decision in the next 48 hours.

1887
01:49:12.004 --> 01:49:14.006
or we're gonna pull the show.

1888
01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:18.594
Everybody's replaceable. kid.

1889
01:49:19.136 --> 01:49:20.721
Even you.

1890
01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:22.723
Mark my fucking words.

1891
01:49:37.613 --> 01:49:39.615
(Sounds of the Metro Rail)

1892
01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:39.342
Sorry I'm late

1893
01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.762
Where were you?

1894
01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.222
Just got back from Puerto Rico!

1895
01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.142
Puerto Rico? Yea!

1896
01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:50.686
I had a good time...(chuckles)

1897
01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.522
It was great!

1898
01:50:53.522 --> 01:50:55.524
Finally got away from this shit hole. so..

1899
01:50:55.816 --> 01:50:57.360
Mission Accomplished!

1900
01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.362
So... You don't know about the callback?

1901
01:51:00.446 --> 01:51:02.948
You had a Callback? ... Yea...

1902
01:51:02.948 --> 01:51:04.950
I had a Callback. Oh. really?!

1903
01:51:07.411 --> 01:51:09.413
Of course. they made me wait forever

1904
01:51:09.413 --> 01:51:11.415
But I went in. and I performed.

1905
01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:14.168
Good for you!

1906
01:51:15.211 --> 01:51:17.213
Anyway. its Over.

1907
01:51:17.213 --> 01:51:19.215
Just like that.

1908
01:51:20.174 --> 01:51:22.176
What?

1909
01:51:22.343 --> 01:51:24.345
What are you talking about?

1910
01:51:25.846 --> 01:51:27.848
I'm finished. Gil.

1911
01:51:29.183 --> 01:51:31.185
Did you even go through with the audition?

1912
01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.562
Yea ... And?...

1913
01:51:34.146 --> 01:51:36.148
Its over.

1914
01:51:36.399 --> 01:51:37.400
Just like that?

1915
01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.401
Just like that.

1916
01:51:40.986 --> 01:51:42.988
What happened?

1917
01:51:43.823 --> 01:51:45.825
It got a little intense...

1918
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:49.412
I think I had an anxiety attack

1919
01:51:49.412 --> 01:51:51.414
I--I clearly didn't listen to directions...

1920
01:51:55.543 --> 01:51:57.545
Anyway...

1921
01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.922
I need your help.

1922
01:52:00.214 --> 01:52:02.216
Help how?

1923
01:52:02.967 --> 01:52:04.969
I need to borrow a thousand dollars.

1924
01:52:04.969 --> 01:52:06.971
I know it sounds bad. but I can pay you back.

1925
01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.142
That can be arranged.

1926
01:52:16.397 --> 01:52:18.399
What's it for?...

1927
01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.695
Well...

1928
01:52:22.945 --> 01:52:24.947
If you want the money...

1929
01:52:28.325 --> 01:52:30.327
I need to get my car out of the impound.

1930
01:52:32.121 --> 01:52:34.123
Where you gonna go?

1931
01:52:34.498 --> 01:52:36.500
(exhales) Somewhere...

1932
01:52:36.834 --> 01:52:38.836
North. probably. fuck knows...

1933
01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.382
I just gotta get as far away from here as I can

1934
01:52:43.799 --> 01:52:45.801
See where the road takes me...

1935
01:52:47.803 --> 01:52:49.805
I'm sick of this whole new Hollywood Game...

1936
01:52:51.765 --> 01:52:53.767
That's not why I became an actor in the first place.

1937
01:52:54.602 --> 01:52:55.686
Yea!

1938
01:52:55.686 --> 01:52:58.230
Its a god damn shame nobody gives a fuck these days.

1939
01:53:01.859 --> 01:53:02.776
Look...

1940
01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:04.778
You know you can come to me for anything...

1941
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:08.032
I've been doing pretty good lately.

1942
01:53:08.032 --> 01:53:10.034
Signing Clients.

1943
01:53:10.367 --> 01:53:12.369
Finally starting to see some money come in...

1944
01:53:13.537 --> 01:53:15.539
How much?

1945
01:53:15.956 --> 01:53:17.958
Enough.

1946
01:53:19.919 --> 01:53:21.921
Well. thanks for everything!

1947
01:53:21.921 --> 01:53:23.923
I'm really gonna miss you...

1948
01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:30.137
Hey... I'll see you when I see you.

1949
01:54:05.047 --> 01:54:07.049
(Radio Chatter)

1950
01:54:20.938 --> 01:54:22.940
Bye Bye L.A.

1951
01:54:25.859 --> 01:54:27.861
Goodbye Los Angeles!

1952
01:55:00.185 --> 01:55:02.187
Seriously?

1953
01:55:04.523 --> 01:55:06.525

1955
01:55:19.788 --> 01:55:21.790

(Ocean Sounds)

1958
01:56:04.416 --> 01:56:06.418
So. why are we here again. Douglas?

1959
01:56:09.171 --> 01:56:11.173
All I ever wanted was to perform.

1960
01:56:15.219 --> 01:56:17.221
Nothin' else.

1961
01:56:18.555 --> 01:56:20.557
Just to Act.

1962
01:56:22.142 --> 01:56:24.144
I was good at it.

1963
01:56:26.105 --> 01:56:27.189
Its the only thing I could ever

1964
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:28.315
do I was any good at...

1965
01:56:29.858 --> 01:56:31.860
That was 35 years ago...

1966
01:56:35.447 --> 01:56:36.740
Here's the deal:

1967
01:56:37.366 --> 01:56:39.368
I'm somebody!

1968
01:56:41.036 --> 01:56:43.038
And I had a wife...

1969
01:56:43.288 --> 01:56:45.290
and I had a house...

1970
01:56:45.582 --> 01:56:47.584
And I had a fuckin' life!

1971
01:56:48.085 --> 01:56:50.087

(laughing)

1973
01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:54.299
What did it get you?

1974
01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:57.177
(crying)

1975
01:57:03.517 --> 01:57:05.519
What would that get me?

1976
01:57:06.937 --> 01:57:08.939
I mean. what would fame get me?

1977
01:57:12.025 --> 01:57:14.027
Everything

1978
01:57:14.903 --> 01:57:15.904
(crazy chuckle)

1979
01:57:15.904 --> 01:57:16.905
I can have it all. right?

1980
01:57:18.866 --> 01:57:21.118
I mean... I can have everything I want!

1981
01:57:21.368 --> 01:57:22.369
Fuck yea! That's what you got--

(Jazz Music)

2005
01:59:48.056 --> 01:59:50.058
How long do they want me for?

2006
01:59:50.976 --> 01:59:52.978

Its quiet and beautiful.

2034
02:01:30.951 --> 02:01:32.953
Yes. she is.

2035
02:01:33.286 --> 02:01:35.288
(chuckles)

2036
02:01:36.039 --> 02:01:38.041
So. what's up?

2037
02:01:38.041 --> 02:01:40.043
So. I got an email

2038
02:01:40.419 --> 02:01:42.421
If we on a Friday--not this Friday

2039
02:01:42.421 --> 02:01:44.423
but a couple Friday's from now

2040
02:01:44.423 --> 02:01:46.425
show up in Budapest for a Private Screening

2041
02:01:46.425 --> 02:01:48.427
of Dire Need. they'll give us a

2042
02:01:48.427 --> 02:01:50.429
$60.000 Cash Advance.

2043
02:01:50.429 --> 02:01:52.431
I mean... We need this...

2044
02:01:52.431 --> 02:01:54.433
Who knows! Maybe we can push our next project

2045
02:01:54.433 --> 02:01:55.892
and get $100.000

2046
02:01:55.892 --> 02:01:57.894
So. is there another project?

2047
02:01:57.894 --> 02:01:59.896
I mean. I want there to be.

2048
02:01:59.896 --> 02:02:01.898
I got tons of ideas for you. Doug.

2049
02:02:03.233 --> 02:02:04.526
Hey. so whatever happened to

2050
02:02:04.526 --> 02:02:05.819
those guys in New York?

2051
02:02:06.153 --> 02:02:08.155
Ahh. god... They. uh...

2052
02:02:09.114 --> 02:02:11.116
They fled the country!

2053
02:02:11.116 --> 02:02:13.118
Turns out. they were being tried for Fraud.

2054
02:02:13.118 --> 02:02:15.120
Seriously? Yea.

2055
02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.122
Unbelievable.

2056
02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:19.166
Well. at least we don't have to

2057
02:02:19.166 --> 02:02:21.960
worry about them anymore.
Yea!

2058
02:02:22.127 --> 02:02:23.128
Those guys were sketchy.

2059
02:02:23.128 --> 02:02:24.129
After everything we went through

2060
02:02:24.129 --> 02:02:25.172
with those guys I'm...

2061
02:02:25.547 --> 02:02:27.549
I'm done with them.

2062
02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:30.343
You think there's... Any way we can get some

2063
02:02:30.343 --> 02:02:32.345
money in Budapest?

2064
02:02:32.345 --> 02:02:33.305
I think there's plenty of ways

2065
02:02:33.305 --> 02:02:34.306
we can get money in Budapest.

2066
02:02:34.306 --> 02:02:36.308
Those guys are loaded!

2067
02:02:36.308 --> 02:02:38.310
As long as you show up. and you're you

2068
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:40.312
and you do your thing. and I'm me?!

2069
02:02:40.312 --> 02:02:42.314
Shit! Who knows? Maybe we'll be able to

2070
02:02:42.314 --> 02:02:44.316
Shoot our next project in Budapest...

2071
02:02:45.108 --> 02:02:47.110
Let's do it! Yea?

2072
02:02:47.527 --> 02:02:48.195
(clang)

2073
02:02:48.195 --> 02:02:49.529
Oliver: I'll give you a call
later in the week

2074
02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:50.530
Let you know if anything changes

2075
02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:51.740
but...

2076
02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:52.949
For now? Get your Passport

2077
02:02:52.949 --> 02:02:54.159
ready. buddy!

2078
02:02:54.159 --> 02:02:56.161
(laughing) Yea!!

2079
02:02:56.828 --> 02:02:58.830
Alright. well. you guys have a good night!

2080
02:03:01.124 --> 02:03:03.126
(laughing at the innuendo)

2081
02:03:27.943 --> 02:03:29.945
(doorbell rings)

2082
02:03:39.704 --> 02:03:41.706
Hey. what's up. man? Come on in!

2083
02:03:41.706 --> 02:03:43.250
Got some good news for you!

2084
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:45.252
Excellent!

2085
02:03:45.585 --> 02:03:46.837
You want some coffee?

2086
02:03:46.837 --> 02:03:47.754
Yea. I'd love some!

2087
02:03:47.754 --> 02:03:48.755
Great! Come on out back and

2088
02:03:48.755 --> 02:03:49.756
we'll gotcha some

2089
02:03:53.844 --> 02:03:55.846
So. what do you got for me?

2090
02:03:56.221 --> 02:03:58.473
Alright. hold your horses!

2091
02:04:09.151 --> 02:04:10.485
What are these?

2092
02:04:10.777 --> 02:04:11.778
I know some of it sounds dumb.

2093
02:04:11.778 --> 02:04:12.779
but for most of these...

2094
02:04:12.779 --> 02:04:14.781
its just a working title.

2095
02:04:15.407 --> 02:04:17.409
So. are they gonna change it? ... Yes...

2096
02:04:20.412 --> 02:04:22.414
These make me look like a Jackass?

2097
02:04:23.748 --> 02:04:25.876
No... (?) 'Cause I don't wanna look like a Jackass!

2098
02:04:25.959 --> 02:04:27.878
Why would you? (Gil’s Aggravated Chuckle)

2099
02:04:29.462 --> 02:04:31.381
Doug. you haven't worked in months!

2100
02:04:31.756 --> 02:04:33.758
Well. because you've brought me shit like this

2101
02:04:33.758 --> 02:04:35.760
No!... No!!

2102
02:04:35.927 --> 02:04:37.095
You landed a lead role and it

2103
02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:38.305
happened to be a hit!

2104
02:04:39.806 --> 02:04:42.392
Now. you have offers coming in. Finally!

2105
02:04:44.186 --> 02:04:45.687
And what?

2106
02:04:45.812 --> 02:04:47.814
You don't wanna "Look like a Jackass"?

2107
02:04:49.816 --> 02:04:52.611
I mean. now is not the time to be selective!

2108
02:04:55.947 --> 02:04:57.365
Do you want to continue to act

2109
02:04:57.365 --> 02:04:58.825
and keep up this lifestyle?

2110
02:04:59.117 --> 02:05:01.119
Make Money?...

2111
02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:03.496
You know. working for you is a constant struggle

2112
02:05:04.206 --> 02:05:06.541
I never said it was gonna be easy Gil:You know that. don't you?

2113
02:05:08.835 --> 02:05:10.837
That's the whole point. if you think about it

2114
02:05:10.837 --> 02:05:12.839
I mean. you're supposed to Gil: --No! Let me explain something

2115
02:05:12.839 --> 02:05:14.299
to you. Doug!

2116
02:05:14.299 --> 02:05:16.176
Nobody's gonna want to work with you if you keep

2117
02:05:16.176 --> 02:05:18.178
holding yourself back!

2118
02:05:18.178 --> 02:05:20.305
You have to embrace challenges head on!

2119
02:05:22.098 --> 02:05:24.100
Besides. what you do is easy!

2120
02:05:24.726 --> 02:05:26.728
I see kids do it all the time.

2121
02:05:28.271 --> 02:05:29.981
I can waste my time with them instead...

2122
02:05:29.981 --> 02:05:31.983
All I want is a real script. not this shit

2123
02:05:31.983 --> 02:05:33.985
you keep bringing me...

2124
02:05:34.402 --> 02:05:36.154
For the love of god. Doug!

2125
02:05:36.154 --> 02:05:38.156
Just do what they say!!

2126
02:05:38.949 --> 02:05:40.951
Go where they tell you to go!

2127
02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:43.703
Then you'll always be able to play and just...

2128
02:05:43.703 --> 02:05:45.705
do whatever you want to do!

2129
02:05:54.839 --> 02:05:56.841
Here's one where you play an Insurance Salesman...

2130
02:05:59.052 --> 02:06:01.054
Its what you wanted. right?

2131
02:06:08.353 --> 02:06:10.355
Maybe he commits murder or something...

2132
02:06:11.106 --> 02:06:13.483
Look. I can only do so much!

2133
02:06:17.404 --> 02:06:19.406
Oliver stopped by today.

2134
02:06:20.532 --> 02:06:22.534
... And?...

2135
02:06:22.867 --> 02:06:24.869
And I'm going to Budapest in

2136
02:06:24.869 --> 02:06:26.371
the next couple of weeks after this

2137
02:06:26.371 --> 02:06:28.373
shit show you got me on is over...

2138
02:06:28.957 --> 02:06:30.959
And then. I'm firing you.

2139
02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:35.171
Are you fucking kidding me?

2140
02:06:39.092 --> 02:06:40.927
Did you forget who got you this far?

2141
02:06:40.927 --> 02:06:42.929
And I thank you for helping me get this far.

2142
02:06:42.929 --> 02:06:44.931
but I'm gonna take my career in a whole different direction.

2143
02:06:45.849 --> 02:06:47.851
I wanna go a little further...

2144
02:06:48.143 --> 02:06:50.145
That's why you're fired.

2145
02:06:51.604 --> 02:06:53.606
Nothin' personal. just Business.

2146
02:06:59.237 --> 02:07:01.239
"Nothing Personal. Just Business"

2147
02:09:27.051 --> 02:09:29.053
Awesome!

2148
02:09:29.053 --> 02:09:30.263
Thank god you're here!

2149
02:09:30.263 --> 02:09:32.265
Wouldn't miss it for the world! How's it going?

2150
02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:34.267
Good. good. Come on over here. we got everything set up for you

2151
02:09:34.267 --> 02:09:36.269
Ok... --We're running a little late. but we should pick up

2152
02:09:36.269 --> 02:09:37.770
the slack after lunch...

2153
02:09:37.770 --> 02:09:39.772
But if you have a seat right here.

2154
02:09:40.190 --> 02:09:42.192
we'll be right with you. Thanks!

2155
02:13:12.777 --> 02:13:17.407
