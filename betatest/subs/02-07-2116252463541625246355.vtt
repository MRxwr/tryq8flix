00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:21.676
Hello?

3
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.076
Hello?

4
00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:13.528
<i>Very good.</i>

5
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.230
<i>Now. if that's not the sound
of being a man. I'm deaf.</i>

6
00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:20.233
<i>We're talking about laying
down the damn law</i>

7
00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.704
<i>and standing up for yourself.</i>

8
00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:24.706
Oh. going the speed limit. huh?

9
00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.107
It's funny. if I'm going
the speed limit.

10
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.307
and you're going faster
than me.

11
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.409
that means you're going
above the speed limit.

12
00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.411
<i>If you're done being nice for no
reason. I want you to scream.</i>

13
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:34.414
<i>Chapter five.</i>

14
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:37.118
<i>Let's all chant the word
"balls." Balls.</i>

15
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.319
- Balls. balls. balls.
- <i>Balls. balls. balls.</i>

16
00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:52.100
<i>Hi. this is Charlotte. Leave a message. Bye.</i>

17
00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.501
Hi. love.

18
00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:57.839
Just want to let you know that
I am almost to my new post.

19
00:03:57.872 --> 00:03:59.006
which is exciting.

20
00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.243
Anyway. call me.

21
00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:07.280
Would love to hear your voice.
you know. or don't.

22
00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:13.420
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Actually. no.

23
00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.656
I would like if you would
call me. please.

24
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.494
This is me saying
what I want. so there.

25
00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:26.167
Okay. well. it's Finn.
Love you. Call me. Okay. bye.

26
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.239
<i>Balls. It's healthy.
Balls. Balls. Balls. Balls.</i>

27
00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.063
<i>Absolutely.
Good afternoon to you as well.</i>

28
00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:58.866
<i>Well. if you've got no holes to
make. make some now.</i>

29
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.469
<i>as the storm is going to be
a big one.</i>

30
00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:04.071
<i>We're talking about
a crippling...</i>

31
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.975
Hi.

32
00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.644
Where can I find the...?

33
00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:15.116
Thank you.

34
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.919
- Mr. Parker. I told you...
- Well. excuse me. Miss Sherwyn.

35
00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:21.722
I told you that
I'm here to listen.

36
00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:23.057
It's Sherman.

37
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.759
See. it's just. I'm worried.

38
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:28.162
Now. this pipeline is a feat of human
ingenuity. I mean. look at this.

39
00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:34.802
This is plastic. cradled in steel
laying underground in Portland cement.

40
00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:37.672
I'll cut you a generous check.
easy as a signature.

41
00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:41.341
And... What-what is so funny?

42
00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:46.848
It's just the... It's the irony. I've got an
environmentalist staying on the second floor.

43
00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:50.551
- See. I'm concerned that...
- Hon. hon. hon. I got environmental guys.

44
00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:55.488
I got MIT guys that are smarter than some
environmentalist on the second floor.

45
00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:58.358
Okay? They do
lots of impact studies. they...

46
00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.529
- Hi. I don't mean to interrupt.
- Oh. no. Please do.

47
00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.097
- Can I help you?
- Are you Jeanine?

48
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.267
Yeah. I... You must be
the new ranger.

49
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.203
Yeah.
I'm Finn Wheeler. US Forest Service.

50
00:06:09.237 --> 00:06:11.906
- Oh. I'm Jeanine Sherman.
- Sam Parker. Midland Gas.

51
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.641
Oh. what a coinkydink.

52
00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:17.078
- Excuse me?
- The pipeline. right? That's your project?

53
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:19.814
- It is.
- Yeah. I'm going to be stationed in Beaverfield

54
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.616
for the duration
of construction.

55
00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:23.818
- Well. lucky me.
- Should it go through.

56
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:26.020
It will. I'm confident.

57
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:29.123
Has to be
a majority vote. Mr. Parker.

58
00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.392
Sure is a lot
of beautiful nature here.

59
00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.896
It'd be a shame to break grounds
so close to a national forest.

60
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.633
A man that doesn't
want to conquer nature

61
00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:41.035
doesn't understand
how brutal it is. Ranger.

62
00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:46.140
Oh. no. I'm so sorry. I wasn't trying
to be like. "Oh. It'd be a shame."

63
00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:50.177
- I wasn't trying to make a...
- May I take your luggage?

64
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:52.513
Oh. uh. miss?

65
00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:55.482
Yeah. uh. Jeanine. you know.
I can get that.

66
00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:58.451
Nope. Breakfast is 7:00
to 9:00 in the café.

67
00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:01.522
and then we reopen again
at noon.

68
00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.125
For now. I'm the only game
in town. food-wise.

69
00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:07.595
open business. especially
with the storm coming.

70
00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:08.696
What a night.

71
00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.298
Yeah. I hear we got
a big one coming.

72
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:13.768
Probably overblown.
Local news guys just love fearmongering.

73
00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:16.904
Hey. Jeanine.
We got café customers.

74
00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:18.139
Do you want me to
take care of it?

75
00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:21.242
No. I'm making sandwiches.

76
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:23.443
All of your pictures are...
I got.

77
00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.947
Do you mind helping
the ranger get settled?

78
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.816
Yeah. you go run this place
'cause you're my damn hero. okay?

79
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:31.185
Hi. Ranger.

80
00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:32.820
Oh. Finn.

81
00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.722
Finn Wheeler.

82
00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.090
You're the mailman.

83
00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:38.392
Person.
Yeah. gender is a construct.

84
00:07:38.426 --> 00:07:39.459
- Cecily.
- Hey.

85
00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:43.297
Oh. I have mail for the ranger.

86
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:44.497
- Oh. really?
- Uh-huh.

87
00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:47.868
Not littering.
I'm just excited.

88
00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:50.037
Yeah. not judging.
Just watching it.

89
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:54.508
"I'm writing to inform you of Emerson
Flint's commercial trapping activity." Hmm.

90
00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:56.677
"Contact road authorities.

91
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:59.613
Sincerely. Dr. Jane Ellis.
PhD. DVM.

92
00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:02.016
and professor of zoology.
and environmental studies.

93
00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:03.417
Room 207."

94
00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:09.423
- Well. ka-ching. I've got a case.
- A case.

95
00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:13.127
Yeah. I'm going to head over
to this guy. Flint's place.

96
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.328
Can I walk that?

97
00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:16.630
It's a bit of a schlep.
yeah. but I can show you

98
00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:18.232
'cause I have a delivery
out that way.

99
00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.934
If that's okay.

100
00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:21.402
- It's totally okay. Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:23.304
- Hey. go ahead and...
- I'm just going to change.

102
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:27.408
...put on your ranger gear.
or on your steed. or... Okay.

103
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.477
- Okay. Yeah.
- Bye.

104
00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:34.749
- So you live at the inn?
- I do.

105
00:08:34.782 --> 00:08:36.250
- Yeah. it's pretty sweet. right?
- Yeah.

106
00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:38.452
I rented a room
when I first transferred jobs

107
00:08:38.486 --> 00:08:41.489
thinking that I'd eventually get
a place in town. but I don't know.

108
00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.090
two days turned into
four weeks.

109
00:08:43.124 --> 00:08:45.126
and Jeanine wouldn't let me
leave. and so I was like.

110
00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:47.828
"Oh. you want me to help
you tidy some rooms in exchange

111
00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:51.265
for staying at your sweet-ass
mansh?" "Yes. please."

112
00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:52.933
- A "mansh"?
- Mansion.

113
00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:55.302
- Oh. right.
- Want some hot Beaverfield goss?

114
00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.971
Uh. yeah.

115
00:08:57.004 --> 00:09:03.310
So Jeanine's husband met a woman
at a bar and they ran off together.

116
00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:06.113
Jeanine hasn't really been
the same since.

117
00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:11.352
- Dang.
- Yeah.

118
00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:14.221
Word is. they left for Belize.

119
00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:17.224
- Ouch.
- I hear Belize sucks this time of year.

120
00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:20.161
Unlike Beaverfield.
real fucking sun shining.

121
00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:22.663
Should've packed
our snowshoes.

122
00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:25.566
What?
People do that?

123
00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:26.801
- What. snowshoeing?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.669
Oh. sure.

125
00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:31.338
You know. fun fact.
not only is it the oldest.

126
00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:34.675
but remains one of the most effective
means of traversing the ice.

127
00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:37.978
and snow. of course.
because snowshoeing.

128
00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:39.213
Wow.

129
00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.816
Yeah. you're going to
fit right in at Beaverfield.

130
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:44.318
Everyone here is a little
questionable.

131
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:46.120
You know. the weather.
the people. everything.

132
00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:52.093
Fancy.

133
00:09:52.126 --> 00:09:54.795
Devon's a tech dude.
and Joaquim runs the yoga sesh.

134
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:58.199
They're all like an ex-city.
nature-loving. millionaire power couple.

135
00:09:58.232 --> 00:09:59.700
You know the type.

136
00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:04.872
Hi. boys. this is Finny.
the new ranger.

137
00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:09.578
You just put the mail on
the marble table. thank you.

138
00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:12.279
We're friends.

139
00:10:12.313 --> 00:10:13.347
Yo. Cecily.

140
00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:15.550
Yo. Gwen.

141
00:10:15.584 --> 00:10:18.752
I know you got my starter
and my fuel injector.

142
00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:20.955
- I don't. no. not yet.
- That's weird.

143
00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:22.189
Sorry.

144
00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:23.958
I ordered them like the fourth
of the last month

145
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.360
and by my algebra. it's been
like three whole weeks.

146
00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:27.828
I'll keep an eye open for it.

147
00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:31.065
Marcus. Marcus!

148
00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:33.602
Wait. you are going to
want to see this.

149
00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.202
- Damn.
- Fuck. Marcus.

150
00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:37.338
- Shit.
- What time is it?

151
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.174
- Sorry. babe. Huh?
- "Sorry. huh" is not a time. Marcus.

152
00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:42.143
- Are you high?
- Baby. no.

153
00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:44.111
Drinking and driving
is for dummies. honey.

154
00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:47.181
Don't talk to me... There's strangers.
who is that? Hey. what's your name?

155
00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:49.618
- I'm Ranger Finn Wheeler.
- What?

156
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.620
He's a new ranger in town.

157
00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:53.654
- Oh. that's ranger thing...
- What he say?

158
00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:56.257
- That's that. Y'all both police?
- I'm Cecily.

159
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.294
We've talked many times.
Welcome to Beaverfield. It's a freak show.

160
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.263
Suck my dick.

161
00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.297
She had too much soda.

162
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.967
- Colorful couple.
- Yeah. quite a show.

163
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:08.903
- Eh?
- Oh. my goodness. gracious.

164
00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:11.640
- Proud of it.
- Yeah. they're in it for a big check from the pipeline.

165
00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.542
It's not funny.
We're just renting here.

166
00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:16.043
- How do you know all this stuff?
- A big bag full of cigarettes.

167
00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:19.013
You're not actually insinuating
that you read people's mail?

168
00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:20.814
- No. I'm kidding.
- It's a felon.

169
00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:23.951
You're the new ranger. hello.

170
00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:27.188
- And who's this?
- Stephen King's very own Trish.

171
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:30.157
- What? What did you say?
- I said. "Beaverfield's queen Trish."

172
00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:32.326
Oh. uh-huh.
Hello. Trisha Anderton.

173
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.795
- Proud owner of Anderton Maple Flowers.
- Hey. nice to meet...

174
00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:40.602
It's been in the family 90 years and
everybody knows but crafting is my passion.

175
00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:42.504
- Boo!
- Oh!

176
00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:44.872
It's you.

177
00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:48.943
- It's a little pale me.
- Has anybody made you a snowfall angel before?

178
00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.345
You put it on your Christmas tree.
do you have a Christmas tree?

179
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.782
- Well. not currently.
- Or do you celebrate Kwanzaa. put it on your Kwanzaa tree?

180
00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:57.418
- No. such thing.
- I am going to open my own craft store

181
00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:59.320
as soon as that pipeline
comes through.

182
00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:00.321
Just mark them words.

183
00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:04.225
Hello. hello. hello.

184
00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:05.960
One. two. three.

185
00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:09.363
He doesn't get any attention ever
since little Chachi came into my life.

186
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.466
- Do you? Look at this.
- Ooh!

187
00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:15.302
There she is.
it's Cecily the mailman.

188
00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.871
- No. thank you. Stop. stop.
- Ranger Finn Wheeler. Hey. how are you doing?

189
00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:19.574
Hello. Ranger.

190
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.009
- Cool. never the left.
- Never the left. My kind of guy.

191
00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.511
It's not what he meant.

192
00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:24.945
- How are you?
- Come on.

193
00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:26.615
Oh. I got something for you.
Ranger.

194
00:12:26.648 --> 00:12:29.350
It's from our own private
reserve right there.

195
00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.185
You guys. so many gifts.

196
00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:33.821
The best syrup in Vermont.
Oh. my God. are you kidding my behind?

197
00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:35.222
What happened?

198
00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:38.425
Jiminy Christmas.
hippies knocked down our sign again.

199
00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:40.027
Oh. It's Antifa.

200
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.097
I mean look at that. Great job.
Picasso. you put an X through it.

201
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.666
You're not going to stop
the pipeline.

202
00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:46.500
Do you have this problem
in your last town?

203
00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:49.270
- No.
- Brooklyn hipsters.

204
00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:50.938
Yeah. you just give 'em
a big old knock

205
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:52.439
on the old craniums. right?

206
00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:56.110
Oh. oh. arrest her. Ranger.
she's the one. lock her up.

207
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.513
Lock her up. yeah. lock her up.
lock her up.

208
00:12:58.546 --> 00:13:00.214
Say goodbye. Chachi.

209
00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:04.485
There's a new sheriff in town.
you're not really a sheriff.

210
00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:05.687
No. you're not.

211
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.921
They seem cool. huh?

212
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.857
He boned Gwen in their
sugaring room.

213
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.492
- No.
- Yes.

214
00:13:11.526 --> 00:13:14.428
That aggressive mechanic lady?

215
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.864
That's the one.

216
00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:19.668
Whew. That's... That's a dish.

217
00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:25.172
Now this thing.
what exactly is this?

218
00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:30.044
Oh. this? This is Parker's
phallic fire totem.

219
00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:32.913
He's stuck 'cause he needs a
majority town vote to build it.

220
00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:37.619
Half want the pipeline cash and half
want to save the trees or whatever.

221
00:13:37.652 --> 00:13:40.220
Anywho. I think the only holdouts
are Jeanine and the boys.

222
00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:42.222
- Do you need a hand with that?
- Yes. please.

223
00:13:44.425 --> 00:13:48.962
So you got a big family.
small family. no family?

224
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:53.834
No. it's just me and my sis.
how about you?

225
00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:57.237
That's so lucky. No. there's seven of us.
I'm the youngest.

226
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:59.239
My sister and I were born
the same year.

227
00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:05.379
Irish twins. same grade even. so it was like.
"You want a toy? Take it from somebody else."

228
00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:07.915
This here. right?
You coming with?

229
00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.350
Actually if you wouldn't mind.

230
00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:11.318
you want to just
bring him that package

231
00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:13.487
'cause Flint likes to
know who's around here.

232
00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:15.889
so you could introduce
yourself.

233
00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:17.826
Neighborly fellow.
my kind of guy.

234
00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.794
Thanks for the tip.

235
00:14:19.828 --> 00:14:22.764
Hey. oh. just one last...

236
00:14:22.797 --> 00:14:25.633
- Hello Charlotte. hello?
- You might want to read this.

237
00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:27.702
Hello? Hello?

238
00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:31.205
Charlotte. hello?
I can't...

239
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:33.140
You're good.

240
00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:36.944
Love. hello. can you hear me?

241
00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.079
Hell... Ah. crap.

242
00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:45.486
<i>Hi. this is
Charlotte. leave a message. bye.</i>

243
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.523
Hi. Charlotte. it's me.
it's Finn.

244
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:51.992
Glad I'm finally getting through.
it's so hard to leave a voicemail. It's...

245
00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:55.929
I'll call you back.

246
00:14:59.768 --> 00:15:00.869
Mr. Flint.

247
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.509
Mr. Flint.

248
00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:03.163
Oh! Oh-ho! Ha! Oh. man.

249
00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:05.667
Oh!

250
00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:10.538
You have 30 seconds to get
the fuck off my property.

251
00:16:10.572 --> 00:16:12.439
I'm Ranger Wheeler.

252
00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:14.943
You're way the hell out of
your jurisdiction. Ranger.

253
00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:19.379
- You see. I received a complaint from Dr. Ellis.
- Regarding?

254
00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:24.051
Regarding concerns of possible
commercial trapping.

255
00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:30.525
You can tell Dr. Stalin I make my
living legally on my own fucking land.

256
00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:32.025
It's called freedom.

257
00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.428
Uh. you know. as long as you're
not doing it on US forest.

258
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:38.499
I don't recognize your job.
your stupid uniform.

259
00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:40.067
or the government
you work for.

260
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.504
You're down to 10 seconds.
nine...

261
00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:45.172
- Oh. okay. yeah. Well...
- Seven.

262
00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:47.509
Are you gonna keep counting?
I have a package for you right there.

263
00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:51.044
Five. four. three.

264
00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:53.882
He's armed!
He's heavily armed.

265
00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:58.151
- Thanks for handling my package.
- Do you know this? Oh!

266
00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:02.690
He's not my kind of guy at all.
which is the neighborly kind.

267
00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:05.593
- Are you hungry?
- Huh? Maybe. I think.

268
00:17:05.627 --> 00:17:08.596
Yes. this requires
active measures. come here.

269
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.532
I tried to warn you.
but I think you were on your phone.

270
00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:11.533
I was on my phone.

271
00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:21.241
I bring in their packages
in the winter

272
00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:26.614
so I have full access
to the kitch kingdom.

273
00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:28.583
Right? It's pretty great.

274
00:17:28.616 --> 00:17:29.784
It's awesome.

275
00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:31.218
Do you want to put on
a song?

276
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:32.654
Oh. yeah. sure. on the jukebox?

277
00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:35.990
Yeah. and I'll see if there's
something I can heat up.

278
00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:37.559
- Okay.
- Okay.

279
00:17:42.362 --> 00:17:43.898
It's a lot of '90s.

280
00:17:43.932 --> 00:17:45.733
Huh?

281
00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:48.536
It's a lot of '90...
I'm just going to put something on.

282
00:17:54.976 --> 00:18:00.548
Yes. I love this song!

283
00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:24.572
So. what brings you
to Beaverfield?

284
00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:27.008
Hard ball right from the top.

285
00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:31.079
- I had an incident at work.
- Did you touch someone?

286
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.146
- No.
- 'Cause time's up. you too.

287
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.650
Yes. but I didn't touch anyone.

288
00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:38.151
- Do you want to show me on the soap bottle angel?
- It's not about touching.

289
00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:40.054
I'm sorry. yes. go ahead.

290
00:18:40.088 --> 00:18:45.192
Some guys I know
convinced me to fish Grout Pond

291
00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:49.329
without a permit and then
they posted it to social media.

292
00:18:49.363 --> 00:18:51.431
- I mean. can you believe it?
- Dummies.

293
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.534
So a transfer was a way for me
to keep my job.

294
00:18:53.568 --> 00:18:55.069
- And Charlotte thought
- Charlotte?

295
00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:57.237
Yes. Charlotte
my girlfriend.

296
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.643
She thinks that this situation
could be good for our relationship.

297
00:19:01.676 --> 00:19:07.115
- How is that?
- Well. you know. she thinks that I am too "available."

298
00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:10.250
Right. because women like men who
aren't. ahem. there.

299
00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:12.620
But. you know. I figure I won't
need a whole year

300
00:19:12.654 --> 00:19:14.956
and maybe. you know.
assuming nobody better comes along...

301
00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:19.727
Your first kombucha?

302
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:24.565
- Assuming that nobody better comes along.
- You will get back together or?

303
00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:26.567
Well. technically.
we're not broken up.

304
00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:28.936
- Ah. but you're not living together?
- No.

305
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.338
- You're not seeing each other?
- Not currently.

306
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:33.641
- You're not talking.
- There's texting.

307
00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:36.309
And you're keeping
your options open?

308
00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.614
Because Charlotte thinks that...
Oh. my God.

309
00:19:39.647 --> 00:19:42.282
- I'm broken up. aren't I?
- I think so.

310
00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:44.686
Want to do something
violent?

311
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:46.219
- Ah!
- Wow.

312
00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:48.723
I think it's like an English
axe. just weighted differently?

313
00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:51.491
- They use a metric system.
- Yeah. I think that's what it is.

314
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.164
Oh!

315
00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.765
God. that was beautiful.

316
00:19:57.799 --> 00:20:00.802
- I'm being hustled.
- You are. I'm a shark and this is a long con.

317
00:20:00.835 --> 00:20:03.838
- Clearly. All right.
- Welcome to your worst nightmare.

318
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.807
All right.

319
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.942
- I'm Ranger Wheeler
- Hold on.

320
00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:11.179
Before you do anything. just recognize
that you're holding a real murder weapon.

321
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.581
- Yes. Acknowledged.
- And it requires some training.

322
00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:15.183
Yes.

323
00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:19.554
So just try to flip it one time and
then land it on the second flip.

324
00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:22.156
Just like a flip and then it
lands on the second flip.

325
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.758
- Yeah. okay.
- Does that make sense?

326
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:25.126
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You got this?

327
00:20:25.159 --> 00:20:26.226
Okay. You got this.

328
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.298
- Oh. yes!
- Oh. yes!

329
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.266
- Up high.
- Yeah!

330
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.971
- Down low. Too slow. oh.
- How did I not see that one coming?

331
00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:39.439
How did you get into
rangering?

332
00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:41.142
- Rangering?
- Yeah.

333
00:20:41.175 --> 00:20:45.278
Yeah. that's what we call it.
but you're going to freak. but I read that.

334
00:20:46.848 --> 00:20:50.450
- My butt?
- N-No.

335
00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:51.953
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- <i>Walden</i>?

336
00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:53.521
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. absolutely.

337
00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:55.857
- You poet.
- Yeah. I was 15.

338
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.425
- It changed my life. Yeah?
- Yeah. it changed mine. too.

339
00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:00.995
Bet you've been to all the biggies. right?
You've been to Sequoia?

340
00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:04.198
- Been to Sequoia. I've been to Kings Canyon.
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:05.666
Been to Yellowstone?

342
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.400
Yellowstone.
I've been to Yellowstone.

343
00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.036
You know. I camped out
a couple of nights

344
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.605
- in the township on the way up.
- Wow.

345
00:21:10.638 --> 00:21:13.440
Yeah. You ever been to
Gallatin National Forest?

346
00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:18.445
No. but I would really
love to go. Yeah.

347
00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:23.283
You know. I feel. um.
most myself outdoors.

348
00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:26.319
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's a cool life you have.

349
00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.055
Yeah. I guess so.

350
00:21:28.089 --> 00:21:32.160
"A taste for the beautiful is
most cultivated out of doors."

351
00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:34.962
- <i>Walden</i>?
- It's <i>Walden</i>. Yeah.

352
00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:38.566
<i>I want to stand with you
On a mountain</i>

353
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:41.434
Hey. um. Ranger Finn.

354
00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:45.438
Mailperson Cecily?

355
00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:50.845
- <i>I wanna lay Like this forever...</i>
- Can I kiss you?

356
00:21:50.878 --> 00:21:53.848
<i>Until the sky...</i>

357
00:21:56.284 --> 00:21:59.287
I'm so sorry. Hello?
Hello?

358
00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:00.955
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you serious right now?

359
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:05.392
- Hello? Charlotte?
- Are you really really answering a call... Wow.

360
00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:08.896
- Hello? Yeah. hey. Uh-huh. yeah.
- I'm sorry.

361
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.967
Yeah. no.
I'm just shopping.

362
00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:15.435
Grow a pair.

363
00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:18.471
Yeah. uh. Sorry. Wait. what?

364
00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:23.443
Oh. no. you need
the actual AAA card for that.

365
00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:45.032
Let's go outside and do
our business.

366
00:22:45.066 --> 00:22:48.536
Yes. that's right. Chachi.

367
00:22:48.569 --> 00:22:50.905
Yes. you are my good boy.

368
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:55.610
Poo-poo potty. please.

369
00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.002
Chachi.

370
00:23:27.808 --> 00:23:28.843
Ooh. boy.

371
00:23:30.378 --> 00:23:32.980
Chachi. what in the hell...?

372
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.002
Okay. Come on!

373
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.558
- Mrs. Anderton?
- It's the damn devil that ate my baby.

374
00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:18.759
Devon found her like this.

375
00:24:18.793 --> 00:24:21.295
I have a triathlon in
August so. you know.

376
00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:22.964
4:00 a.m. sprints.
and I heard screaming.

377
00:24:22.997 --> 00:24:25.399
Well. let's be honest.
The whole neighborhood heard screaming.

378
00:24:25.433 --> 00:24:28.135
I told you.
I didn't need your help.

379
00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:29.370
I'm going to go
get a croissant.

380
00:24:29.403 --> 00:24:35.076
My baby.
That monster killed my Chachi.

381
00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:38.012
I'm so sorry. I'm confused.
Are we talking about a real baby?

382
00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:41.315
Because if that's the case. oh.
my God. but if not. it's a dog.

383
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:43.351
For God's sake. Joaquin.
show a little respect.

384
00:24:43.384 --> 00:24:45.619
It's Joaquim with an M.

385
00:24:45.653 --> 00:24:48.322
I don't mean to be rude. Pete.
but your dog only barked at Jews.

386
00:24:48.356 --> 00:24:50.057
And brown people.
no carbs for you.

387
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:54.195
There's something
out there.

388
00:24:54.228 --> 00:24:55.563
Probably just a coyote.

389
00:24:58.866 --> 00:25:00.968
Or a possum. hon.

390
00:25:01.002 --> 00:25:02.069
Those are scary. huh?

391
00:25:02.103 --> 00:25:03.070
No.

392
00:25:03.104 --> 00:25:05.006
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Trish.

393
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:07.375
but everything in these woods
eats little dogs.

394
00:25:07.408 --> 00:25:08.876
- I can't get on the internet.
- Calm down.

395
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:10.244
What do you think. Dr. Ellis?

396
00:25:16.283 --> 00:25:17.318
Hi.

397
00:25:18.953 --> 00:25:22.890
Uh. it's a little too early
to tell. Mrs. Sherman.

398
00:25:22.923 --> 00:25:25.726
mainly because I literally
don't know what's going on.

399
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.630
Hi. everyone.
I'm Dr. Ellis. Jane.

400
00:25:29.663 --> 00:25:31.465
I'm here to stop the pipeline.

401
00:25:31.499 --> 00:25:35.770
A prominent environmentalist
who's staying here with us.

402
00:25:35.803 --> 00:25:38.339
- Oh. Dr. Ellis. I got your...
- Oh. my God.

403
00:25:38.372 --> 00:25:40.441
The power's out. like.
everywhere.

404
00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:43.911
Oh. no.

405
00:25:43.944 --> 00:25:45.746
Our poor Chachi
left us this morning.

406
00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:48.616
Come here. Oh.

407
00:25:49.617 --> 00:25:52.353
- Sorry. Trish.
- I'm sorry. too.

408
00:25:52.386 --> 00:25:54.055
Okay. everyone.

409
00:25:54.088 --> 00:25:57.691
I'm going to go to town. and I'm going
to get the backup generators going.

410
00:25:57.725 --> 00:26:00.661
log Chachi's death.
and get you back on the internet.

411
00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:04.065
Oh. my goodness. What now?

412
00:26:04.098 --> 00:26:05.332
- Jeanine.
- Yes.

413
00:26:05.366 --> 00:26:07.234
You got to let us in.
Our cedars broke.

414
00:26:07.268 --> 00:26:10.971
Hey. yo. just so you know that
the streets is all storm-fucked.

415
00:26:11.639 --> 00:26:13.207
Storm-fucked.

416
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.276
- What did she just say?
- I think he said...

417
00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:17.278
- Storm-fucked.
- Yeah.

418
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:19.847
I'll be right back.

419
00:26:34.095 --> 00:26:35.129
Oh.

420
00:27:11.465 --> 00:27:12.500
Heavens to Betsy.

421
00:27:38.926 --> 00:27:41.295
Heavens to Betsy.

422
00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:04.818
What is this?

423
00:28:14.094 --> 00:28:15.196
Holy sh...!

424
00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:25.706
Ranger. you look like
you just seen a corpse.

425
00:28:26.675 --> 00:28:28.510
You're right.

426
00:28:28.543 --> 00:28:31.779
Uh... The roads are effed.

427
00:28:31.812 --> 00:28:34.715
- Yes. we just said that.
- Yes. No shit. dummy. We said it.

428
00:28:34.748 --> 00:28:37.818
And something's wrong
with the generator.

429
00:28:37.851 --> 00:28:39.887
Which generator?

430
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.656
- All of them.
- Wait. what?

431
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:46.327
- What does that mean?
- It looks like somebody went at them with like a knife?

432
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.396
What the hell do you mean a knife?

433
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.366
Is that what killed
my Chachi?

434
00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:54.368
Might we put
the horror leash away?

435
00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:57.805
What kind of animal is smart enough to go
around town. slashing all the generators.

436
00:28:57.838 --> 00:28:59.708
but stupid enough to eat
your stupid Chachi?

437
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.874
Okay. you're over the line.
wolf city!

438
00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:02.510
Why don't you use
your inside voice?

439
00:29:02.544 --> 00:29:05.312
I'll use whatever voice I want.
Maybe I'll use my outside voice.

440
00:29:05.346 --> 00:29:07.348
Okay. well.
if the power grid is out.

441
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:09.984
it's going to take at least a
week for the power to get back up.

442
00:29:10.017 --> 00:29:14.922
- A week?
- Uh. also. there's a dead body under your porch.

443
00:29:21.128 --> 00:29:25.165
I didn't want to
leave him on the...

444
00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:28.168
So I left him on the table.

445
00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:38.379
Aw. shit.
That's your husband. ain't it?

446
00:29:38.412 --> 00:29:40.281
Didn't get to Belize
after all. huh. Dave?

447
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.786
- Ooh.
- This is definitely a canine.

448
00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:47.488
- How do you know?
- Probably a wolf.

449
00:29:47.522 --> 00:29:50.958
What are you. like. a wolf detective
now. Marcus? I don't think so.

450
00:29:50.991 --> 00:29:53.193
He's right.
The leg muscles have been severed.

451
00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:55.429
It's a canine.
It's to immobilize their prey.

452
00:29:55.462 --> 00:29:57.766
Accurate assessment
for a gas man.

453
00:29:57.798 --> 00:30:02.336
Well. I used to do a little brown bear
hunting in Siberia. It's a beautiful animal.

454
00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:04.805
Yo. lady.
you a wolf detective. though?

455
00:30:04.838 --> 00:30:06.675
Really good. Marcus.
Close. no.

456
00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:09.076
- She studies animals...
- No. thanks.

457
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:10.878
Tea toddler.
see for yourself.

458
00:30:10.911 --> 00:30:12.846
Well. I'd. I'd take some
if you'd be so kind.

459
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.582
- grunts]
- I would be.

460
00:30:14.616 --> 00:30:18.520
What happened to Dave?
It's just so awful.

461
00:30:18.553 --> 00:30:24.258
Anyway. um. lady doctor. do you think
what got Dave also got my Chachi?

462
00:30:24.291 --> 00:30:27.161
If you'll excuse me.
I need to go compare these fur samples.

463
00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:28.630
Peter.

464
00:30:28.663 --> 00:30:30.331
He don't stink 'cause
he froze up.

465
00:30:30.364 --> 00:30:32.634
- Maybe we should just take it inside.
- Yes.

466
00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:36.538
- It's so disgusting.
- Now one body. there's two bodies.

467
00:30:38.872 --> 00:30:41.676
You know. nothing's gonna
get down that mountain but a snowplow.

468
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.645
Does Beaverfield have
a snowplow?

469
00:30:43.678 --> 00:30:45.946
- Fuck yeah. we do.
- Good.

470
00:30:45.979 --> 00:30:49.149
I just need that starter
and fuel injector I ordered.

471
00:30:49.183 --> 00:30:53.487
- Oh.
- Oh. there's a wild animal out there

472
00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:57.324
and I don't wanna say it
out loud.

473
00:30:57.358 --> 00:31:01.696
but who knows who or when
it's going to kill next?

474
00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:04.599
Who she's going to kill next?

475
00:31:04.632 --> 00:31:07.535
- I do not find that funny.
- Hey. hey. hey.

476
00:31:07.569 --> 00:31:09.604
- It's a little funny.
- I have an idea.

477
00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:12.206
This Flint guy.
he's an expert hunter. right?

478
00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:13.742
- Oh. yeah.
- You could say that.

479
00:31:13.775 --> 00:31:17.378
- Well. maybe we pay him a visit...
- And kill the damn thing?

480
00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:21.549
Actually. I was going to say.
maybe h-h-he could trap it?

481
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:27.154
You can't go by yourself.
man. That psycho. he's nuts.

482
00:31:27.187 --> 00:31:29.758
- You could come with me.
- No. I'm good.

483
00:31:29.791 --> 00:31:30.759
Anyone else?

484
00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:32.192
We're trying to have
a baby.

485
00:31:32.226 --> 00:31:33.427
And my husband
is dead.

486
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.696
And Chachi also.

487
00:31:35.597 --> 00:31:36.631
Cecily?

488
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:41.135
They can probably only
eat one of us at a time.

489
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.239
Uh...

490
00:31:45.272 --> 00:31:46.841
You know.
if we had some snowshoes.

491
00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:48.075
we'd be killing this walk right
about now.

492
00:31:48.108 --> 00:31:49.343
We get it. you love snowshoes.

493
00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:54.948
Yeah.
Thanks for coming with me.

494
00:31:54.982 --> 00:31:58.218
It's really...
really cool of you.

495
00:31:58.252 --> 00:32:01.488
Cool? Is it cool of me.
like "a friend way cool of me."

496
00:32:01.523 --> 00:32:03.792
or is it cool of me in like "a
girl you almost make out with.

497
00:32:03.825 --> 00:32:08.495
but then don't because your
ex-girlfriend calls" cool of me way?

498
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.566
- Look. last night...
- No. Finn. it's fine. You're not over your ex.

499
00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:13.000
Let's not make
a thing out of it.

500
00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:15.102
Well. no. you're wrong.
You know?

501
00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:19.607
Last night was very.
very big for me.

502
00:32:19.641 --> 00:32:22.409
In like a sad way 'cause
you're with the wrong girl?

503
00:32:22.443 --> 00:32:25.946
No. because I was
with the right girl.

504
00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:29.183
One who's smart
and beautiful.

505
00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:30.284
True.

506
00:32:30.317 --> 00:32:31.653
And interesting.

507
00:32:31.686 --> 00:32:32.754
I'm listening.

508
00:32:32.787 --> 00:32:35.523
Look. I blew it. okay?

509
00:32:35.557 --> 00:32:37.892
There's no denying that.

510
00:32:37.926 --> 00:32:41.962
and it's not because
I love Charlotte still.

511
00:32:41.995 --> 00:32:47.034
It's because
I don't know why.

512
00:32:50.471 --> 00:32:55.075
Finn. you're a really likable
guy. and that's great.

513
00:32:55.108 --> 00:32:56.578
A lot of people like you.

514
00:32:56.611 --> 00:33:01.114
Not to sound too heteronormative.
but maybe Charlotte's right.

515
00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:03.383
Maybe you should man up.
you know?

516
00:33:03.417 --> 00:33:05.352
Grow a beard.
hair on your chest.

517
00:33:05.385 --> 00:33:08.021
chug a beer.
yell at someone smaller than you.

518
00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:09.691
I don't know.
yell things like. "Respect me."

519
00:33:09.724 --> 00:33:12.794
I don't know what men do.
I try not to hang out with them too much.

520
00:33:12.827 --> 00:33:16.196
<i>You do realize that we are
prepared to double the offer?</i>

521
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.432
I don't care if you
triple the offer.

522
00:33:18.465 --> 00:33:19.968
We moved up here for scenery.

523
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.504
not your construction scheme.
No.

524
00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:26.206
And scenery requires having
a forest. which you don't F up.

525
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.810
Well. you're really
effing up our people's dreams.

526
00:33:28.843 --> 00:33:31.111
Yeah. well. too bad.
Pete.

527
00:33:31.144 --> 00:33:33.848
Shit. I guess Trish
don't get her craft store. huh?

528
00:33:33.882 --> 00:33:37.150
Craft store?
What about our freaking money?

529
00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:39.219
- I don't know.
- Go ask. Ask.

530
00:33:39.253 --> 00:33:44.091
Yo. P-Parker. so Gwen and I.
we want money.

531
00:33:44.124 --> 00:33:48.362
Oh. sorry. Marcus. if the vote
ain't unanimous. no one gets nothing.

532
00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:51.331
unless you can convince
your neighbors otherwise.

533
00:33:51.365 --> 00:33:54.368
Are you deaf?
We are not going to sell.

534
00:33:54.401 --> 00:33:56.270
- Sorry. neighbors.
- You suck. You both suck.

535
00:33:56.303 --> 00:33:57.906
- I suck?
- You don't belong here!

536
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.676
You're liberal
snowflakes.

537
00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:03.277
Y'all city slickers
suck.

538
00:34:05.045 --> 00:34:07.749
Yeah.

539
00:34:07.782 --> 00:34:11.218
You got everything you. um.
need. Doctor?

540
00:34:11.251 --> 00:34:15.422
Dr. Ellis. do I call you Doctor
or Dr. Jane or...?

541
00:34:15.455 --> 00:34:17.424
Jeanine.
I have everything I need.

542
00:34:17.457 --> 00:34:19.359
Thank you so much for
letting me set up shop in here.

543
00:34:19.393 --> 00:34:20.962
Okay.

544
00:34:20.995 --> 00:34:24.398
- You got enough power?
- Yep. I work in the woods.

545
00:34:24.431 --> 00:34:28.135
- I've got some batteries.
- Okay. okay. Oh.

546
00:34:29.037 --> 00:34:31.204
- Jeanine?
- Okay.

547
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.610
I'm going to find out what
killed your dead husband.

548
00:34:35.643 --> 00:34:38.713
I have excellent samples.
and I'm going to get answers for you.

549
00:34:38.746 --> 00:34:41.114
Uh. okay.

550
00:35:00.969 --> 00:35:03.871
- Do you want me to knock or...?
- No. I got it.

551
00:35:08.308 --> 00:35:09.811
- Are you scared?
- No.

552
00:35:09.844 --> 00:35:11.946
- 'Cause I can hear your tummy.
- I'm not.

553
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.314
- Are you?
- No. I'm punk.

554
00:35:16.017 --> 00:35:18.218
- You're in a punk band?
- I was. actually. in high school. yes.

555
00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:21.089
We were called Megalodons 'cause
our lead singer's name was Meg.

556
00:35:21.154 --> 00:35:22.857
- That's so cool!
- I know. I played...

557
00:35:26.393 --> 00:35:29.631
Either of you care
to illuminate

558
00:35:29.664 --> 00:35:32.132
what the hell happened
to my generator?

559
00:35:35.369 --> 00:35:38.372
Uh. so...

560
00:35:38.405 --> 00:35:40.675
In conclusion.

561
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:45.445
what we're asking is that
you track this thing down and...

562
00:35:45.479 --> 00:35:46.514
Kill it?

563
00:35:54.522 --> 00:35:56.958
- No.
- Okay.

564
00:35:56.991 --> 00:35:59.159
Thank you for your time.
You've made yourself perfectly clear.

565
00:35:59.192 --> 00:36:01.395
We're just going to
get out of your beard.

566
00:36:01.428 --> 00:36:05.667
Mr. Flint. I understand that
you're proud of being tucked away

567
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:12.006
in the outskirts of this town. but.
you know. you're still a part of this town.

568
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.208
This thing is killing people
in the place where you live.

569
00:36:15.242 --> 00:36:17.912
and the people of this town.
everybody's going.

570
00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:24.585
"How the... How the heck are we
going to get rid of this monster?"

571
00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:29.791
You know what? Everybody. every single
one of them. they all voted for you.

572
00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:31.959
- It was really led by you.
- Cecily.

573
00:36:31.993 --> 00:36:33.226
Don't touch that. please.

574
00:36:35.797 --> 00:36:39.366
- Mr. Flint. Emerson.
- Emerson Flint.

575
00:36:39.399 --> 00:36:43.071
People are afraid. and. you know.
no matter what their differences are.

576
00:36:43.104 --> 00:36:46.641
people deserve to feel safe.

577
00:36:46.674 --> 00:36:48.142
I guess what we're asking

578
00:36:48.176 --> 00:36:50.678
is that you...

579
00:36:50.712 --> 00:36:57.585
you be a good neighbor.
you know. like Mr. Rogers.

580
00:36:57.618 --> 00:36:59.587
- Hey. I love him.
- Yeah.

581
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.824
- Mr. Rogers. huh?
- Yeah.

582
00:37:05.893 --> 00:37:06.928
Who's that?

583
00:37:07.729 --> 00:37:09.764
Hmm?

584
00:37:09.797 --> 00:37:17.071
It was all Jeanine's story. you
know. Dave running off and whatnot.

585
00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:21.341
Welcome to Beaverfield.
Population. bunch of liars.

586
00:37:21.374 --> 00:37:23.778
What are you suggesting.
Mrs. Anderton?

587
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:26.379
Pete.
you and Dave were tight.

588
00:37:26.413 --> 00:37:29.083
Did he ever say anything
about going to Bailey's?

589
00:37:29.117 --> 00:37:30.785
Nope. but you know
what's weird?

590
00:37:30.818 --> 00:37:32.754
Jeanine's against
your pipeline. Mr. Parker.

591
00:37:32.787 --> 00:37:34.856
but Dave was really excited
about it.

592
00:37:34.889 --> 00:37:37.125
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

593
00:37:37.158 --> 00:37:39.292
Wait. y'all aren't saying
that...

594
00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:42.262
We just don't know
for sure now. do we?

595
00:37:42.295 --> 00:37:44.665
Shit. You know what
I can't get out of my head?

596
00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:46.433
- Language.
- Tell me.

597
00:37:46.466 --> 00:37:50.605
Come on. All of the generators are just
conveniently mangled by some animal?

598
00:37:50.638 --> 00:37:52.439
- Fuck off.
- Language.

599
00:37:52.472 --> 00:37:57.078
Somebody did this.
a legitimately maladjusted somebody.

600
00:37:57.111 --> 00:38:00.280
Mm. I don't know.
Dr. Ellis did say it was an animal.

601
00:38:00.313 --> 00:38:02.116
- I mean. there was all those hairs.
- Mm.

602
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.988
Well. we definitely have some unknown
knowns and some known unknowns.

603
00:38:09.223 --> 00:38:12.392
What's known is that
animals don't sabotage generators.

604
00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:16.831
but guess what is covered
in hair and totally can?

605
00:38:16.864 --> 00:38:20.168
A werewolf!

606
00:38:20.201 --> 00:38:22.904
No. No. Again. I wasn't...
I wasn't going to say that.

607
00:38:22.937 --> 00:38:29.043
I was going to say...
Emerson Flint.

608
00:38:29.076 --> 00:38:32.780
"It's a Beautiful Day in
the Neighborhood." "Pink Friday."

609
00:38:32.814 --> 00:38:34.982
Then he plays with puppets.
You know.

610
00:38:35.016 --> 00:38:36.984
- Is it the land of make believe?
- I don't think so.

611
00:38:39.086 --> 00:38:42.824
Mr. Flint. I'm convinced this
thing is going to kill again. and...

612
00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:43.891
Finn.

613
00:38:48.428 --> 00:38:50.164
Chachi.

614
00:38:50.198 --> 00:38:52.800
- Oh. my God.
- I know. I know.

615
00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:55.468
I'm not your man. Get out.

616
00:38:55.503 --> 00:38:57.271
Understood. Uh...

617
00:38:57.305 --> 00:39:00.440
You know. we're probably just going to
head back to the inn. save some lives.

618
00:39:00.473 --> 00:39:01.843
- Make a soup.
- Mm-hmm.

619
00:39:01.876 --> 00:39:03.410
I'd die for one of
Jeanine's sandwiches.

620
00:39:03.443 --> 00:39:05.746
- I don't want to die.
- I don't want to die either.

621
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.182
- That would be be terrible.
- Good night.

622
00:39:08.216 --> 00:39:11.085
- Oh. gosh.
- We have to just push.

623
00:39:11.118 --> 00:39:13.654
- Is it jammed?
- You want to leave?

624
00:39:13.688 --> 00:39:18.559
- Uh...
- It's fine.

625
00:39:18.593 --> 00:39:20.595
It's not opening.
I'm going in both directions.

626
00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:22.597
You go ahead. please.
No. spare me.

627
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.265
Oh. please don't.
Oh. please!

628
00:39:26.534 --> 00:39:28.368
- Please don't bother the lock.
- Spare me there.

629
00:39:28.401 --> 00:39:29.804
Think I couldn't do that myself?

630
00:39:29.837 --> 00:39:31.272
I could have gotten that
myself.

631
00:39:31.305 --> 00:39:32.840
But I appreciate it.

632
00:39:32.874 --> 00:39:35.475
- He's definitely the murderer.
- Keep your voice down. be normal.

633
00:39:43.885 --> 00:39:46.721
- Hurry! I need warmth.
- What happened?

634
00:39:46.754 --> 00:39:49.357
- What did he say?
- Emerson killed Chachi.

635
00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:50.958
What?

636
00:39:50.992 --> 00:39:53.561
Hold on a minute.
We don't know that for sure. Cecily.

637
00:39:53.594 --> 00:39:57.031
Does that mean he killed Dave?
Does that mean he killed my husband?

638
00:39:57.064 --> 00:39:58.933
He had Chachi's collar.

639
00:39:58.966 --> 00:40:01.369
She does this a lot.

640
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:04.338
No! That's my child.

641
00:40:05.273 --> 00:40:10.077
That bastard did!

642
00:40:10.111 --> 00:40:13.381
- Okay. okay! Shh! It's all right. It's all right.
- Peter!

643
00:40:13.413 --> 00:40:16.317
She's just happy to have some
closure. and now we finally got it.

644
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.586
It's Emerson.

645
00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:21.689
- Chachi just got his wings. Dave. too.
- Sorry. Trish.

646
00:40:21.722 --> 00:40:24.125
Hey. Jeanine. what do you say we
open up a nice bottle of wine. huh?

647
00:40:24.158 --> 00:40:25.458
- No!
- Okay.

648
00:40:25.492 --> 00:40:27.061
Oh! Uh... Uh. okay.

649
00:40:27.094 --> 00:40:29.730
- Well. maybe not that one. Pete.
- You want some. Gwen.

650
00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:31.999
You're not one to turn away
a spicy rat.

651
00:40:32.033 --> 00:40:34.501
- Why you fucking touch my ass?!
- Whoa. okay.

652
00:40:34.535 --> 00:40:36.671
Keep your hands to yourself.
or I'll cut them the fuck off.

653
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:37.972
Must be
that time of the day.

654
00:40:38.005 --> 00:40:39.206
Don't touch my wife's
ass.

655
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.374
Can I make anybody
a sandwich?

656
00:40:40.408 --> 00:40:41.409
- I'll take one.
- No. you won't.

657
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:42.677
Me. I want one.

658
00:41:03.764 --> 00:41:05.366
Oh. my God.

659
00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:08.903
that was an absolutely
horrible sound you made.

660
00:41:08.936 --> 00:41:11.372
Dr. Ellis. are you okay?

661
00:41:11.405 --> 00:41:14.742
Did you find the answers now?
That was fast.

662
00:41:14.775 --> 00:41:17.345
<i>I compared the DNA
samples.</i>

663
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.816
The hairs from both
Dave's body

664
00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:24.785
and Chachi's little outfit
are a match.

665
00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:26.921
Everything about this predator
is unorthodox.

666
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.158
It's not human.

667
00:41:32.626 --> 00:41:35.329
It's canine. but there are
no matches in the database.

668
00:41:35.363 --> 00:41:37.698
<i>I'm going to keep
running tests. but for now.</i>

669
00:41:37.732 --> 00:41:40.500
<i>what I can tell you is I
don't know what this thing is.</i>

670
00:41:47.041 --> 00:41:50.845
Examining the body. it appears it
feeds like a dog or a wolf. meaning...

671
00:41:50.878 --> 00:41:53.581
Meaning that?
I want to know.

672
00:41:53.614 --> 00:41:56.317
Meaning Dave was
probably eaten alive.

673
00:41:59.854 --> 00:42:01.956
That's fucking rad.

674
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.259
Okay.

675
00:42:05.292 --> 00:42:08.796
Everyone. hey. Everyone. hey.
can I have your attention. please?

676
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:12.767
- Find our way home.
- Between the power outages and the storm.

677
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.171
the whole Emerson thing.
I think we can all agree

678
00:42:17.204 --> 00:42:20.174
that it's unsafe outside
and there's safety in numbers.

679
00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:21.475
- So maybe we...
- We should stay here tonight.

680
00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:25.479
I'm with you. yeah.
I don't wanna go out and get ate.

681
00:42:25.514 --> 00:42:26.881
- Same.
- Jeanine. you got room.

682
00:42:26.914 --> 00:42:28.416
You can put us all up.
can't you?

683
00:42:28.449 --> 00:42:30.885
No. It's just that... Well. I have...

684
00:42:30.918 --> 00:42:32.920
Thank you so much.
Jeanine.

685
00:42:32.953 --> 00:42:34.755
But some people
would have to double up.

686
00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:38.492
Well. I mean. I think
that'd be fine. right. Cecily?

687
00:42:38.527 --> 00:42:41.962
- Okay. Slow down.
- Uh. out of curiosity. who is packing?

688
00:42:41.996 --> 00:42:43.164
I am. yes. sir. America.

689
00:42:43.197 --> 00:42:45.966
Shit.
Well. we're packing. dawg.

690
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.469
I have Dave's hunting
rifle if that would be helpful.

691
00:42:48.502 --> 00:42:52.373
Oh. gosh.
I almost forgot. Um...

692
00:42:52.406 --> 00:42:56.377
- I got... It's teensy.
- It's a purse gun.

693
00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.012
- Excuse you.
- Okay.

694
00:42:58.045 --> 00:43:03.217
You know. I think we should keep a
gun in every room. just to be safe.

695
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:07.054
Hold up! This dude Emerson wants to
come down off his mountain-maniac ass

696
00:43:07.088 --> 00:43:09.524
and eat our asses
and fuck our skulls. guess what?

697
00:43:09.558 --> 00:43:13.194
It's not going to happen tonight
because pam. pam. I'm up in this tit.

698
00:43:13.227 --> 00:43:15.896
Yeah. Where my gun goes.
I goes.

699
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:20.167
Same. and I am sleeping
with my wife

700
00:43:20.201 --> 00:43:25.906
unless someone prefers that my
gun stays in someone else's room.

701
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.110
Cecily. do you want
protection or...?

702
00:43:29.143 --> 00:43:30.644
- I'm good.
- Thank you.

703
00:43:30.678 --> 00:43:35.249
Uh. one more time.
raise your hand if you have a gun.

704
00:43:35.282 --> 00:43:37.852
It's tiny.
It's a purse gun.

705
00:43:37.885 --> 00:43:39.653
And if you don't have a gun.
no gun?

706
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:41.856
Marcus got my gun.

707
00:43:43.624 --> 00:43:46.260
Welp. we're having a good.
old-fashioned sleepover.

708
00:43:48.929 --> 00:43:50.664
- With guns. though.
- With guns. yes.

709
00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:58.105
Dr. Ellis. we just thought we'd clue
you in on the game plan for tonight.

710
00:44:05.112 --> 00:44:06.147
Professor?

711
00:44:07.882 --> 00:44:10.519
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

712
00:44:10.552 --> 00:44:15.789
I just need more time to work.

713
00:44:22.129 --> 00:44:23.164
Okay.

714
00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:26.934
All right. everyone.
let's lock up.

715
00:45:37.137 --> 00:45:39.674
Pete!

716
00:45:43.612 --> 00:45:47.181
Get off of me!

717
00:45:48.816 --> 00:45:51.118
What the fuck is going...?

718
00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.826
- Peter! Peter!
- We need more lights.

719
00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:01.428
- Oh. my God!
- Can someone please look for my hand?

720
00:46:01.462 --> 00:46:02.997
Hell. yeah.
I got you. bro.

721
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.166
You shot my husband.

722
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.402
- His hand has been bitten off!
- Oh. my God!

723
00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:10.672
For God's sakes.
this is an animal attack.

724
00:46:10.705 --> 00:46:13.742
Uh. no. I think he was shot.
too.

725
00:46:17.044 --> 00:46:19.880
Oh. wow.
would you look at that?

726
00:46:19.913 --> 00:46:22.416
- Okay. Peter.
- He's just in shock.

727
00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:24.318
I stopped the bleeding.
He should be okay.

728
00:46:25.953 --> 00:46:27.722
We would have heard him
come in.

729
00:46:27.756 --> 00:46:29.323
How many times
did you fire your piece?

730
00:46:29.356 --> 00:46:30.924
How many times
do you ask stupid questions?

731
00:46:30.958 --> 00:46:32.893
Guys. it was obviously
an accident.

732
00:46:32.926 --> 00:46:36.631
Accident or not.
we're obviously not safe. We need help.

733
00:46:38.232 --> 00:46:40.669
Is he here?

734
00:46:47.742 --> 00:46:50.044
He didn't just
disappear.

735
00:47:00.755 --> 00:47:01.790
Dr. Ellis?

736
00:47:04.958 --> 00:47:07.061
Dr. Ellis. are you okay?

737
00:47:09.496 --> 00:47:11.533
Gwen. what was it?
Did you see it?

738
00:47:12.933 --> 00:47:15.537
Didn't get a good look.
He was fast.

739
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.839
We need to get him
to a hospital.

740
00:47:50.871 --> 00:47:53.273
We can't go anywhere
until the storm blows over.

741
00:47:53.307 --> 00:47:55.710
- Marcus. don't touch that. please.
- I didn't. I wasn't.

742
00:47:55.744 --> 00:47:58.112
I feel like I'm in one of those
dinner theater murder things

743
00:47:58.145 --> 00:48:00.914
and I'm having a horrible time.
and I can't go home.

744
00:48:02.584 --> 00:48:05.052
- I don't get it.
- All right. babe. it's a nightmare.

745
00:48:05.085 --> 00:48:06.554
What could have gotten
in here?

746
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:09.990
And how did it get in here?

747
00:48:11.826 --> 00:48:13.060
How did it get out?

748
00:48:14.662 --> 00:48:15.697
Who says it got out?

749
00:48:19.066 --> 00:48:20.100
Okay.

750
00:48:32.913 --> 00:48:33.947
It's not possible.

751
00:48:48.962 --> 00:48:52.332
It's not possible. It's not possible.
It's not possible.

752
00:48:58.405 --> 00:49:02.042
<i>Did you find
the answers now? That was fast.</i>

753
00:49:02.075 --> 00:49:05.412
- <i>No! No!</i>
- <i>It's not human.</i>

754
00:49:05.446 --> 00:49:07.782
<i>It's canine. but there were
no matches in the database.</i>

755
00:49:07.816 --> 00:49:09.116
<i>Does that mean he killed Dave?</i>

756
00:49:09.149 --> 00:49:12.019
<i>Does that mean
he killed my husband?</i>

757
00:49:12.052 --> 00:49:15.489
<i>I have excellent
samples. keeping the root alive.</i>

758
00:49:17.792 --> 00:49:19.993
<i>I'm going to get answers
for you.</i>

759
00:49:29.671 --> 00:49:30.705
Dr. Ellis?

760
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.742
I told you.
she's probably tanked.

761
00:49:38.445 --> 00:49:42.483
Touch this door again.
I'll shoot. again.

762
00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:43.551
Dr. Ellis?

763
00:49:45.352 --> 00:49:46.888
Please.

764
00:49:46.921 --> 00:49:49.924
- Look. we need answers.
- It didn't disappear.

765
00:49:50.758 --> 00:49:51.960
What did she say?

766
00:49:54.696 --> 00:49:57.866
- What?
- It's not Emerson Flint.

767
00:49:58.833 --> 00:50:00.100
It's one of you.

768
00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:02.302
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

769
00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:06.808
Okay. well. we don't understand.
Can you just please come out?

770
00:50:06.841 --> 00:50:09.009
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Ranger Wheeler.

771
00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:11.078
You could be one of them.

772
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:12.881
- What is she...?
- Shh. shh. shh.

773
00:50:12.914 --> 00:50:13.948
One of what?

774
00:50:19.253 --> 00:50:20.855
A lycanthrope.

775
00:50:22.389 --> 00:50:25.693
- A what?
- A werewolf.

776
00:50:25.727 --> 00:50:28.796
What? What is this. dumbass island?
She's drunk.

777
00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.599
- She's a dumbass island. baby. you're fucking....
- Shh!

778
00:50:31.633 --> 00:50:36.203
- This room got a back door?
- Oh. yeah. Yeah.

779
00:50:36.236 --> 00:50:39.507
Listen. hey. Dr. Ellis?
I know you're freaked out.

780
00:50:39.541 --> 00:50:41.876
Now I'm freaked out.

781
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.679
- I think we're all freaked out. yeah?
- Yeah. We're freaked out.

782
00:50:44.712 --> 00:50:46.179
But tell you what.
if you come out.

783
00:50:46.213 --> 00:50:49.817
- we can all discuss this together as a group.
- Hey.

784
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.154
- Parker. no. Stay back.
- Doc?

785
00:50:54.187 --> 00:50:56.958
Put the gun down. No!

786
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.531
Dr. Ellis. are you okay?

787
00:51:15.977 --> 00:51:17.812
- She killed herself.
- Oh. my God.

788
00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:20.347
What? Wait. Oh. what?
She killed herself?

789
00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.718
She was less afraid of death
than whatever happened to Dave.

790
00:51:39.499 --> 00:51:42.369
All right. We searched again.
doors. windows. everything's locked.

791
00:51:42.402 --> 00:51:45.238
Nobody in here but us.
for better or worse. y'all.

792
00:51:45.272 --> 00:51:47.107
And remember.
nobody's calling the cops.

793
00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:50.410
Everyone shut your stupid
whore mouths and listen to this.

794
00:51:50.444 --> 00:51:54.114
"Complete set of humanoid DNA
overlaps with a complete set

795
00:51:54.147 --> 00:51:57.317
of canine DNA." Blah. blah.
blah. boring. boring. boring.

796
00:51:57.351 --> 00:52:00.655
Oh. "Not sure if this is another
species or evolution."

797
00:52:03.625 --> 00:52:07.061
Well. it's not one
of those things.

798
00:52:07.095 --> 00:52:12.199
Hey. though. real? My dead dad did tell
me an old folklore about the settlers

799
00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:14.535
that used to run the werewolves
out of the woods.

800
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:17.471
Okay. Why are we even talking
about werewolves?

801
00:52:17.505 --> 00:52:20.575
- Why not? Every culture's got a werewolf story.
- Werewolves?

802
00:52:20.608 --> 00:52:24.045
That's true. The Vikings had the
<i>ulfhednar.</i> the Turkey has Kurd Adan.

803
00:52:24.078 --> 00:52:27.515
Okay. Big daddy Sam Parker
dropping that werewolf knowledge.

804
00:52:27.548 --> 00:52:30.283
When I was a kid.
my daddy used to kick my ass.

805
00:52:33.087 --> 00:52:34.656
Okay.

806
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:36.256
He also used to tell me
about the Wendigo.

807
00:52:36.289 --> 00:52:38.726
He said he was coming to get me if
I was acting like a little shit.

808
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.598
- What's a Wendigo?
- It's a man-beast. stalks the woods.

809
00:52:43.631 --> 00:52:48.368
hungers for human flesh.
but is never full.

810
00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:51.338
That's funny. That sounds like
a euphemism for white men.

811
00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:53.173
You're funny. honey.

812
00:52:53.206 --> 00:52:56.611
Thanks. baby. You know.
growing up in Argentina.

813
00:52:56.644 --> 00:52:59.914
it wasn't uncommon for the
seventh-born child to be killed

814
00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:01.949
because that one's
a werewolf.

815
00:53:01.983 --> 00:53:06.054
But you don't do that anymore.
right. because that's crazy?

816
00:53:06.087 --> 00:53:09.123
I think I know what this is.

817
00:53:09.157 --> 00:53:13.528
Somebody's trying to scare us.
so cut the werewolf crap.

818
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:17.131
One of you in this house is
a bully and a murderer.

819
00:53:17.165 --> 00:53:22.937
Somebody is trying to take money from
honest. God-fearing. hardworking people.

820
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:27.775
One of you would rather terrorize us than
let Mr. Parker build his harmless pipeline.

821
00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:30.812
- Oh. Jesus.
- One of you killed my dog.

822
00:53:30.845 --> 00:53:35.183
One of you ate
my husband's hand. and for what?

823
00:53:35.215 --> 00:53:37.217
To save some chipmunks?

824
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:41.388
- Trish. they tried to frack up here. and they log.
- Oh. Janine. shove it.

825
00:53:41.421 --> 00:53:43.791
- It's no different than fracking.
- You need to listen to her.

826
00:53:43.825 --> 00:53:45.292
You don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

827
00:53:45.325 --> 00:53:46.861
You can't just buy people.
Mr. Parker.

828
00:53:46.894 --> 00:53:49.630
Okay. we can't say that. okay. baby?
We have money. honey. Okay?

829
00:53:49.664 --> 00:53:51.933
Who are we to tell these
people they can't take a check?

830
00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:56.704
That's exactly right. Somebody's
terrorizing us to steal our damn money.

831
00:53:56.738 --> 00:53:59.941
Hey. we're talking low-impact
construction here. people.

832
00:53:59.974 --> 00:54:04.277
I don't let people fuck with my money.
That's what I don't do.

833
00:54:04.311 --> 00:54:05.345
Y'all suck!

834
00:54:08.415 --> 00:54:10.585
Are we really in a Mexican
standoff. right now?

835
00:54:10.618 --> 00:54:13.487
Baby. don't say Mexican.
just standoff.

836
00:54:14.889 --> 00:54:15.923
Who's the bully?

837
00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:19.761
Okay. Hey. everyone.
Everyone. please.

838
00:54:19.794 --> 00:54:22.496
- We've got a suicide on our hands.
- You got little hands. bitch.

839
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.866
- And my husband is dead.
- I don't have little hands.

840
00:54:24.899 --> 00:54:26.934
- Stop saying hands.
- Pete's missing a hand.

841
00:54:26.968 --> 00:54:29.469
- I'm missing a hand?
- And my husband is dead.

842
00:54:29.504 --> 00:54:34.374
- And also Chachi.
- Hey. look. I know tensions are high. clearly.

843
00:54:34.407 --> 00:54:38.980
but can we all agree to lock our guns
away until we can figure this out?

844
00:54:39.013 --> 00:54:40.581
Even you. Ranger?

845
00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:46.486
Yeah. Yes. Even me.

846
00:54:46.521 --> 00:54:48.689
Even though that defies all
protocol. sure. you know.

847
00:54:48.723 --> 00:54:53.493
when... when werewolves are
within the house.

848
00:54:53.528 --> 00:54:56.864
You got a point.
I mean. Dr. Ellis is right.

849
00:54:56.898 --> 00:54:58.933
Any one of us could be
a suspect.

850
00:55:06.373 --> 00:55:10.410
I say we put our heads together
and smoke the fucker out.

851
00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:13.614
You're smart.
You're so smart.

852
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:43.311
Shit. y'all. Hey.
Trish has the most motive here. I think.

853
00:55:43.343 --> 00:55:46.379
Cuz... Yeah. You hated Pete ever
since my girl Gwen fucked him.

854
00:55:46.413 --> 00:55:48.182
I'm missing a hand.

855
00:55:48.216 --> 00:55:52.452
First of all. that was four years ago.
Also. it never happened.

856
00:55:52.485 --> 00:55:54.387
This conversation is foul.

857
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:58.192
- Why would I even bite off Pete's hand? That's...
- Payback.

858
00:55:58.226 --> 00:56:00.862
- Well. what...?
- And you. you said you were going to cut off his head.

859
00:56:00.895 --> 00:56:03.030
- You actually said it.
- Why don't you just admit it?

860
00:56:03.064 --> 00:56:05.833
- What? You're a creep.
- Your husband's a creep.

861
00:56:05.867 --> 00:56:07.335
- You're the creep.
- Fine.

862
00:56:21.649 --> 00:56:24.085
No. I'm not a creep.

863
00:56:26.554 --> 00:56:28.122
I'm a werewolf.

864
00:56:36.564 --> 00:56:38.332
Maybe you're a werewolf.

865
00:56:39.466 --> 00:56:41.035
You're a werewolf.
you're a werewolf.

866
00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:43.871
you're a werewolf.
maybe we're all werewolves!

867
00:56:45.506 --> 00:56:50.011
- Maybe I ate my own hand!
- Ow!

868
00:56:50.044 --> 00:56:52.513
You didn't eat your
own hand. hon.

869
00:56:52.546 --> 00:56:54.615
Uh. okay.

870
00:56:54.649 --> 00:56:57.885
Yeah. look. maybe we're just
a little on edge.

871
00:56:57.919 --> 00:57:00.021
Frankly. I'm a bit on edge
about Mrs. Sherwood.

872
00:57:00.054 --> 00:57:03.456
- Yes.
- Oh. my goodness. It's Sherman.

873
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.327
Yeah. Well.
Mr. Sher <i>man</i> was in favor of the pipeline

874
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.696
coming through this stinky
old inn now. wasn't he?

875
00:57:08.729 --> 00:57:10.231
- That's right.
- It's not stinky.

876
00:57:10.264 --> 00:57:14.402
Your husband wanted to sell.
and your story about him is suspect.

877
00:57:14.434 --> 00:57:16.637
That's right.
That's right. That's right.

878
00:57:16.671 --> 00:57:18.372
Don't go easy on her.
Mr. Parker.

879
00:57:18.406 --> 00:57:22.643
because. you know. you forget that
we found her dang husband's body

880
00:57:22.677 --> 00:57:24.477
- underneath her own dang house.
- Right.

881
00:57:24.512 --> 00:57:27.515
- If I could just say one thing...
- You know. I'm sitting here and quite honestly.

882
00:57:27.548 --> 00:57:30.651
- I'm just gobsmacked.
- Oh. you're gobsmacked?

883
00:57:30.685 --> 00:57:34.622
By of the accusations that
are flying around this room!

884
00:57:34.655 --> 00:57:37.758
You know. I didn't kill
my damn husband.

885
00:57:37.792 --> 00:57:40.561
I'm not a damn "lycantrope."
whatever.

886
00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:44.398
- Lycanthrope.
- Well. whatever. I am not one of those.

887
00:57:44.432 --> 00:57:48.035
I'm not a cockamamie wolf.

888
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:51.806
I didn't kill my husband.

889
00:57:53.074 --> 00:57:56.043
Dave said he left me because...

890
00:57:56.077 --> 00:58:02.482
I let myself go.

891
00:58:02.516 --> 00:58:04.885
That's crazy.
You look so. so good.

892
00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:07.288
- You have clothes.
- I'm so sorry.

893
00:58:11.993 --> 00:58:15.495
- It's a bit of a reach.
- Is that why you ate him?

894
00:58:17.465 --> 00:58:23.070
- Uh. if I could just say one...
- What about you. Mr. Parker? Aren't we suspicious of him?

895
00:58:23.104 --> 00:58:26.707
And how do we know
you didn't kill Dr. Ellis?

896
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:29.577
Why am I the only one
bringing that up?

897
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.546
Am I the only one that finds
that suspicious?

898
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.949
The gun was in her hand.
hon.

899
00:58:34.982 --> 00:58:39.320
You gave her your flask.
She didn't want your damn booze.

900
00:58:39.353 --> 00:58:42.023
This man.
he is a newcomer.

901
00:58:42.056 --> 00:58:44.558
He wants our land.

902
00:58:44.592 --> 00:58:47.294
He's trying to buy us out
with all his money.

903
00:58:47.328 --> 00:58:49.163
What's wrong with that?

904
00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:52.533
- Let me just say one thing...
- What about Ranger Wheeler here. and Cecily?

905
00:58:52.566 --> 00:58:54.402
- I mean. they're newcomers.
- Oh. whatever.

906
00:58:54.435 --> 00:58:57.238
We're innocent AF.
and you know it!

907
00:58:57.271 --> 00:59:01.475
We blindly walked into this
weird-ass horror show of a town.

908
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:04.145
Yes. sticking your
nose in these people's business

909
00:59:04.178 --> 00:59:06.614
with your money
and your fancy booze.

910
00:59:06.647 --> 00:59:10.985
- All right. I'll say it again. lady!
- You are a dangerous man.

911
00:59:21.095 --> 00:59:24.231
That was Royal Crown Derby.

912
00:59:24.265 --> 00:59:30.438
Look. I know it's easy to get caught
up in the fear of a fear situation.

913
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:34.575
but can we all just take
a breath and remember

914
00:59:34.608 --> 00:59:36.610
what we wanted out of this
community when we moved here?

915
00:59:38.712 --> 00:59:42.583
- Yeah. like... Like you. Trish.
- What?

916
00:59:42.616 --> 00:59:45.719
- I mean. we know that you're devastated by Chachi.
- Yeah. I am.

917
00:59:45.753 --> 00:59:49.558
- It really sucks.
- But you made us all those...

918
00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:51.625
- Soap bottle angels.
- Yeah. those.

919
00:59:51.659 --> 00:59:53.794
I mean. I don't know
about anybody else.

920
00:59:53.828 --> 00:59:55.296
but that made
me feel amazing.

921
00:59:55.329 --> 00:59:57.898
- I still keep mine on the mantel.
- Yeah. to my dismay.

922
00:59:57.932 --> 01:00:02.636
And Devon. look. I know you feel that
everything bad came in with Parker.

923
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:06.640
but. you know. some of your
neighbors aren't tech millionaires.

924
01:00:06.674 --> 01:00:08.609
You know. a little extra money
would mean a lot of them.

925
01:00:08.642 --> 01:00:10.144
Well. we're not actually
millionaires.

926
01:00:10.177 --> 01:00:12.113
- Well...
- Are we?

927
01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:14.882
- Maybe. Yeah. we're rich.
- Oh.

928
01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:20.387
And Janine. you've been so generous
in spite of all your grief.

929
01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:26.760
I know it's easy to point the
finger and fear each other.

930
01:00:27.962 --> 01:00:30.664
At its heart.
this is a community.

931
01:00:30.698 --> 01:00:33.868
you know. one that agrees
about more than it doesn't.

932
01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:36.837
You know. hard work.

933
01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:39.840
Be a good neighbor.

934
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.776
Warm place to meet.
have a sandwich.

935
01:00:45.146 --> 01:00:47.281
Love.

936
01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:51.620
All I'm asking is that
we remember our common...

937
01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:55.956
our common humanity.

938
01:00:55.990 --> 01:01:01.162
And we just hold off on being enemies
till we've all had a little sleep.

939
01:01:08.936 --> 01:01:10.971
Fuck that noise.

940
01:01:11.005 --> 01:01:13.307
I saw what happened to Pete
and I saw what happened to Dave

941
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.910
and I'm not gonna stick around and
let that happen to me and Marcus.

942
01:01:15.943 --> 01:01:18.345
- Let's go. Marcus.
- Hell yeah.

943
01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:20.848
It's safer out there
than it is in this hellhole.

944
01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:25.587
Fuck your house.

945
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.322
So I hope y'all dildos
get eaten by a wolf.

946
01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:33.127
Okay. Well. this is where I also go my own way.

947
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.095
I had just about enough
of this town. huh?

948
01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:45.739
Once again. fear and intolerance
has reared its ugly head.

949
01:01:45.773 --> 01:01:48.042
We are going to wait this out
at home

950
01:01:48.075 --> 01:01:50.010
or at least until the cops
get here.

951
01:01:50.044 --> 01:01:52.614
Say goodbye to your
stupid craft store. Trish.

952
01:01:52.647 --> 01:01:57.552
Oh. okay. Petey boy. let's get you
home. hon. Come on. come on.

953
01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:02.056
They're gonna get theirs. hon.
They'll get theirs.

954
01:02:05.459 --> 01:02:08.495
They'll get what's
coming.

955
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.431
- They'll get what they deserve.
- Ow!

956
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:24.478
Hey.

957
01:02:24.512 --> 01:02:26.180
How are you going to
protect yourself?

958
01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:29.116
Oh. uh. got my trusty
bear spray.

959
01:02:29.149 --> 01:02:31.785
- Okay. good.
- Yeah. All right.

960
01:03:50.964 --> 01:03:53.867
Oh!

961
01:03:53.901 --> 01:03:55.369
There's something
in Parker's room.

962
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.710
I'm sorry! Oh. God. What now?

963
01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:07.181
Janine. just. uh.
go to your room. lock your door.

964
01:04:07.214 --> 01:04:08.849
Don't come up for anybody. okay?

965
01:04:11.619 --> 01:04:12.687
Okay.

966
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.760
- I thought he left.
- Me. too.

967
01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:35.777
Looks like Parker left
that window open.

968
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:04.706
Hey. Finn.

969
01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.574
Yeah?

970
01:05:11.513 --> 01:05:15.482
Did you say you were
at Grout Pond and Townshend?

971
01:05:16.684 --> 01:05:17.719
Yeah.

972
01:05:24.692 --> 01:05:25.727
Why?

973
01:05:34.803 --> 01:05:37.705
Are you seriously giving
me the silent treatment right now?

974
01:05:37.739 --> 01:05:40.809
You seriously wanna go back to that
chicken shit madhouse with those people?

975
01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:42.677
Oh well. I'm sorry.
babe. but sue me. okay?

976
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.478
You know what they say.
safety in numbers.

977
01:05:44.512 --> 01:05:45.847
Yeah. more like not safety
in numbers.

978
01:05:47.816 --> 01:05:50.184
- What was that?
- It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

979
01:05:50.217 --> 01:05:52.520
Watch your step.

980
01:05:52.554 --> 01:05:55.189
- Who's there? Who's there?
- Who is that?

981
01:05:55.222 --> 01:05:57.224
Let's go.

982
01:05:59.326 --> 01:06:00.728
Hey. Cec.

983
01:06:02.996 --> 01:06:04.198
What's that smell like?

984
01:06:21.381 --> 01:06:22.416
Diesel.

985
01:06:24.117 --> 01:06:25.653
- The generators.
- The generators.

986
01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:28.088
This isn't funny!

987
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:32.359
- Hey. stop fucking with us.
- I'll fuck you up so hard.

988
01:06:33.828 --> 01:06:35.763
- Baby. let's go. Let's go.
- Shh.

989
01:06:44.204 --> 01:06:45.573
Wait a minute.

990
01:06:48.475 --> 01:06:49.944
What the heck is this about?

991
01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.884
- Oh. my God.
- What?

992
01:06:55.917 --> 01:07:00.454
<i>Townshend.
Grout Pond. Beaverfield.</i>

993
01:07:00.487 --> 01:07:03.290
- Joaquim!
- Parker's tracking the attacks.

994
01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:06.059
Oh. shit.

995
01:07:08.428 --> 01:07:10.097
I'm going to go check
the barricade.

996
01:07:15.737 --> 01:07:16.871
What was that?

997
01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.142
You?

998
01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:26.146
I know. hon.

999
01:07:26.179 --> 01:07:28.950
Trish. What the fuck?

1000
01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.421
Maple tap.

1001
01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:37.559
It's where the sweet stuff
comes out.

1002
01:07:38.425 --> 01:07:39.493
What?

1003
01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:44.866
I want my craft store.

1004
01:08:34.616 --> 01:08:35.650
Hey!

1005
01:08:48.062 --> 01:08:50.064
You're probably
a bit confused.

1006
01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:56.004
And why is this gas guy wearing
a bunch of fancy hunting gear?

1007
01:08:57.204 --> 01:09:00.942
I always hunted as a hobby.

1008
01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:07.615
but when Ellis said one of you could
be a lycanthrope. a werewolf...

1009
01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:12.053
Well. news of this predator around the
state suddenly made a whole lot of sense.

1010
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:19.060
- Are you okay? Yeah.
- Yeah. Are you?

1011
01:09:19.093 --> 01:09:20.394
Hi.

1012
01:09:20.427 --> 01:09:22.797
Why is that Parker dressed
like a scary cowboy?

1013
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.066
- I think I just pissed my pants.
- Sorry.

1014
01:09:25.099 --> 01:09:27.802
We were being chased. and then we got
separated from each other. but then...

1015
01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:30.905
Wait. are you guys...
Why are you guys hiding?

1016
01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:32.707
Parker thinks
he's hunting werewolves.

1017
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.241
He sabotaged the generator.

1018
01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:37.879
- Where's Devon?
- I don't know.

1019
01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:40.414
We were... We were together.
and then we got separated.

1020
01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:43.417
and then I got lost.
and then something's out there.

1021
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:44.886
Something's out there.
I think.

1022
01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.589
- I think he got him.
- Where was this?

1023
01:09:48.623 --> 01:09:50.625
It was by Trish's house.

1024
01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:04.138
If I know Devon. he probably
came here for safety.

1025
01:10:04.172 --> 01:10:07.508
so he's probably in here.
right?

1026
01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:09.077
- Devon?
- Ssh! What are you doing?

1027
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.679
Oh. yeah. you're right. you're right.
I'm sorry. I won't do that.

1028
01:10:11.713 --> 01:10:13.881
- Devon. baby!
- Ssh!

1029
01:10:13.915 --> 01:10:16.383
- Joaquim. stop!
- Devon! Baby. is that you?

1030
01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:17.618
- Hey. wait.
- Baby.

1031
01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.822
Boy. you just had
to be strong.

1032
01:10:21.789 --> 01:10:22.824
Now you're dead.

1033
01:10:23.791 --> 01:10:25.258
But...

1034
01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:26.326
Marcus?

1035
01:10:28.529 --> 01:10:31.733
Marcus. what the hell
are you doing?

1036
01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:33.935
What are you doing?
What am I doing?

1037
01:10:33.968 --> 01:10:36.403
That's easy. Ranger.
what am I doing?

1038
01:10:36.436 --> 01:10:40.141
I taped... I taped knives to my
hands. and then underneath.

1039
01:10:40.174 --> 01:10:43.144
it's just my hand.
but it's deadly with the knives on it.

1040
01:10:43.177 --> 01:10:44.812
And I'm going to steal
everybody's shit

1041
01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:46.981
and then I'm going to make it
look like a werewolf did it.

1042
01:10:47.014 --> 01:10:49.117
Well. if you end up being the werewolf.
that's a big fucking disappointment.

1043
01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:52.987
- Right?
- Okay. Marcus. I see you have some knives.

1044
01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.689
Back off!

1045
01:10:54.722 --> 01:10:57.592
- That's my work shirt.
- Stay back! Stay back!

1046
01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.894
Maybe I'm the werewolf.
maybe you became the werewolf.

1047
01:10:59.927 --> 01:11:03.164
Weren't you a werewolf part-time.
motherfucker? Weren't you a werewolf?

1048
01:11:03.197 --> 01:11:05.099
I'm the full-time werewolf.
bitch.

1049
01:11:05.133 --> 01:11:09.302
- Is there even a werewolf?
- I don't know. I don't have to answer your questions. bitch.

1050
01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:16.043
You little
bitches can't catch a cold.

1051
01:11:16.077 --> 01:11:18.846
I said. don't see you.
don't want to be you. now. little punk.

1052
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.782
You guys probably are
so dead right now

1053
01:11:20.815 --> 01:11:26.788
'cause I'm your only friend. really. if you
think about it. Don't get eaten.

1054
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:30.490
Marcus. let's go. brainless!

1055
01:11:31.358 --> 01:11:33.694
Got you. homewrecker.

1056
01:11:36.429 --> 01:11:39.867
- Yeah. this town's bat shit.
- Let's go inside. out the back. let's go out the back. please.

1057
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:42.170
She still has
her tiny BB gun! Fucking bitch.

1058
01:11:42.203 --> 01:11:44.071
That's very rude.
My house. you're trespassing.

1059
01:11:44.105 --> 01:11:48.109
Trespassers will be shot on
command. they will be shot on sight.

1060
01:11:49.544 --> 01:11:52.146
No. Oh. I know another way in.

1061
01:11:57.885 --> 01:11:59.754
- Nobody move.
- What is she. Michael Myers?

1062
01:11:59.787 --> 01:12:02.389
What? Wipe your feet.

1063
01:12:02.422 --> 01:12:04.659
See. clean. Wiped.

1064
01:12:04.692 --> 01:12:07.195
Super. they're so clean. right?

1065
01:12:07.228 --> 01:12:09.997
Listen. back up!
Just keep moving back.

1066
01:12:10.031 --> 01:12:12.700
- Come on. Watch where you're going.
- Hey.

1067
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:15.102
Happy family. line up.
line up.

1068
01:12:15.136 --> 01:12:19.674
You people do not
belong here.

1069
01:12:19.707 --> 01:12:22.076
You don't belong in this town.

1070
01:12:22.109 --> 01:12:24.612
in this house.
and you sure as Shinola

1071
01:12:24.645 --> 01:12:29.482
don't get to tell me
what to do with my property.

1072
01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:32.452
Trish. did you do
something to my husband?

1073
01:12:32.485 --> 01:12:36.891
- Did you kill Devon?
- Oh. I don't care what you do in your own home.

1074
01:12:36.924 --> 01:12:43.231
Your little husband should have
kept his nose in his own beeswax.

1075
01:12:43.264 --> 01:12:49.670
and you all should've let
Mr. Parker build his pipe... Peter!

1076
01:12:49.704 --> 01:12:50.938
Peter!

1077
01:12:53.473 --> 01:12:56.043
What did you do?
Peter. no.

1078
01:12:56.077 --> 01:12:58.445
- You killed Peter.
- You killed my husband.

1079
01:13:01.082 --> 01:13:03.483
Is she okay?

1080
01:13:03.517 --> 01:13:05.319
She's okay.

1081
01:13:05.353 --> 01:13:06.386
Trish?

1082
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:12.760
Let's leave. please.

1083
01:13:12.793 --> 01:13:14.962
Okay. Ranger. put on your ranger
hat. what are we doing?

1084
01:13:14.996 --> 01:13:16.898
All right. Well.
we're going to take Marcus' truck

1085
01:13:16.931 --> 01:13:21.269
as far as we can. uh. you know. maybe fi...
Ugh! Sorry. Marcus.

1086
01:13:21.302 --> 01:13:24.372
- Sorry. Marcus.
- And find some snowshoes. and get the heck off this mountain.

1087
01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:26.908
- Dude loves snowshoes.
- Well. it's the oldest.

1088
01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:29.476
most effective means of traversing
ice and snow... Oh. God!

1089
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:32.713
- Is that...?
- Parker.

1090
01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:35.283
Why is he you hunting?
Why are you hunting us?

1091
01:13:35.316 --> 01:13:37.218
Ssh! I don't know. You know?

1092
01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:39.987
Cec was the youngest of seven.
you guys are blocking his pipeline.

1093
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:43.925
and I'm the pain in the ass
sent to give him a hard time.

1094
01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:46.027
So he could be hunting
any of us.

1095
01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:50.164
But it's not any of us. 'cause none of
us has seen any actual evidence of a werewolf.

1096
01:13:50.197 --> 01:13:52.133
- Finn.
- No. yeah. good point.

1097
01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:55.102
Ellis was taking all those hair samples with
that machine thing. I mean. science. am I right?

1098
01:13:55.136 --> 01:13:57.805
It's just.
something doesn't add up.

1099
01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:08.282
Joaquim.
what are you doing. man?

1100
01:14:08.316 --> 01:14:10.017
She's a seventh born.

1101
01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:13.421
I mean you said it your goddamn
self. Ranger. didn't you? Okay?

1102
01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:15.323
We're not crazy. Okay.
We're not crazy.

1103
01:14:15.356 --> 01:14:17.091
- Kinda...!
- No. we're not. okay?!

1104
01:14:17.124 --> 01:14:19.492
You're the fucking werewolf!
Okay? She's the werewolf. okay?

1105
01:14:19.527 --> 01:14:22.830
- So we have to...
- Please put the gun down. okay?

1106
01:14:22.863 --> 01:14:25.433
I can't. okay?! I can't!

1107
01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:29.704
- Because I live in Argentina. the seventh born is a werewolf!
- It's just superstition!

1108
01:14:29.737 --> 01:14:34.075
Shut the fuck up. girl. I love
you so much. I have to kill your ass.

1109
01:14:34.108 --> 01:14:39.613
I know it's been a long.
long day.

1110
01:14:39.647 --> 01:14:41.415
I know. right?

1111
01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:43.918
Maybe just put the gun down
because...

1112
01:14:55.162 --> 01:14:56.464
Ow.

1113
01:14:58.332 --> 01:15:01.435
Finn. what do we do?!
What do we do now?!

1114
01:15:01.469 --> 01:15:03.070
Okay.

1115
01:15:03.104 --> 01:15:05.039
Start the truck.

1116
01:15:11.412 --> 01:15:13.848
- Finn. it won't start!
- Try again!

1117
01:15:13.881 --> 01:15:15.616
I'm fucking trying!

1118
01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:22.123
Let's go. darling.

1119
01:15:22.156 --> 01:15:25.426
Fight me. come on.

1120
01:15:27.728 --> 01:15:32.500
Family of four.
mauled to death in Townshend.

1121
01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:35.202
Couple of college kids
mangled in Grout Pond.

1122
01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:38.873
all around the same time
that you were there.

1123
01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:42.143
Then you came to Beaverfield.

1124
01:15:43.944 --> 01:15:48.416
Yeah. you put yourself in
charge. you discovered Dave.

1125
01:15:48.449 --> 01:15:52.053
now that's a... that's a bit
obvious. don't you think there. Ranger?

1126
01:15:53.654 --> 01:15:55.890
Finn. what's he talking about?

1127
01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.662
Come on. Cec.

1128
01:16:01.695 --> 01:16:06.367
- He sabotaged the generator.
- No. that was you. Ranger.

1129
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.637
See. I found a diesel-drenched
knife in your room.

1130
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:13.441
I... We found that in your room.
it's not possible.

1131
01:16:13.474 --> 01:16:14.842
I don't know what to believe.

1132
01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:17.144
You pitted this community
against itself

1133
01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:20.848
with your promises.
your money.

1134
01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:22.450
You brought out the worst
of these people.

1135
01:16:23.717 --> 01:16:25.554
There's no animal
on a killing spree.

1136
01:16:26.821 --> 01:16:28.322
There's no monster.

1137
01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:30.891
The only monster here is you.

1138
01:16:31.659 --> 01:16:32.927
Maybe you're right.

1139
01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:36.263
Well. better safe than sorry.

1140
01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:38.499
No!

1141
01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:44.939
- Finn! Finn. look out.
- Cecily. are you okay?

1142
01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:53.047
Finn!

1143
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.282
Eat some silver!

1144
01:16:56.884 --> 01:17:01.155
Yes! Yes! Finn!
Get up!

1145
01:17:02.723 --> 01:17:04.425
Finn!

1146
01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:07.061
Excuse me. Mr. Parker.

1147
01:17:10.397 --> 01:17:12.166
Your pipeline is trash.

1148
01:17:15.069 --> 01:17:17.304
Fuck.

1149
01:17:40.261 --> 01:17:42.730
That was really fucked up.

1150
01:17:42.763 --> 01:17:45.900
Yeah. Yeah. it was.

1151
01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:55.176
Hmm. Power is back.

1152
01:17:55.209 --> 01:17:59.146
Ooh. that's not good.

1153
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.717
Oh. my God. Finn. Okay. come on. we got
to get you inside. let's go. let's go.

1154
01:18:03.751 --> 01:18:07.121
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh.

1155
01:18:07.154 --> 01:18:10.791
Oh. this is much worse
than I thought.

1156
01:18:10.824 --> 01:18:12.426
Yeah. it's pretty bad.
You know what?

1157
01:18:12.459 --> 01:18:14.361
- I'm gonna go get the first aid kit. okay?
- Okay. I'm dying. I think.

1158
01:18:14.395 --> 01:18:16.665
No. you're not going to die.
You're not going to die.

1159
01:18:16.697 --> 01:18:18.533
Hey. can you promise me
that you're not going to die?

1160
01:18:18.567 --> 01:18:21.570
'Cause it would probably traumatize
me for the rest of my life.

1161
01:18:21.603 --> 01:18:26.508
And also. 'cause I. um...
I really like you.

1162
01:18:26.541 --> 01:18:31.845
and I. um... I'm very grateful
that you saved my life.

1163
01:18:33.582 --> 01:18:36.150
so you're not
going to die. okay? Okay?

1164
01:18:36.183 --> 01:18:39.654
- Okay. Say. "okay." Say. okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1165
01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:46.060
Okay. I'm going to see
if the phones are back up.

1166
01:19:22.863 --> 01:19:25.966
<i>You know. nothing's going
to get down that mountain but a snowplow.</i>

1167
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.270
<i>Just need that
starter fuel injector I ordered.</i>

1168
01:20:56.323 --> 01:20:57.759
It's you. isn't it?

1169
01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:13.808
- Were you even in a punk band?
- Yeah.

1170
01:21:13.842 --> 01:21:16.210
We just didn't actually
break up. though.

1171
01:21:17.545 --> 01:21:21.649
- You ate them.
- I ate them. Yes.

1172
01:21:21.683 --> 01:21:24.819
Oh. come on. Finn. didn't I seem
a little too good to be true?

1173
01:21:25.486 --> 01:21:27.121
No.

1174
01:21:27.154 --> 01:21:29.524
You seemed great.

1175
01:21:29.557 --> 01:21:34.562
Oh. no. Finn. help me. What do we do now?
The car won't start.

1176
01:21:34.596 --> 01:21:39.133
Finn. Sam Parker has me by the hair.
That's great?

1177
01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.101
Don't yell at me.

1178
01:21:41.135 --> 01:21:44.071
That's not yelling.
That's taking a tone.

1179
01:21:44.672 --> 01:21:46.473
This is yelling.

1180
01:21:57.886 --> 01:22:00.855
- You're really a...
- Werewolf.

1181
01:22:01.488 --> 01:22:03.157
Yeah.

1182
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:05.760
Werewolves are real.

1183
01:22:05.794 --> 01:22:09.564
Women who raid <i>Walden</i>
while drinking kombucha.

1184
01:22:09.597 --> 01:22:13.835
and getting turned on by your
Yellowstone stories. they're a fantasy.

1185
01:22:18.405 --> 01:22:21.074
- <i>Hello?</i>
- You killed Dave.

1186
01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:23.745
I needed an outfit.

1187
01:22:23.778 --> 01:22:26.714
There can only be
one postal worker.

1188
01:22:26.748 --> 01:22:28.883
It was really
a districting thing.

1189
01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:30.484
You ate Trish's dog.

1190
01:22:31.151 --> 01:22:33.153
My baby.

1191
01:22:33.187 --> 01:22:36.089
And you ate Pete. his hand.

1192
01:22:36.123 --> 01:22:38.425
<i>I was attacked!</i>

1193
01:22:38.459 --> 01:22:43.130
Some men do this thing
when they want to guide you.

1194
01:22:43.163 --> 01:22:47.635
where they put their hand
on your lower back.

1195
01:22:50.772 --> 01:22:52.005
I hate that.

1196
01:22:52.039 --> 01:22:55.577
- Cecily. the mailman.
- No. thank you.

1197
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:59.881
- Should've bitten off both hands.
- Why couldn't you just hunt?

1198
01:22:59.914 --> 01:23:02.349
Which is a brilliant idea.
you think I didn't try that?

1199
01:23:04.284 --> 01:23:07.589
I did. It was exhausting.
but Beaverfield is perfect.

1200
01:23:07.622 --> 01:23:09.958
There's lots of festering
resentments.

1201
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:12.426
made all the spicier
way by this pipeline drama.

1202
01:23:12.459 --> 01:23:15.730
I don't let people fuck
with my money.

1203
01:23:15.763 --> 01:23:19.333
All I had to do was plant
a tiny little doggy's collar...

1204
01:23:19.366 --> 01:23:21.435
<i>Emerson killed
Chachi.</i>

1205
01:23:21.468 --> 01:23:23.504
...spread a couple of rumors.

1206
01:23:23.538 --> 01:23:26.240
I found a
diesel-drenched knife in your room.

1207
01:23:29.243 --> 01:23:32.981
Everyone else just took care
of themselves with their fear.

1208
01:23:33.013 --> 01:23:38.620
and greed. and their own
petty nature.

1209
01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.656
I mean. I'm going to eat them
later.

1210
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:44.993
and I knew there'd be that
snowstorm but that road blockage.

1211
01:23:45.025 --> 01:23:46.995
mm. baby. just...

1212
01:23:49.263 --> 01:23:53.001
Hmm. You almost blew up my shit.
though. you know that. right?

1213
01:23:53.033 --> 01:23:59.373
I kept trying to turn you into one of
them. but you're pathological.

1214
01:23:59.406 --> 01:24:03.210
And what is my pathology
exactly?

1215
01:24:03.243 --> 01:24:07.982
You're too fucking nice
with your kumbaya speeches

1216
01:24:08.016 --> 01:24:11.351
and your small town. "Gee.
golly goodness." Blow me.

1217
01:24:11.385 --> 01:24:17.692
This town is full of two-faced
assholes and you know it.

1218
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.995
You're a monster.

1219
01:24:21.029 --> 01:24:24.364
Girl's got to eat.
and I got dinner on ice until spring.

1220
01:24:27.167 --> 01:24:30.972
What?

1221
01:24:31.005 --> 01:24:32.272
You mock me for being nice.

1222
01:24:32.306 --> 01:24:39.146
This whole time. you've been
mocking me for being nice.

1223
01:24:39.179 --> 01:24:41.214
but... but you know what?

1224
01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:45.753
I got to tell you. I'm a nice
person. all right? I'm considerate.

1225
01:24:45.787 --> 01:24:50.090
I'm compassionate. I care. People want me to
change. but there's nothing wrong with me.

1226
01:24:50.123 --> 01:24:53.093
I'm a nice person who wants to
do nice things for other people

1227
01:24:53.126 --> 01:24:56.998
and have nice people do things
for other people. You know?

1228
01:24:57.031 --> 01:25:02.269
Sorry. I got to tell you.
it's fucking okay to be nice.

1229
01:25:02.302 --> 01:25:06.273
Pardon my language.
it's effing okay to be nice.

1230
01:25:06.306 --> 01:25:09.611
How's that for... for. you know.
kumbaya bullshit?

1231
01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:18.820
Well. in a dog-eat-dog world.

1232
01:25:20.622 --> 01:25:25.526
you could be nice.
or you could be me.

1233
01:25:29.597 --> 01:25:32.867
Heavens. Oh. fuck.

1234
01:25:37.905 --> 01:25:40.041
Cecily?

1235
01:25:50.785 --> 01:25:52.620
Emerson.
what are you doing here?

1236
01:25:54.088 --> 01:25:59.060
Being a good neighbor.
you know. like Mr. Rogers.

1237
01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:02.362
I just...

1238
01:26:02.396 --> 01:26:03.430
Oh!

1239
01:26:13.306 --> 01:26:14.709
Oh. no!

1240
01:26:29.624 --> 01:26:31.458
Oh!

1241
01:27:06.928 --> 01:27:09.864
Wolves.

1242
01:27:19.707 --> 01:27:21.341
Hey. all right!

1243
01:27:21.374 --> 01:27:22.643
Oh. shit!

1244
01:27:26.614 --> 01:27:28.315
Whoa!

1245
01:27:57.344 --> 01:27:58.378
What?

1246
01:28:02.617 --> 01:28:04.317
What?

1247
01:28:43.423 --> 01:28:44.992
Give me a hand.
will you?

1248
01:28:51.566 --> 01:28:52.767
Thanks.

1249
01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:55.870
You all right?

1250
01:28:56.871 --> 01:28:58.371
You saved my life.

1251
01:28:59.774 --> 01:29:02.210
Yeah. well.

1252
01:29:02.243 --> 01:29:07.882
I like what you said back in
my cabin about. uh. community.

1253
01:29:08.783 --> 01:29:13.120
That was. uh. nice.

1254
01:29:14.856 --> 01:29:16.224
You hungry?

1255
01:29:17.225 --> 01:29:18.259
Starving.

1256
01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.928
You think Jeanine's still alive?

1257
01:29:21.562 --> 01:29:23.331
Maybe.

1258
01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:25.266
She could make us
a sandwich.

1259
01:29:52.226 --> 01:29:54.161
Make your own damn
sandwich.
