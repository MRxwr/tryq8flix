JAY: <i>The Oxford
American Dictionary</i>

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:24.157
<i>defines "dark"
as the absence of light.</i>

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:26.592
<i>gloomy. cheerless.</i>

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:32.198

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.873
Hi.

KAREN: I'm your new lawyer.
Karen Haley.

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:35.628
I don't know
if you've heard of me.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.765
but I've done pretty well
with cold cases.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.733
So let's get to work.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.735
In your own words.
tell me exactly what happened.

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.273
I'll tell you.
but you're not gonna believe me.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.142
Try me.

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:53.213
It's like a bad B horror movie.

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:56.850
That's why my attorney
wouldn't use it in my trial.

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.519
That's okay.
Don't worry about what I think.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.589
Just tell me the events
as clearly as you can.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.892
JAY: <i>We were
on this trip to see</i>

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:09.162

The Mangrove Slasher.

we all watched.</i>

<i>They say it really happened.</i>

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.802

I don't believe in that stuff.</i>

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.740
Who were we?

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.911
It was my five friends
and Veronica's cousin.

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:29.515
- Is Casey Veronica's cousin?
- Yeah.

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.851
And who were your other friends?

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:35.388

Yeah. babe.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:06.586
Jay's sleeping pretty sound
in back right now.

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:08.387
So?

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.190
So I'm feeling pretty warm
and fuzzy. what do you think?

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.358
I'm not gonna climb
on top of you.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.261
I'm not asking you
to climb on top of me.

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:17.296
You can use those talented hands
of yours. come on.

00:03:17.932 --> 00:03:19.782
Okay.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.634
But you have to promise
to be quiet.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.402
TREVOR: Shh.
All right. let's do it.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.271

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:47.426
So. uh. guys. I met this
Egyptian chick the other night.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:49.762
Yeah. we were gonna get it on.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.564

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.832
[Donny laughs]

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.601
So I did her mummy instead.

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:56.436
[laughs]

00:03:56.437 --> 00:03:57.971
- Get it. babe?
- DONNY: Mummy.

00:03:57.972 --> 00:03:59.572

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:00.640
[laughs]

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.475
No.

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:04.776
We all know you're not
gonna make it as a comedian.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:08.548
Why do you always have to say
things like that to me?

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.483
VERONICA: Like what. Scott?

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:12.418
You're always trying
to bring me down.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.886
You know I'm so passionate
about my comedy!

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:19.993
You know. babe.
I would never fuck a comedian.

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:21.794
But a businessman.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:25.564
I would do
dirty. dirty things to him.

Hey...

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:39.344
I think Kate's giving Trevor
a hand job.

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:44.884
No. no. I. I think she's
really giving him a hand job.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.653
TREVOR: Yeah. do that.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:47.687
KATE: He's gonna hear you.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.055
TREVOR:
He's not hearing anything.

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:51.990
Look.
he has a smile on his face.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.717
JAY: Ah. dude!

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.758
DONNY: Wait. I think they're
both getting hand jobs!

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.073
What do you think. Casey?

00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:10.826
No.

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:12.312
Aah! Watch where you throw
your cigarettes.

Burnt the tip of my dick.
you dick.

00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:16.316
Oh. shit. It stings.

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.666
Great Scott!

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.135
That was a DeLorean.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:11.436
Wonder how fast it was going.

00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.815
Hey. do you think the car's
all right parked back there?

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.016
It said tow away zone.

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:26.119
Dude. look around.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.522
There's no one here for miles.
I think we're all right.

did you find out

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:31.924
about this place anyways?

Where's Veronica?

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.099
She stayed in the car.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.701
She's putting on more makeup.

00:06:41.702 --> 00:06:43.970
And she hates nature.

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:46.939
and I quote.
"hates old settler homes."

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.075
Of course.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:51.010
Where's the bathroom? Uh...

Why are you so quiet
back there. Jay?

'Cause his pussy hurts.

JAY: Dude. I heard you. man.

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:02.422
Well. seriously. man.

00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:03.923
You're bringing
the whole group down.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.825
Will you please
lighten up a little bit?

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:08.093
So. what's up with Jay?

00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:11.931
What do you mean?

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:16.068

Uh. no.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.947
But it's funny
that you mention that.

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.948
Dude. seriously?

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.951
How am I supposed to forget
about her in three weeks?

So. what happened?

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.960

Well. we were. at least.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.074
Until our backstabbing friend
Steve

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:58.511
decided to. you know. sleep
with Jay's girlfriend

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.481
and broke up our entire group.
essentially.

TREVOR: That's where her mind's
at. though.

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.486
You gotta realize that.

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:09.788
Are you interested?

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:12.592
Maybe.

Ooh. oh.

It sounded like Donny screaming.
Come on. come on.

Whoa. welcome
to the party. people.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:24.797
Damn city folks. think you can
come terrorize my village?

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:27.967
Actually. a village
is a group of houses

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:30.102
and associated buildings.
larger than a hamlet...

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.647
TRAVIS:
Donny. cut it out. dude.

00:09:31.648 --> 00:09:33.192
...and smaller than a town
in a rural area.

- Are you wisecracking me. boy?
- DONNY: No. no. no. no.

this. man.

Ha!

I knew I had y'all.
I should be on the damn TV.

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:54.092
That wasn't funny.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.826
Yeah. man.
You could have killed someone.

Don't get your panties
all up in a wad.

DONNY: You really had me going.
Can I go back to my friends now?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.741
- Here. have some jerky.
- Oh. thanks.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.176
SCOTT: Big old fake gun trick.

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:13.145
Yeah. real good.
A little too good.

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:14.679
Yeah. you got me.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.917
Well. I'm glad somebody
appreciates a good scare.

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:20.152
What do you besides scare
the shit out of people here?

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:21.253
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:25.657
MAN: I don't know. Not much.
It ain't like it used to be.

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:29.829
<i>Believe it or not.
this place used to be</i>

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.330
<i>the main attraction
off the main road.</i>

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.066
<i>Till they built
that goddamn highway.</i>

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.537
Where you guys heading. anyway?

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:40.873
We're actually headed
to. um. Mangrove County

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:44.010
where. uh.
the infamous Mangrove Slasher

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:47.713
butchered. murdered a bunch
of teenagers very brutally.

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.782
And. uh. but. you know.
we like that kind of stuff.

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.717
So we're just stopping
roadside attractions.

00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:53.686
kind of like the one
you have right here.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.755
So you guys are sick fucks. huh?

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.857
Man. you like that twisted guts
and gore shit. don't you?

00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.825
Yeah! Guts and gore.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.160
Hey. hey. I don't mean
to be rude.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.828
but we're already
behind schedule.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.897
And we gotta get all the way
down to old country road

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.132
to get there.
so if you don't mind...

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.701
Well. a little word of advice.

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:10.235
I'd stick to the highway.

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:14.140
Wait.

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:15.107
Why do you say that?

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:17.175
Hmm. I don't know.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.245
Heard stories about
the old country road. you know.

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.213
People not making it out alive.

00:11:21.214 --> 00:11:22.114
[Jay scoffs]

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:23.882
Yeah. sure. man.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.022
Thanks for not killing me.
And the jerky.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.389
Sure. kid.

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.429
These people
are in for a real show.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.829
TRAVIS: That was crazy.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.439
[bell rings]

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.912
I was hanging pretty tough
till the last hand.

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.314
Thought I was
gonna get screwed again.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:04.250
I was holding a ten.
jack of diamonds.

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:09.221
slot comes up. ace diamonds.
king diamonds. two of clubs.

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:11.990
So here I am with a first draw

Dumbass Ray raises the pot.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.363
I'm thinking he's got an ace.
king. you know.

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:19.998
What the hell is
with this broke ass town?

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.405
So. you going to

TRAVIS: Cut it out. man.
That's not funny.

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:38.250
Oh. that was funny.
Oh. you should have seen you.

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:40.286
You were like. aah!
And I was like...

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:43.289
You just scared the living
daylights outta him. didn't you?

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.957
Yeah. I did.

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:45.825
I did. I scared you.

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:47.393
Yeah. Whatever. yeah.

00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:53.498
Hey. man.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.167
The jokester over there
happened to lose our map.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.436
So. we're kind of lost
right now. and in a pickle.

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:59.905
I don't know. do you have a map
back there we could check out.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:01.073
maybe give us some direction?

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.608
Oh. yeah. Man. I got maps.

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:04.210

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:23.896
DONNY: What?

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.631
That's. like. nothing.

00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:27.265
Yup.

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:33.005

What's in Mangrove County?

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:47.152
Mangrove County?

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:48.553
All right. It's right here.

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:50.889
Wait. wait. wait. There?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.258
DONNY: That's where these kids.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:55.261
they were partying.
like. they were by the beach.

00:14:55.262 --> 00:14:59.398
And this big. scary guy.
he was huge.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.567
And he came...
He came and chased them.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.935
And he had...

00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:05.337
He had two. um. you know. um-

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:06.505
Those two machetes.

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:07.973
Yeah. yeah. Machetes.

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:10.910
And he's chasing them.
and he catches them.

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:13.178
And he starts. cuts them open

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.347
and chops
this one girl's head off.

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:18.550
It was down by the mangroves.
that's where we're going.

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:20.419
Well.
it's getting kind of late out.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.487
Do you have a place to stay?

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:25.591
Well. actually.
we're kind of lost right now.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.993
Well. if you wanted to.
you could stay with me

00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:29.428
at the motel up the road.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.029
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.631
And there's a circus
right across the street.

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:34.166
No way. There's a circus?

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:37.068

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.988
I was getting some W and W's.

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:57.156
And she was all like.

00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.457
"Hey. there's a circus."

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.359
And I was like.
"That's so cool."

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.329
And then. she said there's
a hotel we can all stay at.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.597
And it's right down the road.
and we can hang out with her.

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:06.698
Ooh.

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.201
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

Hi. y'all.

Oh. don't worry. honey.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:33.359
I was talking about you.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.659

00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:36.562
Ugh.

No. thank you.

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:41.233
DONNY: Tell them about
the circus and the motel.

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:42.434
And all...
And all the other stuff.

Oh. yes.

is a motel you all
can stay at for the night.

We'd love to have you.

What do you think. Scott?
You wanna go stay at the motel?

I'm ready to go.

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.067
[dog barks]

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:38.323
So. this one time.
I had this dream

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:40.526
that I just got married

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:43.095
to this beautiful girl.
girl of my dreams.

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:44.363
I mean. I was in a dream.

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:47.433
And so. the night
of my honeymoon.

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:51.203
I wake up. and I'm all tied up.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:53.072
And I'm still... I'm still...

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.740
I'm still in my tux.

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:58.177
And she's wearing her dress.

00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:00.579
Except she's got a big chainsaw.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.081
[laughs]

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:06.251
And she starts saying
how much she loves me.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.319
and then starts cutting me.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.320
No. it's not funny.

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:09.455
It was really scary.

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.623
I can think of scary things.

00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:13.559
[laughs]

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.861
You know. maybe someday
I'll make your dream come true.

00:18:15.862 --> 00:18:17.362
Oh. you're joking.

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:18.764
You're joking with me.

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:19.832
Oh. okay.

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:21.422
Okay.

00:18:21.423 --> 00:18:23.012
I don't feel awkward anymore.

00:18:23.013 --> 00:18:24.603
That was kind of...
That was kind of weird. though.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:25.704
You're silly.

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:27.205
[Candy laughs]

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.707
What are you guys talking about?

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.409
That's a horrible dream.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.611
Do you have to laugh that loud?

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:33.745
Oh. honey.

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.714
Money won't save you
here in the woods.

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:37.815
You're in
a survival situation now.

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.785
JAY: <i>I heard
from another inmate</i>

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.386
<i>that they had gypsy circuses</i>

00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:44.656
<i>all over the south.
with no regard for life.</i>

00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:46.391
<i>They're all sick killers.</i>

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:50.329
You damn gypsies!
This ain't no dog and pony show.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.498
You perform. or you die!

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:55.601
Oh. wait till Mr. Kharver
hears about this.

00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:58.770
Hey. boss. boss. these
performers. they're useless.

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:00.305
They just won't listen.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.840
Let me off one of them
right now.

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:03.842
Come on. boss.
Please. boss. Let me off them.

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:05.677
You goddamn fool.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:08.547
Don't you understand
what we're trying to do here?

00:19:08.548 --> 00:19:10.249
I mean. we are trying
to show the world

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.317
the best goddamn circus
under the big top.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.219
and how the fuck do you think
I can do that

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.188
if you go killing off
all our talent?

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:17.922
You fat. lunkheaded fuck.

SKID: I told you. boss.

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.377
I think he's one
of them retards or something.

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:39.478
[laughs]

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:40.711
Shut the fuck up.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:48.620
Oh. now you can talk. huh?

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:50.438
[laughs]

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.257
You know. I don't even know
what the fuck you're saying.

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:54.793
But I see that you're not
so fucking deaf after all. huh?

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:57.528
I think I'm gonna kill you
anyway. you motherfucker.

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:00.566
Ah...

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.668
[laughs]

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.235

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.714
Did you know that ten percent

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.949
of the human race
is left-handed?

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.600
Hey. hey. Bo...

00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:20.251
Hey. I wasn't done
talking yet. Skid mark.

00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:22.754
You know I hate it
when you call me that. boss.

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:24.923
It's just Skid. sir.

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:28.360
I am so sorry.

00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:29.895

Is that a little better?

00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:36.968
Anyway...

00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.239
I am left-handed.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.608
And that means that I access
the right hemisphere

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:45.611
of my brain.
which means I am creative.

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:47.946
Hey. boss.
Einstein was left-handed.

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:49.330
He's a genius.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.716
There you go.
I'm a motherfucking Einstein.

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:52.584
Yes. you are.

shifty. stupid bastard

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.794
who hasn't had
a brand new thought in his mind

00:21:02.795 --> 00:21:05.329
in a thousand years.

00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:11.737
Now. what he doesn't know
is I am an entrepreneur.

00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:14.339
I've got the best acts.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.709
That's right. boss.
I got you the best in the world.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.710
You didn't get me shit.

00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:21.980
All you did was kidnap
the ones that I wanted.

00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:23.848
and I wanted
the best of the best.

00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:26.752
That's right. boss.

00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:27.918

Ew.

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:48.179
He loves me not.

00:25:49.048 --> 00:25:50.614
He loves me.

00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:23.814
Like you don't have one.

00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:28.320
You know how Scott's always
walking around

00:26:28.321 --> 00:26:29.654
telling those jokes?

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:30.322
Yeah.

00:26:30.323 --> 00:26:31.323
[laughs]

00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:33.307
I got a joke for him.

00:26:33.308 --> 00:26:34.726
I don't know if he'd appreciate
the punchline. though.

00:26:34.727 --> 00:26:36.161
- What?
- His girlfriend.

00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:39.164
- Ho.
- Dude. I hate that girl so much.

00:26:39.165 --> 00:26:40.632
I know.

00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:42.199
[sighs]

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.768
Weird thing is. I've been
thinking about them. though.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:47.171
Thinking about. like. what?

00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:49.074
Like. them doing it.

00:26:49.075 --> 00:26:49.941
Screwing?

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:50.875
[laughs]

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:51.910
Yeah. screwing.

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:53.745
Let's be honest.

00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:55.313
Scott has been
with some beautiful girls

00:26:55.314 --> 00:26:56.348
in his time. right?

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:57.215
We both know that.

00:26:57.216 --> 00:26:59.183
Oh. yeah.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.152
So why the hell
does he put up with her shit?

00:27:01.153 --> 00:27:02.287
I don't know.

00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:04.155
Maybe it could be love.

00:27:04.156 --> 00:27:06.725
[both laugh]

00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:09.727
Way to get all sappy on me. man.
I don't think that's it.

00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:11.997
Well. she comes
from a wealthy family.

00:27:11.998 --> 00:27:14.366
She's a real rich bitch.

00:27:14.367 --> 00:27:16.000
I don't know. man.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.681
I don't think
Scott cares about that stuff.

00:27:18.037 --> 00:27:19.670
Yeah.

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:21.306
Well. you know her dad's
supposed to get him that job.

00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:24.075
Oh. yeah. The job
I've heard so much about.

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:26.778
Could you actually
picture Scott selling insurance?

00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:29.180
First of all.
they would make him shave.

00:27:29.181 --> 00:27:30.949
And then they'd probably dress
him up in this suit.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.466
with a matching tie.

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:33.985
And he'd have some pens
sticking out of his pocket.

So what was
the last jerk's name?

00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:45.176
Um. Sean.

00:30:59.158 --> 00:31:01.025
You know. the one that says.

"Some bitch broke my heart.
and fucked me up good."

Yeah. like. that's the thing.

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:14.239

what's the matter with me.
and what did I do wrong?

No. There is something
wrong with her.

we all took off.

'cause it was creepy.

No. We don't have enough time.

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:12.570
We'll get that cash.

[scoffs] I don't think so.

00:36:39.932 --> 00:36:42.799
What do you mean.
hitting places near the circus?

00:36:44.436 --> 00:36:48.206
They held up a tow truck shop
and a gas station.

Do you need to take a break?

00:44:02.374 --> 00:44:05.109
No. It's just hard
bringing this stuff up.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.712
I've been trying to forget it
for the last four years.

00:44:08.713 --> 00:44:10.380

I hope I didn't hurt
your feelings.

I am sorry.
You know me. old Mr. Kharver.

In fact. you know what?

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.404
I would have to say. you're a...

00:47:20.405 --> 00:47:22.105
You're a goddamn fashion plate.

00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:24.575
Look at you with your plaid.
and your...

00:47:24.576 --> 00:47:26.176
Oh. those are real buttons.
aren't they?

I gotta say.
and that denim. you know.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.615

son of a bitch motherfucker

00:47:31.616 --> 00:47:33.032
that you work for.

00:47:33.033 --> 00:47:34.451
You know.
that guy's got no imagination.

00:47:34.452 --> 00:47:35.953
He's got no fashion sense.

00:47:35.954 --> 00:47:37.354
In fact. Sarge. you know.
I gotta wonder.

00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:39.256
why the fuck do you work
for that asshole?

00:47:39.257 --> 00:47:41.090
[laughs]

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:42.926
You know what? I'm the one you
should be working for. frankly.

00:47:42.927 --> 00:47:45.529
Because. you know.
I wasn't gonna tell you this.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.464
but I got a surprise for you.
Sarge.

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:49.299
Right in the trunk.
You know why?

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.002
Because I'm an entrepreneur.
I'm a visionary.

00:47:52.003 --> 00:47:54.104
And I've got
a real good sense of talent.

00:47:54.105 --> 00:47:56.440
So. I want you to come over here
and take a look at this.

00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:58.575
Come on. Sarge.
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

00:47:58.576 --> 00:48:00.010
There they are.

00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:01.645
I tell you. Sarge.
they're the flying phenoms.

00:48:01.646 --> 00:48:03.480
They're the flying fallacies.
I mean.

00:48:03.481 --> 00:48:05.616
I don't give a bearded lady's
ball sack what you call it.

00:48:05.617 --> 00:48:08.518
The fact is.
they are under contract

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:11.054

You're missing
a big opportunity. Sarge.

00:48:19.097 --> 00:48:20.163
But of course.
you wouldn't know that

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:22.199
if it kissed you in the ass.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.167

00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:21.117

00:50:23.254 --> 00:50:26.156
And to my left.

I am not eating this.
It's disgusting.

00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:02.826
So. uh.

[farts]

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.831
Ugh. gross. dude.

00:51:30.388 --> 00:51:31.721
Excuse me.
Where's the ladies' room?

00:51:31.722 --> 00:51:33.556
- Well. that's easy.
- Shut it!

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.462
If you exit the train car.
you go into the warehouse

00:51:38.463 --> 00:51:39.595
and you'll find it.

00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:48.737
What?

00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:59.315
Oh. you've got to be kidding me.

[Casey coughs]

00:52:50.902 --> 00:52:53.302
Man. Casey's been gone a while.

00:52:56.941 --> 00:52:59.175
I think I'm gonna go
check on Casey.

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:16.860
I'm not feeling well.

00:53:16.861 --> 00:53:18.528
Thank you. thank you.

00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:19.562
Babe?

00:53:20.898 --> 00:53:22.532
Babe.

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:24.400
What? Why did she just run away?

00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:27.419
Well. that was quite rude.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.372
Slit that bitch's throat
and boyfriend pissed his pants.

00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.741
[both laugh]

00:53:31.742 --> 00:53:33.476
BOSS: Hey. look
at that window over there.

00:53:33.477 --> 00:53:35.345
That's a place we could stay.

Pull over.

00:53:37.782 --> 00:53:40.549

[girl hums]

00:53:48.259 --> 00:53:49.993
What are you doing in here?

00:53:49.994 --> 00:53:51.460
I'm playing.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:53.363
Where's your mom and dad?

00:53:53.364 --> 00:53:54.530
They're right here.

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:56.967
Why don't you come with me?

00:53:56.968 --> 00:53:58.634
And I'll help you
find your mom and dad.

00:54:10.815 --> 00:54:11.948
Hey. Daddy.

Why. hello. dear.

00:54:13.251 --> 00:54:15.385
I made you
something very special.

00:54:15.386 --> 00:54:17.653
Ah. a nice treat

00:54:37.041 --> 00:54:38.775
VERONICA: Scott.
I'm not gonna calm down.

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:40.677
Seriously.
will you just listen to me?

00:54:40.678 --> 00:54:42.745
I'm trying.
but you won't stop yelling.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.814
No. you're not listening to me.
There's an eyeball in my soup.

00:54:44.815 --> 00:54:46.650
- Just give me your key.
- VERONICA: I don't have my key.

00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:47.628
SCOTT: Why don't you
have your key?

00:54:47.629 --> 00:54:48.606
VERONICA: Because I don't
have my key.

00:54:48.607 --> 00:54:49.586
VERONICA: You're supposed
to carry my stuff.

00:54:49.587 --> 00:54:50.753
Shh.

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:55.625
This is all class.

00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:57.459
Too bad it's all low class.

00:54:57.862 --> 00:55:00.330
- You're screaming. Geez.
- Because...

00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:02.799
SCOTT: Just give me your key.
That's all I want is your key.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.302
Hey. guys. Having some problems?

00:55:05.303 --> 00:55:07.370

- There's these crazy people.
- Babe. just relax...

00:55:10.374 --> 00:55:12.742
Stop telling me
to calm down. Scott.

00:55:12.743 --> 00:55:15.445
There was a circus
a little ways up the road.

00:55:15.446 --> 00:55:16.801
Can you help us. please?

00:55:16.802 --> 00:55:18.157
She says there's
an eyeball in her soup.

00:55:18.158 --> 00:55:19.516
- There was an eyeball...
- I think she's overreacting.

00:55:19.517 --> 00:55:20.650
Do you have
a phone we could use?

00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.352

- Please.

00:55:22.353 --> 00:55:23.553
You know what?
Come on to my room.

00:55:36.717 --> 00:55:37.534
- Scott...
- I think we're just gonna leave.

00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:39.568
- I think we have the wrong room.
- I think not.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:43.505
There were these people
living in this dark warehouse.

00:55:44.542 --> 00:55:45.674
JAY: <i>I couldn't see them.</i>

00:55:46.644 --> 00:55:48.610
<i>But I could feel them.</i>

00:55:53.751 --> 00:55:55.652
One of them grabbed Casey.

00:55:55.653 --> 00:55:58.588
She got away. but they...
They scratched her up.

00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:10.867
I can't tell...

00:56:10.868 --> 00:56:12.635
[mumbles]

00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:14.253
What are you talking about?

00:56:14.254 --> 00:56:15.872
We need to get out of here
right now.

00:56:15.873 --> 00:56:18.742

They attacked me.
We need to get out.

00:56:22.413 --> 00:56:24.447

I guess it's door number two.

00:57:08.893 --> 00:57:10.559
What the hell? It's a dead end.

00:57:13.197 --> 00:57:14.380
The door's locked.

About two feet apart.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:38.721
We were facing each other.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:39.722
With a chainsaw.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:41.789
They chopped her up.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.992
I was covered in her blood.

01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:48.630
They just kept laughing.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:51.399
So they took her head
and torso out of the room.

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:55.938
I got my hand free
and got out of there.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.705
This time I didn't
go near the highway.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:00.943
You ran through the woods again.

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:03.479

JAY: <i>I woke up in hospital.</i>

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:47.622
They took my clothes.

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:54.163
Well. you were sentenced
to 25 years to life

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:57.032
for the murder of Casey.

01:13:57.033 --> 01:13:59.902
because they found two pints
of her blood in your clothing.

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:02.204
I told all this
to my trial attorney.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:04.006
They had me plead guilty.

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:06.175
Plea bargain deal.

01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:07.843
Yeah. some deal.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:09.978
The deal was
to keep you off death row.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:13.948
I bet they're eating
backwoods hillbillies right now.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:18.887
I think we have a pretty
good chance for a retrial.

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:22.023
With your story and the fact
that they never found the body.

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:24.993
Thank you.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:25.994

Um. I'm really worried.

01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:13.609
I don't know
how far away he is from here.

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:14.809
But can you take me
somewhere safe?

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.011
Yeah. he's fucking dead.
Get in. get in.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.645
