00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.041
The papers were what was
believed to be an early draft

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:25.667
of Mark Twain's most famous
novel. Huckleberry Finn.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.333
But the bitter irony
is that after analysis

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.667
the chapters were found
to be forgeries.

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.417
Professor Mac McKinnon
had murdered his

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:36.875
Elmstead College colleague.
Professor Nicole Ford.

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:38.458
for nothing.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:40.792
McKinnon is currently serving
30 years

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.083
at the Washington State
Eastern Correctional Facility

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:47.500
because We Know Whodunnit.

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.917
You know. I really dislike
these shows.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.959
especially when you know
the people involved.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.709
And the fact that the chapters
were forged.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.625
I mean. that's brutal.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.583
Well. fake Mark Twain writings
are all too common.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.917
Which is ironic. seeing
as that Mark Twain

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.250
is actually a pseudonym.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.250
That's right.

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.917
Hey. did you know
Nicole and Mac?

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:09.917
Yeah.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.125
Yeah. I worked with them
for years.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.000
We were friends.

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:14.041
I wasn't teaching at Elmstead

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.583
by the time they joined
the faculty.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:16.917
I knew them through Amy.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.500
Hmm.

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:20.792
You know. Mac always claimed
he was innocent.

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:23.250
Do you believe him?

00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:27.375
Well. I know that they said
they had physical evidence

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:31.125
but I know Mac
and he did not do it.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.000
Well. that was as sensational
as I remember it.

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.041
It happened a couple years ago

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.083
so why are you watching
it tonight?

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.792
Because I'm talking
to that writer tomorrow.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:53.917
Ella Quincy?

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.083
Hmm.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.583
Yeah. she's writing a book
about the case

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.709
so I just kinda wanted to
freshen up on all the details.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.250
I will say this.

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:02.000
I've been a cop for a while
and I have never seen anybody

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:05.625
use strychnine in an asthma
inhaler as the murder weapon.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:06.709
That was very original.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.458
That is just the thing
I'm looking for

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.000
in the next Atticus
Keller novel.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.166
You should steal it.

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:13.417
Well. you know. artists
do that sometimes.

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:14.959
Speaking of which.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.125
I heard there is a waiting list
for your reading on Tuesday.

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.250
Well. I should hope so.

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:21.959
You guys have your reservations.
right?

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.166
- Ooh.
- Huh?

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.667
Do we need reservations?

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.250
Amy. did you make a reservation?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.291
I forgot.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:30.166
Oh. come on.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:30.917
Are you kidding?

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.709
We're not gonna get in.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.625
No...

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:33.917
[laughs]

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.750
Of course we're coming
to your reading!

00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:36.917
Front row centre.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.959
That was very good.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.834
Honey. woah. That was good.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.834
You know. I didn't know much
about your predecessor-

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.000
Detective Clawson?

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:44.250
Yeah. yeah.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.500
I just know that he's definitely
no Travis Burke.

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:49.917
What. he didn't let you tag
along and help him solve crimes?

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.667
[laughs]

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.875
No. that is not what I meant.

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:56.875
No. I'm just saying it-
it didn't seem like he had

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.750
the kind of passion that
you do for the job. that's all.

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:00.875
Yeah. I didn't know the guy.

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:02.291
We only overlapped
for like two weeks.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:06.041
I do know that he was very happy
to retire.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.083
Yeah.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.500
Alright.

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:11.875
Hey. Amy. um... after your dad's
reading on Tuesday night

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.917
I was gonna grab a bite to eat.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.041
Would you like to join me?

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:16.375
Yeah. of course.

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:17.917
Yeah. we can ask Dad while
we're here. if you want.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.208
We could. yeah. but I was kinda
hoping it would be just us.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.750
You mean...
You mean like a date?

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.083
Yeah.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.458
I mean. you know. if you want
to name it. sure.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.667
I mean. just for clarification
purposes.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:33.000
Of course. Yeah.

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.834
Ok.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.000
Ok. Yeah. I'll see you
on Tuesday.

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:39.792
Tuesday it is.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:42.125
Goodnight. Professor.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.750
Goodnight. Detective.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:05.709
Partners.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.917
The most famous fictional
detective of all time.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:12.208
Sherlock Holmes.
he had two partners.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.583
One. Doctor Watson. who we all
know is the complete opposite

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:19.125
of Sherlock in every single way.

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:21.458
but then Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.750
wanted to give the great
detective another partner.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:29.875
This time an academic.
James Moriarty.

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:33.792
He was also known as Sherlock's
arch enemy.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.834
I'm going to read you
guys something.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.125
"A criminal strain
ran in his blood.

00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:42.500
"which. instead
of being modified.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:46.417
"was increased and rendered
infinitely more dangerous

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:50.709
"by his extraordinary
mental powers."

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.000
Extraordinary mental powers.

00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:55.208
Who else does that
remind you of?

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.542
Anybody take a guess?

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.250
Mr. Newman.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.458
Sherlock Holmes?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.125
Exactly.

00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:02.625
Sherlock Holmes.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:04.166
Let me show you guys this.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:12.792
This was an etching from the
original printing of the book.

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:15.792
Holmes. Moriarty.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.667
How similar do they look. right?

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:22.542
So Moriarty was the second
partner of Holmes.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:28.417
He was also his mirror image.
so similar yet so different.

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:30.208
Yeah.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.750
Alright. looks like time is up
so your essays

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:35.875
on the necessity of a partner
in detective fiction

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:37.542
are due in a week. everybody.

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:38.959
Have a great day.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.208
Bye.

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:41.583
What's up. Newman?

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:42.417
How's it going. Bud?

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.542
- Good. how are you?
- Good.

00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:44.625
- Good to see you.
- You too.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:45.500
Hey. Blake.

00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:46.667
How's it going?

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.166
Good. Professor.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.250
Busy. you know.
running the book store.

00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:51.250
Right. Right.

00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.000
Oh. carpel tunnel?

00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.041
Yeah. my physical therapist
gave me this.

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.792
Writing does a number
on my tendons.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.333
So you're writing.
That's good.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:02.000
Yeah. Yeah. actually Bud's been
sort of mentoring me

00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:03.375
on my novel.

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:05.583
Oh. mentoring is a bit of
an exaggeration.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.000
Oh. come on. You're the one
who told me

00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:09.291
to switch from literary
fiction to thriller.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.542
I did do that.

00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:11.583
And he read three drafts.

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.041
That's also true.

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:14.458
Mentoring. yeah.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.709
And so I wanted you to be
some of the first to hear

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.166
I just got a publishing offer.

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:21.250
Woah. nice!

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.917
Blake. that's wonderful!
Congratulations!

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:26.083
Hey guys. I'm missing the party?

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.583
[laughs]

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:28.875
- Hey. Dad.
- Hey. cutie.

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:29.667
How are you?

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:31.083
Great.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.291
Dad. you remember Blake Newman?

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:33.417
How can I forget?

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:34.875
He set up my reading
for Tuesday night.

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:36.458
We were just celebrating
the fact that Blake

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.333
just sold his first novel.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.291
Oh. that's wonderful.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:40.375
Who's the publisher?

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:43.125
Uh. Dain Press.
they're smaller but...

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:45.166
Oh. no. I know them well.
Very respectable.

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:45.959
What's it called?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.709
Uh. Murder While I Smile.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.375
It's a quote from Shakespeare.

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:51.542
Shakespeare. Richard III.
I know it well.

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:52.750
Crime fiction. huh?

00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:54.166
Oh. you bet. sir.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.625
And my dad was a huge
fan of yours.

00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:58.500
He introduced me to
the Atticus Keller books.

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:00.166
[laughs]

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:02.417
Well. I'm sure that
he's quite proud now

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:03.792
that you're being published.

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.500
I'm sure he would be.

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:07.458
He passed away just over
a year ago.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.750
Sorry. Blake.

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.250
That's ok.

00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:13.834
It's just... he'll never get
to read my novel. you know?

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:18.208
Well. can I read it?

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.291
Are you serious?

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:23.417
Yeah. I just happen to have
a copy.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.375
Oh. yeah...

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:28.417
Bud?

00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:29.458
I'll get you a fresh one.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.291
You better.

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:31.792
Great. Thanks.

00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:33.542
I'll read it tonight.

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:35.583
Well. he seems like
a wonderful young man.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:36.625
Yeah.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.834
Yeah. he's in my modern
novel seminar.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:41.000
Studying to get his PhD in
and then he left

00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:43.041
a couple years ago
to focus on writing.

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.542
Seems to have paid off.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.250
It has. yeah.

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:48.458
I'm going to meet that writer.
Ella at her rental

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.792
so I will talk to you later.

00:08:49.834 --> 00:08:50.959
You bet.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.709
Love you.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.041
Love you too. hon.

00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:59.458
Wow. Ella. this is
a lovely rental.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
How long do you have it for?

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:02.792
A week.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.041
It was a great deal.

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:05.417
Yeah.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:08.959
So. I have to get my fan girl
moment out of the way.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.291
I've read everything
your dad's written.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.333
Oh. me too.

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:14.625
You know. he's reading from
his new Atticus Keller book

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:16.291
tomorrow night at
a local book store.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:17.458
Oh. I know.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.083
I arranged this trip to coincide
with that.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:19.959
Ah.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.500
But don't worry.

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:22.583
I didn't ask to interview you
because you're his daughter.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.792
Ok.

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:24.834
You want some tea?

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:26.583
Yeah. yeah.
That would be great.

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:27.542
I'd love some.

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:28.458
Is mint tea ok?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.083
Yeah. that's fine. thank you.

00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:35.667
So. is this your first book?

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.959
Yeah. I was an English major
in college.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.458
What college did you go to?

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.458
Oh. uh. a little school
back east.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.834
Should we get started?

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.542
Sure. Sure.

00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:47.917
You know. I can't help
but ask you

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:50.125
what made you want to write
about this?

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:52.542
Well. a few months ago I saw it
featured on that show

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:53.166
We Know Whodunnit.

00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:53.959
Oh.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.750
Have you seen it?

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:55.750
Yeah.

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:56.583
Yeah. Pretty over the top.

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.000
Mmm.

00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.291
But as an aspiring writer
I thought it was powerful

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.166
that writing would lead
to murder.

00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:06.333
You don't mind if I record this.
do you?

00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:07.583
Sure. go ahead.

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:08.625
[clears throat]

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:12.875
Can you tell me about the
Mark Twain incident with Nicole?

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:15.375
Yeah. sure. I'll tell you
what I know.

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:19.250
Mac was a Twain scholar
and Nicole had found

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.834
what seemed to be an early draft
of the initial chapters

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:26.291
of Huck Finn at an estate sale.
I believe.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:27.917
But she wasn't a Twain Scholar?

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:29.166
No. no. she wasn't.

00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:31.291
She taught creative writing.

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.875
But those chapters could have
gotten a lucrative book deal

00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:34.917
for anyone.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:35.709
Yeah.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.792
If they had been real.

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:37.709
True.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.917
[laughs]

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.709
Uh. so why did Mac need them
so desperately?

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.750
Mac was up for tenure
at the college

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:47.250
and he needed to publish or
he would lose his position.

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:49.875
And this all came out in a fight
which you witnessed?

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:51.250
Yes...

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.583
Amy: It was pretty crazy.
I mean. they were both
very upset.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:59.583
I didn't hear exactly
what was said

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.250
but Mac did come to me
afterwards and he said

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:05.000
that he lost his temper
over the Huck Finn chapters.

00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:07.875
And had Mac and Nicole had
a history of being at odds?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.333
No. quite the contrary.
They were close.

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:11.625
Did you ever think that
he'd be capable

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.208
of doing something like this?

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.250
No.

00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:15.750
Never.

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:18.375
You know. I tend to believe
you just based on your work

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:19.333
with the Garrison
Police Department.

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:20.291
[laughs]

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:21.500
Well...

00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:23.250
But for full disclosure
I am writing this book

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:26.583
because I believe Mac McKinnon
is innocent.

00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:30.041
I'm glad I'm not the only one
that feels that way.

00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:34.875
Can I ask you what makes
you think he's innocent?

00:11:34.917 --> 00:11:38.208
Oh. um... it's just a feeling.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.458
Feeling based on what?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.875
I should probably keep that
confidential for the moment.

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:46.667
Oh. sure. Sure.

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:50.333
Uh. so have you spoken to Mac?

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.583
He won't meet with me.

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:55.083
Oh. well um. I could try
to reach out to him.

00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:56.333
see if I could change that if-

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:57.583
Yeah. that'd be terrific!

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.834
Yeah?

00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:00.959
Ok. well I should do it now
before I forget.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.792
I'll just um. contact
the correctional facility.

00:12:06.834 --> 00:12:08.667
see what happens. right?

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.542
Well. thanks for talking to me.

00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:11.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:13.083
Thank you.

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:16.041
Uh. who are you talking to next?

00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:17.834
Uh. Howard Clawson.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:20.500
He was the detective on the Ford
case but he's retired.

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:23.166
Yeah. I know him.

00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:24.542
Uh. look.

00:12:24.583 --> 00:12:26.166
This might seem a little weird

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:30.959
but would you mind
if I tagged along?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.041
Sure.

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:33.250
Yeah?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.709
Oh. hey. Mr. Clawson.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.250
Enjoying your retirement. I see.

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:55.875
Technically I'm semi-retired.

00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:57.000
I do private security now.

00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.166
Amy Winslow.

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:03.208
Did I hear you helped
Travis Burke a time or two?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.166
I did a little consulting.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.875
Where were you
when I was on the job?

00:13:07.917 --> 00:13:09.083
[laughs]

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.041
Thank you so much for talking
to me. Howard.

00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:12.917
You don't mind if I record this.
do you?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.333
No. go for it.

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:18.208
So um. how did you get assigned
to the case?

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.041
Dwight Merrill. Nicole's
husband. came into the station.

00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:22.375
Dwight and Nicole
were separated.

00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:23.959
she was a no-show
at the appointment

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.834
with their divorce mediator.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.625
Howard: When I called her.
no answer.

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:31.417
I called the department
in Elmstead.

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:33.500
She missed her morning classes.

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:36.208
He wanted me to file a
missing-persons report.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.709
I suggested he look
for her at home.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.417
He asked me to come along.

00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:42.458
If she was there he didn't
want to get in trouble

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.917
with the mediation.
since he moved out.

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:46.208
And that's when you found her?

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.625
Yeah. in bed.

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:49.917
Paramedics thought heart attack.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.834
She had no family history
of heart disease

00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:56.000
so I ran a tox screen
and it was strychnine.

00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:58.792
We looked for how it might
have gotten into her.

00:13:58.834 --> 00:14:00.667
Howard: We found traces
of the poison

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:03.959
on the valve of her asthma
inhaler canister.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.417
So someone injected it
into her canister?

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:07.667
That's right.

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.083
Did you consider Dwight Merrill
as a suspect?

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:11.125
Of course.

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:12.500
But he had an alibi.

00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:14.917
He was at his brother's house
about an hour away.

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.083
And what lead you
to focus on Mac?

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:19.500
Well. we heard about that fight.

00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.625
How desperate McKinnon
was for those papers.

00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:23.125
Save his career.

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:25.417
So we went to question the guy
who wanted them.

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:28.417
He wasn't home but his wife
let us in.

00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:31.000
How long after Nicole's murder
did you do this?

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:32.583
Three days.

00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:35.250
Three days. Wow.
you worked fast.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.583
That's the way to close
a murder case.

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:38.667
Howard: McKinnon wasn't home.

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:41.166
but she let us look around.

00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:43.208
I asked her to open the safe
in his office.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.834
The key was right on top.

00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:49.917
We found the book chapters
and a bottle of strychnine.

00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:51.250
Open and shut.

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.792
But Mac didn't confess.

00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:57.083
I mean. he didn't even take
the plea deal.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:58.375
We didn't need it.

00:14:58.417 --> 00:15:00.125
We got a conviction.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:04.542
And you didn't think that maybe
he could have been framed?

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:10.500
Are you trying to reopen
this case?

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.166
No. No. not at all.

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:13.250
I was just um...

00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:14.500
Listen clearly.

00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:18.834
That was a solid conviction.

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:20.625
Of course.

00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:25.542
You know. I think I'm late
for an appointment.

00:15:25.583 --> 00:15:27.250
I have to cut this short.

00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:33.208
Well. thank you for your time.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.583
Yeah.

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:36.208
Have a good day.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.625
You too.

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:40.083
Sorry. Ella.

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:42.125
Are you kidding?
He was so defensive.

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:44.000
It was like he was
hiding something.

00:15:44.041 --> 00:15:45.792
That will be great for the book.

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:46.959
Huh.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.834
Hey. Chuck.

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:54.250
- Hey. guys.
- Hey. hey.

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:55.500
Hey.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.291
[knocking]

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:58.959
Like what you've done
with the place.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.959
Yeah.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.125
You mean nothing?

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:02.375
You can't get enough of us.
hey Howard?

00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:03.959
Thought I'd stop by. you know.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.542
Yeah. how are you?
How're things?

00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.041
I've been better. honestly.

00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:08.542
Uh. can we talk?

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:10.333
Yeah. of course.
Have a seat.

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:11.375
Thank you.

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:14.792
What's on your mind?

00:16:14.834 --> 00:16:18.875
Well. I just got done talking
with your consultant.

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:21.792
My consultant?

00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:24.625
Oh. you mean Professor Winslow?

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:27.417
Yeah. whatever her title is.

00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:29.417
She doesn't carry
a badge though.

00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:31.000
No. she doesn't.

00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:33.625
Look. I know she's
a smart cookie

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:36.291
but um. she's teamed up
with a young book writer

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:38.125
and they're clearly trying
to reopen a murder case

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:40.667
I closed two years ago.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:43.875
You mean the Nicole Ford murder?

00:16:43.917 --> 00:16:45.417
You knew she was up to this?

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:48.125
Well. no. I knew she was talking
to a writer but that's all.

00:16:48.166 --> 00:16:48.917
That's not all.

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:50.250
They're working together.

00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:52.500
trying to make this look like
a bad conviction.

00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:54.583
Ok.

00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:57.834
Well. Howard. as you just said
she's a smart person

00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:00.875
and if she feels like there's a
reason to look into this case...

00:17:00.917 --> 00:17:02.458
Well. there isn't.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.750
I mean. I just told you.
it's rock solid.

00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:07.417
Well. if it's rock solid
then you've got nothing

00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:09.583
to worry about. right?

00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:12.750
[phone ringing]

00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:14.709
I'm sorry.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.750
I gotta grab this.

00:17:15.792 --> 00:17:18.125
Howard. it's always good
to see you.

00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:18.834
Yeah. you too.

00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:19.667
Don't be a stranger.

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:21.333
- Yeah.
- Alright.

00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:24.333
Hey.

00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:25.500
Were your ears burning?

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.083
Let me guess.

00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:28.709
Howard Clawson called you.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.667
Travis: Not a call. he actually
came down to the station.

00:17:31.709 --> 00:17:33.500
Are you teaming up
with that writer?

00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:35.750
No. I just tagged along
for the interview

00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:36.959
with Howard Clawson.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.375
I was trying to get her
to trust me

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:40.291
and then he got all defensive.

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:42.834
Alright. Amy. you have to
understand his perspective.

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:44.625
He has a solid conviction.

00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:46.750
Ok. well if it was
a solid conviction

00:17:46.792 --> 00:17:49.291
then he wouldn't mind me asking
a few questions to confirm it.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.125
[message alert]

00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.834
Hey. Travis?

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.250
It's an important call.
I'll call you back later.

00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.333
Bye.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.083
Bye.

00:17:58.125 --> 00:17:59.750
Operator: Washington State
Eastern Correctional Facility.

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:00.875
Do you accept the charges?

00:18:00.917 --> 00:18:02.750
Yes.

00:18:02.792 --> 00:18:03.792
Mac?

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:05.291
Amy. hi.

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:07.208
Amy: Hey. Thanks
for calling me back.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.542
Yeah. sure.

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:10.542
Uh. look. I gotta tell you
I'm a little surprised

00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:12.583
to hear from you.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.458
Look. I know this may seem like
it's out of the blue

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.625
but I spoke to a woman today
named Ella Quincy.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:21.417
Yeah. she sent me some messages.

00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:25.000
Amy: Yeah. She said
you wouldn't talk to her.

00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:28.125
Listen. Amy. um...

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:31.458
I get a lot of requests
over the last couple of years.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.792
You know. writers. journalists.

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:35.500
They say they wanna
tell my story

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:37.542
but all they wanna do
is to hear my story.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:41.166
Ok. I understand that
but this is not that.

00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:44.834
She's writing a book that takes
another look at what happened.

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.000
What do you mean. another look?

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.375
She believes you're innocent

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:49.959
and I think she has a way
to prove it.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.333
What is it?

00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:53.792
Amy: I don't know.

00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:56.166
But I'm gonna find out.

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.542
[door closes]

00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:04.959
Amy: Hey. it's me.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.542
Kitchen.

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:10.834
A pipe burst at Holly's and
she's closed and I need coffee.

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.166
Oh. yeah.

00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:13.208
Hi. Help yourself.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.917
Thanks. Dad.

00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:14.959
Yeah.

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:20.208
So I am going to Warrenville
today to talk to Mac.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.542
Are you going with
that young writer?

00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:24.333
Who Ella? Uh. no.

00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:26.291
Oh. that was a loaded reply.

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:30.125
Well. it's just I don't really
know what her agenda is.

00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:31.542
Meaning?

00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:35.083
Meaning she's so sure
that Mac is innocent

00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:36.792
but she won't tell me how.

00:19:36.834 --> 00:19:39.250
Well. I mean.
young writers. they...

00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:42.000
they sometimes feel that someone
might take their ideas.

00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:43.375
I'm not.

00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:45.083
I'm just trying to get
an innocent man out of jail.

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.834
Which you're very good at.
as I recall.

00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.834
[chuckling]

00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:50.792
Oh. what is this?
Blake's manuscript?

00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:51.667
Mmmhmm.

00:19:51.709 --> 00:19:53.125
Wow. you're like halfway done.

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:54.709
Yeah. I was up past midnight.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.500
The kid knows how to craft out
a mystery.

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:57.500
Mmm.

00:19:57.542 --> 00:19:58.917
I gotta go.
See you tonight.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:19:59.667
Ok.

00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:01.250
- Love you.
- Love you.

00:20:15.875 --> 00:20:16.875
[buzzer]

00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:22.417
Go to booth 3. Mac.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:35.458
Hello. Amy.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.959
You look great.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.333
Hey. Thanks. Mac.

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:41.250
You look uh...

00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:42.333
Incarcerated.

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.667
[laughs]

00:20:44.709 --> 00:20:47.166
I really appreciate
you coming down here.

00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.583
I know you're very busy.

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:51.583
Yeah. I just wanted to talk
to you a little bit more

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.959
about what we spoke
about yesterday.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.917
That I'm innocent.

00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:57.917
I am. I swear to you.

00:20:57.959 --> 00:21:01.208
I... I didn't kill Nicole.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.917
I know.

00:21:02.959 --> 00:21:05.542
Listen. Ella says
she can prove it.

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:08.041
But here's the thing.
she's not telling me how.

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:09.709
So here's what I think.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.208
I think that we use the fact

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.917
that you won't speak to her
to our advantage.

00:21:13.959 --> 00:21:15.792
How so?

00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:17.834
We offer her an exclusive
interview

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.542
in exchange for
that information.

00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:22.041
That's a great idea.

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:22.917
Let's do it.

00:21:22.959 --> 00:21:24.792
Yeah? Ok.

00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:26.542
I also wanted to talk to you
about the detective

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:29.125
that arrested you.

00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:30.208
Howard Clawson.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.375
What about him?

00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:32.458
Did you ever have
any previous dealings

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.917
with him before this case?

00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:36.333
No.

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:38.500
My first meeting with this man
was when he arrested me.

00:21:38.542 --> 00:21:41.750
You think you can get him
to take another look?

00:21:41.792 --> 00:21:44.709
No. unfortunately he retired
a year ago.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.500
However. I think that
I can get Travis

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:49.959
to take a look-
um. sorry. Detective Burke.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.709
He's Clawson's replacement.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.208
I've actually helped him
solve some cases.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.083
Really?

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.000
Yeah.

00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:57.709
Well. that is encouraging.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.542
Yeah. I'll talk to him.

00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:02.000
I really appreciate that.
Thank you.

00:22:02.041 --> 00:22:03.875
No worries.

00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:09.417
I'm guessing Linda hasn't been
around in a while.

00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:11.625
How did you know?

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:13.375
Well. you told me once

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:15.875
she doesn't really like
you with a beard.

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:16.750
Right.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.875
Yeah. she's been...
she's been very busy.

00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.000
Well. hang tough.

00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:28.291
I'm gonna see what I can do. ok?

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.750
Yeah. Thanks.

00:22:36.834 --> 00:22:37.792
Voicemail: Hi. you've reached
Ella Quincy.

00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:39.166
Please leave me a message.

00:22:39.208 --> 00:22:40.875
Hey. Ella. this is Amy Winslow.

00:22:40.917 --> 00:22:44.625
Look. Mac's willing to talk
but he has a condition. ok?

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:46.583
Give me a call.

00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:47.834
Thanks. Bye.

00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:04.041
So apparently someone wants me
to stay away from the Ford case.

00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:06.500
Who knew you were
going up there?

00:23:06.542 --> 00:23:09.834
Just my dad. Mac.
and the prison staff.

00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:11.542
Alright. I'm gonna call
up there.

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.333
have them go over the security
camera footage.

00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:16.583
I will also have our new
forensics tech analyze this.

00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:18.083
Ok. good.

00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:20.041
Meanwhile. I want you to stay
away from the Ford case.

00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.750
What? Are you serious?

00:23:21.792 --> 00:23:23.917
If any-

00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:26.709
If anything I should keep
pursuing this.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.041
And so should you.

00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:31.333
Amy. it's closed.

00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:32.667
It's closed.

00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:34.417
And I have to respect that.

00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:36.750
And so should you.

00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:37.542
Yeah?

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.333
Yeah. I-I hear you.

00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:45.792
[knocking]

00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:50.834
Amy.

00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:52.208
Hi. Linda.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.542
I was just wondering. do you
have a minute to talk?

00:23:54.583 --> 00:23:56.375
That writer was here
this morning.

00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:58.125
Is this about that?

00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:01.083
Uh. about Mac. you mean?

00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:02.625
Yeah.

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:05.291
I'm sorry. I have a physical
therapy client coming at 3:00.

00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:07.083
You know what?
This will only take a second.

00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:08.792
I promise.

00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:09.959
Of course.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Please. come in.

00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:12.875
Great. Thank you.

00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:19.125
So. what do you wanna ask me?

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:23.583
Uh. well I was hoping
that maybe you could

00:24:23.625 --> 00:24:26.625
fill in some blanks for me
about what happened.

00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:30.041
Specifically. did Mac ever
express any animosity

00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:31.959
towards Nicole?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.208
No. Never.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.583
But you did know about the fight

00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:37.583
over the Huck Finn chapters.
right?

00:24:37.625 --> 00:24:38.875
No.

00:24:38.917 --> 00:24:40.709
Until the police told me.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.792
Really?

00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:45.000
That seems a little strange.

00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:48.125
Why do you think that Mac
wouldn't mention that to you?

00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:50.417
I really don't know.

00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:55.542
Were you friends with Nicole?

00:24:55.583 --> 00:24:58.000
We would have Nicole
and Dwight over for dinner.

00:24:58.041 --> 00:24:59.834
they would do the same with us.

00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:02.250
But you were not here the night
she was murdered. right?

00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:04.000
You were out of town?

00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:06.750
I was. On a yoga retreat.

00:25:06.792 --> 00:25:07.917
Right. Yeah.

00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:09.291
Uh. what was the name of
that place. again?

00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:10.208
Sky Mountain.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.709
Sky Mountain. right.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.542
You know. I really should be
getting ready for my client.

00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:17.792
Oh. uh. yeah.
No worries.

00:25:17.834 --> 00:25:20.834
I love all these pictures
you've got here.

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:22.875
It's great.

00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:24.417
They're everywhere.

00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:29.041
But I can't help but notice
Mac's not in any of them.

00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:32.583
Look. I've worked very hard
over the last two years

00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:35.375
to put all of this behind me
and now you and this woman

00:25:35.417 --> 00:25:37.542
want me to dredge it
all up again.

00:25:37.583 --> 00:25:38.542
For what?

00:25:38.583 --> 00:25:39.875
Look. Linda.

00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:42.000
There is a question as
to Mac's guilt. that's all.

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:43.333
From whom?

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:44.250
Not the police.

00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:45.291
Well. not yet. but-

00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:46.834
I really think you should leave.

00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:47.458
Linda-

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.667
Now.

00:25:57.792 --> 00:25:58.959
[knocking]

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:03.375
Oh. the face of consternation.

00:26:03.417 --> 00:26:04.500
What's up?

00:26:04.542 --> 00:26:06.166
Sky Mountain.

00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:07.750
- In Rimrock?
- Mmmhmm.

00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:09.750
Yeah. I went there
a couple years ago.

00:26:09.792 --> 00:26:11.792
You went on a yoga retreat?

00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:12.959
It was a fitness boot camp.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.834
Oh.

00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:15.417
It's a full service facility.

00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:17.041
They house all kinds
of programs.

00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:20.208
Well. Linda. Mac McKinnon's
wife. she went there-

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.583
or. she said she did.

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:25.250
She was there the night
Nicole Ford was murdered.

00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:28.208
That's why she couldn't
alibi Mac.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.333
So the consternation's about...

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:32.917
Well. the Sky Mountain website
doesn't exist.

00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:36.208
That's because it closed
about a year ago.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.083
[chuckles]
Of course it did.

00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:43.375
Hi again.

00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:44.750
Hi.

00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:46.583
I spoke to Linda McKinnon.

00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:48.792
I thought you said you
would leave that alone.

00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:50.250
Well. you asked me
to leave it alone

00:26:50.291 --> 00:26:53.000
and I said I heard you. so
technically that's accurate.

00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:54.208
Hmm.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.792
That dog's not gonna hunt. Amy.

00:26:55.834 --> 00:26:59.000
Ok. well maybe this dog will.

00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:00.959
I found out where Linda's
retreat was.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.458
Sky Mountain. which conveniently
closed about a year ago.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.125
But it was in Rimrock which is
only 20 minutes away from here.

00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:10.750
I mean. that's not much
of a retreat.

00:27:10.792 --> 00:27:12.291
That's subjective.

00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.709
Ok.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.291
In addition. to her not going
to visit Mac in prison?

00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:20.709
There's also no photos of him
anywhere in the house.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.208
I was there. I was looking.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.792
Huh.

00:27:24.834 --> 00:27:26.417
I found them for filing.

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:28.875
Did you ask her why?

00:27:28.917 --> 00:27:30.208
Well. yeah.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.709
She said she was trying
to put it behind her.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.834
That's a reasonable answer.

00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:34.625
Travis.

00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:35.417
Amy.

00:27:35.458 --> 00:27:36.834
Forgive me for the cliché

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:38.959
but where there's smoke
there's fire.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.583
Yeah. but I don't smell
any smoke.

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:42.667
Now that is subjective.

00:27:42.709 --> 00:27:43.917
What about the note on my car?

00:27:43.959 --> 00:27:45.500
Whoever it was. was smart enough
to hide his face

00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:46.125
from the camera.

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:47.083
Hmm.

00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.792
Still staying out of it?

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:51.041
Yeah. alright. We'll talk about
this at dinner tonight.

00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:52.166
Ok.

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:54.333
See you at the book store.

00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:57.083
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:28:01.709 --> 00:28:02.542
Hey.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.667
Thank you.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:09.625
Sorry I'm late. I was just-

00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:10.792
You were changing.

00:28:10.834 --> 00:28:12.291
It's good.

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:13.250
Thank you.

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.792
Hey. question for you.

00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:17.542
Who is that person
that Bud is talking to?

00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:20.083
Oh. uh. that's Ella Quincy.

00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:21.959
She's the one who's doing
the book on Mac.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.166
That's Ella Quincy.
Alright.

00:28:24.208 --> 00:28:26.375
Well. it's a good turnout
for your dad. huh?

00:28:26.417 --> 00:28:28.166
Yeah. it definitely is.

00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:29.250
A lot of-

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:31.792
Oh!

00:28:32.917 --> 00:28:34.375
Do you see the guy
that just walked in?

00:28:34.417 --> 00:28:36.000
Yeah.

00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:37.583
That's Dwight Merrill.
That's Nicole Ford's husband.

00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:38.291
Hmm.

00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:40.542
Which is strange.

00:28:40.583 --> 00:28:42.083
Why is it strange?

00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:44.625
I've just... never seen him

00:28:44.667 --> 00:28:47.583
at one of my dad's book
readings before.

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.083
So maybe he's a new fan.
like me.

00:28:49.125 --> 00:28:50.166
Hmm...

00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:51.709
Amy?

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.542
I'll be right back.

00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:53.500
What're you-

00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:54.166
I'm just gonna go and say hello.

00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:55.583
What are you doing?

00:28:56.667 --> 00:28:59.000
Hey. Dr. Merrill.
How are you?

00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:01.000
Um. I don't know
if you remember me.

00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:02.208
I'm Amy Winslow.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.875
I worked with Nicole.

00:29:03.917 --> 00:29:05.834
Right. of course.

00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.250
Please. call me Dwight.
Professor.

00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:08.291
Call me Amy.

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:09.542
Ok.

00:29:09.583 --> 00:29:12.291
I didn't know you were
one of my dad's fans.

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:14.709
Well. who doesn't love
Atticus Keller?

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.792
What's your favourite book?

00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.041
Uh...

00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:20.709
Wait. wait. wait. don't tell me.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.542
"Broken Nine Pins".

00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:23.417
You guessed it.

00:29:23.458 --> 00:29:24.834
Mmm. I figured.

00:29:24.875 --> 00:29:25.959
[clears throat]

00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:28.083
Excuse me. everyone.

00:29:28.125 --> 00:29:30.041
If you wouldn't mind
taking your seats

00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:32.375
we're gonna be beginning
momentarily here.

00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:33.375
We'll talk later.

00:29:33.417 --> 00:29:34.250
Yeah.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.250
Hey.

00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:42.542
So?

00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:44.750
So he says he's a fan
of my dad's.

00:29:44.792 --> 00:29:45.917
There you go.

00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:48.458
His favourite book
is "Broken Nine Pins".

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.792
I haven't read that one.

00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:53.083
'Cause it's not a real book.

00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:55.625
I just want to thank you all
so much for being here.

00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:59.458
You know. I start my east coast
book tour next week

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.834
but I gotta say nothing beats

00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:05.166
reading in front of
my home-town crowd.

00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:08.709
So uh. a special thanks to
Blundel Books for hosting.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.583
[applause]

00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:14.208
I'm going to start by
reading a bit

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.750
and then we can do a Q and A.

00:30:15.792 --> 00:30:16.917
Does that sound good?

00:30:16.959 --> 00:30:18.375
Yeah? Ok.

00:30:19.792 --> 00:30:21.041
"The Waving Flame".

00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:23.667
[cheering]

00:30:23.709 --> 00:30:25.959
Chapter one.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.542
"It had been six months
since Atticus Keller

00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:33.000
"felt the barrel of a gun
against the back of his head.

00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:35.041
"He hadn't missed it.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.875
"If you shoot me". Atticus said.

00:30:40.917 --> 00:30:43.917
"you'll never find out
where the money is."

00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:47.375
So. did your dad used to read
to you when you were a kid?

00:30:47.417 --> 00:30:48.917
[laughs]

00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:51.000
Yeah. Every night.

00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:53.375
It's funny. even after I learned
how to read myself

00:30:53.417 --> 00:30:55.917
I'd still beg him to do it
for me.

00:30:55.959 --> 00:30:57.709
I bet. 'cause he's awesome.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.542
Amy. that was fantastic.

00:31:00.583 --> 00:31:02.333
Look at the turnout. huh?

00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:03.625
Yeah. it was great.

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:05.542
Oh. Blake. do you know
Travis Burke?

00:31:05.583 --> 00:31:06.834
Of course I do.

00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:08.750
This guy's a huge
crime fiction fan.

00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:10.583
This is where I buy my books.

00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:11.917
I am delighted to hear it.

00:31:11.959 --> 00:31:13.083
Mmmhmm.

00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:14.667
Oh. Blake. listen.

00:31:14.709 --> 00:31:18.333
There is this young writer
that I'd love for you to meet.

00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:19.417
Ella!

00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:21.542
Ella. can you come here
for a minute?

00:31:21.583 --> 00:31:24.458
Ella Quincy. Blake Newman.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.667
Blake just sold his
first crime novel.

00:31:26.709 --> 00:31:28.458
Yay.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.917
And Ella is writing her
first true crime book.

00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:32.542
Yeah. she's here
interviewing people

00:31:32.583 --> 00:31:34.125
about the Nicole Ford case

00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:37.000
and then I remembered
you studied with Nicole.

00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:38.959
A few classes. yeah.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.709
Sorry. what's your name again?

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.959
Blake Newman.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.166
What a great name
for a crime writer.

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:45.500
Thank you.

00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:47.583
So uh. do you have a publisher
figured out. or...

00:31:47.625 --> 00:31:49.542
Oh. not yet. no.

00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:53.041
Oh. well I'd be uh. happy to let
you know how I made it happen.

00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:56.083
This is the best way
to reach me.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.375
Great. Thanks.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.250
Excuse me. I gotta go.
go cover the register.

00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:02.375
Bye. Blake.

00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:05.583
Oh. uh. Ella?

00:32:05.625 --> 00:32:08.667
I spoke to Mac and he would love
to speak with you

00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:11.041
as long as you're willing
to share what it is

00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:14.625
that you know that makes you
so sure he's innocent.

00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:16.000
Look. can we talk
about this tomorrow?

00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:17.959
I really should get this signed.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.750
Yeah. sure.

00:32:20.792 --> 00:32:22.291
Uh. that was weird.

00:32:22.333 --> 00:32:25.417
Yeah. maybe she doesn't have
anything to offer after all.

00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:26.458
Maybe.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.291
Are you hungry?

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:32.500
Mmm. I thought you would
never ask.

00:32:32.542 --> 00:32:34.875
[laughing]

00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:37.625
Hey. Travis. is that...

00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:39.375
Howard!

00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:40.458
Travis.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.875
And the professor.

00:32:41.917 --> 00:32:43.542
What're you doing here. Howard?

00:32:43.583 --> 00:32:45.583
I'm just out minding
my own business.

00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:46.750
No. you're not.

00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:48.208
You're tailing me.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.041
Just like you followed me
to the prison.

00:32:51.083 --> 00:32:52.291
I'm late.

00:32:52.333 --> 00:32:54.500
Hey. Let me ask you
a question.

00:32:54.542 --> 00:32:56.041
Why did you leave that note?

00:32:56.083 --> 00:32:57.417
What note?

00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:58.834
The note that I'm having
the forensic tech analyze

00:32:58.875 --> 00:32:59.750
down at the station.

00:32:59.792 --> 00:33:01.250
That note.

00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:03.834
What if I did leave a note?

00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:05.041
Is that a crime?

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:08.417
No. Howard. but stalking is.

00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:12.041
The only crime in this situation
is murder.

00:33:12.083 --> 00:33:16.291
The one Mac McKinnon committed.

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:18.083
I put a killer away.

00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:19.375
You're trying to get him out.

00:33:19.417 --> 00:33:20.875
Listen.

00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:22.875
I don't want you going near
Professor Winslow

00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:25.417
unless she initiates contact.

00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:27.625
Is that clear?

00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:28.792
Crystal.

00:33:28.834 --> 00:33:29.834
Good.

00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:32.083
Good Howard.

00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:33.667
Mmmhmm.

00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:36.709
[exhales]

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.959
You know I could have handled
myself there.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.041
I know. but I wanted to.

00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:45.250
Well. thank you.

00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:46.709
Let's go eat.

00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:57.792
So why do you think that Howard
would want this case left alone?

00:33:57.834 --> 00:33:58.834
Thank you.

00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:00.083
I don't know.

00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:03.250
I'd have to. you know.
look at the case file.

00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:05.667
You mean we would have to read
the case file.

00:34:05.709 --> 00:34:07.333
Is that what I mean?

00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:09.000
Yeah. I think it is.

00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:11.792
You seem to have forgotten
that I make a living

00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:14.208
off of helping people clarify
meaning. Detective.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.208
So I don't think you want to
questioned me.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.583
And I think you forgot.
Professor.

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:20.083
that I make a living off
of questioning people.

00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:21.250
[laughs]

00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:26.208
Touché. Touché.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:31.500
Uh. this is uh...
this is nice.

00:34:31.542 --> 00:34:32.667
Hey. guys.

00:34:32.709 --> 00:34:33.709
[laughs]

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:34.709
Hey. Graham.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:35.875
Hey. Dad.

00:34:35.917 --> 00:34:37.208
What're you doing here?

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.792
It looks like the three of us
had the same idea.

00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:40.750
[laughing]

00:34:40.792 --> 00:34:43.291
You guys get a table?
I'm famished.

00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:44.500
We do. actually.

00:34:44.542 --> 00:34:45.959
We just got the text
our table is ready so-

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.959
Our table's ready.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.875
We'll squeeze you in.

00:34:47.917 --> 00:34:49.625
Yeah. Ok.
Here's your purse.

00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:51.417
- The Three Musketeers.
- Thanks. Dad.

00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:52.083
Come on. hon.

00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:53.542
Uh... huh.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.875
[knocking]

00:35:00.709 --> 00:35:02.125
Amy.

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:04.083
Hey. I was just in the area
and I thought I'd stop by

00:35:04.125 --> 00:35:08.542
to see if you had thought any
more about Mac's proposal.

00:35:08.583 --> 00:35:10.583
Well. it's a fair trade.

00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:12.875
But I have some other avenues
I wanted to pursue first.

00:35:12.917 --> 00:35:14.792
So maybe we could get back to it
in a few days?

00:35:14.834 --> 00:35:15.417
Yeah.

00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:16.792
Yeah. of course.

00:35:16.834 --> 00:35:19.375
Uh. also I just wanted to talk
to you for a minute.

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:21.125
Um. I have some information

00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:23.625
I think you might find valuable
about the case.

00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:25.250
Of course. Come on in.

00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:26.542
Ok. thanks.

00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:31.208
Mmm. do I smell
fresh-brewed coffee?

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.000
You want a cup?

00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:33.417
I would love a cup. yes.

00:35:33.458 --> 00:35:34.291
Thank you.

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:35.375
Have a seat.

00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:36.041
Thanks.

00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:37.917
I'll be right back.

00:35:39.875 --> 00:35:41.500
Oh. how do you take it?

00:35:41.542 --> 00:35:44.458
Um. do you have any oat milk?

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.000
Uh. I'll check.

00:35:55.792 --> 00:35:57.291
Is almond milk ok?

00:35:58.917 --> 00:36:01.291
♪ ♪

00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:02.667
Amy?

00:36:02.709 --> 00:36:04.000
Uh. yeah. yeah.

00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:05.750
Almond milk is fine.

00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:10.166
Here you go.

00:36:10.208 --> 00:36:11.625
Thank you.

00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:14.083
I needed this.

00:36:14.125 --> 00:36:15.542
So. the case?

00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:18.250
Oh. uh. yes.
Of course.

00:36:18.291 --> 00:36:19.417
Let's see.

00:36:19.458 --> 00:36:23.583
I just wanted to stop by
and show you this.

00:36:23.625 --> 00:36:25.709
It was on my car yesterday.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.709
It's very clear that someone
doesn't want me

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.917
poking around the case.

00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:31.458
Who?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.375
I don't know.

00:36:32.417 --> 00:36:33.333
I can't be sure.

00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:34.542
I just wanted to show you this

00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:37.333
because I think that
you should be careful.

00:37:02.208 --> 00:37:06.709
Killings... professor. plural.

00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:32.291
[ringing]

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:36.417
Hey Amy. how are you?

00:37:36.458 --> 00:37:39.834
There was another murder
and it was a lot like Nicole's.

00:37:39.875 --> 00:37:40.792
There was another murder?

00:37:40.834 --> 00:37:42.291
What do you mean. a lot like?

00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:45.834
Jill Ives. this professor from
Grover College. was found-

00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:46.667
thank you.

00:37:46.709 --> 00:37:48.583
Was found dead in her home.

00:37:48.625 --> 00:37:50.166
They thought it was
a heart attack

00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:52.542
but they later on found out
it was strychnine

00:37:52.583 --> 00:37:54.500
from her essential
oils diffuser.

00:37:54.542 --> 00:37:56.458
When was this?

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.750
Five years ago.

00:37:57.792 --> 00:38:00.583
Are you thinking that Mac
is a serial killer?

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:03.000
No. No. it couldn't
have been Mac.

00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:04.583
Jill Ives was killed
the same day

00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:07.625
that Mac and I gave a lecture
together in San Francisco.

00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:11.208
Right. And she was killed
in New Windsor. Oregon.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.750
I'm reading about it right now.

00:38:12.792 --> 00:38:15.083
Travis. you have to pursue this.

00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:16.083
I'm surprised you're not driving

00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:17.667
to New Windsor yourself
right now.

00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:20.709
Well. I would be but I've got
a class to teach right now.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.750
Alright. you know what?

00:38:21.792 --> 00:38:23.166
I'm gonna call
the New Windsor P.D.

00:38:23.208 --> 00:38:24.625
I'm gonna talk to them.
ask them some questions.

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.208
and I might even head
down there.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.875
Will you just wait until my last
class and then I can join you?

00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:30.166
Thank you.

00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:31.250
I'm gonna ask you to stand down.
Professor.

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.500
I think it might be better
cop to cop

00:38:32.542 --> 00:38:34.917
but I promise I will
fill you in.

00:38:34.959 --> 00:38:37.417
Ok. well I'm gonna hold you
to that promise.

00:38:37.458 --> 00:38:39.375
I'll talk to you later.

00:38:43.291 --> 00:38:45.041
It was a few years ago but
I remember that conference.

00:38:45.083 --> 00:38:46.917
We were there.

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:48.583
So there is no way that Mac
could have done it.

00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:49.792
Wow.

00:38:49.834 --> 00:38:50.625
Same date?

00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:51.625
Yes.

00:38:51.667 --> 00:38:54.125
Did Mac or Nicole know
Jill Ives?

00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:55.667
I don't know.

00:38:55.709 --> 00:38:58.583
I think there's some old files
in storage in the basement.

00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:01.750
Probably need to check those out
as soon as I can.

00:39:01.792 --> 00:39:03.750
see if there's any connection.

00:39:15.709 --> 00:39:16.959
Detective Pool?

00:39:17.041 --> 00:39:18.083
Hey. Detective Burke?

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:18.709
Call me Travis.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:19.709
Call me Frank.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.542
Hey. thank you for meeting
me here.

00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:21.750
Yeah. of course.

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:23.667
So I wasn't able to tell you
on the phone

00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:25.041
but we lost Bill Carlyle.

00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:27.000
the detective working the case.
last year.

00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:28.333
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:30.083
There weren't many unsolved
cases on Bill's watch.

00:39:30.125 --> 00:39:31.417
but this was one.

00:39:31.458 --> 00:39:32.625
I made you a copy.

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:34.041
Thanks. Frank.

00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:36.458
So Jill Ives was 52 years old.
ruled cardiac arrest.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.875
But her daughter asked
for an autopsy.

00:39:38.917 --> 00:39:40.417
It took a few weeks
but the results proved

00:39:40.458 --> 00:39:42.583
that Ives had been poisoned.

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:43.458
Really?

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.166
That's when Bill was assigned.

00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:47.417
Fortunately Ives' home had been
pretty much untouched

00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:49.375
and Bill was able to find traces
of strychnine

00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:52.959
in the essential oils diffuser.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.500
Alright. that's good.

00:39:54.542 --> 00:39:55.875
Yeah. I've got something better.

00:39:55.917 --> 00:39:57.542
I got in touch with
Camilla Heinz-Clark.

00:39:57.583 --> 00:39:59.875
she's the chairperson
at Ives' department here

00:39:59.917 --> 00:40:01.458
and she's willing to talk.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.291
Right now?

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.166
Right now.

00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:04.041
That is good news.

00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:05.083
Let's do it.

00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:08.709
So the brilliance of what
Dorothy Sayers does

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.417
is she combines
both a detective story

00:40:12.458 --> 00:40:16.375
and a love story.
and she does so seamlessly.

00:40:16.417 --> 00:40:17.875
starting with this
opening sentence.

00:40:17.917 --> 00:40:19.375
Bud. can you read?

00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.875
“There were crimson roses
on the bench.

00:40:21.917 --> 00:40:24.000
"they looked like splashes
of blood.”

00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:24.834
Ooh. alright.

00:40:24.875 --> 00:40:25.583
And we're off.

00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:27.041
Please continue.

00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:28.917
“The judge was an old man.

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:31.792
"So old he seemed
to have outlived time

00:40:31.834 --> 00:40:35.208
"and change and death.”

00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:37.834
Professor Heinz-Clark.

00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:39.792
we appreciate you taking
the time to meet with us today.

00:40:39.834 --> 00:40:41.125
Of course.

00:40:41.166 --> 00:40:43.291
It was very upsetting.
what happened.

00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:45.750
All the more so that the killer
was never found.

00:40:45.792 --> 00:40:49.208
Well. maybe we can do something
about that.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.709
Where shall I begin?

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.834
Why don't you begin by telling
me everything you remember

00:40:53.875 --> 00:40:56.208
about that time. especially
I think pertaining to Jill?

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.500
There's no detail
that's too small.

00:40:58.542 --> 00:40:59.792
Understood.

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.500
It was a turbulent period.
even before Jill's death.

00:41:03.542 --> 00:41:05.417
It was coming up on the end
of the school year.

00:41:05.458 --> 00:41:07.709
graduation looming.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.458
Jill came to me with concerns.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.709
What were her concerns?

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.125
She believed that
one of her students

00:41:12.166 --> 00:41:14.250
was guilty of plagiarism.

00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.625
An extremely serious offence.

00:41:15.667 --> 00:41:16.667
Sure.

00:41:16.709 --> 00:41:18.333
Do you remember
the student's name?

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:21.166
Jill was reticent to say
their name but...

00:41:21.208 --> 00:41:25.458
It sounds like you might have
an idea of who it was.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.417
I thought it was Jill's
star pupil. Robby Hearst.

00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:30.834
He had a short story
about an old lawnmower

00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:33.250
that was shortlisted for the
prestigious literary quarterly.

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:34.875
"The Portal".

00:41:34.917 --> 00:41:35.583
A lawnmower?

00:41:35.625 --> 00:41:37.125
Yes. very inventive.

00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:38.458
It didn't make it
into The Portal.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.375
but it was published in our own
literary magazine.

00:41:41.417 --> 00:41:43.166
Do you have a copy of it?

00:41:43.208 --> 00:41:44.625
Follow me.

00:41:45.458 --> 00:41:47.291
It's around here somewhere.

00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:49.500
Hey. Professor. I got
a question for you.

00:41:49.542 --> 00:41:53.500
Do you know somebody by
the name of Evan McKinnon?

00:41:53.542 --> 00:41:54.500
He goes by Mac.

00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:55.542
No.

00:41:55.583 --> 00:41:57.500
How about a woman named
Nicole Ford?

00:41:57.542 --> 00:41:59.125
No. I don't believe so.

00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:00.834
How about Ella Quincy?

00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:03.041
Has a young lady named Ella
Quincy reached out to you?

00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:04.583
Uh. no.

00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:07.625
But that name rings a bell
for some reason.

00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:10.834
And um. did you or Professor
Ives ever have any dealings

00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:12.667
at Elmstead College?

00:42:12.709 --> 00:42:13.667
I didn't.

00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:16.125
I don't know about Jill.
honestly.

00:42:18.125 --> 00:42:21.500
Oh. here it is.

00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:22.125
You got it?

00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:23.000
Yeah.

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:24.834
Look at that.

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.458
So did anybody ever deal
with Robby Hearst

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.125
about the plagiarism charges?

00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:30.458
No. he wasn't a student of mine

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.375
and he graduated shortly after
Jill's death.

00:42:32.417 --> 00:42:33.667
Hmm.

00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:37.250
Ok. And this is gonna sound
like a weird question

00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:38.959
but did Jill have any enemies?

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.625
Certainly not.

00:42:40.667 --> 00:42:42.166
Jill was beloved.

00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:43.500
Ok.

00:42:43.542 --> 00:42:44.750
Thanks for this.

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:45.667
You're welcome.

00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:47.709
Thank you for your time.

00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:17.959
Ok.

00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:28.709
[door slams]

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.417
Hello?

00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:43.500
[door slam]

00:43:43.542 --> 00:43:44.458
Hello?

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.250
[crash]

00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:46.291
Ow!

00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:53.458
Hit it. Professor?

00:43:56.291 --> 00:43:57.750
What a mess.

00:43:57.792 --> 00:43:59.500
Why would somebody do this?

00:43:59.542 --> 00:44:00.834
I don't know.

00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:03.041
but maybe I'll find the answer
in here somewhere.

00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:04.333
As long as you're ok?

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.417
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:44:05.458 --> 00:44:07.375
Managed to avoid
the shelves altogether

00:44:07.417 --> 00:44:11.083
and thankfully the boxes that
did land weren't that heavy.

00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:13.000
So I found Professor McKinnon's
file box

00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:15.542
but Professor Ford's box
is gone.

00:44:15.583 --> 00:44:16.875
Are you sure?

00:44:16.917 --> 00:44:18.250
I'm the one who packed
their offices.

00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:20.917
I know where I put them.

00:44:20.959 --> 00:44:22.000
Ok.

00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:23.083
Alright.

00:44:23.125 --> 00:44:24.333
Thanks.

00:44:33.834 --> 00:44:36.375
Holy cow. Amy. that happened in
the basement of the university?

00:44:36.417 --> 00:44:37.208
- Yeah.
- Are you alright?

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.583
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:41.583
The point is whomever it was
that took Nicole's files

00:44:41.625 --> 00:44:45.500
also probably would have taken
Mac's files had I not walked in

00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:46.709
and caught him in
the middle of it.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.959
Hold on. we don't know that.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.208
I mean. Nicole's file.
maybe it just got lost.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.333
Oh. come on. Travis.

00:44:51.375 --> 00:44:53.041
It's not just a coincidence. ok?

00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:57.000
Neither is the fact
that Jill Ives and Nicole

00:44:57.041 --> 00:45:00.375
were killed in much
the same way.

00:45:00.417 --> 00:45:03.542
It makes it possible.
I'll give you that.

00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:08.959
What we're missing is something
that connects Jill and Nicole.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.625
And we got a lot of stuff
to dig through.

00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:12.834
so let's divide and conquer.

00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:15.083
Ok. ok.

00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:21.083
You know. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
once said that

00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:23.291
"it has long been an axiom
of mine

00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:26.583
"that the little things are
infinitely the most important".

00:45:26.625 --> 00:45:28.208
Well. Sir Arthur and I are
on the same page.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:29.667
[small laugh]

00:45:34.375 --> 00:45:37.166
Hmm. Here's a little
thing up front.

00:45:37.917 --> 00:45:39.458
What've you got?

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.291
They list Jill Ives' doctor but
they also list her therapist.

00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:45.208
Dwight Merrill.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:46.917
That's Nicole Ford's husband.

00:45:46.959 --> 00:45:48.625
You know. the guy
from the reading?

00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:49.875
Hold on a second.

00:45:49.917 --> 00:45:51.750
She's driving two hours
to see her therapist?

00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:54.792
No. his office is listed
in New Windsor.

00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:56.250
Oh. thank you.

00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:58.333
This guy. He's-ah.
thank you so much.

00:45:58.375 --> 00:46:02.291
Oh. I didn't realize
how hungry I was.

00:46:02.333 --> 00:46:03.250
[laughs]

00:46:03.291 --> 00:46:04.542
Look at that bite.

00:46:04.583 --> 00:46:05.917
Mmm. So good.

00:46:05.959 --> 00:46:07.333
Hey.

00:46:07.375 --> 00:46:08.959
Do you know what
we're missing right now?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.083
What?

00:46:10.125 --> 00:46:11.041
Your dad.

00:46:11.083 --> 00:46:13.417
[laughs]

00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:14.375
That is not funny.

00:46:14.417 --> 00:46:16.041
It's a little funny.

00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:29.125
[car beep]

00:46:40.917 --> 00:46:43.542
So you know that rule when
you're reading a mystery novel.

00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:44.625
never read the ending first?

00:46:44.667 --> 00:46:45.709
Yeah?

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.041
I should have read
the ending first.

00:46:47.083 --> 00:46:48.083
What?

00:46:52.333 --> 00:46:54.625
Ella Quincy went
to Grover College?

00:46:54.667 --> 00:46:56.750
She lied to you.

00:46:56.792 --> 00:47:01.208
She was a work study student
for Jill Ives in her office.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.583
Ella told me she watched
that horrible show

00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:05.125
that we watched together.

00:47:05.166 --> 00:47:06.500
Um. We Know Whodunnit.

00:47:06.542 --> 00:47:07.667
She saw it a few months ago

00:47:07.709 --> 00:47:09.625
and that lightbulb
must have went off.

00:47:09.667 --> 00:47:13.291
hey I can write a book
connecting these two murders.

00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:16.875
At any rate it's time
to talk to Ella.

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:17.917
Voicemail: Hi. you've reached
Ella Quincy.

00:47:17.959 --> 00:47:19.250
Please leave me a message.

00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:20.333
Voice mail.

00:47:20.375 --> 00:47:22.583
Hey. Ella. it's Amy Winslow.

00:47:22.625 --> 00:47:24.000
Could you just give me
a call back?

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.500
Thank you. Bye.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:32.250
Well... I need to talk
to Dwight Merrill tomorrow.

00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.500
So you're taking this seriously?

00:47:34.542 --> 00:47:37.500
Amy. I just drove to Oregon
and back.

00:47:37.542 --> 00:47:41.208
Ok. then looks like
we're talking to Dwight.

00:47:43.542 --> 00:47:45.250
You know. Travis said
it is possible

00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:47.208
that the two murders
are connected.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:48.834
Meaning the same killer.

00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:51.500
Yeah. and if true that would
mean that Mac is innocent.

00:47:51.542 --> 00:47:54.083
Exactly.

00:47:54.125 --> 00:47:55.417
Who knows?

00:47:55.458 --> 00:47:58.542
Anyway. how was
your day yesterday?

00:47:58.583 --> 00:48:00.750
Uh. are you finished-
are you finished with that?

00:48:00.792 --> 00:48:01.458
Yeah. sure.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.166
You want some help?

00:48:02.208 --> 00:48:03.000
No. no. no.

00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:04.208
Alright. thanks.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.417
So I uh. I finished
"Murder While I Smile."

00:48:08.458 --> 00:48:09.625
Blake's novel?

00:48:09.667 --> 00:48:10.750
- Yep.
- Yeah?

00:48:10.792 --> 00:48:11.875
How was it?

00:48:11.917 --> 00:48:13.500
I didn't love the ending.

00:48:13.542 --> 00:48:14.458
No?

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.417
No. he took the easy way out.

00:48:16.458 --> 00:48:17.417
Are you gonna tell him?

00:48:17.458 --> 00:48:18.333
I already did.

00:48:18.375 --> 00:48:19.500
He took copious notes.

00:48:19.542 --> 00:48:20.542
Ok. that's good.

00:48:20.583 --> 00:48:21.625
Yeah.

00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:22.500
Wanna read it?

00:48:22.542 --> 00:48:24.041
Yeah. I'd love to read it.

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.083
Okay.

00:48:25.917 --> 00:48:26.917
Thank you.

00:48:26.959 --> 00:48:27.917
Here ya go.

00:48:27.959 --> 00:48:28.667
Great.

00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:29.917
Yeah.

00:48:29.959 --> 00:48:32.125
Oh. Dad I gotta to go.
I'm late to meet Travis.

00:48:32.166 --> 00:48:33.333
Oh. ok. ok.

00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:34.041
Thank you for lunch.

00:48:34.083 --> 00:48:34.917
Okay. sweetie.

00:48:34.959 --> 00:48:36.500
- Bye.
- Have fun.

00:48:43.375 --> 00:48:44.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:48:44.667 --> 00:48:45.917
What is that?

00:48:45.959 --> 00:48:47.291
This is Howard's case file
on Nicole's murder.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:49.875
You know. the guy never even
checked Nicole's texts.

00:48:49.917 --> 00:48:51.041
or email records?

00:48:51.083 --> 00:48:51.750
Really?

00:48:51.792 --> 00:48:52.417
Yeah.

00:48:52.458 --> 00:48:53.542
You hear from Ella?

00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:56.083
Uh. no. but we can stop by
there later.

00:48:56.125 --> 00:48:57.083
Thanks.

00:48:59.041 --> 00:49:00.083
So uh-

00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:01.458
He's just over there.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.542
Uh. Dwight.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.667
Amy.

00:49:04.709 --> 00:49:05.208
Hey.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.250
Hi.

00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:07.417
My name is Detective
Travis Burke.

00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:08.959
I'm with the Garrison
Police Department.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.291
Professor Winslow here.

00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:12.417
she's been a consultant
to the police department.

00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:14.375
and I was hoping that I could
ask you a few questions

00:49:14.417 --> 00:49:17.041
about a patient of yours.

00:49:17.083 --> 00:49:19.792
Well. I'm sure you know about
doctor patient confidentiality.

00:49:19.834 --> 00:49:23.417
This one's dead. so it shouldn't
be an issue.

00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:24.959
Can we talk?

00:49:26.375 --> 00:49:27.709
So how can I help?

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:31.291
Well. uh. where were you
practising five years ago?

00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:32.583
New Windsor. Oregon. Why?

00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:36.000
Did you have a patient named
Jill Ives?

00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:37.542
Well. clearly you know I did.

00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.000
How long were you treating
her for?

00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:40.709
About three years.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.792
Until...

00:49:42.834 --> 00:49:45.208
Travis: Until she died.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.125
That's right.

00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:47.667
What were you treating her for?

00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:50.458
Depression after the death
of her husband.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.625
Do you know how she died?

00:49:53.583 --> 00:49:55.709
To be honest there was a lot
going on back then.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:57.375
and Nicole and I were
getting married.

00:49:57.417 --> 00:49:59.667
and I was working to move
my practise here.

00:49:59.709 --> 00:50:02.875
So you don't know how she died?

00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:04.792
She was poisoned
with strychnine.

00:50:04.834 --> 00:50:08.542
Somebody put it into a...

00:50:08.583 --> 00:50:10.959
- A diffuser.
- A diffuser.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.875
Bill Carlyle. a detective who
was investigating Jill's murder.

00:50:13.917 --> 00:50:15.542
he didn't mention that to you?

00:50:15.583 --> 00:50:17.041
Because Detective Carlyle

00:50:17.083 --> 00:50:20.000
told us that he did
mention it to you.

00:50:21.291 --> 00:50:24.750
Uh...

00:50:24.792 --> 00:50:29.542
Yes. actually um... yeah.
Yes. he did.

00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:32.083
And so then when the detective
was investigating

00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:35.208
your wife's murder you didn't
think to mention

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:39.500
that you'd seen a very similar
kind of killing?

00:50:39.542 --> 00:50:41.583
Mac McKinnon had been arrested
and I didn't see the point

00:50:41.625 --> 00:50:45.041
in mentioning something that
to me felt like a coincidence.

00:50:45.083 --> 00:50:47.166
Right. Because you were
getting divorced. anyway.

00:50:47.208 --> 00:50:49.291
So it's convenient. right?

00:50:50.041 --> 00:50:51.875
Detective. I realize you are
trying to provoke me

00:50:51.917 --> 00:50:54.125
but I am telling you the truth.

00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:57.333
Why did you and Nicole split up?

00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:02.041
Because she didn't
love me anymore.

00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:04.500
Anyway. if there's nothing else.

00:51:04.542 --> 00:51:07.083
I have a client that
I need to prepare for.

00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:09.083
Actually. there
is something else.

00:51:09.125 --> 00:51:11.375
You came to my dad's reading
the other night

00:51:11.417 --> 00:51:13.750
but you left before he even
got started.

00:51:13.792 --> 00:51:15.917
Why?

00:51:15.959 --> 00:51:19.166
Because I got a call
from a client in distress.

00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:21.917
I'm sorry that I missed it.

00:51:21.959 --> 00:51:24.000
Now. if there's nothing else.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.709
Well. he might have had
a client that night

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.333
but he lied to me 100 percent.

00:51:34.375 --> 00:51:35.625
Broken Nine Pins. I remember.

00:51:35.667 --> 00:51:38.333
Speaking of lying.
that was a nice bluff.

00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:40.583
Carlyle telling us
about the diffuser.

00:51:40.625 --> 00:51:42.000
Yeah.

00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:44.208
I figured he didn't know Carlyle
was no longer with us.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:47.709
Hey. was Nicole wealthy?

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.208
I didn't know much about
her financial situation.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.750
Why? Are you thinking
that could be a motive?

00:51:51.792 --> 00:51:52.625
Well. no.

00:51:52.667 --> 00:51:54.083
She wants a divorce. right?

00:51:54.125 --> 00:51:56.500
So maybe it has nothing to do
with Jill Ives' murder

00:51:56.542 --> 00:51:57.709
but maybe he thinks
it's a clever way

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.750
to bump off his wife
and not get caught.

00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:02.709
Maybe.

00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:10.917
Still no call from Ella.

00:52:16.417 --> 00:52:18.750
[knocking]

00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:25.125
[door rattles]

00:52:25.166 --> 00:52:26.667
Amy. come on.

00:52:46.083 --> 00:52:48.166
She's dead.

00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:55.125
[radio chatter]

00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:04.875
Hey.

00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:07.041
Are you ok?

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:08.625
Yeah.

00:53:08.667 --> 00:53:10.667
I just feel like maybe we should
have warned her or something.

00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:11.667
you know?

00:53:11.709 --> 00:53:13.583
Well. Amy. we're not psychics.

00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:16.291
You couldn't have known.

00:53:16.333 --> 00:53:17.667
You're right.

00:53:17.709 --> 00:53:20.792
Did you find her recorder.
notebook. anything?

00:53:20.834 --> 00:53:23.750
No. No computer. either.

00:53:23.792 --> 00:53:28.667
I did find this stuck in
the cushions of the couch.

00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:30.792
Howard's business card.

00:53:30.834 --> 00:53:33.792
Howard did tell us that he was
doing private security

00:53:33.834 --> 00:53:36.834
but I never saw him
give her a card.

00:53:36.875 --> 00:53:38.041
No?

00:53:38.083 --> 00:53:39.667
I'm gonna have to have
a conversation with him

00:53:39.709 --> 00:53:41.709
after we canvass
the neighbourhood.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.041
Ok.

00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:48.208
I have an early class tomorrow
so I'll just talk to you after.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.625
Of course.

00:53:49.667 --> 00:53:51.583
Goodnight.

00:53:51.625 --> 00:53:53.500
Goodnight. Amy.

00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:57.125
Thank you.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.333
[knocking]

00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:10.583
Oh. hey Blake. come on in.

00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:12.250
I just wanted to say
how much I appreciate

00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:14.083
your dad reading
"Murder While I Smile".

00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:16.709
Oh. yeah. well he's
pretty great.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.500
His feedback was invaluable.

00:54:18.542 --> 00:54:19.834
Good.

00:54:19.875 --> 00:54:24.000
Oh. speaking of which.
he passed this along to me.

00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:26.625
So I'd be happy to give you
my feedback if you'd like.

00:54:26.667 --> 00:54:27.625
That'd be amazing.

00:54:27.667 --> 00:54:28.333
Yeah?

00:54:28.375 --> 00:54:29.875
Alright. great.

00:54:29.917 --> 00:54:31.834
Listen. uh. I have a class to go
to now but I'll be in touch.

00:54:31.875 --> 00:54:32.750
- Ok.
- Ok.

00:54:32.792 --> 00:54:33.458
Thanks again.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.583
Bye. Have a good day.

00:54:39.917 --> 00:54:41.917
Amy. hey.

00:54:41.959 --> 00:54:43.166
Oh. hey.

00:54:43.208 --> 00:54:44.917
Hey. I need to talk to you
about Ella Quincy.

00:54:44.959 --> 00:54:46.500
Ok. what about her?

00:54:46.542 --> 00:54:49.083
I met up with her yesterday and
she asked me several questions

00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:50.875
about Mac and Nicole.

00:54:50.917 --> 00:54:52.583
And about you.

00:54:52.625 --> 00:54:53.750
About me?

00:54:53.792 --> 00:54:55.250
What-what about me?

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.291
She wanted to know
if she could trust you.

00:54:57.333 --> 00:55:00.834
I said yes and then I left.

00:55:00.875 --> 00:55:05.125
Hey. Bud. I think we need to
call Travis and tell him this.

00:55:05.166 --> 00:55:06.834
Why?

00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:13.000
Because Travis and I found Ella
last night and um...

00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:15.667
she had been killed.

00:55:15.709 --> 00:55:17.417
What?

00:55:25.542 --> 00:55:27.291
[doorbell rings]

00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:34.375
I already bought my Girl Scout
cookies for the season.

00:55:34.417 --> 00:55:36.166
That's very funny.

00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:37.917
Hey. where were you last night?

00:55:37.959 --> 00:55:39.166
Here. watching basketball.

00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:40.625
Can anybody verify that?

00:55:40.667 --> 00:55:42.333
I live alone.

00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.041
Let me ask you this.

00:55:44.083 --> 00:55:46.875
Where was the last time
you saw Ella Quincy?

00:55:46.917 --> 00:55:48.083
Here.

00:55:48.125 --> 00:55:50.000
And her pal. the professor.
was with her.

00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:50.959
See. that's interesting.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.041
because then it makes me wonder

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.333
when you gave her
your business card.

00:55:56.375 --> 00:55:57.709
Fine.

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.750
She called me a couple
nights ago. invited me over.

00:55:59.792 --> 00:56:02.250
Said she was interested
in hiring me as security.

00:56:02.291 --> 00:56:03.417
Did she tell you why?

00:56:03.458 --> 00:56:05.000
No.

00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:08.458
When I got there to talk money
she was quickly uninterested.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.917
And so you didn't see her
last night?

00:56:11.959 --> 00:56:13.500
Why?

00:56:13.542 --> 00:56:15.917
What's going on. Burke?

00:56:15.959 --> 00:56:20.500
Ella Quincy was murdered
last night.

00:56:20.542 --> 00:56:23.875
What. are you trying
to put that on me?

00:56:23.917 --> 00:56:26.250
You want to talk to me again.

00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:28.125
you'll do it with
my attorney present.

00:56:28.166 --> 00:56:29.792
Have a good day.

00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:39.792
So Michael Chabon is weaving
together an alternate history.

00:56:39.834 --> 00:56:43.000
One of religious meditation
and a who done it

00:56:43.041 --> 00:56:48.250
in this amazing book The
Yiddish Policeman's Union.

00:56:48.291 --> 00:56:49.458
Union.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.625
But the word "union"
is definitely a pun

00:56:51.667 --> 00:56:53.709
because I think that at
the heart of this story

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.834
it's really just about
a marriage.

00:56:58.333 --> 00:57:00.959
Alright. everybody.
have a good day.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Bud?

00:57:02.041 --> 00:57:03.083
- Just.
- Yeah.

00:57:03.125 --> 00:57:03.959
Ok.

00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:06.041
Hey.

00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:08.000
So the coroner just called me.

00:57:08.041 --> 00:57:11.083
Ella was strangled sometime
between 7:00 and 8:00.

00:57:11.125 --> 00:57:14.250
And Bud left her sometime
around 5:30.

00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:15.625
Did you talk to Howard Clawson?

00:57:15.667 --> 00:57:16.709
Yeah. I did.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.166
He said he saw her
the night before.

00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:20.041
She was interested in hiring
him for private security.

00:57:20.083 --> 00:57:21.125
And you believe him?

00:57:21.166 --> 00:57:23.542
I want to. I'm just-
I'm not sure.

00:57:23.583 --> 00:57:25.750
Hey. Bud. come here for a sec.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.834
Can I ask you to recount your
conversation with Ella for me?

00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:33.542
Yeah. She asked me a lot of
questions about Mac and Nicole.

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.333
Yeah? What kind of questions?

00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:37.208
She wanted to know how well
I knew them.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.750
not very well.

00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.750
Did I see their big fight
about the Twain papers?

00:57:41.792 --> 00:57:43.250
I said yes.

00:57:43.291 --> 00:57:45.875
And then did I suspect that
they were having an affair?

00:57:45.917 --> 00:57:46.917
What?

00:57:46.959 --> 00:57:48.291
Yeah. I thought
that was weird. too.

00:57:48.333 --> 00:57:49.333
She didn't ask me that.

00:57:49.375 --> 00:57:50.458
Alright. what else?

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.500
Then she asked me questions
about Amy

00:57:52.542 --> 00:57:55.125
and whether or not I thought
you could keep a secret.

00:57:55.166 --> 00:57:57.291
I said so long as you knew it
wasn't going to hurt anyone else

00:57:57.333 --> 00:57:58.125
then of course.

00:57:58.166 --> 00:57:58.792
That's it?

00:57:58.834 --> 00:57:59.959
Yeah.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Alright. Thank you
for that information.

00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:02.208
Thanks. Bud.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.542
Hey. Were you able to go through
Mac's files?

00:58:04.583 --> 00:58:08.542
No. I've been so busy I haven't
even had a chance.

00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:15.667
[laughs]

00:58:15.709 --> 00:58:17.375
What?

00:58:17.417 --> 00:58:20.625
You were a very good student.
weren't you?

00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:24.625
Well. I did go into education
as my profession. so...

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:25.917
Let me ask you something.

00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:27.125
Hmm?

00:58:27.166 --> 00:58:30.959
How many times were you
on the Dean's List?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.458
What?

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.500
No. seriously.
I'd like to know.

00:58:35.542 --> 00:58:37.041
What. in undergrad?

00:58:37.083 --> 00:58:37.875
[laughs]

00:58:37.917 --> 00:58:38.917
Sure.

00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:39.542
I don't know.

00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:41.250
- Eight.
- Eight?

00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:44.417
So two semesters. four years...

00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:46.583
That is every semester.

00:58:46.625 --> 00:58:48.041
You're gonna tease me
about that now?

00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:51.709
No. I'm gonna file that away
and tease you later.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:52.959
[laughs]
Of course you would.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
[laughs]

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.750
You're a very distracting study
partner. you know that?

00:59:06.792 --> 00:59:08.166
I'm sorry.

00:59:08.208 --> 00:59:09.417
I'm not trying to be.

00:59:09.458 --> 00:59:11.083
No?

00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:13.500
Well. if we're supposed
to get through all of this
then it's...

00:59:14.709 --> 00:59:15.875
Hold on.

00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:19.834
- What's that?
- What's going on?

00:59:19.875 --> 00:59:21.333
What'd you find?

00:59:21.375 --> 00:59:22.500
The pages are...

00:59:22.542 --> 00:59:24.625
It's almost like they were
glued together.

00:59:24.667 --> 00:59:26.959
Here. Does this help you?

00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:28.542
Oh. thank you.

00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:30.750
Let's see.

00:59:30.792 --> 00:59:35.458
Why would these pages be
like this?

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.917
That's Mac's journal?

00:59:36.959 --> 00:59:38.709
Yeah.

00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:41.291
Why would that be?

00:59:43.834 --> 00:59:45.333
Bingo.

00:59:47.792 --> 00:59:50.208
Yeah. that's Mac and Nicole.

00:59:52.458 --> 00:59:55.458
Looks like we gotta take a trip
to the prison.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.500
Yep.

01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:05.834
"He watched the crime scene
from a distance with a smile."

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.125
Wait here.

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:12.125
Oh. I think I'm going to have
some good feedback for him.

01:00:12.166 --> 01:00:14.542
You're a good reader.
You take after your dad.

01:00:14.583 --> 01:00:15.667
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:15.709 --> 01:00:16.875
Well. thank you.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:18.166
[chuckles]

01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:23.625
[buzzer]

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.458
Hey Mac.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.875
So this is Detective Travis
Burke who I told you about.

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.500
Mac: It's nice to meet you.
Detective.

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:32.750
So how can I help you?

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:36.083
Well. I guess we can start
by telling us

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:40.291
about your relationship
with Nicole.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.417
Right.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.750
Nicole and I were in love.

01:00:50.792 --> 01:00:53.000
It started innocent.

01:00:53.041 --> 01:00:56.083
Then we realized it was
something more.

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:57.792
We discussed divorcing
our spouses.

01:00:57.834 --> 01:00:59.250
She told Dwight.

01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:01.959
I waffled on telling Linda.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.542
And then one day Nicole
gave me an ultimatum.

01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:10.000
She says if I don't tell Linda
that she would.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:13.000
We had this terrible fight.
which you saw. Amy.

01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:15.250
I thought that fight was
over the Huck Finn chapters.

01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:16.583
No.

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.667
I made it up on the spot
so people wouldn't suspect

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.500
what the fight was really about.

01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:25.291
I had no idea that it was gonna
come back and ruin my life.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:26.875
Why didn't you tell
Detective Clawson

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:28.500
about your relationship
with Nicole?

01:01:28.542 --> 01:01:31.667
Because he would have used it
as proof that I wanted her dead.

01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:36.083
saying that the fight was over
her wanting to break it off.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.291
Why should we believe
that it wasn't?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.417
You can ask Linda.

01:01:41.458 --> 01:01:43.250
I told her the truth.

01:01:43.291 --> 01:01:45.333
When did you tell her?

01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:47.333
After the conviction.

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:50.917
So that's why she doesn't
come here and see you anymore.

01:01:50.959 --> 01:01:52.208
Yeah.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.917
Do you know a woman named
Jill Ives?

01:01:54.959 --> 01:01:56.834
Not that I recall.

01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:57.959
Is she a student?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.250
No. she was a teacher.
Grover College.

01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:01.959
She was murdered five years ago.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.500
She was poisoned very similarly
to the way that Nicole was.

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:06.375
Five years ago?

01:02:06.417 --> 01:02:07.250
Yeah.

01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:09.458
What did she teach?

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.166
Creative writing.

01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:14.333
Like Nicole.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.583
[deep sigh]

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:32.625
So Nicole and Dwight
were divorcing over Mac.

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.458
Linda told me
that the four of them

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.834
used to do dinners together.

01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:37.875
Are you thinking that Linda
and Dwight both knew

01:02:37.917 --> 01:02:41.583
about their spouses?

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.625
If they did it would be a strong
motive for murder.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.917
Are you reopening the case.
Detective?

01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:52.291
We're not reopening.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:56.083
we're just um... we're
taking a second look.

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:58.041
Your husband told us something
very interesting.

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:00.250
He said that he was in love
with Nicole Ford

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:03.583
and he said that he told you.

01:03:03.625 --> 01:03:05.750
But did you already know that?

01:03:05.792 --> 01:03:09.583
I... I may have suspected
something. but-

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.125
The night of the murder you
said you were at Sky Mountain.

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:13.959
That's 20 minutes away.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.250
Is there anybody
that can verify that?

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.875
Didn't the detective
at the time do that?

01:03:17.917 --> 01:03:19.917
You know that he didn't.

01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:22.750
See. he didn't even consider
you as a suspect.

01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:24.083
Is that what you're doing?

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:25.667
Jealousy?

01:03:25.709 --> 01:03:27.417
It is a very powerful motive.

01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:29.250
You knew Nicole's house.

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:32.208
It would be so easy for you to
plant evidence on your husband.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:36.208
make him take the fall
for breaking your heart.

01:03:38.959 --> 01:03:42.625
So. am I under arrest?

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.542
No.

01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:48.000
Then I think this conversation
is over.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.000
Goodbye.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:50.542
Yeah.

01:03:50.959 --> 01:03:52.375
Thank you for your time.

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:00.208
I have an idea.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.458
You have an idea?

01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:03.834
Yeah.

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:14.458
You really think she's gonna
do something?

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.792
I have a hunch.

01:04:16.834 --> 01:04:19.208
Hmm.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.041
[sighs]

01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:24.834
What's the longest you've ever
sat in a car on a stake out?

01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:26.208
You don't wanna know.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:28.959
Well. actually I do wanna know.
that's why I asked.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.750
Eighteen and a half hours.

01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:33.166
During one shift?

01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:34.083
Yeah.

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:37.166
What for?

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:39.208
There were four murders.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.709
It was a serial killer.
We called him "The Wolfman"

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:44.500
because he only killed
during the full moon.

01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:47.250
And we finally got a lead
on who we thought it was

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:49.375
and so we parked out
in front of his house

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:52.333
and we sat there all day
and into the night.

01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:53.291
Did you catch him?

01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:54.583
Yeah.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:56.291
We trailed him to his next kill
and we were able

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:58.500
to stop him before he went
through with it.

01:04:58.542 --> 01:05:00.375
Wow.

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:03.542
I bet you always remembered
that day. huh?

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:06.625
Yeah. but for very
different reasons.

01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:09.500
Um. when I came home my wife
had divorce papers

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:14.875
waiting for me on
the kitchen table.

01:05:14.917 --> 01:05:17.250
I'm sorry.

01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:19.291
Divorce is ugly. Amy.

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:22.917
It's like my whole life
I was used to winning

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:25.500
and then all of a sudden I felt
like I lost. you know?

01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:28.166
I failed.

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:30.500
And that feeling. you know.
it stains you

01:05:30.542 --> 01:05:32.792
and I feel like I'm gonna drag
that into my...

01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:35.750
Here she comes.

01:06:21.166 --> 01:06:23.792
Travis. this is
Nicole Ford's house.

01:06:25.417 --> 01:06:26.375
Are you ok?

01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:27.667
No.

01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:35.208
Look at this.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:37.667
You wanna talk at the station
or in your house?

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:42.709
Here's where I'm confused.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.291
What is the nature
of your relationship?

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:47.208
Linda and I are just friends.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.583
So you randomly go and run
and visit your friend

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:52.208
right after we talk to you?

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:54.333
Dwight and I were both
at Sky Mountain

01:06:54.375 --> 01:06:56.417
the night Nicole was killed.

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:58.083
You said that you were
with your brother.

01:06:58.125 --> 01:06:59.875
He verified that alibi.

01:06:59.917 --> 01:07:02.625
I lied. My brother covered
for me.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:03.959
Dwight.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.375
You know that it's illegal
to lie to a cop. right?

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.166
And it's illegal to withhold
information.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:10.959
Look. Linda was just protecting
my anonymity.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.959
I wasn't there for yoga.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.083
The retreat was for people
with substance abuse issues.

01:07:18.125 --> 01:07:20.250
Same goes for Dwight.

01:07:20.291 --> 01:07:24.333
I was concerned with destroying
my reputation.

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:27.041
Well. can anybody prove
that you two were there?

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:28.417
Well. unfortunately I paid cash

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.750
but of course Linda's
verified it.

01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:32.625
It's convenient that you're both
each other's alibis

01:07:32.667 --> 01:07:36.125
for the night that your wife
was murdered by your husband.

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:37.500
I can also put you in touch

01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:39.667
with the addiction counsellor
on staff.

01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:43.250
Why were you at my dad's
book signing?

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.500
I told you.

01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:46.291
Yeah. but you lied to me.

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.709
Because Broken Nine Pins?
I made that up.

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:50.458
That's not a real book title.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.709
And all of your books over here.
they're so nicely alphabetized.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:58.083
The W's go from Wells to Wolf.

01:07:58.125 --> 01:07:59.709
There's no Winslow.

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:02.125
No Winslow here.

01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:03.166
Anywhere.

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:08.125
That's clever.

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:11.083
Alright. I was there to see Ella
Quincy to try and dissuade her

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:13.083
from writing the book.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.125
Why?

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.250
Answer the question.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.417
Why? Did you walk to her?

01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:21.250
I left her messages but
she hasn't called me back yet.

01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:24.834
Where were you last night
between 7:00 and 8:00?

01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:26.250
I was here. why?

01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:29.667
Because that's the time
that Ella Quincy was murdered.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.458
So Linda and Dwight
are now on the board.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.959
Do you really think
that Linda and Dwight

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.417
are in on it together?

01:08:39.458 --> 01:08:42.417
Well. I think I'm gonna do
some digging at Sky Mountain

01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:44.333
and find some former employees
and see if Linda and Dwight

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:46.625
were there the night
they said they were.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:48.709
What about you?
What're you gonna do?

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.375
I am...

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:54.000
I'm gonna go home
and recharge my brain.

01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:54.917
The little grey cells?

01:08:54.959 --> 01:08:56.834
Yes. my little grey cells.

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:59.875
I have an early class
to teach tomorrow. so.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:01.291
Well. I wanna make sure
you get home safe

01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:04.125
so call me when you get home.

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.166
Goodnight. Amy.

01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:06.375
Bye.

01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:33.500
Oh. come on.

01:09:44.375 --> 01:09:45.458
Hi. Amy.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.583
Got a minute?

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:47.792
Are you following me again?

01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:49.917
I'd like to talk to you.

01:09:49.959 --> 01:09:50.875
Get in the car.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:51.875
Get your hand off me!

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:52.458
Howard!

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:53.333
Let go of her. Howard!

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:54.208
Come on. Travis.

01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:56.333
Hey. you forgot your phone.
Are you ok?

01:09:56.375 --> 01:09:57.709
Yeah. I'm ok.

01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:00.041
What're you doing. Howard?

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:07.625
Howard.

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:09.000
Lawyer.

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:12.667
Alright. Tell me. why-
why were you after Amy?

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:13.959
Lawyer.

01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:22.208
Howard. do you really wanna
spend the night in a cell?

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:23.625
Lawyer.

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:26.250
Alright.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:28.041
Have it your way.

01:10:39.917 --> 01:10:42.500
Alright. So. Howard
is lawyering up.

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.166
You know. he'd rather spend
the night in the same jail

01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:45.834
he used to lock people up in.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.041
[knocking]

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:48.291
Travis.

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:49.000
Hi.

01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:50.375
Oh. hey.

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:52.000
Amy. this is Maria. she's our
new forensics tech.

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:52.875
Hi.

01:10:52.917 --> 01:10:54.375
Amy Winslow?

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.166
Yeah.

01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:56.166
Ah.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.041
Travis is always talking
about you.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:59.542
I'm always talking about her?

01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:01.875
I mentioned her like once
or twice.

01:11:01.917 --> 01:11:04.834
Ok. I get the odd mention. huh?

01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:08.208
Alright. alright.
what've you got?

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.291
Show me.

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:11.000
DNA from your
victim's fingernails.

01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:12.583
Skin and blood.

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:14.959
She tagged the killer
but no match in the system

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.875
so it's not a prior offender.

01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:18.500
Alright. this is really
good work. Maria.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.208
Nice to meet you.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.834
Good to meet you.

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:20.834
And thank you.

01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:21.917
Mmmhmm.

01:11:23.709 --> 01:11:25.375
Alright. so?

01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:27.000
What do you think?

01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:32.000
Well. I was just trying
to step back

01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:34.542
and take it all in. you know?

01:11:34.583 --> 01:11:35.959
Ok.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.375
We have Jill. Nicole. and Ella.
and we've been trying

01:11:39.417 --> 01:11:42.000
to find the link between these
three different chapters. right?

01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:44.125
What makes the novel?

01:11:45.166 --> 01:11:46.083
[laughs]

01:11:46.125 --> 01:11:48.000
And oddly enough I think I just-

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:49.542
I'm figuring it out.

01:11:50.792 --> 01:11:53.000
That's... that's the link.

01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:53.917
You lost me.

01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:55.291
Literature.

01:11:55.333 --> 01:11:58.750
That's the link that connects
these three murders.

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:00.667
Just stay with me. alright?

01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:03.375
Ok. we have Jill Ives. a
creative writing professor.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:06.667
who had an issue with
a plagiarizing student.

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:10.875
Then we have Nicole Ford. also
a creative writing professor.

01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:14.500
who lost her life over
some chapters in a book.

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:17.583
Then there's Ella. a budding
writer who I think

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:20.458
was gonna write a book that
connects these two murders.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.917
I mean. no wonder she didn't
wanna tell us all the details

01:12:22.959 --> 01:12:25.417
because she wanted to pursue
it herself

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:28.625
and name the killer in her book.

01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:30.500
I mean. think about it.

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:33.000
It's a massive best-seller.

01:12:33.041 --> 01:12:35.375
Ok. I'm with you.

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.583
So?

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:40.625
Well. so I think that we need
to go back

01:12:40.667 --> 01:12:44.333
and do what any great literary
scholar would do.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:45.709
Go back to the source material.

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:46.750
The case books?

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:47.792
Yeah.

01:12:47.834 --> 01:12:49.041
Amy. we went through
those already.

01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.542
I know that. I know that.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.792
But we need to go back again.
see if we missed anything.

01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:55.834
See if there's anything more
that these three women

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:57.542
have in common.

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:58.750
Especially Jill and Nicole.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:00.375
I want to go back
in their biographies

01:13:00.417 --> 01:13:03.250
and see if anything overlaps.

01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:04.417
Well. we got work to do.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.458
Mmm.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:10.542
Hold on.

01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:11.750
Did you see this?

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:13.125
Mmm.

01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:15.542
Nicole Ford was an associate
editor of The Portal.

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:17.458
that fancy literary magazine.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.500
Yeah. I know the magazine.
but that's not in her bio.

01:13:21.542 --> 01:13:23.000
I know.

01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:25.000
I looked up a list of people
who worked on the magazine.

01:13:25.041 --> 01:13:25.750
The Masthead.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.250
Right.

01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:30.709
Well. this is from a few years
ago and she's on the list.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:33.458
Ok. well I think the bigger
question is did she hold

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.625
that position five years ago
when Jill Ives' star student

01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:40.083
submitted that story about
the lawnmower?

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:40.834
What was his name?

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:41.709
"The Cuttings".

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.375
"The Cuttings".

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:43.458
By Robby Hearst.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.709
Right.

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:49.083
Huh.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.250
This is actually pretty good.

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.625
Camilla was right.

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:53.834
You can tell that it's good
in like five seconds?

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:56.667
Well. I mean. a strong
first paragraph

01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:58.583
is usually a promising sign.

01:13:58.625 --> 01:14:02.667
Ok. so Nicole Ford was on
the Masthead five years ago.

01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:05.125
So she could have read this.
Let's mine that connection.

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:06.041
I've got a question for you.

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:07.542
Yeah?

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:10.667
Do you think that Robby Hearst
went to Elmstead College?

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:12.375
I can check.

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.041
Log into my faculty access.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.875
Alright. look up Robert Hearst.
too.

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:17.291
Yeah. I'm on it.

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:24.500
There was one. but he graduated
in 1962.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:25.208
Hmm.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.875
No.

01:14:25.917 --> 01:14:26.709
Not our guy.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.250
There's not been one since.

01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:29.458
I'm gonna run down Robby Hearst

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.125
through the official channels.

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.917
Let's see what we got.

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:43.166
What?

01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:46.125
Travis. I think I know
who the murderer is.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.875
[phone ringing]

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:53.083
Hello?

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:54.083
Well. hello. Detective Burke.

01:14:54.125 --> 01:14:55.959
How can I help you?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.542
[knocking]

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:01.041
Detective. Amy.

01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:02.875
As you can see I haven't
left town.

01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:05.083
Hey. can we come in?

01:15:06.875 --> 01:15:08.875
It's right through here.

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:20.083
Travis. Amy.

01:15:20.125 --> 01:15:20.834
How's it going?

01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:22.291
Hey. Blake.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:24.166
I need to see your security
camera footage

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:26.709
from the night of
Graham's reading.

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:33.834
I think that one of the people
on it is a murderer.

01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:39.083
Guys. can I ask
what this is about?

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:41.208
You remember the lady
that you met that night.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:42.917
Ella Quincy?

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:44.709
Uh. yeah. Sure.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.583
Yeah. well we just wanna see
a piece of that conversation

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.750
that you had with her
right after the reading.

01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:49.959
More specifically.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
right when I introduced you two

01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:53.500
she made that comment
about your name

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:55.041
and then you gave her
your number.

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:55.834
Do you remember that?

01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:56.500
Mmmhmm.

01:15:56.542 --> 01:15:57.583
Yeah. ok.

01:15:57.625 --> 01:16:00.083
If you could just pull
that moment up.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:04.417
Keep going. keep going.
keep going... and freeze.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:05.667
Ooh. that's a good angle.

01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:07.667
Could you zoom in on that?

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:09.834
Uh. I'm not sure I can.

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:12.000
Oh. here. I can do it.

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:18.250
Like that.

01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:19.083
Perfect.

01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:20.458
Great. thank you.

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.458
Blake. could you read
that for me?

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.667
"Don't say anything.
Let's talk.

01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:28.417
"We'll make it worth it."

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.792
Speaking of things
that you've written.

01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:36.083
I finished your manuscript.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:37.834
Here you go. you can have
that back.

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:41.291
And you know what's funny
is when I was reading it.

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:46.458
it reminded me of something else
I had read. right here.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.291
"The Cuttings" by Robby Hearst.

01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:50.917
this brilliant undergraduate.

01:16:50.959 --> 01:16:53.083
and he submitted it
to The Portal.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:55.333
It's this literary magazine.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:56.750
And then it came to me.

01:16:56.792 --> 01:16:57.959
Look what she did here.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.458
"Murder While I Smile".
And watch this.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.125
That's you and that's you.

01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:06.875
Look. I don't know what you
think you figured out here-

01:17:06.917 --> 01:17:09.500
Since Robby Hearst was known
for plagiarizing.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.375
we thought we'd see if
"The Cutting"

01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:12.709
had appeared elsewhere first.

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:14.917
Yeah. And guess what?

01:17:14.959 --> 01:17:18.083
He just ripped words right off
the page of a 19th century

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:20.458
short story written
by Edwin Bowles.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.083
Which unfortunately
is out of print now.

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:23.291
Yeah.

01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:26.041
However. guess
where we found it?

01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:27.625
I'll go check right away.
Detective.

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.667
Grover College library.

01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:31.875
Professor Heinz-Clark helped us.

01:17:31.917 --> 01:17:33.959
You remember her. Robby?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.959
Guys. I think you're
confused here.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:37.792
I'm Blake.

01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:38.667
I'm not confused.

01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:39.625
Does that say Blake?

01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:40.458
No. it doesn't.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.959
It says Robert Hearst.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.583
Driver's license from the state
of Montana issued to you.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:46.875
son of Walker Hearst.

01:17:46.917 --> 01:17:49.166
shortlisted twice
for the Pulitzer.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:50.542
Yeah. here's one of his books.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.291
It's actually really good.

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:54.875
And you know. it can be
challenging being a child

01:17:54.917 --> 01:17:58.542
of a successful writer.
trust me. I know.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:00.333
You know. I'm just interested.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.959
How did you explain to your
father the name change?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.041
Did you just tell him
that you wanted to get out

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:06.500
from underneath his shadow?

01:18:06.542 --> 01:18:08.625
I don't really get involved
with psychological stuff.

01:18:08.667 --> 01:18:11.542
What I care about is the fact
that you changed your name

01:18:11.583 --> 01:18:14.041
two weeks after you graduated
from Grover College

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:15.667
after you killed Jill Ives.

01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:18.667
And then you came to Elmstead
as Blake Newman and everything

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:26.000
was perfect until you submitted
"Green Blades" to Nicole Ford.

01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:27.875
Now Nicole had this habit
of scanning

01:18:27.917 --> 01:18:30.500
all of her students' work.

01:18:30.542 --> 01:18:32.500
Amy: We spent hours over
at Nicole's home office

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:35.625
going through paperwork
from that semester.

01:18:35.667 --> 01:18:39.709
The only thing physically
missing was your writing.

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:46.166
More specifically this one.
"Green Blades".

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:49.000
You submitted it to Nicole
Ford and this is what she wrote.

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:51.834
"I know this. it was a portal
submission through Jill Ives."

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:54.625
Now. Nicole knew this was
plagiarized. right?

01:18:54.667 --> 01:18:56.083
And she confronted you about it.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:57.250
This is insane.

01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.583
Is that what you told her?

01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:01.959
But she didn't believe you
so you had to act.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
But this time you didn't copy
a story.

01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:05.875
you copied a murder.

01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:07.542
And you couldn't leave
it unsolved.

01:19:07.583 --> 01:19:10.875
but lucky for you. you had
someone to take the fall.

01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:12.041
Yeah. poor Mac.

01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.709
Yeah. poor Mac.

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.959
You know. we spoke to your
physical therapist. Linda.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.125
earlier this morning.

01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:22.625
And she did confirm that you
were there the day before

01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:25.625
Nicole's murder.
which was brilliant

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:30.417
because you had direct access
to Mac's safe.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:32.709
And then you dropped out
of Elmstead.

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:35.041
You came here. got a job.
wrote your book. sold it.

01:19:35.083 --> 01:19:37.792
I mean. you were on the brink
of success.

01:19:37.834 --> 01:19:40.250
Yeah. but then Ella Quincy
showed up.

01:19:40.291 --> 01:19:42.250
She was a Grover College
graduate.

01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.542
she was a work study student
under Jill Ives.

01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:45.709
She recognized you.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.291
Mmmhmm.

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:48.834
So you told her that you were
gonna pay her off.

01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:51.291
Great. thanks.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.083
But instead you killed her.

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:55.250
[chuckles]

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.125
Seriously?

01:19:57.166 --> 01:20:00.000
Well. that is quite a story.

01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:04.125
If you don't mind I might even
borrow some of it

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.458
for my next book.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.583
And when I do write it I'll make
sure my detective character

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:12.583
has actual proof.

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:16.041
But we got a warrant to search
your apartment this morning

01:20:16.083 --> 01:20:17.625
and that sweet little landlady
of yours.

01:20:17.667 --> 01:20:18.583
she let us in.

01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:20.375
Guess what we found?

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:22.750
Boom.

01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:25.834
Amy: All the original
paperwork stolen

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:29.125
from Nicole's home office.

01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:31.583
And these could have only
been taken at the time

01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:32.792
she was murdered.

01:20:32.834 --> 01:20:34.000
As far as Ella Quincy's
concerned.

01:20:34.041 --> 01:20:36.667
you know that she scratched
her aggressor?

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:42.583
She got some of his DNA
under her fingernails.

01:20:42.625 --> 01:20:46.125
Which I think we're going
to match to yours shortly

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:47.875
down at the station.

01:20:48.959 --> 01:20:49.959
Travis!

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.291
[groans]

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.917
Blake! Stop!

01:21:06.083 --> 01:21:07.709
Easy. Detective.

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:09.208
You wanna add assaulting
an officer?

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:10.250
Shut up.

01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:11.709
You don't understand.

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.750
You're gonna have to do this.

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:22.083
This is a glock 19 pointed
at the base of your neck.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:27.834
And if I were you I would
drop those scissors.

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:37.000
[groans]

01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:41.458
[choking]

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.667
Stop!

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:48.583
[gasping]

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:51.083
Stop.

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:53.375
[gasping]

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:04.125
For what it's worth you were
right about my dad.

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:06.625
Dad's illness changed
everything.

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:09.667
It's how I ended up taking
shortcuts with my writing.

01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:12.125
It took over my life.

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:17.458
Starting with who I was
and what I was willing to do.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.500
Watch your head. Blake.

01:22:20.959 --> 01:22:22.417
Hey.

01:22:22.458 --> 01:22:23.500
Oh.

01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:38.458
[message alert]

01:22:38.792 --> 01:22:40.000
Sorry. Amy.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:45.166
It's Detective Clawson.
He wants to talk to us.

01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:45.917
Ok.

01:22:45.959 --> 01:22:47.375
He's been released.

01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:54.667
Hey. Howard.

01:22:55.959 --> 01:23:01.083
Look. you know. when
I caught the Ford case

01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:03.208
I took what was handed to me.

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.625
Didn't ask questions.

01:23:05.667 --> 01:23:07.750
But you do.

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:10.625
I panicked.

01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:12.792
Wrote that stupid note.

01:23:12.834 --> 01:23:14.041
Threatened you.

01:23:15.959 --> 01:23:19.375
I'll be going to see
Mac McKinnon.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:22.542
I don't know what else to say
but I'm sorry.

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:26.750
And thank you for getting
it right.

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:31.625
All's well that ends well.

01:23:31.667 --> 01:23:32.709
Take care.

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:34.458
Yeah. you too.

01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:37.667
Well.

01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:38.542
Coffee?

01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:39.583
Yeah.

01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:45.667
I never imagined that I'd be
getting my life back

01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:49.000
in a couple weeks.

01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:51.625
So you know how grateful
I am to you.

01:23:51.667 --> 01:23:54.208
It was a team effort.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:55.250
Yeah.

01:23:56.875 --> 01:24:00.792
You and Travis. you make
a great team.

01:24:00.834 --> 01:24:02.834
I'd stick with him
if I were you.

01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:07.792
Yeah.

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:10.500

Yeah. my pleasure.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:28.875
Oh. my dad's just landing in
New York for the book tour.

01:24:28.917 --> 01:24:30.583
Ah. is that why he didn't
join us?

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:31.834
[laughs]

01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:34.166
That's awful but yes.
that's so true.
