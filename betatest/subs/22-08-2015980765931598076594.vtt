You dare to wage war against China?

11
00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:02.918
Do you think you could win?

12
00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:06.082
Then you really think China could win

13
00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:11.834

United States and Japan?

16

To offer you a choice.

17
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.582
Kagemusha on Senkaku?

18
00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:41.250

The U.S. Department of Defense

21
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.166
called us to join the Senkaku exercises

22
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.166
as a member of the
tripartite alliance. sir.

23
00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:09.998
It's always been a U.S.-Japan
exercise. Why ask us to suddenly join?

24
00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.750
That's what I said. sir.

25
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.542
But they said circumstances
changed and we can't have everything.

26
00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:21.582
They asked so blatantly. sir.

27
00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:27.250
But the peace talks are coming up...

28
00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:31.374
Minister.

29
00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:37.834
Let's say it's too short of a notice
and that we can't join this time.

30
00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:40.834
Yes. Mr. President.

31
00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:49.082
You had a briefing for me on Dokdo?

32
00:04:49.334 --> 00:04:50.414
Yes. sir.

33
00:04:50.677 --> 00:04:53.137
It's a growing situation.

34
00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:56.706
You must be informed. sir.

35
00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.834
Let's talk inside.

36
00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:01.767
<i>Case Report on Dokdo</i>

37
00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:05.290
A month ago. on June 25th to be exact.

38
00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:10.414
a Coast Guard patrol vessel captain
turned himself in to the NSO.

39
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.042
<i>I met a woman about two months ago.</i>

40
00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:18.918
She's a pretty Japanese-Korean woman.

41
00:05:19.042 --> 00:05:23.918
<i>We dated. and she took
me to the casino a few times.</i>

42
00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:27.626
I ended up hundreds
of thousands in debt.

43
00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:31.082
I asked her to lend me some money.

44
00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.834
She said she'll give it to
me under one condition.

45
00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:37.374
When a Japanese patrol
ship soon sails around Dokdo.

46
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.666
she said to attack it
without any warning shots.

47
00:05:42.582 --> 00:05:46.750
We worked with the NIS to
investigate the woman first.

48
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:49.790
Her real name is Ito Hideko.

49
00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:51.166
She works for

50
00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.374
Yamato Foundation. the bank
for right-wing Japanese extremists.

51
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.874
She came to Korea and approached
people with connections to Dokdo.

52
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.706
Apart from the Coast Guard captain.

53
00:06:02.998 --> 00:06:06.958
she had affairs with several
senior naval officers.

54
00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:11.414
Lt-Col CHOI at Navy HQ.

55
00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.874
The NIS brought him in for questioning.

56
00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:14.895
<i>FORGIVE ME</i>

57
00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.498
But he killed himself.

58
00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:20.998
What have you found?

59
00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:24.166
We know she's working
for the Yamato Foundation.

60
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.082
We'll keep investigating
through the NIS.

61
00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:29.206
But we fear...

62
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.458
We could see a repeat of
the 2006 Dokdo War. sir.

63
00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:38.958
When a Japanese patrol ship
trespassed our waters at Dokdo

64
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.706
and our Coast Guards drove it out?

65
00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.042
Yes. sir.

66
00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.918
But behind the patrol ship

67
00:06:47.498 --> 00:06:50.414
was a task flotilla deployed
in nearby international waters.

68
00:06:51.312 --> 00:06:54.089
If we had attacked the patrol ship.

69
00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:57.742
the flotilla would have attacked
our Coast Guards and Navy.

70
00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:03.906
The situation was at
the very brink of war. sir.

71
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.326
If the U.S. hadn't intervened quickly.

72
00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:13.158
a confrontation between the two
navies would've been inevitable.

73
00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:18.198
What if

74
00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:22.242
there is a confrontation at
Dokdo as Japan intends this time?

75
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.118
With just our Navy and Air Force...

76
00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.534
We'd be defeated.

77
00:07:37.074 --> 00:07:40.218
<i>Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Japan</i>

78
00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:41.866
80 years ago.

79
00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:44.118
when the U.S. cut off our oil supply

80
00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:47.990
Japan had no choice
but to go to war with them.

81
00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:51.574
So began the Pacific War

82
00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:56.990
which ended with the
atomic bombing here.

83
00:07:57.326 --> 00:08:00.198
However. great Japan did not give up

84
00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:03.034
but rose again!

85
00:08:04.826 --> 00:08:06.950
This time. it was our economy.

86
00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:10.906
Only 3 decades ago.
for half the price of Tokyo.

87
00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:12.826
we could buy all the land in the U.S.

88
00:08:12.906 --> 00:08:15.826
Japan was the reigning
global economic power.

89
00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:20.074
But we were exploited
by the U.S. again.

90
00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:24.242
The Plaza Accord and
appreciation of the yen

91
00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:28.534
pushed us into a deep decline
that even Koreans scoff at!

92
00:08:29.698 --> 00:08:33.906
The U.S. may be our ally.

93
00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:39.366
but we must recall how America
influenced Japan in the last century!

94
00:08:39.698 --> 00:08:42.282
The author of 'Japan: The
Future of Our Great Nation'.

95
00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:45.282
Shinzo Mori. Let's give him a big hand!

96
00:08:48.782 --> 00:08:50.490
Damn Yankees!

97
00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:53.326
Pitting us against China?

98
00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:57.034
We won't be used by them any longer.

99
00:08:57.282 --> 00:08:59.450
It's our turn to use them.

100
00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:00.574
Yes. sir.

101
00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:03.698
As the U.S. wants.

102
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.906
we'll pretend to prepare
a war with China.

103
00:09:07.074 --> 00:09:09.742
But we'll reclaim our stolen territory.

104
00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:10.574
Yes. sir.

105
00:09:11.242 --> 00:09:12.866
Our invasions of Korea.

106
00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:15.326
the Sino-Japanese War.
the Russo-Japanese War.

107
00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:17.406
and finally. the Korean War.

108
00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:21.034
the expansion of Japanese
reign always began in Korea.

109
00:09:21.574 --> 00:09:25.282
Through war with Korea.

110
00:09:26.282 --> 00:09:30.450
the dormant Japanese
spirit will be awakened.

111
00:09:31.698 --> 00:09:32.906
Yes. sir.

112
00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:36.534
<i>The Blue House (South Korea)</i>

113
00:09:36.698 --> 00:09:38.990
The U.S. will take all
the nuclear warheads.

114
00:09:39.074 --> 00:09:40.574
in exchange for

115
00:09:40.698 --> 00:09:45.534
signing a peace agreement and
ambassador-level diplomatic relations.

116
00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:49.990
There is some
disagreement on some details.

117
00:09:50.406 --> 00:09:54.658
but I think they'll be worked out
after the summit tomorrow. sir.

118
00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:56.466
<i>Chief Secretary</i>

119
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.198
The Foreign Minister
is on the line. sir.

120
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:03.990
Yes. Minister YOON.

121
00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:10.658
Let's listen together.

122
00:10:11.614 --> 00:10:13.034
<i>Mr. President.</i>

123
00:10:13.282 --> 00:10:17.658
<i>The U.S. State Department
just postponed the summit. sir.</i>

124
00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.242
Did they say why? I thought
the big picture was set.

125
00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:24.034
<i>They cited issues with the nuclear
weapon handover procedures.</i>

126
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.826
What procedures?

127
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:32.326
<i>North Korea wanted a
deadline for inspections as well.</i>

128
00:10:32.826 --> 00:10:36.450
<i>The U.S. apparently refused.</i>

129
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.242
<i>So North Korea said no
handover until inspections are done.</i>

130
00:10:43.034 --> 00:10:45.034
Did they give a new
date for the summit?

131
00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:49.118
<i>I'm afraid not. sir.
Nothing was mentioned.</i>

132
00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:54.318
Minister YOON.

133
00:10:54.442 --> 00:10:56.982
Please arrange a call
with President Smoot.

134
00:10:57.398 --> 00:10:58.274
<i>Yes. sir.</i>

135
00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:00.942
<i>I'll inform you once it is arranged.</i>

136
00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:17.526
Where'd you find the chips?

137
00:11:35.358 --> 00:11:37.650
Is it because the summit
has gone belly up?

138
00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:40.734
It's not gone belly up.
It's been postponed.

139
00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:47.774
How can a teacher say that?

140
00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:53.442
A math teacher should still
use more appropriate words. no?

141
00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:57.942
Sorry.

142
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.458
It's been postponed before.
Be patient. It'll work out.

143
00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:06.498
Exactly...

144
00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:11.206
What are you reading so intently?

145
00:12:11.914 --> 00:12:14.250
A copy of the Armistice.

146
00:12:14.626 --> 00:12:18.790
68 years ago. this agreement
stopped the Korean War.

147
00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:23.166
An armistice. a cessation of arms.

148
00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:26.958
I hoped a peace agreement
would replace this.

149
00:12:27.082 --> 00:12:29.626
KIM Il-sung and NAM
Il were North Koreans.

150
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.790
Mark Clark and William
Harrison were Americans.

151
00:12:32.874 --> 00:12:35.250
Peng Teh Huai represented China.

152
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.790
Wait. no South Korea?

153
00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:40.374
Though we've been invited this time.

154
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.582
South Korea won't be signing anywhere.

155
00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:51.250
I know you majored in math.

156
00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:55.666
but shouldn't you know we weren't
a signatory to the Armistice?

157
00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:02.042
What's the area of a circle
with a 10cm diameter?

158
00:13:04.126 --> 00:13:06.126
25π square cm.

159
00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.582
You know π is 3.1415926. right?

160
00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:17.334
Why try to save a country when you
can't solve the area of a tiny circle?

161
00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:19.666
Why you!

162
00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:24.374
Stop wallowing in self
pity and come to bed!

163
00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:26.706
Ouch!

164
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.366
This soup is delicious.

165
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.114
It really hits the spot.

166
00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:37.698
Would you like some more?

167
00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:40.158
No. thank you. I've had plenty.

168
00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:42.866
Experience is a great teacher.

169
00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:47.950
You gentlemen didn't come
here this early to try my cooking.

170
00:13:48.074 --> 00:13:49.490
Young-hee? Are you finished?

171
00:13:49.618 --> 00:13:51.906
- Yes.
- Let's go. We'll be late.

172
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.490
Goodbye. dear.

173
00:13:57.658 --> 00:13:58.906
- Bye. Dad.
- Bye.

174
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.406
Thank you for breakfast.

175
00:14:00.742 --> 00:14:02.074
Have a great day.

176
00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:06.158
Shall we talk in the sitting room?

177
00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:07.326
Dad!

178
00:14:08.158 --> 00:14:09.906
- Yes?
- I polished your shoes.

179
00:14:10.406 --> 00:14:11.490
Right.

180
00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:16.950
Where's my wallet?

181
00:14:17.534 --> 00:14:18.698
Here.

182
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.618
$50?

183
00:14:28.698 --> 00:14:29.782
Mom!

184
00:14:30.198 --> 00:14:32.826
If you take it. your dad will be
arrested for accepting bribes.

185
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.034
Let's go.

186
00:14:35.618 --> 00:14:37.490
- See you later.
- Bye.

187
00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:39.158
Young-hee. have fun!

188
00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:42.450
I've checked through the back channels.

189
00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:45.906
President Smoot will
not schedule a video call

190
00:14:46.742 --> 00:14:51.742
unless we agree to participate
in the Senkaku exercises. sir.

191
00:15:23.574 --> 00:15:25.866
Please tell them we'll take part.

192
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.866
Yes. sir.

193
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.618
What about the luncheon tomorrow
with the Chinese Ambassador?

194
00:15:31.826 --> 00:15:35.490
He's coming to thank you for
not partaking in the exercises.

195
00:15:36.658 --> 00:15:40.782
Oh my...

196
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.990
I have updates on the Yamato
Foundation investigation.

197
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.198
We've been monitoring its accounts.

198
00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:54.742
$1 billion was deposited. recently.

199
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.950
We've confirmed that half of it

200
00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:01.450
was withdrawn in cash. sir.

201
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.242
Where did the money go to?

202
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.074
We're looking into it. sir.

203
00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:09.534
But we know who
transferred it to Yamato.

204
00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:13.450
It's Chen Longfei. a
Chinese real estate mogul.

205
00:16:15.198 --> 00:16:18.782
A Chinese mogul gave money to
right-wing Japanese extremists?

206
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.950
Yes. sir.

207
00:16:20.114 --> 00:16:24.450
We dug deeper and found the
Chinese public security bureau

208
00:16:25.242 --> 00:16:29.034
held him for months for tax evasion
and illegal foreign currency transfers.

209
00:16:29.074 --> 00:16:30.490
Meaning.

210
00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:35.366
it was the Chinese government
that sent the money not Chen Longfei.

211
00:16:36.658 --> 00:16:38.906
But it doesn't make sense.

212
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.158
Why would the Chinese government
be funding Japanese extremists?

213
00:16:51.826 --> 00:16:54.574
A confrontation at Dokdo would mean

214
00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:59.114
the end of the
U.S.-Japan-Korean alliance.

215
00:17:00.326 --> 00:17:03.406
Then the biggest
beneficiary would be...

216
00:17:07.074 --> 00:17:08.950
China.

217
00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:13.450
<i>East Sea International Waters</i>

218
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.406

Get them!

220

Grab hold tightly!

223
00:17:32.534 --> 00:17:33.534
Pull!

<i>Captain of the Paektu SSBN</i>

227
00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.874
Sighing brings you bad luck.

228
00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:02.250
Try to relax and sleep.

229
00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:05.042
Sorry. Let's sleep.

230
00:18:09.414 --> 00:18:11.790
I said it's bad luck!

231
00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.374
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

232
00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:19.250
It wasn't a sigh.

233
00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:21.750
You know I exhale longer.

234
00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:25.666
<i>The Foreign Minister is on the line.</i>

235
00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:29.206
<i>The Foreign Minister is on the line.</i>

236
00:18:31.334 --> 00:18:32.874
Yes. Minister YOON.

237
00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:35.958
No. I was awake.

238
00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.250
3 p.m.?

239
00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:42.042
Eastern Standard Time...

240
00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:47.082
It's fine. The sooner the better.

241
00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:50.434
Good morning. sir.

242
00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:51.057
<i>National Security Council</i>

243
00:18:51.082 --> 00:18:52.498
You came early.

244
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.498
You as well. sir.

245
00:18:55.348 --> 00:18:59.458
Once we said we'll join the exercises.
they arranged the call right away.

246
00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:03.458
But the Senkaku exercises
are not this important.

247
00:19:05.582 --> 00:19:07.790
Is there something more to it?

248
00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:13.666
Things have become rocky with Japan.
Maybe the U.S. wants to mend ties.

249
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:17.250
I hope that's all it is.

250
00:19:18.042 --> 00:19:20.918
A stronger tripartite alliance

251
00:19:21.582 --> 00:19:24.498
will only help keep China in check.

252
00:19:24.834 --> 00:19:26.834
When North Korea is taken care of.

253
00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:30.626
China will be the Americans'
primary concern.

254
00:19:30.998 --> 00:19:32.498
<i>We are on? Yeah.</i>

255
00:19:32.834 --> 00:19:34.126
<i>President HAN.</i>

256
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.458
<i>Thank you for accommodating
the time difference.</i>

257
00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:41.126
President Smoot.
Thank you for your time.

258
00:19:41.206 --> 00:19:42.498
<i>And let me just say</i>

259
00:19:42.582 --> 00:19:45.998
<i>that you made the right decision
to join the Senkaku Exercises.</i>

260
00:19:46.126 --> 00:19:50.042
<i>You are the key to our
tripartite alliance. President HAN.</i>

261
00:19:50.206 --> 00:19:52.498
<i>protecting our interests in the region.</i>

262
00:19:52.582 --> 00:19:56.542
<i>bringing peace and
prosperity to Japan and Korea.</i>

263
00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:15.458
Mr. President?

264
00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:18.166
Mr. President?

265
00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:23.334
Dear? What time is it?

266
00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:24.918
It's almost 8 o'clock.

267
00:20:24.998 --> 00:20:27.082
5 more minutes...

268
00:20:27.706 --> 00:20:28.918
I'm sorry. sir.

269
00:20:35.998 --> 00:20:39.166
I'm glad we share the
same Korean heritage.

270
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.166
We share the same language and tastes.

271
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.666
My appointment as ambassador
as a Korean-Chinese.

272
00:20:47.206 --> 00:20:51.834
means that the Chinese government
values friendship with South Korea.

273
00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:53.582
Yes. of course.

274
00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:02.166
I know the U.S. asked you to partake
in military exercises off Diaoyu.

275
00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:06.334
Our government extends our gratitude

276
00:21:06.582 --> 00:21:10.958
for maintaining your
neutrality by refusing to join.

277
00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.834
Thank you.

278
00:21:19.206 --> 00:21:22.414
We will be taking part
in the exercises after all.

279
00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:27.042
It's just a routine exercise. The
Chinese government need not worry.

280
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.250
President HAN.

281
00:21:35.874 --> 00:21:39.334
Are you aware what
this exercise signifies?

282
00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:46.290
It means the U.S.-Japan forces
will go to war against China!

283
00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:48.834
Why would your forces join in?

284
00:21:49.498 --> 00:21:51.626
South Korea's participation

285
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:57.458
means a declaration
of war against China!

286
00:21:57.706 --> 00:22:01.290
It's not a declaration of
war. It's just an exercise.

287
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.750
Mr. President.

288
00:22:08.042 --> 00:22:10.582
After the first summit
with North Korea.

289
00:22:10.834 --> 00:22:13.334
do you know what
the Americans did first?

290
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.790
They dispatched the marines to
the American consulate in Taiwan.

291
00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:20.750
Then U.S. destroyers commenced
operations in the Taiwan Strait!

292
00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:25.042
Then the American trade
war against China began!

293
00:22:25.414 --> 00:22:28.874
If North Korean nuclear issues
are fully resolved in the summit.

294
00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:32.250
how do you think the
U.S. will act towards us?

295
00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:34.790
Mr. Ambassador.

296
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.334
We apologize for the tight schedule.

297
00:22:37.414 --> 00:22:38.582
Mr. President?

298
00:22:38.874 --> 00:22:41.542
The Foreign Minister has
urgent matters to report.

299
00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:44.334
Mr. Ambassador.

300
00:22:44.414 --> 00:22:47.414
My apologies. I'm afraid I must go.

301
00:22:52.626 --> 00:22:55.582
Stay out of the exercise.

302
00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.166
Listen.

303
00:22:58.458 --> 00:23:06.458
I say this as your friend. not
an ambassador from China.

304
00:23:14.582 --> 00:23:17.414
<i>Foreign Minister</i>

305
00:23:17.498 --> 00:23:19.998
It appears it didn't go well.

306
00:23:22.414 --> 00:23:24.166
<i>U.S. State Department</i>

307
00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:28.082
<i>will soon call with the set
date for the summit. sir.</i>

308
00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:31.918
<i>The new date of the postponed
North Korea-U.S. summit is August 1st.</i>

309
00:23:31.998 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>The world awaits the announcement
of where it will be held.</i>

310
00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:39.706
<i>- President Smoot wrote on Twitter...
- The Unification Minister is on the line.</i>

311
00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:42.666
Yes. Minister.

312
00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:46.582
<i>that U.S. will transport all
North Korean nuclear weapons...</i>

313
00:23:46.706 --> 00:23:47.918
I understand.

314
00:23:48.874 --> 00:23:49.998
Thank you. Minister.

315
00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.082
Why? Another early morning meeting?

316
00:23:59.414 --> 00:24:03.666
The summit's location has been decided.

317
00:24:04.414 --> 00:24:07.126
All the best. Mr. President!

318
00:24:08.998 --> 00:24:11.042
Mr. President!

319
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.874
It's President HAN!

320
00:24:14.626 --> 00:24:16.290
Hello. Mr. President!

321
00:24:20.782 --> 00:24:23.906
American military transport
aircrafts will come for the nukes.

322
00:24:24.074 --> 00:24:28.034
It'll unease people in Pyongyang.
so they decided on Wonsan.

323
00:24:28.158 --> 00:24:33.698
It seems Americans welcome the end
of the North Korean nuclear problem.

324
00:24:34.242 --> 00:24:39.158
But the U.S. Congress
says no peace agreement

325
00:24:39.574 --> 00:24:42.282
before inspections are complete.

326
00:24:42.406 --> 00:24:46.866
The White House are also concerned
about President Smoot's safety.

327
00:24:48.574 --> 00:24:50.782
That sounds nice.

328
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.326
No one in the Blue House
seems worried about my safety.

329
00:24:57.282 --> 00:24:58.574
What was it again?

330
00:24:58.614 --> 00:25:02.698
'Commie! Live in North
Korea and don't come back!'

331
00:25:02.742 --> 00:25:04.698
It was on the Blue
House petition board.

332
00:25:04.782 --> 00:25:06.282
No...

333
00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.034
<i>Typhoon Aere. which
was headed to Shanghai.</i>

334
00:25:09.118 --> 00:25:11.990

<i>- and wind speeds of over 90m/s.</i>
- Mr. President.

<i>U.S. Air Force Weather Agency

338
00:25:20.854 --> 00:25:22.190
Yes. Prime Minister.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.366
Yes.

340
00:25:24.698 --> 00:25:27.326
Even the weather isn't cooperating.

341
00:25:27.658 --> 00:25:32.034
Please do your best to make sure
the typhoon doesn't cause damages.

342
00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:33.173
<i>WHERE IS TYPHOON STEEL RAIN HEADED?</i>

343
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.798
I'll see you when I get back.

344
00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:37.826
<i>...and is expected to go
past Dokdo and Ulleungdo.</i>

345
00:25:37.906 --> 00:25:39.406

<i>Wonsan Airport VIP Room</i>

348
00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:01.490
Would you care for one?

349
00:26:01.614 --> 00:26:03.242
No. thank you.

350
00:26:04.574 --> 00:26:06.906
Though smoking indoors
is prohibited in South Korea.

351
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.990
it's not here. So. excuse me.

352
00:26:09.074 --> 00:26:10.034
Sure.

353
00:26:20.614 --> 00:26:23.742
What is it? Is something funny?

354
00:26:23.826 --> 00:26:27.866
Someone recently told
me sighing brings bad luck.

355
00:26:29.198 --> 00:26:30.326
Anyway.

356
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.990
it'll be a good day.
What's worrying you?

357
00:26:35.658 --> 00:26:39.282
Know how much time and money
we poured into our nuclear weapons?

358
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.034
And opposition to this
summit was always a given.

359
00:26:44.118 --> 00:26:47.074
But recently. it has died down.

360
00:26:47.366 --> 00:26:48.826
Thanks to your persuasiveness...

361
00:26:48.866 --> 00:26:52.490
We don't persuade
here. We simply decide.

362
00:26:54.906 --> 00:26:58.490
Recently. China promised us aid
irrespective of our nuclear weapons.

363
00:26:58.614 --> 00:27:01.406
and warned us to stand up to the U.S.

364
00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:06.326
It's caused some unrest
among my military officers.

365
00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:12.198
<i>A strong typhoon is
headed north from the south.</i>

366
00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:15.282
<i>Two typhoons have merged.</i>

367
00:27:15.658 --> 00:27:23.534
<i>The super typhoon will bring
stronger winds and rain than usual.</i>

368
00:27:24.534 --> 00:27:29.198
<i>High wave warnings are in
place in the eastern coast.</i>

369
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:35.282
<i>Therefore. each sector of the
Republic must take measures</i>

370
00:27:35.658 --> 00:27:38.906
<i>to prevent damage from the heavy rain.</i>

371
00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:42.834
<i>In particular. urban management
and construction sectors must...</i>

372
00:27:42.859 --> 00:27:44.667
<i>Supreme Guard Commander</i>

373
00:28:15.906 --> 00:28:16.866
Welcome.

374
00:28:17.034 --> 00:28:18.118
How are you doing?

375
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:19.534
Welcome. President Smoot.

376
00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:20.982
Good to see you again.

377
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:22.858
Oh! What a nice little...

378
00:28:22.982 --> 00:28:27.318
The DPRK honor guards welcome you!

379
00:28:27.526 --> 00:28:30.274
Colonel YOO. speaking!

380
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.690
This way. sir!

381
00:29:07.066 --> 00:29:11.398
<i>Wonsan Kalma International Hotel</i>

382
00:29:13.906 --> 00:29:14.618
Mr. Chairman.

383
00:29:14.658 --> 00:29:18.574
You'd better come to Washington
and sign the peace agreement there.

384
00:29:19.282 --> 00:29:22.826
There's a lot of people
who are up in arms about

385
00:29:22.906 --> 00:29:26.074
me signing this agreement
way too early. you know.

386
00:29:26.574 --> 00:29:32.574
And I know that here in North Korea.
it's whatever the Chairman says goes.

387
00:29:32.782 --> 00:29:35.906
In Washington. it's a
whole different story.

388
00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:40.782
You know we got the
bureaucrats. politicians. the press...

389
00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:44.534
Hardliners are not
exclusive to America.

390
00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:47.242
We have many here. too.

391
00:29:50.114 --> 00:29:51.742
I'm gonna be honest with you.

392
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.698
I envy you.

393
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.450
You're a dictator. You
can do anything you want.

394
00:29:57.574 --> 00:30:01.490
You can drag your enemies out of their
beds in the middle of the night 3 a.m.

395
00:30:01.698 --> 00:30:03.366
Have them shot. Boom! Boom!

396
00:30:03.574 --> 00:30:05.450
I mean. it's a beautiful thing.

397
00:30:06.198 --> 00:30:09.034
And politics is show business.

398
00:30:09.114 --> 00:30:10.742
And that's what I do.

399
00:30:11.034 --> 00:30:12.326
Show business.

400
00:30:12.406 --> 00:30:15.990
So I'm gonna take your nukes back home.

401
00:30:17.114 --> 00:30:18.866
I'm gonna put on a good show.

402
00:30:19.574 --> 00:30:21.618
You are gonna sign the agreement.

403
00:30:21.866 --> 00:30:23.906
We'll normalize ties.

404
00:30:24.826 --> 00:30:27.114
And then you and I are gonna
make a lot of money together.

405
00:30:27.198 --> 00:30:28.242
It's a beautiful thing.

406
00:30:28.282 --> 00:30:31.658
You gotta trust me here.
I know what I'm doing.

407
00:30:32.074 --> 00:30:33.490
President Smoot.

408
00:30:34.406 --> 00:30:37.242
I. too. can only do so much.

409
00:30:38.326 --> 00:30:42.074
Without a diplomatic agreement.
you can't take our nuclear weapons.

410
00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:44.282
Well...

411
00:30:44.574 --> 00:30:48.114
Who do you think is gonna take the
flak when I go home empty handed?

412
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.198
Not me. You!

413
00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:53.242
So you'd better think
about this very carefully.

414
00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:54.990
Mr. Chairman.

415
00:30:55.826 --> 00:30:57.534
Is he allowed to smoke in here?

416
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.326
Excuse me. please.

417
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.782
No smoking.

418
00:31:02.698 --> 00:31:04.534
30 years ago.

419
00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:08.074
South Korea sought ties
with the Soviets and Chinese.

420
00:31:08.242 --> 00:31:11.326
Swallowing our pride.
we turned to the U.S.

421
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.114
But you ignored us

422
00:31:13.242 --> 00:31:15.074
and said we're a failed state.

423
00:31:15.242 --> 00:31:17.406
That's why we chose nuclear weapons.

424
00:31:17.534 --> 00:31:20.866
With them. you'd pay attention to us!

425
00:31:21.866 --> 00:31:24.906
It took 30 years for
you to sit down with us.

426
00:31:26.034 --> 00:31:27.866
In exchange for your signature here.

427
00:31:28.326 --> 00:31:32.990
we're giving up what we
labored 30 years to build!

428
00:31:33.198 --> 00:31:38.242
Is that so much to ask for you to sign?

429
00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:40.990
Are you finished?

430
00:31:41.534 --> 00:31:42.866
You're not listening to me.

431
00:31:43.074 --> 00:31:44.990
I told you I want to sign it.

432
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.906
But there's the Neocons
who want nothing to...

433
00:31:48.114 --> 00:31:49.406
They want nothing more to do

434
00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:52.826
then to blow the fuck out of
your stupid. little fucking country.

435
00:31:53.198 --> 00:31:54.782
How dare you!

436
00:31:55.198 --> 00:31:58.406
So you know. I'd
appreciate a little gratitude.

437
00:31:58.534 --> 00:31:59.490
Because right now.

438
00:31:59.574 --> 00:32:03.242
I'm the only thing keeping you
and your fucking people alive.

439
00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:04.534
Please. please. please.

440
00:32:05.282 --> 00:32:06.866
Why don't we take a break?

441
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.034
No need! Goodbye to you both!

442
00:32:10.326 --> 00:32:12.034
Fucking spits all over me?

443
00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:13.326
Fuck you.

444
00:32:15.198 --> 00:32:17.158
What's his fucking problem?

445
00:32:18.034 --> 00:32:18.950
You know?

446
00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:21.406
Just wanna make some money?

447
00:32:25.574 --> 00:32:26.866
Mr. Chairman.

448
00:32:27.242 --> 00:32:29.114
If we pass this final hurdle.

449
00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:32.782
the Korean Peninsula
will no longer be used

450
00:32:33.242 --> 00:32:35.198
for foreign ambition and conflict...

451
00:32:35.282 --> 00:32:38.034
Stop beating around the bush!

452
00:32:38.366 --> 00:32:42.158
Do whatever the U.S. tells
you. Isn't that your point?

453
00:32:43.406 --> 00:32:45.242
Let me ask you this.

454
00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:48.490
Are you really interested
in our people's future?

455
00:32:48.782 --> 00:32:51.782
Aren't you doing this
to improve your ratings?

456
00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.490
Please leave.

457
00:33:05.534 --> 00:33:06.450
Mr. Chairman.

458
00:33:09.242 --> 00:33:12.114
The South Korean President
serves just one 5-year term.

459
00:33:12.326 --> 00:33:13.866
The only reason I'm here

460
00:33:14.574 --> 00:33:17.574
is because we almost went to war again.

461
00:33:18.158 --> 00:33:20.782
I'm doing my best to prevent war.

462
00:33:23.398 --> 00:33:27.650
Please remember that
when you sit down at the talks.

463
00:33:35.482 --> 00:33:39.314
Nuclear inspections take a
long time and have limitations.

464
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.314
If North Korea cheats and hides a
few nuclear warheads. we're screwed.

465
00:33:43.606 --> 00:33:46.274
If you focused on peace.
not nuclear weapons.

466
00:33:46.582 --> 00:33:49.206
I think it'll be easier to resolve.

467
00:33:49.498 --> 00:33:55.582
If you open an embassy here.
it'll make inspections much easier.

468
00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.514
This situation would be much easier to resolve
if you focused on peace. not nuclear weapons.

469
00:34:00.598 --> 00:34:01.934
If you open an embassy in North Korea.

470
00:34:01.974 --> 00:34:02.766
An embassy. another embassy.

471
00:34:02.806 --> 00:34:04.558
your staff will have a
base for their operations.

472
00:34:04.598 --> 00:34:05.058
Okay.

473
00:34:05.098 --> 00:34:06.586
That will make inspections much easier.

474
00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.333
Mr. HAN. Do you really think
the U.S. is holding all the cards?

475
00:34:09.357 --> 00:34:15.134
Mr. HAN. Do you really think
the U.S. is holding all the cards?

476
00:34:15.598 --> 00:34:16.682
Oh. sorry.

477
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:21.498
What do cards matter if
you're carrying a big stick?

478
00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:24.626
What do cards matter if
you're carrying a big stick?

479
00:34:25.082 --> 00:34:27.498
North Koreaʼs carrying a big stick.

480
00:34:28.577 --> 00:34:31.386
Few years ago. after the
North Korean tell that...

481
00:34:31.582 --> 00:34:32.998
Well. you're wrong.

482
00:34:33.082 --> 00:34:35.834
North Korea's carrying a big stick.

483
00:34:36.082 --> 00:34:39.834
After their 6th nuclear and ICBM test.

484
00:34:39.958 --> 00:34:42.250
America was going to go to war.

485
00:34:42.374 --> 00:34:45.958
Jesus Christ would've
bombed North Korea too.

486
00:34:46.126 --> 00:34:47.666
He talks too fast.

487
00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:54.166
Thanks to me. we're negotiating
now without a nuclear war.

488
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.042
Isn't that a great achievement?

489
00:34:59.126 --> 00:35:00.498
Somebody get me a coke. Now.

490
00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:02.166
Where's Coke?

491
00:35:03.126 --> 00:35:05.498
I am well aware of your efforts.

492
00:35:06.126 --> 00:35:11.918
If everything goes well. the
Nobel Peace Prize will be yours.

493
00:35:11.998 --> 00:35:14.582
The Nobel peace prize
will definitely be yours.

494
00:35:15.166 --> 00:35:17.250
Yeah. and I deserve
it because you know.

495
00:35:17.334 --> 00:35:19.750
Let's say that the nukes are
out of the question. Mr. HAN.

496
00:35:19.874 --> 00:35:22.126
I deserve it. right?

497
00:35:22.626 --> 00:35:23.542
Mr. HAN.

498
00:35:23.874 --> 00:35:26.414
Let's say the nukes
are out of the question.

499
00:35:26.542 --> 00:35:29.790
If we give indulgence to
North Korea. China's ally.

500
00:35:29.874 --> 00:35:31.750
how would that benefit the U.S.?

501
00:35:32.082 --> 00:35:34.706
Why should we let
North Korea off the hook?

502
00:35:34.834 --> 00:35:38.706
Then North Korea would
act in China's best interest.

503
00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:42.706
It'd be like a free pass.

504
00:35:42.918 --> 00:35:44.290
Where's ketchup?

505
00:35:45.334 --> 00:35:48.126
We'd be letting the enemy walk free.

506
00:35:49.626 --> 00:35:53.542
If they think. they can deal
with us apart from China.

507
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.790
it'd be a strategic mistake.

508
00:35:57.626 --> 00:36:00.290
North Korea's mistaken.

509
00:36:01.706 --> 00:36:04.042
It doesn't work like that.

510
00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:07.458
But if they break alliance
with China and join us.

511
00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:10.250
what's a few nuclear
warheads between friends?

512
00:36:11.082 --> 00:36:12.374
Have some doughnuts.

513
00:36:12.498 --> 00:36:13.874
Put a little weight on yourself.

514
00:36:13.998 --> 00:36:15.626
You should gain weight.

515
00:36:16.998 --> 00:36:18.374
God bless America.

516
00:36:18.998 --> 00:36:20.082
Oh god.

517
00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:24.390
<i>Waters off Sinpo Port (North Korea)</i>

518
00:36:24.414 --> 00:36:28.290
A big typhoon is headed
our way. It's so windy. sir.

519
00:36:29.122 --> 00:36:31.166
Are we ferrying money again?

520
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.750
Even if it's on the Chairman's
orders. it doesn't feel right.

521
00:36:35.546 --> 00:36:36.855
Naval officers transporting money...

522
00:36:37.294 --> 00:36:39.265
What you feel doesn't matter.
It's the Chairman's orders.

523
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.334
Never mind.

524
00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:43.082
We will stop in Wonsan.
then head to the East Sea.

525
00:36:43.874 --> 00:36:44.790
Wonsan?

526
00:36:45.542 --> 00:36:48.874
The Chairman wanted to inspect
our sub before commissioning.

527
00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:50.666
- Does that mean...?
- Comrade JANG.

528
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.206
Do you still hold a grudge
against the Chairman?

529
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:54.834
No. sir.

530
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.626
He wants to use the nuclear
weapons to protect our Republic.

531
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:59.750
And...

532
00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:04.414
Let's dive. sir.

533
00:37:04.918 --> 00:37:06.082
Prepare to dive!

534
00:37:06.698 --> 00:37:07.574
Prepare to dive!

535
00:37:07.598 --> 00:37:08.295
<i>Director of GPB</i>

536
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.901
Of all people. how could
you turn against the Republic?

537
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:12.851
<i>Supreme Guard Command: Defense and
security agency for the head of state</i>

538
00:37:12.875 --> 00:37:17.149
Besides the Supreme Guard Command.
what unit could pull off a coup?

539
00:37:17.174 --> 00:37:18.134
Exactly!

540
00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:22.227
That's why we put you there.
but you dare attempt a coup?

541
00:37:31.006 --> 00:37:32.966
<i>Minister of the People's Armed Forces</i>

542
00:37:36.134 --> 00:37:38.134
Use your brains!

543
00:37:40.222 --> 00:37:42.382
If we hand over all
our nuclear weapons.

544
00:37:42.466 --> 00:37:47.714
seek reform and open
up. what will happen to us?

545
00:37:50.882 --> 00:37:55.050
Our Republic is different
from Vietnam or China.

546
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.798
They can reform and open up. Why?

547
00:37:58.882 --> 00:38:01.550
Because they can
survive even if they fail.

548
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.590
But us?

549
00:38:02.798 --> 00:38:06.714
If we reform and open
rashly. the country will collapse!

550
00:38:07.466 --> 00:38:09.966
We'd be taken over by South Korea.

551
00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:13.174
Am I wrong?

552
00:38:16.006 --> 00:38:19.882
Our only hope is our blood ally China!

553
00:38:20.342 --> 00:38:23.590
Soon. China will surpass
the U.S. in every way.

554
00:38:23.674 --> 00:38:25.298
We must endure!

555
00:38:26.258 --> 00:38:29.882
We must wait until they do.

556
00:38:48.798 --> 00:38:49.966
Evac! Evac!

557
00:38:50.298 --> 00:38:51.298
Secure Mogul!

558
00:38:52.218 --> 00:38:53.674
Secure a way out!

559
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.590
Let's go!

560
00:38:58.382 --> 00:39:00.426
President HAN! It's a coup!

561
00:39:06.882 --> 00:39:07.926
Blackout!

562
00:39:08.506 --> 00:39:09.382
Find an escape route!

563
00:39:09.466 --> 00:39:10.506
Find an escape!

564
00:39:15.466 --> 00:39:16.842
Move. move. move. move!

565
00:39:17.966 --> 00:39:19.090
Clear a path! Clear a path!

566
00:39:19.174 --> 00:39:21.050
Let them go!

567
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.258
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

568
00:39:24.174 --> 00:39:24.590
Move!

569
00:39:24.674 --> 00:39:25.506
Cover him!

570
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.842
Come tight! Go!

571
00:39:30.298 --> 00:39:31.926
Protect the Chairman!

572
00:39:57.926 --> 00:39:58.926
Secure the back!

573
00:40:05.382 --> 00:40:06.298
Tighter!

574
00:40:11.426 --> 00:40:13.550
Stand down! Stand down!

575
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.926
We'll be escorting you three.

576
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.842
Listen. You know.

577
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:41.714
I'm sorry. but if you think taking
me hostage is gonna help you out...

578
00:40:41.926 --> 00:40:43.174
You're wrong. I mean...

579
00:40:43.342 --> 00:40:46.842
The United States America
does not negotiate with terrorists.

580
00:40:46.926 --> 00:40:49.006
Be quiet. I don't understand you.

581
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.926
He said the U.S. does
not negotiate with terrorists.

582
00:40:53.298 --> 00:40:58.926
We're soldiers protecting
our Republic. not terrorists. sir.

583
00:41:03.006 --> 00:41:06.798
He says they are
soldiers. not terrorists.

584
00:41:09.298 --> 00:41:11.342
You speak English?

585
00:41:12.798 --> 00:41:14.174
Why not?

586
00:41:15.174 --> 00:41:17.634
Fuck... Could have told me.

587
00:41:18.466 --> 00:41:22.050
Well. that's even more serious
you can tell him because...

588
00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:25.966
North Korean military
taking me hostage?

589
00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.298
That's a declaration of war.

590
00:41:29.394 --> 00:41:30.193
<i>Wonsan Port (North Korea)</i>

591
00:41:30.218 --> 00:41:35.372
This is the Paektu. our first
ballistic missile submarine!

592
00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:39.506
It's powered by a nuclear reactor
with nuclear missiles as well.

593
00:41:39.882 --> 00:41:40.882
Escort them.

594
00:41:41.006 --> 00:41:42.134
This way. sir.

595
00:42:11.506 --> 00:42:12.466
- Mr. Chairman!
- Sir!

596
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.050
Comrades in Arms!

597
00:42:23.506 --> 00:42:25.714
Escort them to the captain's cabin.

598
00:42:25.798 --> 00:42:27.550
What's happening. sir?

599
00:42:28.634 --> 00:42:30.842
He's from the GPB.

600
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.426
Escort them to the cabin.

601
00:42:53.758 --> 00:42:54.842
Follow me. sir.

602
00:42:55.882 --> 00:42:58.342
You two stand guard outside.

603
00:43:00.258 --> 00:43:05.050
Isn't he General JANG Ki-sok.
former head of Submarine Command?

604
00:43:07.176 --> 00:43:08.220
That's right.

605
00:43:08.842 --> 00:43:11.798
Hwaseong 14. 15: North Korea's ICBM.

606
00:43:11.823 --> 00:43:13.426
He was demoted after opposing
the Hwaseong 14 and 15 ICBM tests.

607
00:43:13.506 --> 00:43:15.258
Why'd he oppose the test launches?

608
00:43:15.506 --> 00:43:20.090
He said if we wanted to use ICBMs.
we need to deploy SLBMs first.

609
00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:23.298
or we would be attacked.

610
00:43:23.882 --> 00:43:25.006
Accused by the party

611
00:43:25.426 --> 00:43:29.882
of self-interested opposition
to their plans. he was demoted.

612
00:43:30.426 --> 00:43:32.758
That's why he's a First Officer now?

613
00:43:36.466 --> 00:43:38.550
I don't know what he's thinking.

614
00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:43.506
but he's the best submarine
strategist. brother.

615
00:43:51.006 --> 00:43:54.050
We're not brothers when on duty.

616
00:43:54.218 --> 00:43:56.966
Submarines have 3 basic problems.

617
00:43:57.174 --> 00:43:58.926
First. the space is very tight.

618
00:43:59.758 --> 00:44:01.926
It's cramped. but try to rest.

619
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:03.298
General JANG Ji-sok.

620
00:44:03.382 --> 00:44:04.342
Yes. sir.

621
00:44:06.258 --> 00:44:07.342
Are you with them. too?

622
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.426
It's not Ji-sok. but Ki-sok.

623
00:44:09.674 --> 00:44:11.466
And I'm a major. not a general.

624
00:44:11.634 --> 00:44:13.798
You demoted me. sir.

625
00:44:17.674 --> 00:44:18.966
Rest. sir.

626
00:44:49.134 --> 00:44:50.590
Can's too small.

627
00:44:50.758 --> 00:44:53.174
Room. room's too small.
Everything too small!

628
00:44:53.382 --> 00:44:54.298
Hey. you!

629
00:44:54.798 --> 00:44:56.342
Yeah. I'm talking to you.

630
00:44:56.758 --> 00:45:00.218
What's the plan? These
guys. They are your guys. huh?

631
00:45:00.506 --> 00:45:01.882
What's the plan?

632
00:45:02.506 --> 00:45:05.550
He's got a bed. You got
a... You've got a chair.

633
00:45:05.966 --> 00:45:07.050
Where's my chair?

634
00:45:07.134 --> 00:45:08.926
The can? I can sit in the can?

635
00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.382
Please. sit here.

636
00:45:10.466 --> 00:45:12.090
Oh! Thank you.

637
00:45:12.426 --> 00:45:14.298
Very kind of you. sir.

638
00:45:16.174 --> 00:45:17.218
Too small.

639
00:45:22.842 --> 00:45:24.758
Bearing 20 degrees. range 6.000m!

640
00:45:25.006 --> 00:45:26.634
Assumed U.S. sub detected.

641
00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:29.506
Bastards. This isn't your own backyard!

642
00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:30.714
Never mind.

643
00:45:31.258 --> 00:45:33.466
Say hello and send out a ping.

644
00:45:34.342 --> 00:45:37.174
They're just here to
guard their President.

645
00:45:37.258 --> 00:45:39.050
We'll give away our location!

646
00:45:39.134 --> 00:45:40.258
Never mind.

647
00:45:40.714 --> 00:45:44.426
We found them now. They
likely knew our location earlier.

648
00:45:45.758 --> 00:45:47.090
Send the ping.

649
00:46:00.298 --> 00:46:03.050
They've pinged back. sir.

650
00:46:04.006 --> 00:46:06.550
They have no idea what happened.

651
00:46:08.758 --> 00:46:11.966
Captain. Take us to our destination.

652
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.506
Yes. sir.

653
00:47:04.966 --> 00:47:06.466
What are you doing?

654
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.357
<i>The White House
National Security Council</i>

655
00:47:16.382 --> 00:47:18.651
<i>A coup has broken
out here in North Korea.</i>

656
00:47:19.056 --> 00:47:20.233
<i>and it appears President Smoot.</i>

657

<i>the South Korean President. and
the North Korean Supreme Leader</i>

658

00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:35.219
<i>and members of the press. like myself.
are being kept in a separate room.</i>

662
00:47:35.926 --> 00:47:39.140
<i>Now. judging by the fact
that we no longer hear gunfire.</i>

663
00:47:39.378 --> 00:47:41.501
<i>the coup seems to have succeeded.</i>

664
00:47:41.526 --> 00:47:44.026
Find out which duties can be
executed by the Vice President

665
00:47:44.106 --> 00:47:46.942
when the President has been
captured by an enemy but is still alive.

666
00:47:48.858 --> 00:47:50.150
<i>Who's on the phone!</i>

667
00:47:50.526 --> 00:47:52.274
<i>Hand over your phones!</i>

668
00:47:53.482 --> 00:47:54.942
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.818
<i>FAX Jennifer is reporting
from North Korea.</i>

670
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.690
<i>President Smoot has
been captured as hostage</i>

671
00:48:00.774 --> 00:48:02.818
<i>with North and South Korean leaders.</i>

<i>Blue House NSC</i>

673
00:48:07.314 --> 00:48:09.734
Humint in Pyongyang found

674
00:48:09.818 --> 00:48:12.898
the Supreme Guard
Command started the coup.

675
00:48:12.942 --> 00:48:13.917
<i>Prime Minister</i>

676
00:48:13.942 --> 00:48:14.898
What about the border?

677
00:48:14.982 --> 00:48:18.858
There's no movement.
They're not part of the coup.

678
00:48:18.898 --> 00:48:21.314
Declare a state of emergency
across all forces.

679
00:48:21.442 --> 00:48:25.150
and please get more intel
from Humint in the North.

680
00:48:25.398 --> 00:48:26.026
Yes. ma'am.

681
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.482
Now meanwhile. North Korean
ground forces near the Armistice Line

682
00:48:29.566 --> 00:48:32.150
have only just begun
showing signs of movement.

683
00:48:32.606 --> 00:48:33.858
Another problem

684
00:48:33.942 --> 00:48:38.026
is the Chinese troops assembled along
the bridge between China and North Korea.

685
00:48:38.106 --> 00:48:42.442
Now. they moved into position
before even the front-line corps did.

686
00:48:42.818 --> 00:48:45.234
China knew the coup was gonna happen.

687
00:48:45.898 --> 00:48:46.982
If they're on the bridge now.

688
00:48:47.066 --> 00:48:50.066
it's only a matter of time before
they cross into North Korea.

689
00:48:50.566 --> 00:48:51.818
Madam Vice President?

690
00:48:52.314 --> 00:48:56.314
When the President is incapable of
discharging his duties as commander-in-chief.

691
00:48:56.442 --> 00:48:58.526
then this authority
is transferred to you.

692
00:48:58.606 --> 00:49:02.314
Given he's a prisoner right now. it's
safe to assume he is incapacitated.

693
00:49:02.774 --> 00:49:05.774
So you're saying I have
supreme operational command?

694
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:07.066
Yes. ma'am.

695
00:49:07.482 --> 00:49:08.066
Okay.

696
00:49:08.482 --> 00:49:11.026
How do we keep the Chinese
from entering North Korea?

697
00:49:11.358 --> 00:49:14.858
We have to send them a clear message
that entering North Korea means war.

698
00:49:14.982 --> 00:49:18.734
To do that. we'll have
to strike North Korea first.

699
00:49:18.898 --> 00:49:21.026
But what if something
happens to the President?

700
00:49:21.106 --> 00:49:24.234
If we just sit here doing nothing. out
of concern for the President's safety.

701
00:49:24.314 --> 00:49:27.026
future historians will devote pages

702
00:49:27.106 --> 00:49:30.066
in their books to the incompetence
of the people in this room.

703
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.858
Mr. Secretary!

704
00:49:30.942 --> 00:49:34.150
Find out what retaliatory options
we have against North Korea. ASAP!

705
00:49:38.398 --> 00:49:39.818
Meet me in the hallway.

706
00:49:40.606 --> 00:49:41.650
You bet.

707
00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:48.274
All due respect Joanne.
what the hell are you doing?

708
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.566
They have our President.
our colleagues. our reporters.

709
00:49:52.442 --> 00:49:53.566
Think with me.

710
00:49:54.026 --> 00:49:57.234
What is the worst
thing that could happen?

711
00:49:57.606 --> 00:50:00.026
Well. that's obvious.
Losing our President.

712
00:50:00.442 --> 00:50:01.442
That's right.

713
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.566
And if that worst thing were to happen.

714
00:50:05.818 --> 00:50:07.734
what would we have to lose?

715
00:50:08.774 --> 00:50:11.566
If something were to
happen to the President.

716
00:50:12.274 --> 00:50:13.526
our party would have itself

717
00:50:13.606 --> 00:50:18.690
the first ever President to
die a hero in a foreign country.

718
00:50:22.942 --> 00:50:24.858
And what about Kagemusha?

719
00:50:24.982 --> 00:50:28.066
Neocons think the Chinese
are the Nazis of the 21st century

720
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:32.026
and that we are destined to go
to war with them sooner or later.

721
00:50:32.442 --> 00:50:34.898
Better to do it when we can win.

722
00:50:35.606 --> 00:50:36.942
Don't you agree?

723
00:50:59.066 --> 00:51:02.482
You heard from Chinese
Ambassador Liang Wei

724
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.982
about America's plans for Operation
Kagemusha. have you not?

725
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.898
It's highly improbable.

726
00:51:11.026 --> 00:51:13.690
Why would Japan go
to war against China?

727
00:51:14.066 --> 00:51:17.482
The Japanese don't do
things to their disadvantage.

728
00:51:18.066 --> 00:51:19.942
Administer the injection.

729
00:51:21.106 --> 00:51:23.150
Motherfuckers! Mother!

730
00:51:23.314 --> 00:51:24.734
What are you doing!

731
00:51:25.066 --> 00:51:29.274
Oh! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

732
00:51:29.774 --> 00:51:31.274
You. especially you!

733
00:51:31.482 --> 00:51:33.734
Tell him to stop
resisting and sit still!

734
00:51:33.818 --> 00:51:35.314
Hey!

735
00:51:36.066 --> 00:51:37.774
It is just a drug.

736
00:51:37.942 --> 00:51:39.690
It will make you happy. Okay?

737
00:51:39.858 --> 00:51:41.026
Relax!

738
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.526
Fuck you. man!

739
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:55.982
American will is stronger than
all of your North Korean drugs.

740
00:51:56.234 --> 00:51:57.026
Give him one more.

741
00:51:57.106 --> 00:51:58.026
So go fuck yourself!

742
00:52:01.858 --> 00:52:03.650
I'm gonna fuckin'...

743
00:52:04.442 --> 00:52:06.566
I'm gonna... fuck you...

744
00:52:15.314 --> 00:52:17.566
Explain Operation Kagemusha.

745
00:52:17.898 --> 00:52:19.774
Explain Operation Kagemusha.

746
00:52:23.482 --> 00:52:26.234
The objective of Operation Kagemusha

747
00:52:26.314 --> 00:52:28.150
The goal of Operation Kagemusha

748
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.398
is a regime change in China.

749
00:52:32.606 --> 00:52:35.106
is a regime change in China.

750
00:52:37.106 --> 00:52:39.398
A U.S. submarine

751
00:52:39.606 --> 00:52:43.606
sinks a Japanese fleet off Senkaku.

752
00:52:45.106 --> 00:52:50.982
Japan blames it on China
and orders a counterattack.

753
00:52:56.234 --> 00:53:01.566
The U.S. submarines sink
Chinese submarines and destroyers.

754
00:53:03.898 --> 00:53:08.026
And guess who takes
the credit for it all?

755
00:53:08.314 --> 00:53:10.774
Guess who takes the credit for it all?

756
00:53:13.066 --> 00:53:14.442
Japan.

757
00:53:14.734 --> 00:53:21.650
And in the air we provide
intelligence. and we provide air power.

758
00:53:22.026 --> 00:53:25.526
And the Japanese air force.

759
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.982
they emerge superior.

760
00:53:30.942 --> 00:53:32.650
What is this shit?

761
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:36.106
It feels so fucking good.

762
00:53:36.442 --> 00:53:40.234
Oh. yeah! What is the
point of it all? I ask you.

763
00:53:42.398 --> 00:53:48.358
China will be crushed into a
million porcelain pieces of dust.

764
00:53:49.066 --> 00:53:55.398
The arrogance that made China think it
could ever be a contender in the ring.

765
00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.566
China will be crushed to dust.

766
00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.482
I mean. because what
did they invent? Eh?

767
00:54:00.774 --> 00:54:03.690
The Chinese! What
the fuck did they invent?

768
00:54:04.818 --> 00:54:06.358
Noodles?

769
00:54:06.898 --> 00:54:08.942
And we invented the atom bomb.

770
00:54:10.234 --> 00:54:16.026
Japan's gonna become the greatest
arms' market in the whole wide world.

771
00:54:16.442 --> 00:54:19.442
Yeah. and the America just
keeps getting greater and greater.

772
00:54:19.526 --> 00:54:23.482
And America will become greater.

773
00:54:24.358 --> 00:54:26.026
Do you see now?

774
00:54:27.274 --> 00:54:30.442
This is the true nature
of the Yankee bastards.

775
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.274
They fabricated an attack
to start a war in Vietnam.

776
00:54:34.358 --> 00:54:37.190
Now. they'll start one
between China and Japan

777
00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:40.734
and bind our blood
ally in chains of defeat.

778
00:54:41.026 --> 00:54:42.150
Why?

779
00:54:43.066 --> 00:54:45.566
Because we chose to give
up our nuclear weapons

780
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:49.650
and turned our back
on our ally of 70 years!

781
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:50.898
Comrade!

782
00:54:51.358 --> 00:54:54.566
How much did you get
paid by the Chinese for this!

783
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.442
Yes. I've been paid!

784
00:54:56.734 --> 00:54:58.818
But you got it wrong. sir.

785
00:54:59.274 --> 00:55:01.190
<i>It wasn't by the Chinese.</i>

786
00:55:01.442 --> 00:55:04.150
<i>I got $500 million from the Japanese.</i>

787
00:55:04.566 --> 00:55:05.818
<i>Of course.</i>

788
00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:08.302
Should we report what's
coming from the cabin?

789
00:55:08.327 --> 00:55:10.374
<i>the Chinese promised restoration
of mutual aid and treaty...</i>

790
00:55:10.399 --> 00:55:11.209
Leave it!

791
00:55:11.234 --> 00:55:13.026
It's not our place to interfere.

792
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.606
<i>...as well as economic aid!</i>

793
00:55:16.418 --> 00:55:18.794
China promised me!

794
00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:24.434
So.

795
00:55:25.598 --> 00:55:27.514
we should do our best

796
00:55:28.018 --> 00:55:32.142
to stop a Sino-Japanese
war. shouldn't we?

797
00:55:35.682 --> 00:55:37.142
Goodnight. then.

798
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:01.974
What's that sound?

799
00:56:09.142 --> 00:56:10.642
What did you do?

800
00:56:10.766 --> 00:56:12.142
Let's hope

801
00:56:14.226 --> 00:56:16.850
not everyone on this sub is a traitor.

802
00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.590
There's a typhoon
passing over the East Sea.

803
00:56:19.674 --> 00:56:22.926
so deploying an aircraft
carrier will be impossible.

804
00:56:22.966 --> 00:56:26.134
And it's too stormy to
dispatch the Seventh Air Force.

805
00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:28.090
Now. there is one other option.

806
00:56:28.426 --> 00:56:32.674
An artillery attack by ground
troops deployed in South Korea.

807
00:56:32.926 --> 00:56:36.382
The President's been taken hostage.
and you're suggesting we fire cannons?

808
00:56:37.134 --> 00:56:39.926
We need to strike back before
they even know what hit them.

809
00:56:40.134 --> 00:56:41.842
And make it resoundingly clear

810
00:56:42.426 --> 00:56:46.090
that no good will come from
provoking the United States of America.

811
00:56:47.258 --> 00:56:50.426
Ma'am. We did plan an
operation some time ago.

812
00:56:51.342 --> 00:56:52.842
Prompt Global Strike.

813
00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:54.590
Prompt Global Strike?

814
00:56:54.758 --> 00:56:57.714
We attack with a Minuteman ICBM.

815
00:56:57.798 --> 00:57:01.466
but instead of a nuclear warhead.
we use a conventional one.

816
00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:04.634
Now it is expensive. but it's
very fast. impossible to stop.

817
00:57:04.714 --> 00:57:06.842
and perfect for
demoralizing your enemy.

818
00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:08.798
How long would the operation take?

819
00:57:08.966 --> 00:57:10.258
Just say the word.

820
00:57:10.342 --> 00:57:13.298
and a warhead will be dropped
over North Korea in half an hour.

821
00:57:13.382 --> 00:57:14.382
And our target?

822
00:57:14.426 --> 00:57:15.506
The bridge.

823
00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:17.090
On the North Korean side.

824
00:57:17.134 --> 00:57:18.966
where the Chinese are
assembling their troops.

825
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:22.590
We blow it up. keeping the Chinese
from crossing into North Korea

826
00:57:22.674 --> 00:57:25.342
and sending a clear
warning to both sides.

827
00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:27.218
Do it.

828
00:57:27.634 --> 00:57:29.674
All right. There's just one problem.

829
00:57:30.426 --> 00:57:32.134
If we fire an ICBM.

830
00:57:32.218 --> 00:57:35.798
Russia and China might think
it's a nuclear attack and fire back.

831
00:57:36.426 --> 00:57:39.506
They once mistook one of
our missile tests for an attack.

832
00:57:39.634 --> 00:57:42.466
and we barely avoided
an all-out nuclear war.

833
00:57:43.174 --> 00:57:44.674
So this time.

834
00:57:44.966 --> 00:57:47.550
we're gonna have to
give them a heads up.

835
00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:51.926
Aren't they allied with
the North Koreans?

836
00:57:52.466 --> 00:57:54.218
Look. If we fire without warning.

837
00:57:54.298 --> 00:57:58.674
the entire human race could
be obliterated in under an hour.

838
00:58:06.006 --> 00:58:07.426
We got the evidence.

839
00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:12.218
Since we saved China. keep
your promise to help North Korea.

840
00:58:14.174 --> 00:58:14.966
Understood.

841
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.258
I'm sure it will go as planned.

842
00:58:17.882 --> 00:58:20.550
I'll see you next time in Pyongyang.

843
00:58:21.966 --> 00:58:23.134
Comrade!

844
00:58:23.426 --> 00:58:25.966
Transmit this to the
Chinese PLA frequency.

845
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:27.218
Yes. sir!

846
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:32.634
During the 2008 financial crisis.

847
00:58:32.758 --> 00:58:36.966
the U.S. moved its Pacific
fleet to Afghanistan and Iraq.

848
00:58:37.674 --> 00:58:41.006
Then China sent some nuclear
submarines to the Pacific.

849
00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.926
The U.S. was furious when it found out.

850
00:58:44.426 --> 00:58:46.466
but there wasn't enough money.

851
00:58:46.674 --> 00:58:50.134
The U.S. proposed to Japan
to block Chinese expansion.

852
00:58:50.342 --> 00:58:54.882
The U.S. would block south of
Taiwan and Japan to the north.

853
00:58:55.926 --> 00:58:57.466
Japan took the offer

854
00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:03.590
as an approval for a 'normal'
war-making Japanese state.

855
00:59:04.798 --> 00:59:08.758
Japan built its forces. claiming it's
due to North Korean nuclear threat.

856
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:10.426
But in reality.

857
00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:13.842
Japan and the U.S. did
it to keep China in check.

858
00:59:14.882 --> 00:59:18.174
But since we declared
we'll give up our weapons.

859
00:59:18.258 --> 00:59:20.798
Japan loses justification
for militarization. right?

860
00:59:20.882 --> 00:59:23.134
When the U.S. started pressuring Japan

861
00:59:23.218 --> 00:59:26.466
to cut the act and
face off against China.

862
00:59:26.798 --> 00:59:31.298
Japan chose to rather
fight South Korea on Dokdo

863
00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:35.966
or revive the North
Korean nuclear threat.

864
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:40.090
With help from China. apparently.

865
00:59:41.634 --> 00:59:43.050
How are you feeling?

866
00:59:43.674 --> 00:59:44.926
You okay?

867
00:59:45.674 --> 00:59:46.714
Water.

868
00:59:46.966 --> 00:59:48.298
Very thirsty.

869
01:00:00.342 --> 01:00:03.426
But what does China get from all this?

870
01:00:04.926 --> 01:00:07.342
China averts the war
they're destined to fight.

871
01:00:07.426 --> 01:00:10.590
Destined? What do you mean?

872
01:00:10.798 --> 01:00:14.550
When a rising power and
ruling power come into conflict.

873
01:00:14.758 --> 01:00:17.382
historically. it led to war 80%.

874
01:00:18.714 --> 01:00:21.134
Tensions between a rising China

875
01:00:21.258 --> 01:00:23.714
and a ruling America are no different.

876
01:00:23.966 --> 01:00:27.174
It's all in the book.
'Destined for War'.

877
01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:30.506
More water. please.

878
01:00:32.006 --> 01:00:39.006
The current situation is the result of
trying to define the frontline of war.

879
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.174
Thanks.

880
01:00:40.758 --> 01:00:43.882
Will it be Senkaku or Dokdo?

881
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.882
What are you two talking about? Eh?

882
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:50.926
The world does not
revolve around you. America.

883
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:54.634
And I'm gonna make America great again.

884
01:00:55.031 --> 01:00:59.699
Pax Americana! America first.

885
01:01:00.382 --> 01:01:02.050
God bless America.

886
01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:03.966
President Smoot.

887
01:01:04.966 --> 01:01:08.050
You say you'll make
America great again.

888
01:01:08.426 --> 01:01:11.342
But America has been
great since its founding.

889
01:01:12.582 --> 01:01:15.418
A country built to uphold freedom
of conscience and religion.

890
01:01:15.498 --> 01:01:18.166
The first country to claim
independence from colonial rule.

891
01:01:18.498 --> 01:01:20.998
The first to establish a republic
based on separation of powers.

892
01:01:21.374 --> 01:01:25.706
America's greatness lies in the
ideals that birthed and sustained it.

893
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:29.042
not in its might.

894
01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.790
Say it in English.

895
01:01:37.498 --> 01:01:39.374
He can't understand.

896
01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:47.206
Ah... I can understand it well.

897
01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:51.082
but speaking doesn't come easy.

898
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:55.042
South Korean cramming
education has far to go.

899
01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:57.582
I guess I shouldn't say that.

900
01:01:59.914 --> 01:02:02.290
Do you really understand English?

901
01:02:02.666 --> 01:02:05.042
I can understand 100%.

902
01:02:10.582 --> 01:02:11.582
90%.

903
01:02:15.914 --> 01:02:17.250
85%.

904
01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:19.790
80...

905
01:02:21.166 --> 01:02:23.626
80%. I understand that much for sure.

906
01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:26.126
Fuck! Didn't your
mothers ever teach you

907
01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:31.042
that it's rude to talk like this in
googly gook in front of a guest.

908
01:02:31.834 --> 01:02:33.582
Come on! What's he saying?

909
01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.542
But...

910
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.914
He said...

911
01:02:45.042 --> 01:02:49.626
Repeat what you said again. slowly.

912
01:02:52.334 --> 01:02:53.418
President Smoot.

913
01:02:53.642 --> 01:02:54.974
President Smoot.

914
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.890
Yeah.

915
01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:57.806
You say you’ll make U.S.A. great again.

916
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.518
The United States of...

917
01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:01.910
<i>Moscow. Russia</i>

918
01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:03.266
Yes. I understand.

919
01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:04.558
Good luck.

920
01:03:08.182 --> 01:03:10.934
<i>ICBM Facility. USA</i>

921
01:03:18.565 --> 01:03:20.617
<i>Beijing. China</i>

922
01:03:20.642 --> 01:03:22.058
Madam Vice President.

923
01:03:22.682 --> 01:03:25.766
We're concerned about your
situation and send our condolences.

924
01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:29.142
But we've received
some unusual information.

925
01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:31.014
Could you explain this?

926
01:03:32.506 --> 01:03:38.674
<i>A U.S. submarine is gonna
sink a Japanese boat in Senkaku.</i>

927
01:03:38.758 --> 01:03:41.050
No! This is bullshit!

928
01:03:41.506 --> 01:03:42.718
This is a conspiracy!

929
01:03:42.798 --> 01:03:45.842
And you can bet that the
North Koreans are responsible.

930
01:03:54.966 --> 01:03:59.718
The U.S. just fired an ICBM near
the border of China and North Korea.

931
01:04:01.134 --> 01:04:02.966
Is it a nuclear attack?

932
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.926
No. it's a conventional
ballistic missile.

933
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:09.758
Get the U.S. Secretary
of Defense on the line.

934
01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:12.506
We have been a strong alliance.

935
01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:14.798
You should've notified
us before the attack.

936
01:04:14.882 --> 01:04:19.798
Telling us afterwards is improper
communication between allies.

937
01:04:21.342 --> 01:04:23.966
Anyway. we appreciate your cooperation.

938
01:04:27.174 --> 01:04:28.426
Shit.

939
01:04:30.006 --> 01:04:35.090
The President has told the
North Koreans everything.

940
01:04:36.634 --> 01:04:37.758
The Korean government says

941
01:04:37.842 --> 01:04:41.090
there is reason to believe Japan
and China are also in on the coup.

942
01:04:41.214 --> 01:04:42.674
Japan and China?

943
01:04:42.718 --> 01:04:45.674
The Chinese Government
apparently transferred a billion dollars

944
01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:48.718
to a powerful Japanese tycoon.

945
01:04:48.758 --> 01:04:50.966
Million years America
could ever agree...

946
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:54.134
The U.S. fired a
missile at our Republic!

947
01:04:54.926 --> 01:04:58.590
An ICBM at that!

948
01:04:59.134 --> 01:05:00.506
Was it nuclear?

949
01:05:00.718 --> 01:05:01.966
Next time.

950
01:05:02.174 --> 01:05:04.090
it probably will be!

951
01:05:04.214 --> 01:05:07.718
Your country fired an
ICBM at my country!

952
01:05:10.798 --> 01:05:12.758
Well. sir. with all due respect.

953
01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:15.342
If you don't get me
off the sub right now.

954
01:05:15.426 --> 01:05:16.718
we're all gonna die.

955
01:05:16.798 --> 01:05:17.634
- Start it.
- Yes. sir.

956
01:05:17.674 --> 01:05:20.342
I mean. if it wasn't for
him. and uh his coup.

957
01:05:20.506 --> 01:05:22.718
we would all be entering
a whole new era right now.

958
01:05:22.798 --> 01:05:24.174
But instead we are all gonna die.

959
01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:25.342
Tell him to read it.

960
01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:27.342
Say what I'm saying.

961
01:05:28.882 --> 01:05:30.506
I am in talks with North Korea.

962
01:05:30.882 --> 01:05:32.550
Do not attack without my order.

963
01:05:32.874 --> 01:05:35.042
I am safe and I have not been harmed.

964
01:05:35.126 --> 01:05:37.542
Excuse me. No. I'm not saying that.

965
01:05:37.998 --> 01:05:40.334
Not in front of a
camera. There's just no...

966
01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.834
Okay. would you repeat that please?

967
01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:45.498
I am in talks with North Korea.

968
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.626
I am in talks with North Korea.

969
01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:50.834
Do not attack without my order.

970
01:05:50.874 --> 01:05:54.582
<i>No attacks are to be
made without my order.</i>

971
01:05:54.706 --> 01:05:55.790
<i>I repeat.</i>

972
01:05:55.998 --> 01:05:57.374
<i>I am safe.</i>

973
01:05:57.626 --> 01:06:01.874
Tell the CIA to verify the South
Koreans' intel as soon as possible.

974
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.690
Comrade PARK!

975
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:17.026
Tell me what you were going to
do for the Japanese for the money.

976
01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.066
Let's go. sir.

977
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.314
Stay out of it!

978
01:06:20.066 --> 01:06:23.026
This is my final order
for Commander PARK.

979
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.358
Fine.

980
01:06:26.398 --> 01:06:30.234
I can indulge you one
last time for old times' sake.

981
01:06:30.858 --> 01:06:36.190
Japan asked us to torpedo one
of its patrol ships near Dokdo.

982
01:06:36.566 --> 01:06:40.650
They want to carry out
Operation Kagemusha on Dokdo?

983
01:06:40.898 --> 01:06:42.190
For a few pennies.

984
01:06:43.314 --> 01:06:45.274
you'd sell your compatriots?

985
01:06:47.274 --> 01:06:52.774
They colonized us and is responsible
for the war that split us in two!

986
01:06:52.858 --> 01:06:53.774
That's not all.

987
01:06:54.234 --> 01:06:57.066
<i>Japan did not only ask for a torpedo.</i>

988
01:06:57.234 --> 01:07:00.774
<i>They said if South Korea falls.
it'd be good for both them and us.</i>

989
01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:03.734
<i>They asked to fire a nuclear
missile at South Korea.</i>

990
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:10.442
Since I got my $500
million. I'll fire a torpedo.

991
01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.150
They said if a war breaks out on Dokdo.

992
01:07:13.234 --> 01:07:17.190
Japan will win and South Korea's
military forces will be annihilated.

993
01:07:17.274 --> 01:07:19.566
Wouldn't that be good for our Republic?

994
01:07:19.982 --> 01:07:22.858
A peace treaty was within reach!

995
01:07:23.358 --> 01:07:26.026
What peace after being
enemies for 70 years?

996
01:07:26.106 --> 01:07:28.650
What really matters
is our nuclear missiles.

997
01:07:28.774 --> 01:07:31.234
I'll be firing one as well.

998
01:07:32.066 --> 01:07:34.526
Not so fast!

999
01:07:35.066 --> 01:07:36.774
President HAN!

1000
01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:39.690
I wasn't finished talking!

1001
01:07:40.942 --> 01:07:42.858
Yes. I'll fire the missile.

1002
01:07:42.942 --> 01:07:47.066
Not at South Korea. but at Japan.

1003
01:07:47.774 --> 01:07:49.734
If I fire it at Japan.

1004
01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:54.314
who cares about the UN sanctions!

1005
01:07:54.898 --> 01:07:57.566
China promised us a
generous $10 billion in aid.

1006
01:07:57.690 --> 01:08:00.858
And $5 billion more
every year after that.

1007
01:08:00.942 --> 01:08:01.982
Comrade Chairman!

1008
01:08:02.066 --> 01:08:05.606
$5 billion can restart food
distribution to our people.

1009
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:07.026
Commander.

1010
01:08:08.734 --> 01:08:14.026
If you fire at Japan. the
U.S. will nuke North Korea.

1011
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:17.774
But we have President Smoot.

1012
01:08:18.869 --> 01:08:20.213
What's he saying now?

1013
01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:24.458
Japan wants him to fire a
nuclear missile at South Korea.

1014
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.414
But China wants him to attack Japan.

1015
01:08:27.542 --> 01:08:30.998
so he decided to fire on Japan instead.

1016
01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:32.542
However. he said.

1017
01:08:32.626 --> 01:08:36.542
North Korea is safe as
long as you are his hostage.

1018
01:08:38.458 --> 01:08:41.542
Safe? Because I'm your hostage?

1019
01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:43.542
I don't think so.

1020
01:08:44.226 --> 01:08:48.226
See. you have no idea how
many people in America

1021
01:08:48.306 --> 01:08:49.890
hate my guts.

1022
01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:53.474
And Republicans will look the other way

1023
01:08:53.598 --> 01:08:55.682
and Democrats will
probably throw a party.

1024
01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:59.474
The Neocons will celebrate
with a campaign donation spree.

1025
01:09:00.306 --> 01:09:02.266
Well. that will be the end of you.

1026
01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:04.682
- What is it?
- A word. sir.

1027
01:09:07.306 --> 01:09:10.098
<i>- You're safe if you</i>
- They heard everything. sir.

1028
01:09:10.226 --> 01:09:13.806
<i>take me in the White House in 24 hours.</i>

1029
01:09:13.934 --> 01:09:15.726
You let everything be heard?

1030
01:09:15.806 --> 01:09:17.434
I couldn't interfere...

1031
01:09:17.514 --> 01:09:20.474
Lock up the weapons
and check on the men.

1032
01:09:20.642 --> 01:09:22.018
<i>Good guys. Come on!</i>

1033
01:09:22.142 --> 01:09:23.226
Shake my hand.

1034
01:09:30.598 --> 01:09:32.934
On this submarine.

1035
01:09:33.474 --> 01:09:36.018
I have the U.S. President. you.

1036
01:09:36.474 --> 01:09:39.306
and the Chairman as hostages.

1037
01:09:43.018 --> 01:09:45.598
And we're hundreds
of meters underwater.

1038
01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:48.434
Don't mess with me.

1039
01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:12.018
From our sub?

1040
01:10:12.266 --> 01:10:13.390
Didn't you hear?

1041
01:10:28.306 --> 01:10:29.514
Yeah. you know.

1042
01:10:29.598 --> 01:10:33.306
You nuke an American
ally. America nukes you back.

1043
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:36.350
China? Does he really think
China has got what it takes

1044
01:10:36.434 --> 01:10:38.266
in a nuclear war?

1045
01:10:40.266 --> 01:10:42.058
Hey. I'm talking to you!

1046
01:10:42.226 --> 01:10:43.974
You wasted all our time

1047
01:10:44.098 --> 01:10:47.558
weighing your options back and forth.
forth and back and for what? I mean.

1048
01:10:47.598 --> 01:10:49.974
if you just gave us your fucking
weapons in the first place.

1049
01:10:50.058 --> 01:10:52.018
we wouldn't be here
right now. would we?

1050
01:10:52.058 --> 01:10:55.850
We are here because of
America's selfish arrogance.

1051
01:10:56.098 --> 01:10:59.907
We expected you to just
keep the same pace with us!

1052
01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:03.574
Consider our circumstances! But no!

1053
01:11:03.598 --> 01:11:07.041
You just wanted our complete surrender!

1054
01:11:07.066 --> 01:11:12.182
How many times have you promised one
thing and then you do another thing. uh?

1055
01:11:13.098 --> 01:11:16.890
You sound like America
always keeps your promises.

1056
01:11:17.118 --> 01:11:20.904
But you are the one who
never keep your promises.

1057
01:11:20.929 --> 01:11:22.326
You know what? We have rules.

1058
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:24.242
We don't bend to dictators like you!

1059
01:11:24.326 --> 01:11:25.406
Go fuck yourself!

1060
01:11:25.534 --> 01:11:26.198
Fuck you!

1061
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:26.866
Fuck you!

1062
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:27.658
Fuck you!

1063
01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:28.450
Yeah. fuck you!

1064
01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:28.950
Fuck you!

1065
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:30.406
- You can't even keep your fingers in line.
- Shut up!

1066
01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:31.406
Shut up!

1067
01:11:33.698 --> 01:11:35.326
We're all too late!

1068
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:38.118
Mr. Chairman.

1069
01:11:39.118 --> 01:11:42.866
To talk to Americans. try to
understand the way they talk.

1070
01:11:43.782 --> 01:11:46.698
You waited decades
for talks with the U.S..

1071
01:11:46.906 --> 01:11:51.950
but didn't bother to learn how
best to communicate and negotiate?

1072
01:11:56.406 --> 01:11:57.866
President Smoot.

1073
01:11:59.118 --> 01:12:00.782
You should remember.

1074
01:12:01.658 --> 01:12:03.326
In human history.

1075
01:12:04.074 --> 01:12:07.450
the greatest weapon
of a great empire is

1076
01:12:07.574 --> 01:12:08.906
tolerance

1077
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:10.698
and...

1078
01:12:14.421 --> 01:12:15.293
Engagement?

1079
01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:16.614
Engagement!

1080
01:12:18.158 --> 01:12:19.118
Engagement!

1081
01:12:19.406 --> 01:12:20.826
Engagement!

1082
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:38.242
President HAN.

1083
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:42.782
That you must endure
this trouble on my account.

1084
01:12:44.242 --> 01:12:46.034
I apologize.

1085
01:12:50.826 --> 01:12:52.282
President Smoot.

1086
01:12:52.366 --> 01:12:53.242
Yeap.

1087
01:12:54.326 --> 01:12:55.406
This is...

1088
01:12:55.614 --> 01:12:57.074
all my fault.

1089
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:59.826
Yeah. well... Okay!

1090
01:13:00.118 --> 01:13:01.950
Yeah. Let's get it out!

1091
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:06.198
I mean. what the fuck makes
Dokdo so important anyway?

1092
01:13:06.337 --> 01:13:10.881
I mean. what makes it so fucking
important that South Korea and Japan

1093
01:13:10.906 --> 01:13:15.282
gotta go to war over some shitty
little rock in the middle of the ocean?

1094
01:13:15.326 --> 01:13:16.866
Please translate.

1095
01:13:19.118 --> 01:13:24.326
Dokdo is the first territory Japan
seized when it occupied Korea.

1096
01:13:24.658 --> 01:13:29.990
Dokdo is the first seized territory
when Japan invaded Korea.

1097
01:13:30.326 --> 01:13:30.990
Yeah.

1098
01:13:31.118 --> 01:13:36.032
Till Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.
which started the World War II.

1099
01:13:36.057 --> 01:13:38.614
and that paved the way
for your independence.

1100
01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:41.734
And you know. I mean. we've
been pretty good allies to you guys.

1101
01:13:41.814 --> 01:13:43.858
America's the good guys. Right?

1102
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.106
You're right.

1103
01:13:45.318 --> 01:13:46.482
Good guys!

1104
01:13:47.358 --> 01:13:49.942
When the U.S. won and
Korea got its independence.

1105
01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:52.942
signatories to the Cairo and
Potsdam Declarations made it clear

1106
01:13:53.066 --> 01:13:57.606
that Dokdo was Korean territory.
and prohibited Japan from it.

1107
01:13:58.606 --> 01:14:01.398
The United States won the war

1108
01:14:01.566 --> 01:14:05.398
and due to the Cairo Declaration
and Potsdam Declaration.

1109
01:14:06.026 --> 01:14:08.606
Korea won its independence

1110
01:14:08.774 --> 01:14:11.734
and Dokdo became a
Korean territory again.

1111
01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:15.190
And Japan was never
allowed to come near.

1112
01:14:15.274 --> 01:14:18.318
What's Japan's deal with
it? They got a claim or what?

1113
01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:20.150
During the Korean War.

1114
01:14:20.398 --> 01:14:22.566
in the case that Korea
fell to communism.

1115
01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:29.055
Dean Rusk. Assistant Secretary of State.
wrote Dokdo may not be Korean territory.

1116
01:14:29.234 --> 01:14:30.774
Japan is using that to claim Dokdo.

1117
01:14:30.858 --> 01:14:32.650
During the Korean War.

1118
01:14:32.814 --> 01:14:36.442
in the case that Korea
fell to communism.

1119
01:14:36.566 --> 01:14:38.482
Dean Rusk. U.S. government man.

1120
01:14:38.566 --> 01:14:39.274
Who?

1121
01:14:39.318 --> 01:14:40.274
Dean Rusk.

1122
01:14:40.398 --> 01:14:46.234
Ah.. wrote a memo that Dokdo
did not appear to be Korean territory.

1123
01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:50.690
Japan uses his personal
memo to back up their claims.

1124
01:14:50.814 --> 01:14:51.942
Okay. okay. okay.

1125
01:14:52.066 --> 01:14:53.066
I mean...

1126
01:14:54.942 --> 01:14:57.318
I mean. where is this Dodko place?

1127
01:14:58.734 --> 01:14:59.398
Dokdo.

1128
01:14:59.526 --> 01:15:00.150
Dokdo!

1129
01:15:00.442 --> 01:15:01.318
Dodko. Where is it?

1130
01:15:01.398 --> 01:15:02.358
Dokdo!

1131
01:15:02.442 --> 01:15:03.066
Dodko.

1132
01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:03.650
Dokdo!

1133
01:15:03.690 --> 01:15:05.106
Dokdo. Dock-do.

1134
01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:06.318
Dokdo!

1135
01:15:06.358 --> 01:15:06.898
There!

1136
01:15:06.982 --> 01:15:07.734
There.

1137
01:15:16.398 --> 01:15:17.190
Japan is...

1138
01:15:17.234 --> 01:15:20.734
Stop talking. please!
I'm tired of translating.

1139
01:15:21.442 --> 01:15:22.442
President Smoot?

1140
01:15:22.526 --> 01:15:26.150
Can we all shut up?
Together. okay? Uh? Uh?

1141
01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:28.858
Yeah. yeah... I'm tired. man.

1142
01:15:29.234 --> 01:15:32.150
You guys fuck me up. you know? Man.

1143
01:15:33.274 --> 01:15:36.566
Hey. hey. No smoking. Okay?
We are indoors. Come on.

1144
01:15:36.858 --> 01:15:38.066
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1145
01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:41.398
Erectile dysfunction for
fuck's sake. Come on. man.

1146
01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:42.982
You're killing me here.

1147
01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:44.234
Come on!

1148
01:15:45.026 --> 01:15:46.982
This is my submarine!

1149
01:15:47.066 --> 01:15:49.066
- Second-hand smoke!
- I'm tired!

1150
01:15:49.106 --> 01:15:51.358
I will just have a few. Okay?

1151
01:15:51.482 --> 01:15:52.606
- You're killing me here!
- Only one!

1152
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:54.606
It's a fucking nuclear submarine!

1153
01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.734
I am tired!

1154
01:15:55.814 --> 01:15:56.566
All right.

1155
01:15:57.106 --> 01:15:58.482
You wanna smoke indoors?

1156
01:15:58.566 --> 01:16:00.482
I'm gonna take a fucking shit

1157
01:16:00.606 --> 01:16:02.398
and I'm gonna leave
the door open. All right?

1158
01:16:02.482 --> 01:16:03.606
- Come on! Stop.
- How about that?

1159
01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:04.442
Stop!

1160
01:16:08.734 --> 01:16:09.942
See ya.

1161
01:16:16.066 --> 01:16:17.942
What are you doing?

1162
01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.734
Would you prefer to smell that?

1163
01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:25.482
That's how you make a deal.

1164
01:16:28.606 --> 01:16:32.734
One's smoking. the other's farting.
I'm always stuck in the middle.

1165
01:16:34.514 --> 01:16:36.259
Rise to periscope depth.

1166
01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.814
- Periscope depth!
- Yes. sir!

1167
01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:51.398
I don't see anything.

1168
01:16:52.898 --> 01:16:53.942
Comrade.

1169
01:16:54.442 --> 01:16:56.318
Radio a message here.

1170
01:16:57.442 --> 01:17:01.650
Tell them we've arrived.
but we don't see the tuna.

1171
01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:24.106
<i>Tuna catching postponed due to typhoon.
Tuna will appear once it passes.</i>

1172
01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:28.190
Dive to maximum operating depth.

1173
01:17:28.318 --> 01:17:30.234
Set depth for 90 meters.

1174
01:17:40.274 --> 01:17:42.190
I'm kinda thirsty. you know.

1175
01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:43.898
Can't drink that.

1176
01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.974
Are you guys hungry? Huh?

1177
01:17:48.806 --> 01:17:49.766
Hey!

1178
01:17:51.014 --> 01:17:52.058
You hungry?

1179
01:17:53.518 --> 01:17:54.766
Hungry!

1180
01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:57.934
Officer!

1181
01:17:58.226 --> 01:17:59.142
Hungry!

1182
01:17:59.306 --> 01:18:00.182
Officer!

1183
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:01.518
Officer!

1184
01:18:05.766 --> 01:18:08.014
The American President is hungry.

1185
01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:10.390
- Bring some food and water.
- I want some burger...

1186
01:18:10.518 --> 01:18:11.474
Fries.

1187
01:18:11.682 --> 01:18:13.058
Chocolate milkshakes.

1188
01:18:14.806 --> 01:18:17.142
Hey. I haven't finished...

1189
01:18:17.934 --> 01:18:19.726
What kind of food do they serve here?

1190
01:18:20.014 --> 01:18:22.098
They are requesting food and water.

1191
01:18:34.474 --> 01:18:35.934
Eat comfortably.

1192
01:18:45.766 --> 01:18:46.766
Sit.

1193
01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.014
The Chairman is on our sub. right?

1194
01:18:50.182 --> 01:18:51.642
Didn't you hear him?

1195
01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:58.226
Back then.

1196
01:18:59.642 --> 01:19:02.934
Wasn't it the Chairman's
voice on the intercom?

1197
01:19:03.014 --> 01:19:05.558
But wasn't it strange?

1198
01:19:05.682 --> 01:19:08.266
The Chairman mentioned
a traitor and yelled.

1199
01:19:08.434 --> 01:19:10.474
Something about
shooting a nuke at Japan.

1200
01:19:10.558 --> 01:19:11.350
Right.

1201
01:19:12.098 --> 01:19:13.850
It sounded like.

1202
01:19:15.726 --> 01:19:18.518
the Chairman's not
here for an inspection.

1203
01:19:19.682 --> 01:19:21.058
but he's being held prisoner.

1204
01:19:21.098 --> 01:19:22.890
The Chairman? A prisoner?

1205
01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:25.682
By who?

1206
01:19:26.682 --> 01:19:28.726
If we fire a nuke at Japan.

1207
01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:31.058
our country will be attacked too.

1208
01:19:31.806 --> 01:19:33.474
What do we do?

1209
01:19:34.467 --> 01:19:38.098
What if we rescue the Chairman?

1210
01:19:40.426 --> 01:19:44.882
Wouldn't we be made
heroes of the Republic?

1211
01:19:46.466 --> 01:19:48.758
We'll be heroes for sure.

1212
01:19:54.882 --> 01:19:56.718
What were you talking about?

1213
01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:03.174
If you want to see
your mothers. stay put.

1214
01:20:06.298 --> 01:20:07.550
Sir!

1215
01:20:10.258 --> 01:20:13.214
Are we really firing a
nuclear missile at Japan?

1216
01:20:15.842 --> 01:20:17.550
They said if we do.

1217
01:20:18.466 --> 01:20:21.050
the U.S. will fire one at us.

1218
01:20:21.298 --> 01:20:23.758
Then we won't see our mothers. sir.

1219
01:20:29.298 --> 01:20:30.298
No.

1220
01:20:32.966 --> 01:20:34.050
Yeah!

1221
01:20:36.426 --> 01:20:39.006
The sub is new. but it stinks.

1222
01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:43.550
Stench is another problem
with submarines.

1223
01:20:44.758 --> 01:20:46.798
It's because the old man farted.

1224
01:20:46.882 --> 01:20:47.798
Thank you.

1225
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:49.382
What's he saying?

1226
01:20:49.882 --> 01:20:51.134
You smell!

1227
01:20:51.214 --> 01:20:52.926
Oh. no!

1228
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:55.214
Oh. he smoky. smoky!

1229
01:20:55.426 --> 01:20:57.926
You have my sympathy. Mr. President.

1230
01:20:58.342 --> 01:21:00.298
Such trouble for you.

1231
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:04.634
The food isn't much. but please enjoy.

1232
01:21:07.798 --> 01:21:08.758
Wait...

1233
01:21:14.028 --> 01:21:16.090
Wow! This tastes like shit.

1234
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:19.718
What is this?

1235
01:21:20.134 --> 01:21:22.258
That is sokdojeon-tteok.

1236
01:21:22.382 --> 01:21:26.174
Made of corn flour. salt. and sugar.

1237
01:21:27.426 --> 01:21:31.050
And this is injokogibap.

1238
01:21:40.506 --> 01:21:42.006
Are you okay?

1239
01:21:44.426 --> 01:21:45.634
Are you all right?

1240
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:52.674
Are you okay?

1241
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:58.050
Are you okay?

1242
01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:10.090
What is this?

1243
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:19.006
"Whatever you hear outside
 don't come out. sir."

1244
01:22:28.926 --> 01:22:30.134
Wait. what does it say?

1245
01:22:30.214 --> 01:22:33.342
Whatever sounds you hear outside
of cabin. do not leave. okay?

1246
01:22:36.426 --> 01:22:39.258
Hey. what are you doing? Hey. hey!

1247
01:22:39.798 --> 01:22:41.258
That is fixed!

1248
01:22:50.718 --> 01:22:52.382
That will keep them out.

1249
01:22:59.093 --> 01:23:02.593
You don't mind if I
eat your food. right?

1250
01:23:04.842 --> 01:23:06.550
I'll never smoke.

1251
01:23:07.506 --> 01:23:08.798
Good kid.

1252
01:23:09.798 --> 01:23:10.798
He's a good kid.

1253
01:23:10.882 --> 01:23:11.926
Come on. eat.

1254
01:23:23.214 --> 01:23:24.966
You'll damage the sub!

1255
01:23:37.506 --> 01:23:39.466
Don't spill as you eat.

1256
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.674
They haven't caught on. sir.

1257
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:59.466
You boys. cover fire from here.
Make sure they don't go in the cabin.

1258
01:24:20.926 --> 01:24:21.426
Stop!

1259
01:24:21.506 --> 01:24:25.382
Let's save the Chairman with our lives!

1260
01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:27.426
You'll get killed!

1261
01:24:27.758 --> 01:24:28.674
Stay put!

1262
01:24:33.926 --> 01:24:35.382
Come back!

1263
01:24:42.634 --> 01:24:44.006
No!

1264
01:24:44.214 --> 01:24:45.506
Are you all right?

1265
01:24:48.718 --> 01:24:50.926
Don't be swayed! Keep your posts!

1266
01:24:59.466 --> 01:25:01.090
Move them over there.

1267
01:25:14.134 --> 01:25:15.342
Myung-chul! No!

1268
01:25:19.006 --> 01:25:20.090
Get him!

1269
01:25:26.758 --> 01:25:27.842
Bullets!

1270
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:31.282
Die!

1271
01:26:04.126 --> 01:26:05.626
Follow me. sir.

1272
01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.166
Oh. shit.

1273
01:26:10.918 --> 01:26:12.542
How many steps!

1274
01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:15.334
Captain! Inspect all the equipment!

1275
01:26:16.042 --> 01:26:17.334
Inspect all the equipment!

1276
01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:18.542
Inspect the equipment!

1277
01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:19.874
Propulsion system. clear!

1278
01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:21.626
Communication system. clear!

1279
01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:29.458
Don't mind me.

1280
01:26:30.334 --> 01:26:33.582
In case of an emergency.
while the Chairman is here.

1281
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:36.750
a rescue sphere was installed
above the torpedo room.

1282
01:26:37.126 --> 01:26:39.250
They'll use the maintenance passage.

1283
01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:40.666
Down there.

1284
01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:42.414
It's through there.

1285
01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:45.626
Go after them.

1286
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:47.626
If you can't seize them alive.

1287
01:26:47.706 --> 01:26:49.374
you may kill them.

1288
01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:54.790
Chul-woo...

1289
01:26:57.706 --> 01:27:01.250
Trust me and hang on.

1290
01:27:10.126 --> 01:27:11.918
The rescue sphere is up there.

1291
01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:14.334
You can take it and
go up to the surface. sir.

1292
01:27:14.626 --> 01:27:16.958
There is a rescue sphere.

1293
01:27:17.042 --> 01:27:17.834
Huh?

1294
01:27:17.918 --> 01:27:19.542
Oh well. that's good. Let's go!

1295
01:27:19.626 --> 01:27:21.458
- Come on!
- Hey. hey. hey! Wait. wait. wait.

1296
01:27:21.742 --> 01:27:22.198
What?

1297
01:27:22.242 --> 01:27:23.490
The problem is...

1298
01:27:24.074 --> 01:27:27.034
It was made for the Chairman
to escape in an emergency.

1299
01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:28.866
Only one can get in.

1300
01:27:29.282 --> 01:27:30.782
We have bad news.

1301
01:27:30.866 --> 01:27:32.326
Only one person can get in.

1302
01:27:32.366 --> 01:27:34.074
Oh. fuck! Fuck!

1303
01:27:34.406 --> 01:27:36.742
Hey. hey. hey! Where
do you think you're going?

1304
01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:41.118
Let's take the chair out.

1305
01:27:42.658 --> 01:27:45.614
- What's he saying?
- He said take the chair out.

1306
01:27:46.034 --> 01:27:48.534
- Why?
- Make more space.

1307
01:27:48.866 --> 01:27:50.366
For how many?

1308
01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:52.574
I think...

1309
01:27:53.158 --> 01:27:53.826
Two?

1310
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:55.034
Two?

1311
01:27:56.574 --> 01:27:59.698
But there's three of us.

1312
01:27:59.866 --> 01:28:01.782
Hey. hey. hey! Be careful!

1313
01:28:05.366 --> 01:28:06.866
Burst in!

1314
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:09.366
Mr. Chairman! Escape. sir!

1315
01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:10.490
Open up!

1316
01:28:11.574 --> 01:28:12.614
Open up now!

1317
01:28:16.074 --> 01:28:17.574
Are you all. okay?

1318
01:28:27.534 --> 01:28:28.698
Step aside. please!

1319
01:28:34.906 --> 01:28:36.242
Almost done. sir.

1320
01:28:38.658 --> 01:28:40.034
Comrade!

1321
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:42.158
Is that a grenade?

1322
01:28:42.282 --> 01:28:43.990
That's a fucking grenade!

1323
01:28:44.326 --> 01:28:45.614
It's a grenade!

1324
01:28:47.282 --> 01:28:50.282
I'm gonna change and be a
good man. I'll do anything you say.

1325
01:28:50.366 --> 01:28:51.990
Just get me out of this situation.

1326
01:28:52.534 --> 01:28:53.782
Hold it tightly.

1327
01:28:55.614 --> 01:28:56.490
Done.

1328
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:57.950
Got it?

1329
01:29:03.158 --> 01:29:04.074
It's ready. sir.

1330
01:29:04.326 --> 01:29:05.534
Come up. sir!

1331
01:29:05.866 --> 01:29:08.282
Oh! Thank you. dear Lord.

1332
01:29:08.658 --> 01:29:10.326
Okay. now.

1333
01:29:11.658 --> 01:29:14.282
I don't think the three of us
are gonna be able to get in there.

1334
01:29:14.366 --> 01:29:16.198
So we gotta make a choice.

1335
01:29:16.282 --> 01:29:17.866
Who's coming with me?

1336
01:29:20.534 --> 01:29:21.614
You two!

1337
01:29:21.742 --> 01:29:22.866
I'm the commander here!

1338
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:24.074
Mr. Chairman!

1339
01:29:26.366 --> 01:29:28.950
I'm not doing this
because you're special.

1340
01:29:29.326 --> 01:29:33.614
You have to stay alive to finish
the summit and fix this mess.

1341
01:29:35.826 --> 01:29:36.742
Please go up.

1342
01:29:36.782 --> 01:29:38.282
Yeah. we gotta go. Come on.

1343
01:29:38.534 --> 01:29:39.990
It's not time for talking.

1344
01:29:40.198 --> 01:29:43.282
He insists us to get in.

1345
01:29:44.198 --> 01:29:48.614
We have to be alive to prevent
war and finish our negotiations.

1346
01:29:48.698 --> 01:29:51.534
And he's absolutely
right. You're a smart guy.

1347
01:29:51.574 --> 01:29:54.614
We gotta prevent war. We
gotta finish the negotiations.

1348
01:29:54.782 --> 01:29:56.782
Soon as I'm on land. him and me.

1349
01:29:56.826 --> 01:29:58.614
we're gonna sign that peace treaty.

1350
01:29:58.782 --> 01:30:01.534
Nuclear non-proliferation deal.

1351
01:30:02.118 --> 01:30:04.574
We're gonna have peace in our time.

1352
01:30:06.366 --> 01:30:08.326
And I thank you President HAN.

1353
01:30:09.034 --> 01:30:12.698
for your contribution
and your sacrifice.

1354
01:30:14.574 --> 01:30:16.118
You are a brave man.

1355
01:30:16.742 --> 01:30:17.866
Here.

1356
01:30:18.866 --> 01:30:20.282
You're gonna need that!

1357
01:30:37.698 --> 01:30:38.906
Mr. Chairman.

1358
01:30:42.406 --> 01:30:44.450
Don't fight with the U.S.

1359
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:52.906
Please get the peace treaty done.

1360
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:58.406
Now. go.

1361
01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:04.742
Come on. kid!

1362
01:31:18.698 --> 01:31:22.826
Smoot. you'd better keep your promise.

1363
01:31:41.906 --> 01:31:44.574
Thank you for letting them go ahead.

1364
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:01.782
Fire! Fire in the kitchen!

1365
01:32:01.906 --> 01:32:03.282
Don't be swayed!

1366
01:32:09.242 --> 01:32:10.826
Let's call a truce!

1367
01:32:11.574 --> 01:32:15.118
If the fire burns up all the oxygen.

1368
01:32:15.366 --> 01:32:17.158
<i>we'll all die!</i>

1369
01:32:23.490 --> 01:32:27.950
If you give us medicine. I will.

1370
01:32:35.614 --> 01:32:38.326
Yeah. okay...

1371
01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:45.326
What's the number for
the White House? Fuck!

1372
01:32:46.782 --> 01:32:51.034
+1-202-456-1111. Okay!

1373
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.826
Why?

1374
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:56.242
Wait a minute. How do you know
the number to the White House?

1375
01:32:56.534 --> 01:32:58.198
That's on Google.

1376
01:32:58.826 --> 01:33:00.118
I Googled it.

1377
01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:01.950
YouTube. too!

1378
01:33:04.782 --> 01:33:06.034
The President just called.

1379
01:33:06.118 --> 01:33:09.034
He's escaped the North Korean submarine.
He's with the Chairman now.

1380
01:33:09.782 --> 01:33:11.230
The call disconnected after that.

1381
01:33:11.255 --> 01:33:12.490
We tried calling back. but
we couldn't get through.

1382
01:33:12.658 --> 01:33:13.944
Shut up!

1383
01:33:14.874 --> 01:33:16.706
All right. Where did he call from?

1384
01:33:16.874 --> 01:33:19.126
Somewhere in the
middle of the East Sea.

1385
01:33:19.206 --> 01:33:21.250
Nearby some island.

1386
01:33:21.666 --> 01:33:23.834
Dukdo? Dokdu? Dokdo?

1387
01:33:23.958 --> 01:33:24.458
Okay.

1388
01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:26.542
Dispatch rescuers to
the sat phone location.

1389
01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:27.626
Immediately!

1390
01:33:27.666 --> 01:33:28.542
Yes. ma'am.

1391
01:33:50.706 --> 01:33:51.958
Be careful!

1392
01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:08.418
Thank you.

1393
01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:20.158
We got the first-aid kit.

1394
01:34:38.626 --> 01:34:41.418
<i>It's the Virginia-class
sub from before!</i>

1395
01:34:41.498 --> 01:34:43.626
<i>Bearing 30 degrees. Range 3.000m!</i>

1396
01:34:43.706 --> 01:34:45.706
<i>It's on the surface. sir.</i>

1397
01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:47.874
Rise to periscope depth.

1398
01:34:53.126 --> 01:34:55.874
The submarine is here to
rescue President Smoot.

1399
01:34:56.082 --> 01:34:58.626
Don't worry. The Chairman
will be rescued too.

1400
01:35:09.042 --> 01:35:10.042
What is it?

1401
01:35:10.126 --> 01:35:12.790
They'll try to sink the
American submarine.

1402
01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:15.542
It's the only way for
the coup to succeed.

1403
01:35:16.958 --> 01:35:17.834
Sir!

1404
01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:21.290
Call the Vice President
and tell her to give

1405
01:35:21.374 --> 01:35:23.790
the Japanese Prime
Minister this message.

1406
01:35:24.206 --> 01:35:27.418
That North Korean submarine
you bribed to do your dirty work

1407
01:35:27.498 --> 01:35:29.834
is going to fire a nuke at you.

1408
01:35:35.334 --> 01:35:37.334
Prepare to fire the torpedo.

1409
01:35:38.958 --> 01:35:41.334
Not at the submarine. sir?

1410
01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.334
Fire it.

1411
01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:55.082
Prepare the torpedo launch.

1412
01:35:57.166 --> 01:35:58.334
Torpedo 1!

1413
01:36:00.334 --> 01:36:01.418
Again!

1414
01:36:06.542 --> 01:36:07.790
Torpedo 2!

1415
01:36:08.998 --> 01:36:10.498
Something is wrong!

1416
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:12.418
Torpedo 3!

1417
01:36:15.914 --> 01:36:16.834
Torpedo 4!

1418
01:36:17.706 --> 01:36:18.626
Torpedo 8!

1419
01:36:19.834 --> 01:36:22.166
Shit! Torpedo 8 is activated!

1420
01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:23.626
No. 8 is working.

1421
01:36:23.706 --> 01:36:25.834
I'll launch it. sir.

1422
01:36:29.166 --> 01:36:31.666
Shit! The torpedo is stuck!

1423
01:36:36.542 --> 01:36:37.666
What's wrong?

1424
01:36:37.914 --> 01:36:38.914
Why isn't it fired?

1425
01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:40.290
The torpedo is stuck!

1426
01:36:40.542 --> 01:36:42.998
If the door doesn't open.
it will explode inside. sir!

1427
01:36:46.206 --> 01:36:49.042
If it doesn't shoot out
now. it'll explode inside!

1428
01:37:02.758 --> 01:37:03.506
Brace for impact!

1429
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:04.258
Away from the walls!

1430
01:37:04.298 --> 01:37:05.134
Yes. sir!

1431
01:37:11.134 --> 01:37:11.966
Check the status.

1432
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:13.006
Yes. sir!

1433
01:37:13.718 --> 01:37:16.214
Our torpedoes are programmed

1434
01:37:16.634 --> 01:37:20.134
to self-detonate even if
they miss their targets.

1435
01:37:21.090 --> 01:37:24.342
So we can still inflict damage.
even if the enemy isn't hit.

1436
01:37:24.674 --> 01:37:28.842
The President and the North Korean
Chairman have both been rescued safely.

1437
01:37:31.134 --> 01:37:32.758
What about our President?

1438
01:37:33.258 --> 01:37:34.842
President HAN

1439
01:37:35.466 --> 01:37:37.966
remained on the North Korean submarine.

1440
01:37:38.674 --> 01:37:39.882
The President claims

1441
01:37:39.966 --> 01:37:43.674
the North Korean submarine is
gonna fire a nuclear missile at Japan.

1442
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:45.798
What?

1443
01:37:45.966 --> 01:37:49.426
But the President has
ordered us not to help Japan.

1444
01:37:51.227 --> 01:37:52.767
It's the Prime Minister.

1445
01:37:53.611 --> 01:37:54.621
<i>Japanese Minister of Defense</i>

1446
01:37:54.731 --> 01:37:55.835
Yes. Prime Minister.

1447
01:37:57.006 --> 01:37:57.842
Yes. sir!

1448
01:37:58.090 --> 01:38:00.882
Turn around! Call everyone
to the Defense Agency!

1449
01:38:01.298 --> 01:38:02.634
Call the JMSDF Chief of Staff.

1450
01:38:02.718 --> 01:38:03.258
Hurry!

1451
01:38:03.506 --> 01:38:06.466
<i>Japan Maritime
Self-Defense Force (JMSDF)</i>

1452
01:38:12.634 --> 01:38:15.758
<i>Japanese Self-Defence
Forces Military Satellite</i>

1453
01:38:21.882 --> 01:38:28.966
<i>Japanese Oyashio-Class Submarine</i>

1454
01:38:29.798 --> 01:38:36.006
<i>Japanese Soryu-Class Submarine</i>

1455
01:38:36.634 --> 01:38:39.550
Where was President Smoot rescued?

1456
01:38:40.342 --> 01:38:42.050
It was just off Dokdo. ma'am.

1457
01:38:45.466 --> 01:38:48.342
Where is our closest naval unit?

1458
01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:51.674
On standby at Ulleungdo
because of the typhoon.

1459
01:38:53.966 --> 01:38:55.090
However.

1460
01:38:56.634 --> 01:38:58.798
our submarine
flotillas are operational.

1461
01:39:01.426 --> 01:39:03.006
I'm over Takeshima.

1462
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:05.050
but the winds are too strong!

1463
01:39:05.466 --> 01:39:09.674
<i>Find the sub and destroy it! Our
nation's survival depends on it!</i>

1464
01:39:09.842 --> 01:39:10.758
Understood.

1465
01:39:10.926 --> 01:39:12.174
Drop the sonobuoy!

1466
01:39:12.342 --> 01:39:13.718
Drop the sonobuoy!

1467
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:31.382
Deploy the active sonar system!

1468
01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:33.342
Deploy the active sonar system!

1469
01:39:51.081 --> 01:39:52.957
Patrol plane dropped an active sonar!

1470
01:39:57.757 --> 01:39:58.940
Emergency dive!

1471
01:39:59.122 --> 01:40:00.649
<i>Go below the sonic layer depth!</i>

1472
01:40:00.674 --> 01:40:03.298
Emergency dive! Set depth for 220m!

1473
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:04.634
Comrade!

1474
01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.758
Why are you listening to that traitor?

1475
01:40:06.842 --> 01:40:08.134
Commander!

1476
01:40:09.006 --> 01:40:10.090
Brother.

1477
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:13.466
If you want to live. listen to him.

1478
01:40:15.214 --> 01:40:17.342
Dive to depth 220m.

1479
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:19.466
- Rudder down!
- Rudder down!

1480
01:40:33.214 --> 01:40:34.590
Submarine detected!

1481
01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:37.718
From its acoustic signature.
it's not American!

1482
01:40:37.798 --> 01:40:39.798
It must be the North Korean sub!

1483
01:40:40.006 --> 01:40:40.882
Destroy it!

1484
01:40:41.506 --> 01:40:43.006
Ready to engage!

1485
01:40:43.174 --> 01:40:44.926
Fire the torpedoes!

1486
01:40:45.214 --> 01:40:46.426
Fire the torpedoes!

1487
01:40:58.718 --> 01:41:00.466
Prepare to fire 2 sonar decoys.

1488
01:41:00.818 --> 01:41:02.274
Prepare to fire sonar decoys!

1489
01:41:03.358 --> 01:41:05.858
Control room! How far
to the sonic layer depth?

1490
01:41:07.898 --> 01:41:09.026
Currently at 160 meters!

1491
01:41:09.566 --> 01:41:10.690
<i>10 meters to sonic layer depth!</i>

1492
01:41:11.526 --> 01:41:13.982
<i>60m to optimal depth
to avoid detection!</i>

1493
01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:15.734
Fire sonar decoys!

1494
01:41:15.942 --> 01:41:17.358
Fire sonar decoys!

1495
01:41:22.942 --> 01:41:26.190
Maintain parallel
altitude angle. Full ahead!

1496
01:41:26.526 --> 01:41:29.234
Maintain parallel
altitude angle! Full ahead!

1497
01:41:37.066 --> 01:41:40.358
Explosion confirmed. but
unsure if it was the sub!

1498
01:41:41.190 --> 01:41:45.358
I detect a signal on sonar. but it
may not be the North Korean sub!

1499
01:41:45.774 --> 01:41:48.650
An American sub is also nearby!

1500
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:50.774
<i>I repeat.</i>

1501
01:41:50.858 --> 01:41:52.526
<i>Destroy it at once!</i>

1502
01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:55.774
Copy.

1503
01:41:56.942 --> 01:42:00.314
Deploying all depth charges.

1504
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:18.982
<i>It's a depth charge!</i>

1505
01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:22.274
<i>600 meters behind us.</i>

1506
01:42:23.234 --> 01:42:24.606
<i>400 meters!</i>

1507
01:42:25.898 --> 01:42:27.190
<i>200 meters!</i>

1508
01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:29.066
<i>Depth charge...</i>

1509
01:42:29.234 --> 01:42:30.774
<i>Coming directly overhead!</i>

1510
01:42:30.858 --> 01:42:32.606
Hard right rudder! Bearing 90 degrees!

1511
01:42:32.898 --> 01:42:34.982
<i>Hard right rudder! Bearing 90 degrees!</i>

1512
01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:36.190
<i>Hard right rudder!</i>

1513
01:42:36.274 --> 01:42:37.482
<i>Hold tight!</i>

1514
01:42:46.274 --> 01:42:49.190
We're getting away from the explosions.

1515
01:42:51.758 --> 01:42:54.599
<i>Set course for Sim Hung Thaek Seamount.</i>

1516
01:42:56.234 --> 01:42:59.274
Explain why we should go there.

1517
01:42:59.314 --> 01:43:01.942
A patrol aircraft came
here in a typhoon!

1518
01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:05.066
It means all enemy subs in the
East Sea are on the hunt for us!

1519
01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:06.982
<i>They're dying to get us!</i>

1520
01:43:07.234 --> 01:43:09.190
<i>If you don't want to be fish bait.</i>

1521
01:43:09.606 --> 01:43:13.066
we must hide where terrain is
complex and it's hard to be detected.

1522
01:43:17.606 --> 01:43:20.734
<i>The U.S. military wouldn't send an
aircraft in the middle of a typhoon.</i>

1523
01:43:20.858 --> 01:43:22.566
<i>The Korean navy. as well.</i>

1524
01:43:22.858 --> 01:43:25.190
That means it's a Japanese plane.

1525
01:43:25.358 --> 01:43:27.398
It must've flown
through a typhoon here.

1526
01:43:27.482 --> 01:43:30.442
because Japan knows you'll
fire nuclear missiles at them.

1527
01:43:31.066 --> 01:43:32.274
<i>Commander PARK!</i>

1528
01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:35.650
<i>You won't get any more
money from the Yamato.</i>

1529
01:43:35.734 --> 01:43:37.774
Let's think of how to get out alive.

1530
01:43:37.858 --> 01:43:40.650
<i>Cut the bullshit. Mr. President!</i>

1531
01:43:40.818 --> 01:43:42.858
The only way to ensure our survival

1532
01:43:42.942 --> 01:43:47.026
is for us to uphold our
alliance with China and fight!

1533
01:43:47.398 --> 01:43:48.606
Got that?

1534
01:43:52.314 --> 01:43:54.314
Give me the launch key.

1535
01:44:23.482 --> 01:44:24.858
Chul-woo...

1536
01:44:44.398 --> 01:44:47.066
Rise to nuclear missile firing depth.

1537
01:44:47.818 --> 01:44:50.234
But at this depth.
they can't find us. sir.

1538
01:44:50.358 --> 01:44:51.982
If we rise any higher.
we'll get caught.

1539
01:44:52.026 --> 01:44:53.774
You dare disobey me?

1540
01:44:53.898 --> 01:44:56.942
Only I give the orders! Is that clear?

1541
01:44:57.982 --> 01:44:59.150
Do it.

1542
01:45:00.947 --> 01:45:02.542
Rise to firing depth.

1543
01:45:05.414 --> 01:45:07.918
Set to ascend to 30 meters.

1544
01:45:10.458 --> 01:45:14.626
<i>Heroic soldiers of the Paektu!</i>

1545
01:45:14.998 --> 01:45:17.582
Once we achieve our mission.

1546
01:45:17.918 --> 01:45:21.594
China has promised us
generous economic aid

1547
01:45:21.619 --> 01:45:27.768
and help revive our blood alliance
to fight against the imperialists.

1548
01:45:28.542 --> 01:45:30.126
Now. we'll fire

1549
01:45:30.498 --> 01:45:36.498
a nuclear missile at Japanese invaders
who tormented us for centuries!

1550
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:42.958
I trust you'll join me in fighting
for our country and our people!

1551
01:45:44.347 --> 01:45:49.639
To the glorious victory of
the heroes of the Paektu!

1552
01:45:51.250 --> 01:45:53.998
Commander PARK! Are you insane?

1553
01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:56.382
If you fire at Japan.

1554
01:45:56.590 --> 01:46:00.506
the U.S. will have to
counterattack as an ally!

1555
01:46:00.926 --> 01:46:05.298
Since President Smoot knows.
China will deny everything!

1556
01:46:05.342 --> 01:46:06.382
<i>Shut up!</i>

1557
01:46:06.882 --> 01:46:09.758
Would you trust your enemy of 70 years?

1558
01:46:09.842 --> 01:46:11.758
Or your blood ally?

1559
01:46:12.203 --> 01:46:14.663
How much longer to firing depth?

1560
01:46:16.842 --> 01:46:18.634
On-coming torpedo detected!

1561
01:46:18.842 --> 01:46:19.842
Range 4km!

1562
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:22.634
It appears to be from a submarine!

1563
01:46:23.134 --> 01:46:24.382
There's another one!

1564
01:46:24.674 --> 01:46:26.590
Range 3.900 meters!

1565
01:46:34.634 --> 01:46:35.674
Control room!

1566
01:46:35.966 --> 01:46:37.842
How far are we from the seamount?

1567
01:46:40.342 --> 01:46:42.134
Whose submarine is it?

1568
01:46:44.466 --> 01:46:47.134
I think it's a Japanese
Oyashio-Class sub!

1569
01:46:48.634 --> 01:46:49.590
Control room!

1570
01:46:49.758 --> 01:46:51.506
Don't do anything
foolish. Answer me now!

1571
01:46:51.674 --> 01:46:53.466
How far to the seamount?

1572
01:46:56.006 --> 01:46:59.590
Sim Hung Thaek Seamount.
Bearing 45 degrees. Range 800 meters!

1573
01:47:00.298 --> 01:47:01.590
What are you doing!

1574
01:47:02.426 --> 01:47:05.050
I said ascend and fire the missile!

1575
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:09.006
If we don't get away now.
the torpedoes will kill us. sir.

1576
01:47:10.298 --> 01:47:11.298
Shut up!

1577
01:47:11.466 --> 01:47:14.466
<i>Full ahead to the seamount!</i>

1578
01:47:15.006 --> 01:47:16.714
<i>Prepare to fire sonar decoys!</i>

1579
01:47:20.298 --> 01:47:21.590
Prepare to fire sonar decoys!

1580
01:47:21.674 --> 01:47:23.218
Set depth to 250m!

1581
01:47:23.382 --> 01:47:25.006
Set depth to 250m!

1582
01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.506
- Torpedo range?
- It's within 2.000m!

1583
01:47:36.634 --> 01:47:38.714
- How far to the seamount?
- 400m. sir!

1584
01:47:38.798 --> 01:47:40.966
- Current depth?
- 160m!

1585
01:47:41.134 --> 01:47:42.714
Torpedo range 1.400m!

1586
01:47:43.382 --> 01:47:45.590
200m to the seamount. depth 190m!

1587
01:47:46.506 --> 01:47:47.926
Torpedo range 1.100m!

1588
01:47:47.966 --> 01:47:50.674
Hard right rudder. bearing
90! Pivot around the seamount!

1589
01:47:51.133 --> 01:47:52.213
Hard right rudder!

1590
01:47:52.418 --> 01:47:53.498
Hard right rudder!

1591
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:02.042
Fire sonar decoys!

1592
01:48:05.126 --> 01:48:06.498
Emergency blow!

1593
01:48:06.542 --> 01:48:08.958
Ascend to 130m and rest
on the seamount peak.

1594
01:48:09.418 --> 01:48:11.706
Emergency blow to 130m!

1595
01:48:49.082 --> 01:48:51.498
Tell me when they pass under our bow.

1596
01:48:57.458 --> 01:48:58.498
It's coming.

1597
01:49:00.666 --> 01:49:02.334
It's right beside us.

1598
01:49:05.498 --> 01:49:06.582
Now. sir!

1599
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:08.126
Flood forward trim!

1600
01:49:08.626 --> 01:49:09.750
Everyone hold tight!

1601
01:49:09.874 --> 01:49:10.750
Flood forward trim!

1602
01:49:10.874 --> 01:49:11.998
Flood forward trim!

1603
01:49:23.458 --> 01:49:24.582
Fire torpedoes!

1604
01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:27.374
10 seconds to impact!

1605
01:49:27.958 --> 01:49:28.582
9 seconds!

1606
01:49:28.706 --> 01:49:29.874
We can't sink it!

1607
01:49:30.126 --> 01:49:32.206
If you do. it's war at Dokdo!

1608
01:49:33.706 --> 01:49:35.290
5 seconds! 4 seconds!

1609
01:49:35.666 --> 01:49:36.834
Self-detonate it!

1610
01:49:38.166 --> 01:49:39.166
Self-detonate!

1611
01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:54.250
The Japanese sub wasn't hit.

1612
01:49:55.206 --> 01:49:56.542
It's ascending.

1613
01:49:58.914 --> 01:50:00.042
Thank you.

1614
01:50:00.334 --> 01:50:01.666
Never mind.

1615
01:50:03.166 --> 01:50:07.666
North Koreans always say.
'Never mind'. It hurts our feelings.

1616
01:50:08.166 --> 01:50:12.874
It sounds so cold. Can't
you just say. 'It's okay'?

1617
01:50:15.458 --> 01:50:17.082
Let's go to Ulleungdo.

1618
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:20.166
Our flotilla will be waiting there.

1619
01:50:21.666 --> 01:50:23.498
To you they may be 'our'.

1620
01:50:23.998 --> 01:50:25.790
but not to us.

1621
01:50:26.082 --> 01:50:29.874
We're not sure to follow you yet.

1622
01:50:30.334 --> 01:50:32.706
Think the traitors will
follow you anywhere?

1623
01:50:33.206 --> 01:50:34.458
Take position.

1624
01:50:39.998 --> 01:50:40.750
Left 20.

1625
01:50:40.874 --> 01:50:41.666
Left 20.

1626
01:50:42.418 --> 01:50:43.998
- Right 50.
- Right 50.

1627
01:50:44.626 --> 01:50:46.042
- Left 10.
- Left 10.

1628
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:48.374
Open it.

1629
01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:56.418
Three. two. one.

1630
01:50:58.998 --> 01:51:01.958
<i>6 km southeast. Depth 300m.</i>

1631
01:51:02.374 --> 01:51:04.166
Something is approaching.

1632
01:51:05.126 --> 01:51:06.750
Could be a sperm whale...

1633
01:51:07.082 --> 01:51:08.498
The speed and course?

1634
01:51:08.626 --> 01:51:11.498
Speed. 20 knots.
Course. straight for us.

1635
01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:13.290
That's no whale!

1636
01:51:19.082 --> 01:51:22.626
It's a Japanese Soryu-Class
sub! Hide behind the seamount!

1637
01:51:23.206 --> 01:51:25.458
Rise to nuclear missile firing depth!

1638
01:51:25.706 --> 01:51:30.666
But it's safer here. sir. If
we go up. we'll be targeted.

1639
01:51:35.166 --> 01:51:36.834
I won't repeat myself again.

1640
01:51:38.042 --> 01:51:39.666
Go and treat it.

1641
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:42.666
Rise up now!

1642
01:51:46.458 --> 01:51:48.834
If we go up any higher.
we'll be targeted!

1643
01:51:50.542 --> 01:51:52.750
I hear torpedo launch tubes opening!

1644
01:51:53.498 --> 01:51:54.958
They've fired. sir!

1645
01:51:56.158 --> 01:51:59.074
Control room! Go behind the seamount!

1646
01:52:02.574 --> 01:52:04.742
We've reached firing depth.

1647
01:52:07.534 --> 01:52:08.950
Get back in trim.

1648
01:52:15.826 --> 01:52:18.742
Torpedo range 5km! Time
to impact 250 seconds!

1649
01:52:18.826 --> 01:52:20.406
<i>You sons of bitches!</i>

1650
01:52:20.490 --> 01:52:22.034
<i>Don't just stand there!</i>

1651
01:52:22.198 --> 01:52:24.034
<i>245 seconds to impact!</i>

1652
01:52:24.490 --> 01:52:25.742
<i>Are you deaf?</i>

1653
01:52:26.114 --> 01:52:26.906
Take cover!

1654
01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:29.866
<i>Listen to me! Move!</i>

1655
01:52:30.034 --> 01:52:31.658
<i>235 seconds to impact!</i>

1656
01:52:31.742 --> 01:52:33.618
<i>We'll all die!</i>

1657
01:52:34.534 --> 01:52:35.698
<i>Come on!</i>

1658
01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:37.698
<i>230 seconds to impact!</i>

1659
01:52:37.782 --> 01:52:39.158
<i>Go to the seamount!</i>

1660
01:52:40.698 --> 01:52:42.034
<i>Go behind the seamount!</i>

1661
01:52:42.114 --> 01:52:44.074
We've reached firing depth.

1662
01:52:44.782 --> 01:52:47.742
But while the missile is fired.
we won't be able to move.

1663
01:52:47.826 --> 01:52:51.326
We may fire one. but they'll
be no time for a second!

1664
01:52:52.282 --> 01:52:55.906
One is enough to make our
nation a powerful socialist state.

1665
01:52:56.034 --> 01:52:57.906
Open the launch tube.

1666
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:03.574
Opening vertical launch tube.

1667
01:53:14.158 --> 01:53:15.990
I'll start the countdown. sir.

1668
01:53:17.698 --> 01:53:18.742
10 seconds.

1669
01:53:20.242 --> 01:53:21.574
9 seconds.

1670
01:53:22.406 --> 01:53:23.490
8 seconds.

1671
01:53:24.534 --> 01:53:25.742
7 seconds.

1672
01:53:26.534 --> 01:53:27.534
6 seconds.

1673
01:53:28.618 --> 01:53:29.450
5...

1674
01:53:30.326 --> 01:53:31.114
Commander!

1675
01:53:31.158 --> 01:53:32.618
Are you insane?

1676
01:53:35.826 --> 01:53:37.742
If you fire that missile.

1677
01:53:38.782 --> 01:53:42.450
it won't be just the Japanese.
but North Koreans...

1678
01:53:43.658 --> 01:53:44.782
No!

1679
01:53:46.698 --> 01:53:49.366
The future of the Korean
people will be gone!

1680
01:53:51.906 --> 01:53:53.826
Let's try to survive together!

1681
01:53:54.074 --> 01:53:56.866
But if someone must die.
let it be just us here.

1682
01:54:01.158 --> 01:54:03.906
Don't threaten me!
You don't have the guts!

1683
01:54:07.198 --> 01:54:08.950
Prepare to fire again!

1684
01:54:16.034 --> 01:54:16.906
First Officer. sir!

1685
01:54:18.074 --> 01:54:20.574
Calm down. men!

1686
01:54:37.158 --> 01:54:38.950
Time to impact. 120 seconds!

1687
01:54:39.282 --> 01:54:41.158
Emergency dive! All hands to the bow!

1688
01:54:41.282 --> 01:54:43.198
Emergency dive! All hands to the bow!

1689
01:54:43.326 --> 01:54:45.242
All hands to the bow!

1690
01:54:45.906 --> 01:54:46.782
Let go.

1691
01:54:46.866 --> 01:54:48.158
Be careful.

1692
01:54:50.698 --> 01:54:51.866
To the bow!

1693
01:54:52.658 --> 01:54:53.950
Go! Go! Go!

1694
01:54:54.490 --> 01:54:55.574
Hurry up!

1695
01:54:56.074 --> 01:54:57.074
Hold on tight!

1696
01:55:05.282 --> 01:55:06.326
Are you all right?

1697
01:55:07.158 --> 01:55:08.490
Never mind.

1698
01:55:13.198 --> 01:55:14.826
Where are they running to?

1699
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:17.326
The heavier the bow
is. the quicker we dive.

1700
01:55:17.858 --> 01:55:19.314
Set depth to 250m!

1701
01:55:19.398 --> 01:55:20.734
Set to 250m!

1702
01:55:23.942 --> 01:55:26.150
Go behind the peak. then level off.

1703
01:55:26.442 --> 01:55:28.398
Going behind the peak. sir!

1704
01:55:32.398 --> 01:55:34.026
35 seconds to impact!

1705
01:55:37.234 --> 01:55:38.774
Levelling off. sir!

1706
01:55:39.314 --> 01:55:40.734
Back to positions!

1707
01:55:41.858 --> 01:55:42.818
Run! Run!

1708
01:55:43.774 --> 01:55:44.566
Hurry!

1709
01:55:44.690 --> 01:55:45.650
Fire stern torpedo!

1710
01:55:45.774 --> 01:55:47.026
Intercept it!

1711
01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:48.442
Firing stern torpedo!

1712
01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:50.150
Fire!

1713
01:55:52.942 --> 01:55:54.482
Take care of yourself.

1714
01:55:58.858 --> 01:56:00.526
What's the range
between ours and theirs?

1715
01:56:00.606 --> 01:56:02.234
Only a few seconds away.

1716
01:56:02.442 --> 01:56:05.734
6 seconds. 5. 4...

1717
01:56:07.942 --> 01:56:09.026
Self-detonate!

1718
01:56:22.982 --> 01:56:25.190
There's another one headed here!

1719
01:56:25.442 --> 01:56:26.482
10 seconds!

1720
01:56:26.690 --> 01:56:27.818
No. 9 seconds to impact!

1721
01:56:27.858 --> 01:56:29.482
- Fire stern torpedo!
- Firing stern torpedo!

1722
01:56:31.234 --> 01:56:32.234
Detonate!

1723
01:56:44.274 --> 01:56:45.650
Take positions!

1724
01:56:45.774 --> 01:56:47.150
Take positions!

1725
01:56:52.566 --> 01:56:53.898
Go! Go!

1726
01:57:11.566 --> 01:57:12.982
Report the damages.

1727
01:57:13.314 --> 01:57:14.734
The ballast tank is damaged.

1728
01:57:14.898 --> 01:57:16.690
If we don't surface now. we'll sink.

1729
01:57:16.818 --> 01:57:18.066
Can it be repaired?

1730
01:57:18.190 --> 01:57:19.066
Negative. sir.

1731
01:57:19.274 --> 01:57:20.858
We'll have to dock first.

1732
01:57:22.234 --> 01:57:24.106
Stern torpedo room has been hit!

1733
01:57:24.314 --> 01:57:28.398
Water is flooding in! Evacuating
and closing hatch doors!

1734
01:57:29.858 --> 01:57:31.398
Everyone get out!

1735
01:57:33.898 --> 01:57:36.650
Get out! Run!

1736
01:57:38.526 --> 01:57:40.106
Enemy sub is approaching.

1737
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:42.066
At 4.500 meters!

1738
01:57:43.606 --> 01:57:45.566
A torpedo hatch is opening.

1739
01:57:47.398 --> 01:57:50.314
It's from 3 seconds ago.
They've already fired.

1740
01:57:50.898 --> 01:57:54.150
I'll cancel the countdown.

1741
01:57:58.150 --> 01:58:01.026
I think this is the end. Mr. President.

1742
01:58:07.690 --> 01:58:10.106
Is communication possible?

1743
01:58:10.734 --> 01:58:12.526
Only low-frequency transmissions.

1744
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:15.774
Do you know the ROK Navy's frequency?

1745
01:58:16.106 --> 01:58:18.190
I have it memorized. sir.

1746
01:58:20.274 --> 01:58:23.150
It's set to the ROK Navy. sir.

1747
01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:40.606
This is President HAN Gyeong-jae.

1748
01:58:42.734 --> 01:58:45.190
I charge the South Korean military

1749
01:58:46.314 --> 01:58:50.566
to continue to protect our
land and preserve peace.

1750
01:58:54.150 --> 01:58:55.690
Madam Prime Minister.

1751
01:58:58.066 --> 01:59:02.398
Please look after our country well.

1752
01:59:23.774 --> 01:59:26.274
<i>3 more submarines approaching.</i>

1753
01:59:27.358 --> 01:59:30.190
I hear on-coming torpedoes. sir.

1754
01:59:34.774 --> 01:59:37.898
Long live our unified Korea!

1755
01:59:41.234 --> 01:59:43.106
My grandchildren

1756
01:59:47.734 --> 01:59:49.942
and my daughter live in Hamheung.

1757
01:59:51.398 --> 01:59:54.942
A peace agreement will mean
better lives for them too. right?

1758
01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:01.690
Let's pray it to be.

1759
02:00:04.398 --> 02:00:06.818
How does one pray?

1760
02:00:08.026 --> 02:00:09.482
Like this?

1761
02:01:17.026 --> 02:01:20.190
<i>This is the South Korean Navy.</i>

1762
02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:23.818
<i>You've entered our waters.</i>

1763
02:01:25.566 --> 02:01:27.274
<i>Ascend immediately!</i>

1764
02:01:30.898 --> 02:01:32.942
<i>This is the South Korean Navy.</i>

1765
02:01:33.898 --> 02:01:36.026
<i>You've entered our waters.</i>

1766
02:01:37.734 --> 02:01:39.818
<i>Ascend immediately!</i>

1767
02:01:47.542 --> 02:01:49.998
The Japanese submarine
is retreating. sir!

1768
02:01:50.250 --> 02:01:54.166
The 3 submarines are of the ROK Navy!

1769
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:03.626
Turn on the loudspeakers!

1770
02:02:08.058 --> 02:02:12.098
Members of the ROK
Navy. it is a pleasure.

1771
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:18.074
The Paektu Submarine will ascend.

1772
02:02:27.490 --> 02:02:28.782
Begin ascent!

1773
02:02:38.118 --> 02:02:39.326
<i>Now. for some good news.</i>

1774
02:02:39.450 --> 02:02:45.782
<i>Typhoon Steel Rain has passed Dokdo
and is headed toward Hokkaido. Japan.</i>

1775
02:02:46.282 --> 02:02:48.326
<i>The strongest typhoon on record...</i>

1776
02:02:48.406 --> 02:02:52.198
Minister of Defense.
Deploy all forces to Dokdo.

1777
02:02:53.366 --> 02:02:54.490
Yes. ma'am.

1778
02:05:03.118 --> 02:05:05.950
The Prime Minister promised
your legacy will continue.

1779
02:05:06.158 --> 02:05:09.574
He said you need not worry.

1780
02:05:10.118 --> 02:05:13.658
I knew the Chinese and Korean
bastards weren't to be trusted.

1781
02:05:15.198 --> 02:05:17.282
Please give him my apologies

1782
02:05:18.326 --> 02:05:19.950
for my missteps.

1783
02:05:20.326 --> 02:05:23.242
About those missteps...

1784
02:05:23.826 --> 02:05:27.450
You're the only one who
can take responsibility.

1785
02:05:28.782 --> 02:05:31.406
So he asked that you do!

1786
02:06:00.074 --> 02:06:01.782
Well. maybe you should get out.

1787
02:06:01.866 --> 02:06:03.906
President HAN? Please join us?

1788
02:06:06.826 --> 02:06:08.198
Fantastic.

1789
02:06:09.614 --> 02:06:12.158
Sometime. we should
go on a boat trip together.

1790
02:06:16.158 --> 02:06:18.074
I invite you to visit Seoul.

1791
02:06:29.742 --> 02:06:32.826
<i>Steel Rain 2: Summit</i>

1792
02:07:33.914 --> 02:07:37.334
<i>The leaders of South and North
Korea have arrived together.</i>

1793
02:07:37.410 --> 02:07:39.158
<i>Please welcome them with a big hand!</i>

1794
02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:40.374
Welcome.

1795
02:07:42.542 --> 02:07:44.418
How is your injury coming along?

1796
02:07:44.834 --> 02:07:46.834
It's much better. Thank you.

1797
02:07:49.290 --> 02:07:51.082
After you. Mr. President.

1798
02:08:00.082 --> 02:08:01.750
My fellow Koreans.

1799
02:08:04.126 --> 02:08:06.874
Over the past few years.
many people asked me.

1800
02:08:08.418 --> 02:08:10.498
'Can unification really happen?'

1801
02:08:11.418 --> 02:08:16.958
I always gave a vague
answer and said. 'It'll work out.'

1802
02:08:19.082 --> 02:08:22.498
But today. I can answer
with complete conviction.

1803
02:08:25.666 --> 02:08:30.126
Unification can't be achieved by
the will or power of one President.

1804
02:08:31.834 --> 02:08:36.498
nor by determination and power
just of politicians and officials.

1805
02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:41.126
We recently saw the end of a
war that began 70 years ago.

1806
02:08:41.542 --> 02:08:44.914
A peace agreement between the
U.S. and North Korea from 30 years ago.

1807
02:08:45.418 --> 02:08:47.498
has been finally completed.

1808
02:08:48.914 --> 02:08:53.042
It may take a few more
decades to build peace

1809
02:08:53.334 --> 02:08:57.250
and for South and North Korea
to trust and understand each other.

1810
02:08:59.666 --> 02:09:04.206
The path to unification will
require tremendous effort.

1811
02:09:07.914 --> 02:09:09.418
Beloved citizens.

1812
02:09:11.542 --> 02:09:14.166
I can say one thing with certainty

1813
02:09:15.306 --> 02:09:19.598
that without your efforts.
nothing will happen.

1814
02:09:22.014 --> 02:09:24.306
So I ask you now.

1815
02:09:26.742 --> 02:09:32.574
Are you willing to realize
unification in our time?
