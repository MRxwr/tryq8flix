00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:59.016
All units. all units.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.850

00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:04.054
Any patrols able to assist with
backup at Kenning Farm.

00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:05.788
Attempted to clear private
property.

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:07.091
experiencing resistance.

00:01:07.124 --> 00:01:09.625

Kenning Farm. over.

Move.

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:20.903
Move!

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:21.838
Get up.

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:22.739
Get up.

00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:26.276
Move.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.177
Move.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.084
You. get them out of here.

00:01:34.118 --> 00:01:35.319
You. get them cuffed.

00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:36.420
We need another unit.

00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:40.523
Sergeant Lawson to control.
we need more units.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.232
Hands up!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.202
It wasn't me.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:02:59.303
It wasn't me.

00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:02.973
Something in the shadows.

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:37.000
Well. this looks
straightforward enough.

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:37.900
Yeah.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:39.937
Bust down the door. kick out
squatters.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.871
secure the property.

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:43.739
Life of a bailiff.

00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:46.076
Anything is better than last
gig. huh?

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:49.479
After facing armed insurgents
with suicide vests. yeah.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.015
Now we get to scare pothead
teenagers.

00:04:52.049 --> 00:04:53.383
Easy life.

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:54.451
We earned it. soldier.

00:04:54.484 --> 00:04:55.352
Come on.

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:10.067
So. as agreed. first case.

00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:15.405
If happy. let's make this a
regular agreement.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.241
There's plenty more where that
came from.

00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:19.376
You can guarantee me how many
kilos?

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.843
Unlimited.

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:22.446
My boys down the docks have got
final sign off

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.380
on the containers.

00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:34.291
We good?

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:38.262
We very good.

00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:43.567
This is private property.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.203
This is your eviction notice.
lads.

00:05:46.236 --> 00:05:47.837
You called the police?

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.339
No. did you?

00:05:49.373 --> 00:05:51.475
We're not police. we're
bailiffs.

00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:54.578
You told me this place is
clean.

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:55.845
Usually is.

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:01.952
I've got an idea.

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.421
Why don't you just turn around

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:06.990
and pretend none of this ever
happened.

00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:10.060
Sorry lads. we can't let you
do that.

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:13.163
Then. you leave us no choice.

00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:35.112
Caitlin.

00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:35.979
Caitlin.

00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:37.647
Caitlin. stop.

00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:38.548
Stop.

00:08:47.317 --> 00:08:48.351
Hey.

00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:50.587
Sorry. the door was open.

00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:53.256
Latte?

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.157
Thanks.

00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:02.432
I'm worried about you.

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:04.067
Don't be.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.335
Come on. Caitlin.

00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:06.269
Don't give me that tough soldier
act.

00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:08.038
I saw you yesterday.

00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:10.006
It all still bothers you.
doesn't it?

00:09:11.174 --> 00:09:12.542
What is it you want me to
say?

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.111
Look. you've always had my
back.

00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:16.480
I'm just saying I got yours.

00:09:19.082 --> 00:09:21.685
This thing is gonna follow me
wherever I go.

00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:24.154
Running away isn't gonna help.

00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:25.355
True.

00:09:25.388 --> 00:09:27.457
Problem is. Caitlin in this job.
we're literally everyday...

00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:29.259
Yeah. and that's the life we
know.

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:31.094
Caitlin.

00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:35.398
Look. knowing you've got my
back

00:09:35.432 --> 00:09:36.566
is all I need right now.

00:09:40.837 --> 00:09:43.640
Go on. go and get your gear
on.

00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:03.460
Here we are look. couple of
bad asses.

00:10:03.493 --> 00:10:06.162
Yeah. the police said you
guys pulverized those assholes.

00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:08.365
Yeah. yeah. leave it out
lads.

00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:09.199
No chance.

00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:10.534
So let me get this straight you
two.

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:12.369
You stumble across a drug den.

00:10:12.402 --> 00:10:13.637
and instead of calling the
police.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.405
you take out the thugs
yourselves?

00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:16.506
Now that's mad shit.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.775
Nothing to be proud of.

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:20.210
Like the fuck it isn't.

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:24.147
Boss wants to see you two.

00:10:25.248 --> 00:10:26.116
Now.

00:10:32.489 --> 00:10:33.523
Thank you. Rebecca.

00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:40.330
So. traditionally we let the
police handle

00:10:40.363 --> 00:10:43.466
any violent or illegal
situations.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.834
Well. it's not like we had a
choice.

00:10:44.868 --> 00:10:45.970
It was self defense.

00:10:46.003 --> 00:10:48.471
They attacked us and we took
care of the situation.

00:10:49.272 --> 00:10:52.242
So. I guess I'm lucky that
you two are ex-Army.

00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:55.111
Otherwise I'd be looking for two
new bailiffs.

00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:56.346
Sorry.

00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:57.714
Look. it won't happen again.

00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:02.686
Another job for you two. if
you're up for it.

00:11:02.719 --> 00:11:04.254
- Not really.
- Absolutely.

00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:08.458
Don't worry. this one will be
far less exciting.

00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:11.695
Some local brat has inherited
his father's old farm.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.165
What are we evicting. sheep?

00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:17.267
No livestock. just vagrants.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.435
Vagrants?

00:11:18.468 --> 00:11:20.370
Yes. the previous owner

00:11:20.403 --> 00:11:22.339
allowed the homeless onto his
land.

00:11:22.372 --> 00:11:25.141
The new owner is only interested
in selling the property.

00:11:25.175 --> 00:11:27.377
So it needs to be cleared as
soon as possible.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.511
Great.

00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:30.914
So. we're kicking out homeless
people from their homes.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:31.983
Nice job.

00:11:32.016 --> 00:11:33.817
No. the police already
cleared the property.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.253
You're going in to clean up and
secure the old farmhouse.

00:11:37.287 --> 00:11:38.755
Okay. sounds simple.

00:11:38.788 --> 00:11:41.291
Definitely more simple than
the last job.

00:11:41.324 --> 00:11:42.559
Well. there's something.

00:11:42.592 --> 00:11:45.328
Well. Rebecca will explain
the rest of the details to you.

00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:52.535
Hey Boss. be honest with
me.

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:54.437
How many bad guys did you kill
in The Army?

00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:55.572
Shut up Ol.

00:11:55.605 --> 00:11:57.273
Caitlin totally killed
way more than Brad did.

00:11:57.307 --> 00:11:58.075
Oh yeah. I got it.

00:11:58.109 --> 00:11:59.476
She's a lean mean killing
machine

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:01.578
Oliver. enough.

00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:04.180
Why on earth did we have to
bring this two. Caitlin?

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:04.848
Okay. we're nearly
there.

00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:05.749
Straight ahead.

00:12:27.938 --> 00:12:28.805
Morning everyone.

00:12:28.838 --> 00:12:29.906
Morning. Rebecca.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.408
So. what's the plan?

00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:32.542
Hey. well. first things
first.

00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:34.210
Jameson sent us over three extra
hands

00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:35.545
to help us out on this one.

00:12:35.578 --> 00:12:36.513
Is there a problem?

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:37.681
I thought this was a straight
enough job.

00:12:37.714 --> 00:12:38.782
Didn't she tell you?

00:12:39.582 --> 00:12:41.551
Our client is coming to watch
over things today.

00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:42.919
Watch over things?

00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:43.753
Nice.

00:12:43.787 --> 00:12:45.488
He just wants to sell the
land.

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:46.556
Yeah. sounds good to me.

00:12:46.589 --> 00:12:47.457
It's fresh meat.

00:12:48.591 --> 00:12:50.460
But. no work for us.

00:12:50.493 --> 00:12:52.629
A good manager always delegates.

00:12:52.662 --> 00:12:53.897
Great. maybe you two can go

00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:55.398
and pester somebody else today.

00:12:55.432 --> 00:12:56.299
Guys!

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.735
Hey guys.

00:12:58.768 --> 00:12:59.869
Welcome to the team.

00:12:59.903 --> 00:13:01.438
- Caitlin.
- Tony.

00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:02.739
- Tony.
- Lawrence.

00:13:02.772 --> 00:13:03.606
Lawrence.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.674
- Jen.
- Jen.

00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:06.242
If you guys have any questions.
just let me know.

00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:06.944
Thanks.

00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:09.446
So the homeless were living
here?

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:10.547
Yeah.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.881
Pretty much the entire land.

00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:13.683
I'm amazed the council
allowed it.

00:13:13.717 --> 00:13:15.318
It's not very sanitary.

00:13:16.886 --> 00:13:18.788
To be honest with you.

00:13:18.822 --> 00:13:19.756
I don't think that they were
fully aware

00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:22.292
with just how many people were
living here.

00:13:23.493 --> 00:13:27.263
This land is pretty far off the
beaten path.

00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:30.500
Now it's down to the new owner.

00:13:30.533 --> 00:13:31.768
Leave us alone.

00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:33.303
Leave us alone.

00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:35.371
- Leave us alone.
- Fucking protesters.

00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:37.874
Go fucking protest on someone
else's land.

00:13:37.907 --> 00:13:40.910
Fuckin' do-gooders. mind their
own fuckin' business.

00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:43.780
Hi Mr. Kenning. I'm Rebecca.

00:13:44.581 --> 00:13:47.383
Everyone. this is Mr. Richard
Kenning.

00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:49.719
He recently inherited this land
off his father.

00:13:49.753 --> 00:13:50.820
Sorry for your loss.

00:13:50.854 --> 00:13:52.555
Don't be. dad was a prick.

00:13:52.589 --> 00:13:54.557
The sooner that I can offload
this shit hole

00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:56.559
and make some money. the better.

00:13:56.593 --> 00:13:58.628
You won't be following in
your father's footsteps?

00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:00.697
I'll help the homeless. when
I'm no longer in need

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.967
of help myself. thank you very
much.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.902
Mr. Kenning. we're here to
help you clear the property.

00:14:05.936 --> 00:14:08.005
Council won't let me sell it
until I do.

00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:12.408
This is Caitlin and Brad.
they're our top team.

00:14:12.442 --> 00:14:14.310
And I'm here if you have any
questions.

00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:15.012
Why are the pigs here?

00:14:15.045 --> 00:14:16.981
It's just standard procedure.

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:19.083
It speeds things up
paperwork-wise.

00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:20.450
Fine.

00:14:20.483 --> 00:14:22.485
So. you're in charge then?

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:23.988
What now?

00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:26.023
I'm paying a fortune for you
lot.

00:14:26.056 --> 00:14:28.324
So. our signage team will
make a start at the entrance.

00:14:28.358 --> 00:14:30.027
and then we'll just work our way
through the house.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.896
Michael. if you wanna take Tony
and Jen.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.564
start at the front of the
property with signs.

00:14:34.597 --> 00:14:36.967
make sure all the entrances are
secure.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.635
Don't engage with the
protesters.

00:14:38.668 --> 00:14:40.403
All right. come on. signage
team.

00:14:40.436 --> 00:14:43.373
One of you get the toolbox.
other get the posts. follow me.

00:14:44.607 --> 00:14:47.011
Ollie. do you wanna take
Lawrence?

00:14:47.044 --> 00:14:48.578
Start unloading the van.

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:49.879
Quick as you can. Ol.

00:14:49.913 --> 00:14:51.447
Yes sir.

00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:53.017
Let's make a start in the
house.

00:14:54.118 --> 00:14:54.985
What a dick!

00:14:59.123 --> 00:15:00.490
Great.

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:01.959
What a shit hole.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.428
We'll try and make this as
quick as possible.

00:15:05.461 --> 00:15:06.263
Thanks.

00:15:06.297 --> 00:15:07.597
We'll be glad to get out of
here.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.599
Especially with him around.

00:15:09.632 --> 00:15:11.068
What. Mr. Kenning?

00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:12.468
Why. do you know him?

00:15:12.502 --> 00:15:14.537
Yeah. he's very well known to
us.

00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:16.372
A bit of a spiky character.

00:15:16.406 --> 00:15:17.507
Fabulous.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.076
There's always something. isn't
there?

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:25.115
I can't believe this is where
Lawson died.

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:27.417
Be glad to get out of here as
soon as possible.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.751
Why. what's up?

00:15:28.785 --> 00:15:29.853
It's DI Evans.

00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:32.455
He wants me to wrap up these
missing people reports.

00:15:32.488 --> 00:15:33.356
Sounds fun.

00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:37.493
Cozy.

00:15:38.295 --> 00:15:40.630
Yeah. the glamorous life of
the bailiff.

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:43.867
They delivered your boards
earlier.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.567
Great.

00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:46.636
So how many rooms do we have?

00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:48.105
Six. I think.

00:15:48.138 --> 00:15:50.874
Okay guys. looks like we need
safety gear for this one.

00:15:50.907 --> 00:15:52.042
Safety gear?

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:55.179
Yeah. this place likely has
broken glass everywhere.

00:15:55.212 --> 00:15:56.613
Well. I don't always agree
with you

00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:58.481
but this time you're right.
Oliver.

00:15:58.514 --> 00:16:00.483
Everybody tread carefully.

00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:01.384
Told you.

00:16:04.888 --> 00:16:07.657
It's probably safer if we
stay outside.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.758
This is my house.

00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:10.493
Of course.

00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:20.770
Don't I know you from
somewhere?

00:16:20.803 --> 00:16:21.905
Possibly sir.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.208
Brad. if you could take PC
Williams and Lawrence.

00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:26.076
do a recce down here. make sure
there's no squatters

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.744
or anything we need to deal
with.

00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:30.080
Just me and you.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:30.981
Great!

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:33.516
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:34.717
You love me really. bro.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.688
Bro. really. I don't.

00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:41.926
Ollie. if you PC Gray and I
take upstairs?

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:56.606
It looks clear so far.

00:16:58.042 --> 00:17:00.743
He must have had one massive
porn collection.

00:17:52.662 --> 00:17:53.663
Oh. sorry.

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:57.935
Sorry.

00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:01.537
Just saying. looks like we're
good. right?

00:18:02.605 --> 00:18:03.873
I'm sure I saw something.

00:18:07.177 --> 00:18:08.078
Everything okay?

00:18:08.845 --> 00:18:11.614
Ol. how are we doing up
there?

00:18:11.647 --> 00:18:13.050
Yeah. yeah. we're all clear.

00:18:36.672 --> 00:18:37.840
Hurry up. Ollie.

00:19:05.768 --> 00:19:06.636
Come on. dad.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:08.738
Give me a sign.

00:19:09.806 --> 00:19:10.773
Investments.

00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:13.077
offshore savings.

00:19:14.144 --> 00:19:15.012
anything.

00:19:16.313 --> 00:19:17.914
Do you miss your old man?

00:19:20.217 --> 00:19:23.053
I told ya. dad was a prick.

00:19:24.787 --> 00:19:26.924
He never let anyone come here.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.624
Said his work was too important.

00:19:29.592 --> 00:19:32.762
Maybe helping the homeless
really meant something to him.

00:19:34.998 --> 00:19:36.233
You didn't know him.

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:37.800
He didn't care about anyone.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.337
He didn't care when mom died.

00:19:41.771 --> 00:19:43.773
He kicked me out the house when
I was 16.

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.877
I literally never saw him again.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.778
Prick!

00:19:50.913 --> 00:19:51.781
Right.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:56.853
I'm done here.

00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:00.823
Come on. dad.

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:03.726
What was so fucking important?

00:20:05.728 --> 00:20:07.998
Look. Mr. Kenning.

00:20:10.234 --> 00:20:13.170
My dad wasn't a good one. he
left when I was young.

00:20:13.203 --> 00:20:15.205
and that forced me into The Army
as a teenager.

00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:17.341
It was the best thing that ever
happened to me.

00:20:17.374 --> 00:20:20.410
What I'm saying is. maybe we
don't need our dads.

00:20:20.444 --> 00:20:23.447
or maybe your dad loved you in
his own special way.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.348
Loved me?

00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:27.184
He once beat me unconscious.

00:20:27.217 --> 00:20:29.219
'cause I spoke before being
spoken to.

00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:32.289
Fine.

00:20:32.322 --> 00:20:33.924
So maybe your dad was a prick.

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:36.093
All right. I'm done here.

00:20:36.126 --> 00:20:37.327
I'll meet you downstairs.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.111
Us black guys hate the cold.

00:22:03.213 --> 00:22:05.915
Next time. that fucking Ollie is
getting outdoor duties.

00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:07.351
So. are we nearly done then?

00:22:07.384 --> 00:22:08.952
Yeah.

00:22:08.986 --> 00:22:10.153
I can't feel my fingers.

00:22:13.357 --> 00:22:15.926
Looks like we got one more
entrance to mark.

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.194
Tell you what. a tea break.
yeah?

00:22:17.227 --> 00:22:18.228
Oh. you read my mind.

00:22:18.262 --> 00:22:19.129
Nice one.

00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:29.973
It's still warm...

00:22:34.378 --> 00:22:35.245
Guys.

00:22:37.114 --> 00:22:40.217
Just stop fucking about. this
ain't funny.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.085
It's scary enough out here as it
is.

00:22:45.455 --> 00:22:47.291
Oh. guys. look guys. I...

00:22:51.428 --> 00:22:52.562
What the fuck?

00:22:58.168 --> 00:22:59.036
Shit!

00:23:08.045 --> 00:23:09.112
Okay guys. we're set
upstairs.

00:23:09.146 --> 00:23:10.047
how are we doing down here?

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.115
Yeah. I think we're just
about done.

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:13.517
Yep. we're happy.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.384
Thank God.

00:23:14.418 --> 00:23:16.053
Sick of this place. it's a shit
hole.

00:23:16.086 --> 00:23:16.919
Great.

00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:21.591
Where's Kenning?

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:22.926
Mr. Kenning.

00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:29.333
Are you ready?

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:30.233
Just about.

00:23:32.402 --> 00:23:34.870
Michael. Tony!

00:23:34.904 --> 00:23:36.306
What's wrong?

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.574
I found Michael's phone.

00:23:38.575 --> 00:23:40.110
He's just gone.

00:23:40.143 --> 00:23:41.645
He's just gone. he's just
disappeared.

00:23:41.678 --> 00:23:42.346
Vanished?

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.914
Playing silly buggers more like.

00:23:49.486 --> 00:23:50.354
Michael!

00:23:51.254 --> 00:23:52.888
Michael!

00:23:52.923 --> 00:23:54.391
Enough boys.

00:23:54.424 --> 00:23:56.159
You've really scared this girl.

00:23:56.193 --> 00:23:58.595
It's not like Michael to do
something like this.

00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:03.400
Well then Ollie. you're no
longer my least favorite.

00:24:03.433 --> 00:24:05.602
Yeah. even I'll admit this
isn't funny.

00:24:05.635 --> 00:24:06.603
Enough of this.

00:24:06.636 --> 00:24:08.638
Ollie. help me get the boards
off the window.

00:24:30.293 --> 00:24:34.498
Right. I need a light down here
and a medipack now.

00:24:39.469 --> 00:24:41.638
Just breathe. Ollie.

00:24:41.671 --> 00:24:43.473
Deep breaths.

00:24:43.507 --> 00:24:44.541
Deep breaths.

00:24:50.747 --> 00:24:51.948
Deep breaths. Ollie.

00:24:55.685 --> 00:24:56.586
It's Michael.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.288
And what the hell has
happened to Tony?

00:24:58.321 --> 00:24:59.990
It's the fuckin' man that
killed Michael.

00:25:00.023 --> 00:25:02.092
Shut up Ol. it's obviously
more than one person.

00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:03.360
Sit up. sit up.

00:25:03.393 --> 00:25:07.030
This Officer 2472. do you
copy?

00:25:07.063 --> 00:25:08.999
1907 calling in.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.201
Nothing.

00:25:11.234 --> 00:25:12.102
Nothing.

00:25:13.103 --> 00:25:14.337
I had signal before.

00:25:14.371 --> 00:25:15.038
There's something blocking
us.

00:25:15.071 --> 00:25:16.440
The body came from upstairs.

00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:17.507
Gray.

00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:18.208
Yeah.

00:25:18.241 --> 00:25:21.044
Everyone else. just stay here.

00:25:21.077 --> 00:25:23.013
This is fucking insane.

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:24.414
Come on you. up on your feet.

00:25:24.448 --> 00:25:25.415
Rebecca. help me.

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:27.584
Rebecca!

00:25:27.617 --> 00:25:30.053
I'm gonna see about getting
some lights working here.

00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:33.123
Jen. Lawrence. grab a torch.

00:25:33.156 --> 00:25:34.458
I need you to help me. okay?

00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:38.462
Come this way.

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:03.520
This is the police.

00:26:03.553 --> 00:26:07.057
Put your weapons down. come out
with your hands up.

00:26:09.793 --> 00:26:10.794
Stop. police.

00:26:26.076 --> 00:26:27.077
Where'd he go?

00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:30.213
No idea.

00:26:40.824 --> 00:26:42.225
Oh. found it.

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:54.237
I think I've got a signal.

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:00.610
Guys.

00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:07.217
Are you okay?

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.419
The floor. it just went out
from under us.

00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:13.156
Jen doesn't look too good.

00:27:13.189 --> 00:27:14.524
I'm gonna get down to you.

00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:17.694
What the fuck?

00:27:19.663 --> 00:27:20.864
This house is falling apart.

00:27:20.897 --> 00:27:23.333
Jen and Lawrence are down there.
I need to get down to them.

00:27:23.366 --> 00:27:24.301
No way.

00:27:24.334 --> 00:27:25.535
There's no guarantees we can get
you back up.

00:27:25.569 --> 00:27:27.203
Jen needs medical assistance.

00:27:28.305 --> 00:27:29.639
We found someone upstairs.

00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:32.409
- I knew it.
- We lost him.

00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:33.610
There's a hidden doorway.

00:27:33.643 --> 00:27:34.611
Leading where?

00:27:34.644 --> 00:27:36.446
We don't know. all we could
see was steps

00:27:36.479 --> 00:27:37.647
leading down into darkness.

00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:40.584
But it's probably our best
chance of getting out of here.

00:27:40.617 --> 00:27:42.352
It looks like we're in a
tunnel.

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:45.555
I can see some light in the
distance.

00:27:45.589 --> 00:27:46.823
We need to split up.

00:27:46.856 --> 00:27:48.625
Caitlin. no. that's crazy.

00:27:48.658 --> 00:27:50.760
Potentially. there's two ways
of getting out of here.

00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:53.096
This tunnel or their secret
doorway.

00:27:54.065 --> 00:27:55.799
Let's increase our chances of
getting out of here.

00:27:55.832 --> 00:27:58.401
and getting help by splitting.

00:27:58.435 --> 00:27:59.302
She's right.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.571
We divide by skill set.

00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:05.775
PC Gray. come with me. PC
Williams. stay with Brad.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.744
I hope you're right about
this.

00:28:07.777 --> 00:28:08.712
Trust me.

00:28:31.969 --> 00:28:33.703
Go and find the others.

00:28:33.737 --> 00:28:35.505
We need to get out of here.

00:28:35.538 --> 00:28:36.406
Good luck.

00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:45.415
How is she?

00:28:45.448 --> 00:28:47.617
Not good. she's barely
breathing.

00:28:47.651 --> 00:28:48.852
There's some reaction to
stimulus.

00:28:48.885 --> 00:28:50.453
but she's mostly out of it.

00:28:50.487 --> 00:28:52.355
Looks like broken bones.

00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:53.790
Possibly internal bleeding.

00:28:53.823 --> 00:28:54.724
What can we do?

00:28:56.226 --> 00:28:57.627
We have to leave her?

00:28:57.661 --> 00:28:59.262
Alone?

00:28:59.295 --> 00:29:00.830
I'll stay with her.

00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:02.532
Are you sure?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.168
Yep.

00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:08.905
Pretty sure I'm happy not
finding out what that is.

00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:10.907
Just don't do anything to
bring attention to you and Jen.

00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:13.810
Keep your torch off and stay
quiet. do you understand?

00:29:13.843 --> 00:29:15.612
If she starts to show signs
of consciousness.

00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:16.780
just talk to her.

00:29:16.813 --> 00:29:19.482
Try to keep her calm but keep
her awake.

00:29:19.516 --> 00:29:20.483
Okay.

00:29:20.517 --> 00:29:21.785
Let's keep her comfy.

00:29:21.818 --> 00:29:22.686
Yeah.

00:29:42.372 --> 00:29:43.007
Ready?

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.907
Yeah.

00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:48.979
I've got a signal.

00:29:49.013 --> 00:29:51.448
I've got a signal.

00:29:51.481 --> 00:29:52.882
I've got a signal.

00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:55.318
My battery.

00:29:57.454 --> 00:29:58.956
But I had a signal.

00:29:58.989 --> 00:30:00.857
It must be this spot.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:01.926
No signal for me.

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:04.894
But I had a signal. I
promise.

00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:05.996
Where's Jen's phone?

00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:13.503
Smashed. probably in the fall.

00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:17.407
Looks like mine is the only
one with any juice left.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.943
The reception is not gonna get
any better down there.

00:30:18.976 --> 00:30:22.378
Here. just check it periodically
for a signal.

00:30:22.412 --> 00:30:24.048
Don't waste the battery by
checking every five seconds.

00:30:24.081 --> 00:30:27.283
And if you do get a signal. just
call 999. nothing else.

00:30:27.317 --> 00:30:28.752
Do you understand?

00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:49.506
What kind of a house has a
secret staircase?

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.609
A fucked up one.

00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:53.576
Thanks. Ollie.

00:30:54.477 --> 00:30:55.845
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

00:30:55.879 --> 00:30:57.081
It means. shut the fuck up.
Ollie.

00:30:57.114 --> 00:30:58.481
Fuck off.

00:30:58.515 --> 00:31:01.618
It's obviously illegal.
whatever it is.

00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:02.919
Why else make it secret?

00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:06.723
Sometimes pigs just need to
keep their noses

00:31:06.756 --> 00:31:08.458
out of other people's
businesses.

00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:14.798
It's a tunnel.

00:31:18.068 --> 00:31:20.403
I guess we have no choice but
to keep going.

00:31:22.605 --> 00:31:24.707
I guess.

00:31:33.984 --> 00:31:35.085
What the fuck was that?

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:36.553
I don't like the sound of
that.

00:31:36.586 --> 00:31:37.554
What do you think it was?

00:31:37.587 --> 00:31:39.889
What. do you think it's what
killed Michael?

00:31:39.924 --> 00:31:42.092
I'm hoping that young lad is
still alive down there.

00:31:42.126 --> 00:31:42.759
What. Tony?

00:31:42.792 --> 00:31:44.360
For his sake. I hope not.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.899
What were you up to down
here. dad?

00:32:08.185 --> 00:32:09.586
Are these bones?

00:32:10.787 --> 00:32:11.788
Not just any bone.

00:32:13.157 --> 00:32:14.091
Human bone.

00:32:16.026 --> 00:32:16.893
Where are we?

00:32:18.095 --> 00:32:18.963
Hell!

00:32:35.511 --> 00:32:36.379
Shit.

00:32:37.881 --> 00:32:39.549
Well come on stairs. pick a
tunnel.

00:32:39.582 --> 00:32:40.683
There's literally two options.

00:32:40.717 --> 00:32:43.053
Well. which option would you
take?

00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:43.954
That one.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:48.691
Maybe that one.

00:32:49.927 --> 00:32:51.161
Let's just split up.

00:32:51.195 --> 00:32:54.731
Absolutely under no circumstances
are we splitting up.

00:32:55.632 --> 00:32:56.466
What's the matter?

00:32:56.499 --> 00:32:57.134
Are you scared?

00:32:57.167 --> 00:32:58.202
No. Mr. Kenning.

00:32:58.235 --> 00:33:00.104
It's because we stand a better
chance of survival

00:33:00.137 --> 00:33:01.604
if we stay as one unit.

00:33:02.705 --> 00:33:05.541
If you can't decide which
path we're gonna take.

00:33:05.575 --> 00:33:07.777
I think we need some proper
fucking leadership.

00:33:09.046 --> 00:33:10.080
You?

00:33:10.114 --> 00:33:11.115
What's the matter?

00:33:11.148 --> 00:33:12.649
Don't like a strong man?

00:33:12.682 --> 00:33:13.716
Knock it off Kenning.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.120
Well. I say we take the
right. who's with me?

00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:22.458
Left. definitely left.

00:33:22.492 --> 00:33:23.559
- Suits me.
- Yeah.

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:30.167
Cowards.

00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:35.872
Brad. this thing is
fucking useless.

00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:37.573
I'm taking it off.

00:33:40.576 --> 00:33:41.778
Get that fucking jacket off.

00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:43.113
Giving us all away.

00:33:43.147 --> 00:33:46.183
You look like a fucking traffic
cone.

00:33:56.226 --> 00:33:57.627
Did you hear that?

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.761
Yeah.

00:33:58.795 --> 00:33:59.762
What is it?

00:33:59.796 --> 00:34:00.797
Go.

00:34:34.198 --> 00:34:36.066
Where's she come from?

00:34:53.183 --> 00:34:54.717
Everybody be really careful.

00:34:54.751 --> 00:34:57.121
No loud noises. no sudden
movements.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.028
Let's push on.

00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:12.802
Take as long as you want.
pig.

00:35:30.054 --> 00:35:31.754
What was that?

00:35:31.788 --> 00:35:33.257
Williams.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.124
Where is he?

00:35:34.158 --> 00:35:35.591
Where the fuck did he go?

00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:36.692
I don't know.

00:35:36.726 --> 00:35:38.929
One minute he's here. next he's
not.

00:35:38.962 --> 00:35:41.198
Okay. there's something very
bad down there.

00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:46.003
Where the fuck. are you
seriously leaving us?

00:35:46.036 --> 00:35:47.004
Some leader.

00:35:47.037 --> 00:35:49.306
Oy. wouldn't you want him to
run after you

00:35:49.339 --> 00:35:51.008
if you were the one they took?

00:35:54.044 --> 00:35:55.279
I say we keep moving.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.081
We're sitting ducks here.

00:35:57.114 --> 00:35:58.915
Oh. shut up. Brad
wouldn't leave us.

00:36:06.023 --> 00:36:07.824
I think Rich is right on this
one.

00:36:07.857 --> 00:36:09.226
No. no. you were right
before.

00:36:09.259 --> 00:36:10.693
Brad wouldn't abandon us.

00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:11.661
Unless he's dead.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.399
First the pig. then the idiotic
hulk.

00:36:15.432 --> 00:36:17.101
Who's next?

00:36:17.134 --> 00:36:18.168
I'm not sitting around here.

00:36:18.202 --> 00:36:20.337
waiting to get took like that.

00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:22.705
I'm going.

00:36:22.738 --> 00:36:25.008
Well. I'd rather follow an
idiotic hulk

00:36:25.042 --> 00:36:26.276
than a spoiled prick..

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.149
For fuck's sake.

00:36:32.182 --> 00:36:34.318
- Brad!
- Did you find Williams?

00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:35.219
No.

00:36:36.286 --> 00:36:37.887
But I did find something else.

00:36:39.356 --> 00:36:42.993
She must have been down here
for weeks. months even.

00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:45.628
Yeah. well. she looks very
healthy. considering.

00:36:46.863 --> 00:36:47.763
Are you okay?

00:36:48.465 --> 00:36:51.135
Someone must be looking after
her.

00:36:51.168 --> 00:36:52.802
Where's your mommy and daddy?

00:36:57.441 --> 00:37:00.177
I think she wants to show us.

00:37:06.984 --> 00:37:08.385
Why do I have a bad feeling
about this?

00:37:14.291 --> 00:37:15.359
Some sort of a lab.

00:37:19.729 --> 00:37:20.931
Was this your father's?

00:37:21.797 --> 00:37:24.067
Jeez. your dad was into some
weird shit.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.048
Guys!

00:38:13.317 --> 00:38:14.184
What is this?

00:38:15.452 --> 00:38:16.320
Give me that.

00:38:19.256 --> 00:38:21.959
If this belonged to me dad. it's
mine now.

00:38:21.992 --> 00:38:23.994
Just be careful Mr. Kenning.
okay?

00:38:24.027 --> 00:38:24.995
We don't know what any of this
stuff is.

00:38:25.028 --> 00:38:27.797
Anything good we find down
here is mine.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.099
Do you hear me?

00:38:29.132 --> 00:38:30.367
This is my property.

00:38:33.136 --> 00:38:34.004
Sh!

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.793
Stay back.

00:38:57.827 --> 00:38:58.662
Stay back.

00:38:58.695 --> 00:38:59.529
Just punch her in the fucking
face.

00:38:59.563 --> 00:39:02.032
- Shut up. Kenning.
- Seriously.

00:39:02.065 --> 00:39:03.200
You're Dr. Kenning's son?

00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:05.369
Well. who the hell are you?

00:39:05.402 --> 00:39:06.970
My name is Maya.

00:39:07.004 --> 00:39:08.838
I worked with Dr. Kenning.

00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:11.174
and that vial is some of his
life's work.

00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:13.443
In other words. it's mine.

00:39:13.477 --> 00:39:16.079
Just keep your fucking hands off
it.

00:39:16.113 --> 00:39:16.947
What is it?

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.015
It's hard to explain.

00:39:18.048 --> 00:39:18.949
Wait. wait. wait.

00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:20.984
You said you worked with
Kenning's old man.

00:39:21.018 --> 00:39:22.085
What's going on?

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:23.186
Tell me why our group have been
killed.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.988
What is going on down here?

00:39:25.022 --> 00:39:26.590
Things are getting worse down
here.

00:39:28.458 --> 00:39:30.127
We need to go now.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.962
If any of you guys came down
here tracked.

00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:32.862
it's not safe anymore.

00:39:32.895 --> 00:39:34.864
We need to go now.

00:39:34.897 --> 00:39:36.500
- You know a way out of here?
- Yes.

00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:40.137
Come on let's go.

00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:53.417
Hello. we found your
daughter.

00:39:59.056 --> 00:40:00.324
Hello.

00:40:37.527 --> 00:40:38.995
Little bitch stabbed me.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.498
We need to stop the bleeding.

00:40:52.476 --> 00:40:54.177
What are these things?

00:40:57.414 --> 00:40:59.383
- I've no idea.
- Caitlin.

00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:00.650
Are we gonna survive this?

00:41:06.189 --> 00:41:07.190
How much further?

00:41:07.224 --> 00:41:08.658
There's a long way to go yet.

00:41:10.961 --> 00:41:12.162
Tell me about me dad.

00:41:12.195 --> 00:41:14.231
He dedicated his life to
develop a serum

00:41:14.264 --> 00:41:15.932
that creates better humans.

00:41:15.966 --> 00:41:17.100
Better humans?

00:41:17.134 --> 00:41:18.502
She means this.

00:41:18.535 --> 00:41:19.636
You're seriously not thinking

00:41:19.669 --> 00:41:21.138
about drinking that. are you?

00:41:21.171 --> 00:41:22.506
What's it to you?

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:24.141
This is my dad's gift to me.

00:41:24.174 --> 00:41:25.142
Oh. his gift to you?

00:41:25.175 --> 00:41:26.676
I know he would've wanted
me to have it.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.712
Oh. I can understand that.

00:41:28.745 --> 00:41:29.413
Have only known you a couple of
hours.

00:41:29.446 --> 00:41:31.481
would gladly let you take it.

00:41:31.515 --> 00:41:32.549
Did the serum work?

00:41:32.582 --> 00:41:33.650
Oh yeah.

00:41:33.683 --> 00:41:35.285
Your father was a genius.

00:41:35.318 --> 00:41:37.454
He's destined for great things
but.

00:41:38.488 --> 00:41:40.524
one of his creations killed him.

00:41:40.557 --> 00:41:41.691
His creations?

00:41:46.396 --> 00:41:48.432
That's one of the creations?

00:41:48.465 --> 00:41:52.636
His experiments were
successful in unforeseen ways.

00:41:52.669 --> 00:41:54.171
That sounds very diplomatic.

00:41:54.204 --> 00:41:56.306
What exactly does this serum do?

00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:59.176
Heightened reactions.
heightened strength

00:41:59.209 --> 00:42:01.111
but low intelligence.

00:42:01.144 --> 00:42:02.612
Wait. where do they come
from?

00:42:02.646 --> 00:42:07.184
To perfect his serum. Mr.
Kenning needed test subjects.

00:42:17.527 --> 00:42:19.162
Hey. hey. hey. calm down.

00:42:19.196 --> 00:42:20.030
Why am I here?

00:42:20.063 --> 00:42:21.231
Why am I strapped in?

00:42:22.799 --> 00:42:24.034
Please don't do this.

00:42:25.535 --> 00:42:26.603
No!

00:42:26.636 --> 00:42:27.504
No!

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.578
Test subjects?

00:42:38.815 --> 00:42:40.617
You mean the homeless?

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.585
Of course.

00:42:41.618 --> 00:42:43.520
That's why he had all this scum
on his land.

00:42:43.553 --> 00:42:45.388
He was experimenting on them.

00:42:45.422 --> 00:42:46.723
It's genius.

00:42:46.756 --> 00:42:49.292
Take worthless lives and make
them meaningful.

00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:50.560
Worthless to who?

00:42:51.528 --> 00:42:53.129
Everyone stop and be quiet.

00:42:55.499 --> 00:42:56.766
Everyone down.

00:43:06.776 --> 00:43:08.245
Where's Rebecca?

00:43:10.747 --> 00:43:12.315
She was here a minute ago.

00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:13.216
Rebecca.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.784
Brad.

00:43:14.818 --> 00:43:15.652
Brad.

00:43:15.685 --> 00:43:17.087
Sit down. Brad.

00:43:28.265 --> 00:43:29.132
Rebecca.

00:43:34.804 --> 00:43:35.639
Rebecca.

00:43:49.586 --> 00:43:51.521
Hey. get back.

00:43:51.555 --> 00:43:53.290
You fucking prick.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:58.128
Ollie. this is a big fucker.
give me help.

00:44:15.712 --> 00:44:17.213
Rebecca.

00:44:17.247 --> 00:44:18.114
Rebecca.

00:44:19.883 --> 00:44:20.850
Breathe. breathe.

00:44:20.884 --> 00:44:23.420
Ollie. I need something to stop
the bleeding.

00:44:25.455 --> 00:44:27.223
Rich.

00:44:27.257 --> 00:44:28.458
And that woman.

00:44:31.595 --> 00:44:33.129
don't trust them.

00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:36.733
They're evil.

00:44:36.766 --> 00:44:38.568
They're evil.

00:44:38.602 --> 00:44:42.472
We gotta get her somewhere.
safely. come on.

00:44:55.785 --> 00:44:56.653
Hello.

00:44:59.889 --> 00:45:00.824
Lawrence.

00:45:02.192 --> 00:45:04.794
Jeez. you scared the crap out
of me.

00:45:04.828 --> 00:45:05.829
What's going on?

00:45:05.862 --> 00:45:07.864
It's okay. don't worry.

00:45:07.897 --> 00:45:09.866
Caitlin and everyone will be
back soon.

00:45:10.968 --> 00:45:12.402
Back?

00:45:12.435 --> 00:45:14.871
From where?

00:45:14.904 --> 00:45:15.872
Where am I?

00:45:17.607 --> 00:45:18.475
We fell down.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:21.778
Where am I?

00:45:22.612 --> 00:45:24.714
We were in the basement and
we fell through the floor.

00:45:24.748 --> 00:45:26.616
into this tunnel underground.

00:45:27.283 --> 00:45:28.718
Caitlin and Officer Gray have
gone on

00:45:28.752 --> 00:45:30.153
to try and get some help.

00:45:34.224 --> 00:45:35.225
How are you feeling?

00:45:36.593 --> 00:45:38.662
My legs. I can't feel 'em.

00:45:42.899 --> 00:45:44.401
They'll be back with some
help soon.

00:45:49.305 --> 00:45:52.375
You can hold my hand if
you're scared.

00:45:52.409 --> 00:45:54.411
I'm not scared.

00:45:57.714 --> 00:46:00.483
What was that?

00:46:01.384 --> 00:46:02.252
I have no idea.

00:46:03.687 --> 00:46:04.854
Lawrence.

00:46:04.888 --> 00:46:05.755
Yeah.

00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:09.526
Don't let go of my hand.

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:10.694
Yeah. yeah. okay.

00:46:12.029 --> 00:46:14.798
Promise me.

00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:16.833
Yeah. yeah. I promise.

00:46:23.339 --> 00:46:24.207
Hey. hey.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.878
Did you see how fast that thing
was?

00:46:28.912 --> 00:46:30.747
We didn't even see it coming.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.282
Yeah.

00:46:32.315 --> 00:46:33.650
Your father's serum at work.

00:46:37.487 --> 00:46:38.855
Amazing.

00:46:38.888 --> 00:46:40.657
You're very lucky to have
that.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:41.658
It's very rare.

00:46:42.792 --> 00:46:43.994
Will it make me faster?

00:46:45.528 --> 00:46:46.396
Faster.

00:46:47.497 --> 00:46:48.431
Stronger.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.768
Smarter.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.337
How long does it last?

00:46:55.338 --> 00:46:56.173
The changes are permanent

00:46:56.207 --> 00:46:58.408
but the serum won't stay potent
forever.

00:46:59.576 --> 00:47:01.644
It's probably already starting
to weaken.

00:47:04.014 --> 00:47:05.116
What do you mean?

00:47:05.149 --> 00:47:08.451
That batch is the last batch
your father ever made.

00:47:09.987 --> 00:47:12.022
There will never be any more.

00:47:12.056 --> 00:47:12.990
I can make more.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.292
Only your father knows the
process.

00:47:16.326 --> 00:47:17.962
He never shared the formula with
anyone

00:47:17.995 --> 00:47:19.295
or even wrote it down.

00:47:19.964 --> 00:47:20.931
It died with him.

00:47:21.631 --> 00:47:26.836
So that vial is the last vial
that might ever exist.

00:47:27.637 --> 00:47:30.373
So. how do I know if there'll
be any

00:47:30.406 --> 00:47:32.542
unforeseen side effects?

00:47:32.575 --> 00:47:33.510
Give me the vial.

00:47:36.113 --> 00:47:37.347
I can tell you.

00:47:53.696 --> 00:47:56.566
I thought as much. but now I
know.

00:47:58.068 --> 00:47:59.103
What?

00:47:59.136 --> 00:48:01.905
This is the last batch your
father ever made.

00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:03.941
It's the pinnacle of your
father's work.

00:48:05.009 --> 00:48:05.909
So it's good?

00:48:08.678 --> 00:48:10.880
He told me he perfected it.

00:48:10.914 --> 00:48:12.682
That the results would be better

00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:15.485
than anything he'd ever hoped
for.

00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:17.587
It's a shame that he got killed

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.023
before he got to try it first.

00:48:23.793 --> 00:48:25.395
Are you okay?

00:48:25.428 --> 00:48:26.729
I just can't believe he died

00:48:26.763 --> 00:48:28.498
before he got to see the
results.

00:48:30.034 --> 00:48:30.900
And you.

00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:33.469
his son.

00:48:34.804 --> 00:48:37.141
You have the last vial.

00:48:37.174 --> 00:48:39.542
It's almost as if everything is
meant to be.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.477
You're blessed.

00:48:42.313 --> 00:48:44.982
Maybe we can reverse engineer
it somehow.

00:48:47.584 --> 00:48:49.786
It'll just get weaker and
weaker over time.

00:48:51.454 --> 00:48:54.791
In 24 hours. it may be
worthless. I don't know.

00:48:54.824 --> 00:48:56.459
It might be even worthless now.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.699
Do you think I should drink
it?

00:49:02.732 --> 00:49:03.934
If you don't.

00:49:06.436 --> 00:49:07.104
can I?

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.996
This is for you. dad.

00:49:35.832 --> 00:49:36.733
Brad. table.

00:49:40.703 --> 00:49:44.440
Rebecca.

00:49:44.474 --> 00:49:45.909
Rebecca.

00:49:45.943 --> 00:49:46.776
Breathe. breathe.

00:49:49.013 --> 00:49:49.913
Brad. she's gone mate.

00:49:49.947 --> 00:49:50.981
- No!
- Brad. she's gone.

00:49:51.015 --> 00:49:53.017
- No!
- Brad. she's gone.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.984
She's gone.

00:49:54.985 --> 00:49:55.852
Okay?

00:49:56.753 --> 00:49:57.620
She's gone.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.007
What was that?

00:50:31.956 --> 00:50:33.958
- What the fuck?
- Oh. God.

00:50:33.991 --> 00:50:35.125
Ollie. grab a knife.

00:50:35.159 --> 00:50:36.193
Knife's on the table.

00:50:38.695 --> 00:50:40.863
Look. just stay calm. I'm
gonna cut you out. okay?

00:50:44.268 --> 00:50:45.568
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

00:50:48.305 --> 00:50:49.974
Thank you.

00:50:50.007 --> 00:50:53.010
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

00:50:53.043 --> 00:50:54.244
No. no. no. no.

00:51:00.985 --> 00:51:03.120
What the fuck is going on?

00:51:14.664 --> 00:51:15.631
Holy shit!

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.668
Jen!

00:51:19.336 --> 00:51:20.636
Jen. we've got signal.

00:51:29.712 --> 00:51:31.614
Jen. let go of my hand.

00:51:31.647 --> 00:51:32.849
Let go of my hand.

00:51:32.882 --> 00:51:34.051
Jen. let go.

00:51:34.084 --> 00:51:34.917
Jen!

00:51:34.952 --> 00:51:35.785
Jen.

00:51:35.818 --> 00:51:36.652
Jen.

00:52:15.159 --> 00:52:17.660
I don't like the look of
this.

00:52:17.693 --> 00:52:18.561
No shit!

00:52:24.034 --> 00:52:26.702
The cupboard. go. go. go. go.

00:54:28.158 --> 00:54:30.160
Oh. I don't feel so good.

00:54:30.194 --> 00:54:32.462
It's a normal part of the
process.

00:54:32.496 --> 00:54:34.097
I feel like I wanna be sick.

00:54:34.797 --> 00:54:39.036
But at the same time. I wanna
eat a big bloody steak.

00:54:40.404 --> 00:54:42.772
Your body is growing and
changing rapidly.

00:54:43.941 --> 00:54:45.442
You'll need some protein.

00:54:56.019 --> 00:54:58.088
Why the fuck did you bring me
here?

00:54:58.121 --> 00:54:59.256
You fucking backstabber.

00:54:59.289 --> 00:55:00.224
No.

00:55:00.257 --> 00:55:03.360
I'm alive because I've earned
their trust.

00:55:03.393 --> 00:55:04.760
You have to do the same.

00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:08.198
He's got a vial.

00:55:08.232 --> 00:55:10.167
I thought you said I had the
last one.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:14.037
He doesn't have the perfected
batch like yours.

00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:15.305
Are you lying to me?

00:55:22.179 --> 00:55:23.779
Mr. Kenning's son. he's with
us.

00:55:40.896 --> 00:55:42.499
Was that it?

00:55:42.532 --> 00:55:43.400
Am I safe?

00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:45.269
No.

00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:48.238
Prove your worth.

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.308
What are you talking about?

00:55:52.842 --> 00:55:55.178
You must fight one of the
tribe.

00:56:46.096 --> 00:56:47.130
There.

00:56:47.164 --> 00:56:49.066
Does that prove my worth?

00:56:49.099 --> 00:56:51.501
You've defeated the weakest
member of the tribe.

00:56:52.569 --> 00:56:54.538
Now the tribe lives within you.

00:56:55.505 --> 00:56:57.107
Whoa. I beat him.

00:56:58.175 --> 00:56:59.443
I won!

00:56:59.476 --> 00:57:00.344
I won!

00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:09.319
Now what?

00:57:09.353 --> 00:57:11.221
You have to kill the one you
beat.

00:57:12.956 --> 00:57:15.492
He's no longer a member of the
tribe.

01:02:41.618 --> 01:02:43.253
Come on. Caitlin.

01:02:43.286 --> 01:02:43.954
Where are you?

01:02:45.422 --> 01:02:47.557
These tunnels can't go on
forever.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.792
We'll run into her eventually.

01:02:51.795 --> 01:02:53.329
They just don't give up. do
they?

01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.568
Ollie. back-to-back.

01:02:58.601 --> 01:02:59.536
You deal with everything in this
direction.

01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:01.805
I'll deal with everything in
that direction.

01:03:02.806 --> 01:03:03.941
Any Army tips for me?

01:03:03.974 --> 01:03:05.475
Yeah. don't get hit.

01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:10.847
Switch sides. switch sides.

01:03:28.832 --> 01:03:30.700
Did you see that shit?

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:33.837
Ollie!

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.989
How's your injury?

01:04:25.022 --> 01:04:26.123
Injury?

01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:28.926
Did you not see me fighting with
my usual high standards?

01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:29.793
I didn't notice.

01:04:29.826 --> 01:04:31.594
Well. that's harsh.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:35.465
He didn't make it.

01:04:35.498 --> 01:04:36.967
No one made it.

01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:38.902
Maybe that prick. Richard
Kenning.

01:04:38.936 --> 01:04:40.370
So. where is he?

01:04:40.403 --> 01:04:42.072
He run off with some woman we
found.

01:04:42.106 --> 01:04:42.772
Some woman?

01:04:42.806 --> 01:04:43.974
She works with Kenning's dad.

01:04:44.008 --> 01:04:46.944
She said that apparently. they
made all of these monsters

01:04:46.977 --> 01:04:48.545
out of the homeless people.

01:04:48.578 --> 01:04:49.445
Jesus!

01:04:50.814 --> 01:04:52.715
We need to get out of here.
Brad.

01:04:52.749 --> 01:04:54.118
I don't wanna leave him.

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:55.685
We need to prioritize our
safety.

01:04:55.718 --> 01:04:57.554
We're gonna have to come back
for him.

01:04:58.488 --> 01:04:59.556
Yes. ma'am.

01:05:26.683 --> 01:05:27.550
What's going on?

01:05:27.584 --> 01:05:29.519
They're questioning your
presence.

01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:30.988
I've already proved my worth.

01:06:09.626 --> 01:06:12.795
You lied to me. I know you
did.

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:13.696
You bitch!

01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:18.501
What have you done to me?

01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:19.203
I've turned you into
something

01:06:19.236 --> 01:06:21.638
your father would be proud of.

01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:23.140
Why?

01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:24.908
Because you're just like your
father.

01:06:24.942 --> 01:06:25.909
Bullshit!

01:06:26.944 --> 01:06:28.045
Remember what you said

01:06:28.078 --> 01:06:30.613
about making worthless lives
useful?

01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:33.650
You're eager to continue his
work.

01:06:33.683 --> 01:06:34.550
Bitch.

01:06:36.186 --> 01:06:38.454
It wasn't one of his creations
that killed him.

01:06:38.488 --> 01:06:39.156
It was you.

01:06:41.658 --> 01:06:42.960
Don't strain yourself.

01:06:42.993 --> 01:06:44.761
It'll just make the pain worse.

01:06:45.963 --> 01:06:47.830
Get back here.

01:06:47.864 --> 01:06:49.532
Bitch!

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:06.951
Jesus. Caitlin.

01:07:07.684 --> 01:07:10.054
You paid attention in basic
training.

01:07:10.087 --> 01:07:11.088
That should do it.

01:07:12.056 --> 01:07:14.091
So. they draw first blood?

01:07:35.812 --> 01:07:37.214
Who are you. Mary Poppins?

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:38.815
Where did you get all that
stuff?

01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:40.250
Found a little storage room.

01:07:41.651 --> 01:07:42.685
These things must have raided

01:07:42.719 --> 01:07:44.121
that disused mine we drove past.

01:07:44.154 --> 01:07:44.787
Yeah.

01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:45.990
I reckon all these tunnels.

01:07:46.023 --> 01:07:47.623
they're all connected somehow.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:53.896
Seriously?

01:07:57.001 --> 01:07:58.969
And to think Kenning's dad
was experimenting

01:07:59.003 --> 01:08:00.304
on all these poor souls.

01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.006
and everyone thought he was
helping them.

01:08:02.039 --> 01:08:03.273
Whoever they were.

01:08:03.307 --> 01:08:06.210
their personalities have long
been erased.

01:08:06.243 --> 01:08:08.012
Whatever he did to them.

01:08:08.045 --> 01:08:11.115
I don't even think you can call
them human anymore.

01:08:11.148 --> 01:08:12.782
Just like animals.

01:08:12.815 --> 01:08:13.716
Mindless.

01:08:15.085 --> 01:08:16.519
just run on instinct.

01:08:18.654 --> 01:08:21.225
Okay. I think we're good until
we get you to a doctor.

01:08:24.094 --> 01:08:25.728
I hate you.

01:08:25.762 --> 01:08:26.964
You big baby.

01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:33.003
I swear to God. Caitlin.

01:08:33.037 --> 01:08:36.140
if we get out of this. we
getting different jobs?

01:08:36.173 --> 01:08:37.807
We?

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.109
Yeah!

01:08:39.143 --> 01:08:40.010
We.

01:08:50.787 --> 01:08:51.621
We need to go.

01:08:51.654 --> 01:08:56.659
Yeah.

01:09:17.214 --> 01:09:19.316
Please. I'm not looking for a
fight.

01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:20.551
Who's this?

01:09:20.583 --> 01:09:22.386
This is the evil bitch who
was helping old man Kenning

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:23.987
with his experiments.

01:09:24.021 --> 01:09:26.990
I didn't help Kenning. I
stopped him.

01:09:27.024 --> 01:09:28.325
And we are meant to believe
you why?

01:09:28.358 --> 01:09:30.294
I literally just saved your
lives.

01:09:30.327 --> 01:09:31.428
I'm not buying it.

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:34.231
You run off the very second that
Rebecca was attacked.

01:09:34.264 --> 01:09:36.799
I had to get away for my own
safety.

01:09:36.833 --> 01:09:39.735
I didn't know who yo guys were
or if I could trust you.

01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:41.771
Rich was the one that followed
me.

01:09:41.804 --> 01:09:43.873
So. what do you want now?

01:09:43.906 --> 01:09:46.243
I wanna burn this place down
to the ground.

01:09:46.276 --> 01:09:48.911
Anyone who has a similar goal is
an ally of mine.

01:09:48.946 --> 01:09:51.747
And what about your newfound
friend. Rich?

01:09:51.781 --> 01:09:54.384
I told you he followed me.

01:09:54.418 --> 01:09:55.918
He's obsessed with his dad.

01:09:55.953 --> 01:09:57.653
he thought I had all the
answers.

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:01.757
I didn't help Kenning.

01:10:02.725 --> 01:10:03.860
I was abducted.

01:10:04.928 --> 01:10:06.029
I'd lost everything.

01:10:07.297 --> 01:10:09.166
I didn't know anyone in this
country.

01:10:11.368 --> 01:10:13.971
I came to the farm because there
was a generous man

01:10:14.004 --> 01:10:16.706
who offered to help people down
on their luck.

01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:18.741
When Kenning first brought me
down here.

01:10:19.543 --> 01:10:22.312
he was going to experiment on
me.

01:10:22.346 --> 01:10:24.148
But I managed to get out of it.

01:10:24.181 --> 01:10:25.748
So why didn't you escape?

01:10:25.781 --> 01:10:27.317
When Dr. Kenning died.

01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:30.087
I thought that escaping this
place would be easy.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.755
But his creatures go wild
without their leader.

01:10:33.557 --> 01:10:35.392
They didn't kill me but they
didn't want me to leave.

01:10:35.425 --> 01:10:36.859
So. where's Rich now?

01:10:36.893 --> 01:10:38.195
I forced him to drink the
medicine

01:10:38.228 --> 01:10:40.030
before he could force it on
anyone else.

01:10:40.063 --> 01:10:42.032
What does the medicine do?

01:10:42.065 --> 01:10:44.001
It turns you into these
monsters.

01:10:45.335 --> 01:10:47.437
One of his father's tribe.

01:10:47.471 --> 01:10:49.239
So Rich is one of them now?

01:10:49.273 --> 01:10:52.075
He's still turning. but he
will be.

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.311
Brilliant.

01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:57.047
So now he's gonna be twice as
fast. twice as strong

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.215
and twice as stupid.

01:10:59.149 --> 01:11:00.783
You wanna destroy this place?

01:11:02.186 --> 01:11:04.188
We need to find somewhere to
plant these.

01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:05.289
Follow me.

01:11:19.369 --> 01:11:21.104
That stupid bitch.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.840
I do feel stronger.

01:11:26.343 --> 01:11:28.212
That vial hasn't done me any
harm.

01:11:30.846 --> 01:11:33.483
My Kenning blood has kept me
strong.

01:11:35.285 --> 01:11:36.353
Give me another vial.

01:11:38.388 --> 01:11:39.323
I'll be even stronger.

01:11:45.395 --> 01:11:48.198
Don't you know all this is mine?

01:11:48.232 --> 01:11:50.033
My dad made you.

01:11:50.067 --> 01:11:51.101
You're mine.

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:01.311
Where are you going?

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.514
Is it that bitch?

01:12:14.857 --> 01:12:17.294
This is a part of the old
mining pit.

01:12:17.327 --> 01:12:18.996
It's directly under the cave
system

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:20.097
where Kenning's creations live.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.499
And what's with the
explosives?

01:12:22.532 --> 01:12:23.967
Left over from the mine.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.237
So. if we blow this place
up...

01:12:28.038 --> 01:12:29.872
Their whole world will
collapse.

01:12:29.905 --> 01:12:31.241
And it'll finally be over.

01:12:32.376 --> 01:12:34.077
Let's see what's in those
barrels.

01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:55.365
Can I help?

01:12:55.399 --> 01:12:57.034
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

01:12:57.067 --> 01:12:58.068
Be careful.

01:12:58.101 --> 01:12:59.369
This stuff is really volatile.

01:12:59.403 --> 01:13:00.836
The chemical compounds in
dynamite

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:02.439
haven't changed for 200 years.

01:13:12.049 --> 01:13:14.518
Very knowledgeable. for a man
with muscles

01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:16.320
where his brain should be.

01:13:16.353 --> 01:13:19.122
You're looking a little under
the weather there. Rich.

01:13:19.156 --> 01:13:22.993
Did you really think I was
gonna let you destroy

01:13:23.026 --> 01:13:25.295
my dad's legacy?

01:13:26.096 --> 01:13:29.066
You're just another sick.
twisted prick.

01:13:29.099 --> 01:13:30.300
just like your father.

01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:34.538
Well. they say the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

01:13:41.445 --> 01:13:46.450
This guy will kill all three of
you with his bare hands.

01:13:49.686 --> 01:13:50.620
Go get her.

01:13:52.055 --> 01:13:53.924
He looks like he's taken his
juice.

01:13:55.692 --> 01:13:57.127
Let's go daddy's boy.

01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:42.999
They're twice as fast. twice
as strong.

01:15:43.033 --> 01:15:44.401
Stop!

01:15:44.434 --> 01:15:45.502
Your mom!

01:15:45.535 --> 01:15:46.703
Twice as stupid.

01:18:26.529 --> 01:18:27.397
Caitlin.

01:18:28.898 --> 01:18:29.766
Help me.

01:18:31.201 --> 01:18:31.868
Brad.

01:18:38.341 --> 01:18:39.209
Hey.

01:18:40.543 --> 01:18:41.678
Scared you'd lost me?

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:44.648
That's good.

01:18:47.283 --> 01:18:48.151
Maya.

01:19:08.271 --> 01:19:09.606
I'm sorry.

01:19:09.639 --> 01:19:11.307
Sorry for what?

01:19:11.341 --> 01:19:13.410
I didn't attach the last
explosive on time.

01:19:13.443 --> 01:19:15.245
No worries. we can do it.

01:19:15.946 --> 01:19:18.248
Hold this. apply pressure.

01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:21.518
You don't understand.

01:19:21.551 --> 01:19:23.253
They're attracted to the noise.

01:19:23.286 --> 01:19:24.955
This place is going to be filled
with creatures.

01:19:24.989 --> 01:19:26.957
you guys won't be able to fight
them.

01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:28.625
Then we need to get you out
of here.

01:19:28.658 --> 01:19:29.659
I'm not going anywhere.

01:19:29.693 --> 01:19:30.827
And I'm not leaving you
behind.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.929
We can get you help.

01:19:31.962 --> 01:19:33.596
I'm losing too much blood.

01:19:34.264 --> 01:19:36.533
I'll die either in here or out
there.

01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:39.602
I'd rather die knowing that I
took this place

01:19:39.636 --> 01:19:41.237
to hell with me.

01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:42.006
What are you saying?

01:19:42.039 --> 01:19:43.640
Even if you could save me.

01:19:44.774 --> 01:19:46.309
I don't wanna live in a world

01:19:46.342 --> 01:19:47.877
where this place still exists.

01:19:51.347 --> 01:19:53.017
We can't let you do that.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.718
You have no choice.

01:19:54.751 --> 01:19:56.720
I'm going to blow this place up.

01:19:56.753 --> 01:19:58.254
whether you're here or not.

01:19:59.422 --> 01:20:00.390
Come on.

01:20:00.423 --> 01:20:02.325
Come on. Caitlin

01:20:02.358 --> 01:20:03.626
Go!

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.494
Run!

01:21:26.944 --> 01:21:29.079
That's it. I'm done.

01:21:29.113 --> 01:21:30.847
I'm serving cocktails on a
beach.

01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:34.818
What. with shit pay and lousy
tourists?

01:21:35.986 --> 01:21:38.855
No responsibilities. good
weather.

01:21:38.888 --> 01:21:40.958
Yeah. the easy life.
