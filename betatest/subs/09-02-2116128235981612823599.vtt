00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:05.875
My name is Wei Jinbei

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.375
Since I started my first business at 22

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.292
I've been following startup trends closely

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:10.292
I've done shared bike apps

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:11.125
grocery delivery apps

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:12.000
dating apps

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.042
and various e-commerce businesses

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:15.000
Those who claim that I have too many interests

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:16.875
don't really know me

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.167
Son. pick one

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:20.792
I'm actually very loyal

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:21.625
I'm loyal to money

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:22.208
Awesome

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.083
My latest failure happened 15 days ago

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:27.208
when I lost 890000 yuan. last of my savings

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:29.167
I've been suffered from insomnia since then

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.458
I couldn't fall asleep. not even a second

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:32.792
Someone suggested I go see a shrink

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:34.083
All my other patients

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:35.167
fell asleep here

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:37.208
I can't sleep. that's why I'm here

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:38.708
My doctor has stopped my medication

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.042
Too many pills is no good

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.333
Look at that painting

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.625
It looks so sad

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.083
Your horse is dying

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:47.750
I suggest

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.083
you take a break from work

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:50.458
I haven't worked for 15 days

00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:51.500
I think

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:52.167
you should go somewhere

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.417
where you can enjoy a simple life

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.417
Stay for a while

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.708
with your friends

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:56.667
Where?

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:57.417
Hunan

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.125
Hainan

00:02:58.208 --> 00:02:58.917
Yunnan

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.917
You just go

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.167
where your friends are

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:03.792
I don't have friends

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:06.208
And I have nowhere to go

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:09.583
Okay then

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.458
Let me give you a cupping

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.750
I'm standing on the rooftop of a 38-floor building

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.375
100 meters above ground

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:18.125
With an acceleration of 9.8 m/s/s

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:19.542
in about 4.472 seconds

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:21.083
I will bid farewell to the world

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:22.583
Five

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:24.500
Four

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.458
Three

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.083
Two

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.000
One

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.542
Please sign for your package

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:36.625
My name is Peng Xiubing

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.542
I was born in Jingmai Mountain. Yunnan Province

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.875
Since childhood. Dad's been telling me to see the outside world

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:42.708
What's so good about outside?

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.042
You should know it

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.500
What does it have?

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:48.500
Everything. You should take a good look at everything

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:54.417
Dad

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.625
I wouldn't come back if I can't make it in Beijing

00:03:56.708 --> 00:03:58.208
Don't come back if you can make it there

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.500
Or I'll beat you up

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:01.750
After I left home

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.792
I found the ideal job to immerse myself in city life

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:04.750
I found the ideal job to immerse myself in city life
10 Years Later. Beijing

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.167
10 Years Later. Beijing

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:05.875
10 Years Later. Beijing
deliveryman

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:06.250
deliveryman

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.667
This month's Star of Deliveryman is still

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.542
the peerless

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.542
Peng Xiubing!

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:14.917
I have delivered more than 500000 packages

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.125
and won the Star for more than 100 times

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:17.000
What's our motto?

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:18.833
Beating Peng Xiubing

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:19.958
Becoming No.1!

00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:22.875
More importantly. I've saved up 190000 yuan

00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.167
This morning

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.958
I finally told my boss:

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.042
I'm quitting

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:31.625
Xiubing

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:32.708
What are you talking about?

00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:34.792
You got your salary yesterday

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:36.083
No need to pay me for today

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.083
I'm going back home tomorrow to start my own delivery

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:39.333
You ever heard of the saying

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:40.417
even pigs stand a chance to fly

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.833
when there is favorable wind blowing?

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:43.542
Why did you put your photo up here?

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:45.833
Not bad. huh?

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.708
My last package in Beijing

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.083
Nothing can stop the perfect ending

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.333
Wei Jinbei.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.500
why is your office emptied out?

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.000
I was looking for you everywhere. heard you're on the rooftop

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:56.708
Come down and pick up your package

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.208
Here

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.250
Keep it

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.292
I can keep it. but you need to sign for it

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:05.708
It's my last package

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:07.250
Sign for it. for my sake

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:16.250
Last one?

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:17.042
Yes

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:19.042
- Are you fired? - Of course not!

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:21.292
I fired my boss. I'm starting my own delivery business

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.042
Anyone can start a business these days

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:26.167
I used to believe

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:28.542
as long as I'm making a difference of the world

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:30.625
even if I fail eventually

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:32.750
it's my business that fails. not me

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.083
I was wrong

00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:38.625
I am the failure

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:42.333
Well said

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:43.625
I'm writing in down

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.667
It's the business that failed

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:49.667
not

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.750
the person

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.292
You think it's well said?

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.500
Of course!

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.333
I never lie to my friend

00:05:58.625 --> 00:05:59.792
I'm just a client

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:00.583
Not really your friend

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:01.500
We've known each other for so long

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:03.417
I've always treated you as a friend

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.542
I'm leaving. you?

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:10.833
I'm leaving as well

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.208
Where to?

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:23.208
Hunan

00:06:23.292 --> 00:06:24.167
Hainan. Yunnan

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.917
Wherever

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.833
Yunnan?

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:27.500
I'm going back to Yunnan! Come with me!

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:28.375
With you?

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.792
You're my friend. let's go together

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.542
In your case. a good crying will help a lot

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:50.792
A client of mine told me

00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:52.292
Don't focus on whether you can succeed or not

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:53.417
Focus on your destination

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.792
despite the hardships on the road

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.833
Only fools believe this

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:59.542
There's nothing at the destination. it's just far away

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:01.458
Another client told me

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.208
One cannot be defeated

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:05.292
if you can rise up again

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:09.375
When you are defeated more than enough times

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.167
you'll know it's easiest to lie down

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.042
Many of my clients have returned to their hometowns

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:15.958
They are doing pretty well

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:18.208
They look happy on social media

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:20.333
There's no traffic jam. no car crash

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:22.125
No cold-shoulder or sneers in the countryside

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:27.500
I've never given up my hopes

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:28.417
Sing with me

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.542
Forgive my passion for freedom

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.250
Even someday I may fall hard...

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:26.875
Rise

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:35.625
Old Li. get down here!

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:37.417
Let young people do it!

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:41.375
I can't trust others with the ancestor worship ceremony

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:42.833
I have to do it myself

00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:44.708
If I piss off a person

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:46.083
I can apologize

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.167
But pissing off the ancestors. that I can't afford

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.292
Rest assured. my legs are still strong

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:53.625
Don't jinx it

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:54.333
Be quiet

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:56.375
Hurry up. it's the tea god ceremony!

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.292
That's the head of our village

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.708
The fireworks rose higher than we could get it to

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:07.333
Stop there!

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:10.625
Why don't you stay in the city like others?

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.958
Beating up your son can't solve any problem

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.792
Stop chasing him around

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.125
Let him explain himself first

00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:18.958
You used to beat up your son like he was a thief

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:20.583
Now you ask me to stop?

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:21.917
None of your business

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.792
Let's not change the subject

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.333
And dare you mention my dead son again!

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.792
Shaoqun is dead?

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:28.917
For many years

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.792
Don't interrupt adults

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.250
Come

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:33.833
Just talk to me

00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:35.458
I'll reason it out

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:36.708
What's the reason

00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:38.292
you decided to come back?

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:40.292
I came back to start my own business

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:42.458
I want to open a package delivery shop

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:43.792
here in the village

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:45.792
Go on

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:49.667
Stop yelling! I haven't even touched you

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:51.917
It wasn't me

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.375
Don't move

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:07.292
The best cure to insect sting

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.250
is to have a cow lick it

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:11.292
If you move around and startle it

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.625
it may lick the wrong place

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:23.000
I feel so dirty

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.042
So dirty

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.167
Eat. and you'll recover fast

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:34.625
Villagers. may I say a few words

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:36.625
The fireworks at the ceremony

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:38.917
had a small accident

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.750
But as long as our prayer was sincere

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.958
our ancestor would hear it

00:11:44.042 --> 00:11:49.500
We will have a big tea harvest this year!

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.792
So what?

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:51.833
We'll still have a hard time selling it

00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:53.958
Isn't our tea of great quality?

00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:54.917
Nowadays

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
only aged Pu'er tea cakes can sell

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.167
New leaves are valueless

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.625
We have to crush them

00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:01.042
and sell the bagged tea to factories

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:03.375
Praying to the ancestors is useless

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:04.458
The tea factories owners are our god

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:06.375
The tea factories owners are our god

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:07.667
Who said that!

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:11.000
He heard that?

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:15.375
It's a great day today

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:17.083
so I will keep my cool

00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:19.500
Who was talking just now

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:21.875
Stand up!

00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:25.000
I make less than 500 yuan

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:26.125
on average every month

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.792
Whoever wants to keep growing tea. go ahead

00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:29.750
Just saying. even construction workers make 80 yuan a day in cities

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:30.875
Fuck off!

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.708
Number of Young People Leaving the Village:

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:35.250
What don't you sell your tea online?

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:36.917
How would you know the taste

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.542
by looking at photos?

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.458
Villagers. eat!

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:44.708
Eat!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.417
It tastes good indeed

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.500
Nevertheless. the competition is fierce

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:50.917
the core customers are elders

00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:52.917
who don't do much online shopping

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.417
and the tea lacks branding

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.542
No wonder it doesn't sell

00:12:58.458 --> 00:12:59.917
I'm blabbing about work again

00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:04.375
The closest delivery shop to Huanglu Village

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:06.917
is 20km away

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.708
For this reason. almost nobody here does online shopping

00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:11.542
When I was a delivery guy in the city

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.542
we fought for every potential customer

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:14.625
You know why?

00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:15.750
In delivery business

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:17.625
your customer base is the goldmine

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.500
If I can start a delivery business here

00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:21.042
use our village as a portal

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.792
to cover the last-mile service in neighboring villages

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:24.000
One day. the number of rural population in China

00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:25.333
will be the number of my customers

00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:26.917
I'm not coming back to this shithole!

00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:27.792
I'm not coming back to this shithole!
Number of Young People Leaving the Village:

00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:28.750
Number of Young People Leaving the Village:

00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:32.250
Except for these guys

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:36.125
Doesn't it look like honey?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.833
All you need is a straw to suck it out

00:13:40.708 --> 00:13:41.875
No it doesn't

00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:43.958
It looks like shit

00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:45.708
You put a straw in it

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:47.292
you are stirring the shit pot

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.000
You have to understand

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.167
The reason why there's no delivery here

00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:53.833
is that no one shops online

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:54.958
It's not the other way round

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:56.333
Don't confuse cause and effect

00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:58.000
I took a good look at the villagers during the banquet

00:13:58.083 --> 00:13:59.583
Asides from the few young people who just left

00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:01.708
there are only old people and children

00:14:01.792 --> 00:14:02.500
That being said

00:14:02.583 --> 00:14:03.583
those who stay in the village

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:05.167
are not your customers

00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:07.583
The ones who left are

00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:10.583
That's why I'm giving you my thoughts

00:14:10.792 --> 00:14:12.417
You are in e-commerce and I'm a delivery guy

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.458
We are a perfect match

00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:14.583
Enough

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:15.958
I don't need another failure

00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:17.625
That's why you are in urgent need of success

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.417
I don't need success

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.750
I need to stay away from failure

00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:21.583
I'm leaving

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.417
Is that a deal?

00:14:37.542 --> 00:14:38.708
Get lost!

00:14:40.917 --> 00:14:41.750
Go

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:43.125
Easy. easy

00:14:44.167 --> 00:14:46.792
If it wasn't because my shrink's advise

00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.833
I would have done anything to go back

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:15.667
Your eye is recovered?

00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:18.167
The licking works

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:25.917
Have some tea

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:28.292
Today is the 23rd day of my insomnia

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:30.375
The second day I'm in Huanglu Village

00:15:30.917 --> 00:15:32.625
I'll probably never be able to fall asleep again

00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:35.792
Today is the first day of my startup

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.500
I've figured it all out in Beijing

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:41.167
I'm only three steps from success

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.833
The first step: merge and acquisition

00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:50.250
DO NOT MENTION LI SHAOQUN

00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:51.375
Before Shaoqun died

00:15:51.458 --> 00:15:53.458
what heinous crime did he commit?

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:01.375
How much?

00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:02.375
Two yuan

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:04.083
I'm talking about your shop

00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:08.667
Step two. recruiting

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:10.250
Xiubing Delivery

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:11.792
fast and accessible

00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:13.208
secure and reliable

00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:14.708
deliver to your home with one click!

00:16:14.792 --> 00:16:16.917
Xiubing delivers everywhere

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.875
Xiubing brings convenience to us all!

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.500
Great!

00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:23.792
This guy

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:24.833
used to be a postman

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.250
Where there was human. there was me

00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:29.208
This guy used to be a barber

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.292
Where there was human head. there was me

00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:33.250
Yay

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.292
This guy... is really something

00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:36.042
I used to be a feces collector

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.708
Where there was human feces...

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:40.042
now I'm saying it

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:40.958
it sounds

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.375
inappropriate...

00:16:43.667 --> 00:16:45.250
They've spent their lives running around this town

00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:46.583
They know every road by heart

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:47.750
They know every road by heart

00:16:47.833 --> 00:16:48.583
Having them as our delivery men

00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:50.625
will greatly increase our efficiency

00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:51.417
What do you think?

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.750
What have I got to do with it?

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:53.792
You're my business partner

00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:55.500
this is our opening day. you need to say something...

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.458
Since when I became your partner...

00:16:56.542 --> 00:16:57.542
A round of applause!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.292
These men have a combined age of more than 1000 years old

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:04.917
Having them deliver packages

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.958
I'm worried that before they can send off the packages

00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:10.167
the packages would send them off the world

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.125
You brat

00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.750
look at your leg. you think you're better than us?

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.542
Uncle. for my sake

00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:17.542
Enough of talking. just show him what you've got

00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:31.792
Iron fist

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:45.250
Assemble!

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.875
How was it?

00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:54.083
If there's no online shopping

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:56.125
there's no package to deliver

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.208
It's useless to hire delivery men

00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:00.667
That I already have the solution

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.958
Online shopping 101

00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:04.083
Step 1. register an online banking account

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.417
Step 2. download a payment app

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.708
Stop

00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:10.625
It's too complicated

00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:11.708
I spent three days working on it

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:12.833
This is the easiest tutorial

00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:14.583
I can solve your problem with one simple trick

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:15.708
That's not possible

00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:17.792
- Do you want to buy stuff online? - Yes

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:20.292
Give me your money. I'll do it for you

00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:22.333
If you want something

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:23.833
why do you care how you get it?

00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:27.500
Anyone going to the farmer's market?

00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:29.208
Seems like your biggest competitor

00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:30.875
is that market

00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.500
Let's go meet the competitor

00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:36.000
Step three. expand the market share

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:37.667
If not seeing it myself

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.750
I wouldn't believe that

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.125
people still do shopping in this primitive way

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.458
But they are all our potential customers

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.875
What do you want? Give me the money. I'll buy it for you

00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.167
No need. What a wacko

00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:52.208
Don't get distracted

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:54.000
you're not here to sell goods

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:56.083
you're selling the concept of online shopping

00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:58.208
I get it

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.208
Villagers listen up

00:19:00.292 --> 00:19:02.292
everything here you can buy online

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:04.583
They are cheap and of good quality

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.458
If you don't know how to do online shopping

00:19:06.542 --> 00:19:07.667
just give me the money

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.792
I'll place orders for you

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:11.292
Hello. come on in. what can I get for you?

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:13.625
How much is it to rent your TV?

00:19:14.667 --> 00:19:16.500
Don't miss out

00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:17.750
Come take a look!

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:18.792
You name it. we have it!

00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:20.667
Lowest price in the market!

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.292
Best deal. best goods!

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:25.125
Come take a look!

00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:27.542
Auntie. come take a look

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.667
We have everything

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.292
Got rice cooker?

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.208
Yes. 168 yuan

00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:34.792
Yes! 168 yuan!

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:36.833
Mine is 167!

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:39.333
It's on sales on Juhuasuan. buy one get one free

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:41.417
168 for two!

00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:44.000
You're messing up with me!

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:45.417
Got slippers?

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.042
Yes

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:46.875
Yes!

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.708
Any fortune tellers?

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:49.875
Yes!

00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.833
Fortune telling first. pay later!

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:54.458
You have helicopters?

00:19:54.542 --> 00:19:56.250
- Yes - We have it! Do you want it?

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:57.833
It's okay. I was joking

00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.667
Let me know what you need

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.417
Any cheap TVs?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.292
Any big TVs?

00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:06.667
I need to use the bathroom

00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:07.958
Hurry up

00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:09.125
Excuse me

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.625
- What kind of TV do you want? - The same as yours

00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.958
Biggers one will do. too

00:20:14.042 --> 00:20:15.917
The bigger the cheaper. the better

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.208
Do you have

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:19.792
Yes. we have the same model

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:22.292
Only 799. you want it?

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:23.458
I want two rice cookers

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:24.792
Give me your address

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.500
- you'll get them in three days - Three days?

00:20:26.583 --> 00:20:28.875
Con-man!

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:30.375
He's a con-man!

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:31.958
You are a con-man!

00:20:32.042 --> 00:20:33.250
No

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.958
I'm just helping you guys place orders online

00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:40.208
Catch him. he's a con-man!

00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:41.125
Con-man!

00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.417
Catch him. don't let him run off!

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.792
Catch him!

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:49.500
Catch him. don't let him run off!

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:50.917
Catch him!

00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:53.500
I'm not smart

00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:55.458
I don't know how to talk about big ideas

00:20:55.542 --> 00:20:57.083
but I know what's the right thing to do

00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:59.208
Your method definitely works

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:00.542
It worked last time

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:02.083
People who wanted to beat us got overcrowded

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:03.167
They couldn't even reach us

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.333
I'm going again tomorrow

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.875
You should just give up on the delivery business

00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.667
The whole idea is wrong

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.292
so every step followed is a misstep

00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:12.083
The more you persist

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:13.625
the more mistakes you make

00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:16.542
I've done one thing right

00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:19.125
What is it?

00:21:19.292 --> 00:21:20.250
I brought you back

00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:21.292
Since I decided to open the shop

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:22.417
It's the best decision I've made

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.167
You have my word

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.208
If my shop becomes successful

00:21:24.292 --> 00:21:26.250
You'll have a share as my business partner

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:28.625
I didn't agree to become a partner

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.333
Then you be the boss. I'll be the manager

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:34.917
That's not what I meant

00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:39.958
I could be your consultant

00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:42.750
I promise

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:44.750
- I'll make you a partner as soon as... - I said I don't want to be a partner

00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:46.000
Excuse me

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:48.917
I heard you have a lot of cheap goods?

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.083
Yes

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:54.167
You pay first and we deliver later

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.167
Deliver to your home with one click

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.292
Pay first? With one click?

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.208
That's right

00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:02.958
Why should I believe you?

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:07.583
Then

00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:09.917
You can get your package first and pay later...

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.125
Really?

00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:12.208
Are you sure?

00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:13.250
Come here

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.375
Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.625
Hurry up!

00:22:21.417 --> 00:22:23.125
Hurry up!

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.542
Hurry up! Here! Hurry up!

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:25.792
Here! Hurry up! Hurry!

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:27.542
One auntie can bring four aunties

00:22:27.625 --> 00:22:29.458
A good-looking auntie. can bring three uncles

00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:31.792
There are the customers from one farmers' market

00:22:31.875 --> 00:22:33.292
Although that will probably piss off three aunties

00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.958
One couple can bring at least two kids

00:22:35.042 --> 00:22:36.917
Two kids can bring two couples...

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
If I go to more markets. get beaten up more

00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:40.500
I can attract more customers

00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:42.708
I think my body can withstand seven or eight more beatings

00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:44.208
We make 1.5 yuan per package

00:22:44.292 --> 00:22:45.250
There are 12 villages in the area

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.583
Assuming each village has 100 aunties

00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:47.625
and 50 kids who do online shopping

00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:48.708
Then the delivery fee in total would be...

00:22:48.792 --> 00:22:50.583
Wait. wait. wait. wait

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.083
Consultant. what's our chance of success?

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:54.417
I need to think about it

00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:55.875
Not zero anymore I'm sure

00:23:02.292 --> 00:23:04.375
Thermal cup. 40

00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:34.208
TV or instant noodles

00:23:34.292 --> 00:23:36.250
just let me know what you want

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.083
Fridges? No problem!

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.125
What's our motto?

00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:40.375
Deliver to your home with one click!

00:23:40.458 --> 00:23:41.500
Let's go!

00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:50.833
Next

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.167
What are you doing here?

00:23:55.417 --> 00:23:56.083
Don't get me wrong

00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:58.083
Just wanted to check out where you bought your goods

00:23:59.542 --> 00:24:01.250
Leave. we are not selling to you

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:02.458
Wait. our door is open to all customers

00:24:02.542 --> 00:24:03.417
You're welcomed here

00:24:23.167 --> 00:24:24.208
This is awesome

00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:27.917
- Hello? - You need to turn on your phone first

00:24:33.417 --> 00:24:34.458
Smaller than my size!

00:24:34.542 --> 00:24:36.458
I can't wear this

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:38.000
It doesn't fit?

00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:38.833
That's right

00:24:38.917 --> 00:24:39.792
I'll return it for you

00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:42.292
If you bought the wrong size. we can return it for you

00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:43.125
Order as you wish

00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:44.750
we guarantee an unconditional return

00:25:10.708 --> 00:25:11.458
Peng Xiubing

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.000
How come the shipping address says "back mountain"?

00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:15.083
Who's package is this?

00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:17.375
Li Shaoqun

00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:22.292
He's dead?

00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:23.500
For many years.

00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:28.333
It's a ghost!

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.250
Isn't he dead?

00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:40.000
I'm a patient

00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:41.542
Please don't scare me

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.333
Let's go

00:25:46.042 --> 00:25:47.167
Where to?

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:50.958
To your home with one click!

00:25:51.042 --> 00:25:52.042
Even if he's dead

00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:53.750
we should deliver it to his grave

00:26:13.792 --> 00:26:14.625
What?

00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:16.042
That's Yang Tao

00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:17.375
Didn't you see him?

00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:18.292
Yang Tao

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:23.875
I heard

00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.583
This is where Li Shaoqun lost his life

00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:29.542
Here me out

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.333
delivering to his grave or burning it

00:26:31.417 --> 00:26:32.542
he will receive it anyways

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:34.667
Yeah

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.833
It's a COD package!

00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:38.542
Go without me

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:40.542
I wouldn't understand the ghost's dialect

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:42.833
We go together

00:26:56.667 --> 00:26:57.917
Did you see it?

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.667
No

00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:14.500
Anyone home?

00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:15.792
You've got a package

00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:52.250
Peng Xiubing

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.250
Why do people say you're dead?

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:25.458
Five years ago I chopped down tea trees to grow coffee

00:28:25.583 --> 00:28:27.042
Since then I'm dead to my father

00:28:27.208 --> 00:28:29.292
You chopped down tea trees to grow this?

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:31.708
And you?

00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:34.083
Couldn't make it in Beijing. forced to come back?

00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:35.000
I'm not like you

00:28:35.083 --> 00:28:36.167
I was doing pretty well in Beijing

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.458
I came back to start my business and make big bucks

00:28:38.542 --> 00:28:40.792
All you talk about is money

00:28:40.958 --> 00:28:41.833
I left Beijing

00:28:41.917 --> 00:28:43.750
just to stay away from people like you

00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:45.958
I didn't expect to see two today

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:47.208
Two?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.625
I'm not like him

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:52.500
Please

00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.542
Coffee at this hour?

00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:56.750
Dump it if you don't drink it.

00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:58.250
- Whatever - Wait

00:28:59.417 --> 00:29:00.917
This coffee is really good

00:29:01.042 --> 00:29:02.708
The pre-fermentation adds flavor complexity

00:29:04.208 --> 00:29:05.458
You are a coffee person?

00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.042
I spent three years

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.667
trying many different ways of fermentation

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.208
and finally produced this flavor

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.125
On first taste you get flavors of tropical fruits

00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:16.917
Tangerine. plum. orange peel

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.875
apricot and wild ginger flowers

00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:21.333
their sweetness and sourness are brought out perfectly

00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:23.375
mixed with strong aroma of dark cocoa

00:29:23.458 --> 00:29:25.833
The coffee tastes smooth. and its flavors are layered well

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.625
Doesn't it taste like forests and mountains?

00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:42.500
Yes

00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:44.625
It finishes with a touch of nuts

00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:46.583
vanilla and caramel

00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:47.750
The aftertaste lingers on your tongue

00:29:49.958 --> 00:29:50.917
I've never met a coffee connoisseur like you

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.958
since I came back to the village

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:53.833
Li Shaoqun

00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.125
Wei Jinbei

00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:00.000
He's MY friend

00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:01.417
I didn't say anything when you stole Wang Saifen from me

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.375
You're stealing my man too?

00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:04.917
Who is Wang Saifen?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
- My girlfriend - My girlfriend

00:30:06.792 --> 00:30:07.750
- Mine - Whose girlfriend is she?

00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:09.792
- That's not important - It's very important!

00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:11.708
Whatever. I'm not going to charge you for the package

00:30:11.792 --> 00:30:13.625
I just opened a delivery shop. please come visit

00:30:13.917 --> 00:30:15.042
Put it down

00:30:15.958 --> 00:30:17.625
I don't need delivery. I already have a car

00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:19.833
Running a delivery service here...You're not going to have any success

00:30:19.917 --> 00:30:20.500
Beat it

00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:21.625
Come back soon. Jinbei

00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:22.458
No problem

00:30:22.542 --> 00:30:23.625
He's still as mean as ten years ago

00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:25.167
No wonder people wish he was dead

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.000
He owns a car and so what?

00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:30.250
I swear I'm going to make him use my service

00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:35.875
Dear villagers

00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:37.625
We are raising fund for construction projects

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.875
With the money

00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:41.875
we will build wide cement roads

00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:45.750
We will install a running water system

00:30:46.708 --> 00:30:49.542
Making our village better is everyone's duty

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.833
Please make a small contribution

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.875
Help us raise a big fund

00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:56.167
We don't have much to spare

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.875
Either keep the fridge. or the piglet

00:30:57.958 --> 00:30:59.542
- You choose - The fridge works well

00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:01.500
Where are you going?

00:31:01.667 --> 00:31:02.833
Where are you going?

00:31:02.917 --> 00:31:04.667
You can't sell my piglet

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.792
I think I'll need to get a job

00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:08.875
Dad where can you find a job

00:31:08.958 --> 00:31:09.917
at your age?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Who would hire you?

00:31:11.083 --> 00:31:13.250
Xiubing probably will

00:31:13.333 --> 00:31:15.375
I'll ask my son to send back some money

00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.750
His life is much harder than ours

00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:20.167
Who are you showing all this makeup to

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.542
Return everything!

00:31:23.458 --> 00:31:24.833
Here. we bought you a new one.

00:31:24.917 --> 00:31:25.500
Give it a try.

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.583
Not used to it. don't like it. it's not comfy

00:31:27.667 --> 00:31:29.167
Try it. we already spent the money

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.375
We had a low yield this year. Don't waste money!

00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:32.625
We can return it

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.917
Why there's no water?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Is it broken?

00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:36.792
Broken?

00:31:36.875 --> 00:31:37.792
New bike?

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:38.750
Yes. new motorbike

00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:40.125
The seat is a little too high. I'm going to return it

00:31:40.208 --> 00:31:41.708
The hair dryer is burnt out. what should I do?

00:31:41.792 --> 00:31:42.625
Xiubing can return it

00:31:42.708 --> 00:31:43.875
Ask Xiubing to return it

00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:44.750
If you don't like it. you can return it

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:46.625
- What items can I return? - Anything you bought

00:31:49.917 --> 00:31:50.875
I don't care

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.667
- I bought it from you - Yes you can return it

00:31:52.917 --> 00:31:55.083
but we need to talk to the sellers first

00:31:55.167 --> 00:31:56.667
Not everything is refundable

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.250
My wife bought the wrong dye

00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.875
Her hair is green now. she can't stop complaining

00:31:59.958 --> 00:32:01.083
I wanted chocolate

00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:02.042
Not chocolate mush

00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:03.208
I need money for fertilizers

00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:04.083
There's no use keeping this!

00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:05.500
I spent so much on the shoes

00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:06.875
They came in with two left foot

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:09.292
The cookies came in crushed

00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:10.000
I want refund!

00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:12.042
Everyone is returning. so I'm doing it too

00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:13.833
You picked your own purchase

00:32:13.917 --> 00:32:15.917
We simply placed orders for you

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.500
We didn't make any money from it

00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:20.542
Okay. okay!

00:32:22.792 --> 00:32:23.875
Peng Xiubing

00:32:24.167 --> 00:32:25.542
This is not how you do business

00:32:25.875 --> 00:32:27.958
If you agree to return everything. There's no way we can afford the refund

00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:30.208
You need to listen to me this time

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.708
It already took longer for packages to deliver get here

00:32:32.792 --> 00:32:33.792
They've probably missed the return window by now

00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:35.333
It's our village's business

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.708
You outsider stay out of it

00:32:39.292 --> 00:32:40.458
Xiubing

00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:43.125
We've known you since you were little

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.708
Everyone here

00:32:44.792 --> 00:32:46.042
We all trust you

00:32:46.125 --> 00:32:48.292
That's why we choose to buy from your shop

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.667
Tea sales hasn't been good recently

00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:52.667
Didn't you say

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.583
we can ask for return?

00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:14.167
Okay

00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:17.125
I'll return everything!

00:33:34.167 --> 00:33:35.208
I understand

00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:36.333
But there are dozens of villages here

00:33:36.417 --> 00:33:37.417
tens of thousands of people

00:33:37.542 --> 00:33:39.083
They are all your future customers

00:33:39.167 --> 00:33:40.458
Is it possible if...

00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:42.000
Well

00:33:44.042 --> 00:33:45.417
The deadline has passed

00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:47.375
You can't return any of these

00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:52.917
Is it true you can fly when there's favorable wind?

00:33:54.208 --> 00:33:56.333
I don't know

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:57.625
All I know when the wind stops

00:33:57.708 --> 00:33:59.708
I am the first one to fall

00:34:01.417 --> 00:34:02.667
You know

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:05.542
I lived in a basement when I was in Beijing

00:34:05.708 --> 00:34:08.000
I spent no more than 20 yuan on meals every day

00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:12.167
I made 1 yuan per package

00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:14.583
When others could deliver 150 packages

00:34:15.042 --> 00:34:16.500
I did 180

00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:17.708
or even 200

00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:19.625
There are liftless buildings no one wanted to deliver to

00:34:20.375 --> 00:34:21.500
I'd do it

00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:24.083
just to make an extra 1 yuan

00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:30.000
In the past ten years

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:34.458
the packages I've sent are probably

00:34:34.542 --> 00:34:36.208
as tall as a mountain

00:34:38.667 --> 00:34:40.375
Now the mountain has collapsed

00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:46.458
Wake up

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:47.583
You can return none of these

00:34:47.667 --> 00:34:48.917
Don't think about it

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.458
Peng Xiubing

00:34:56.208 --> 00:34:57.875
I was talking to you

00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:02.208
I thought it was the pig

00:35:02.542 --> 00:35:04.542
I felt like talking to a pig

00:35:07.958 --> 00:35:09.083
Zero

00:35:12.917 --> 00:35:14.083
Are you asleep?

00:35:15.083 --> 00:35:16.250
Yes

00:35:20.542 --> 00:35:22.542
Is this insomnia?

00:35:22.917 --> 00:35:24.792
You know how much you lost this time?

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:28.000
193895.6 yuan

00:35:28.083 --> 00:35:29.625
I don't get it

00:35:29.708 --> 00:35:31.375
Why did you agree to return everything?

00:35:31.583 --> 00:35:32.875
In my village

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.875
some things are more important than money

00:35:35.542 --> 00:35:36.750
As long as we act with honesty

00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:38.417
we can keep doing business here

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.833
This was first time they did online shopping

00:35:39.917 --> 00:35:41.292
They will get used to it with time

00:35:41.375 --> 00:35:43.417
The money you make per package is nothing

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.542
You won't be able to make the loss back in ten years

00:35:45.917 --> 00:35:47.000
You failed hard this time

00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:48.417
Says who?

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.292
I just haven't succeeded yet

00:35:50.375 --> 00:35:52.083
It doesn't mean I have failed

00:35:52.167 --> 00:35:53.708
It's not like I'll starve

00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:57.125
Plus

00:35:57.208 --> 00:35:58.375
all the paper boxes

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.083
we can sell them for a few dozen yuan

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:01.708
Then I'll have the money for food

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.125
Then I'll have the energy to work

00:36:03.208 --> 00:36:04.792
Then I can keep delivering packages

00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:06.500
Then I'll make money again

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.708
I probably will live to at least 80 years old

00:36:11.833 --> 00:36:13.875
There are several decades ahead. why should I worry?

00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:15.542
I don't have much saving

00:36:15.917 --> 00:36:17.333
Tomorrow I'll make a few calls

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.542
See if I borrow some money for you

00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:21.500
I thought I'm your only friend. Who will you borrow money from?

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:27.750
Sorry. that's not what I meant

00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:30.667
You're right

00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:33.917
You're my only friend

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.958
Otherwise why would I stay here

00:36:35.042 --> 00:36:36.417
in this god-forsaken village

00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:38.708
I'm not good at consoling people...

00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:41.000
I remember one rainy day

00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:42.292
you delivered my package

00:36:42.458 --> 00:36:44.375
You were soaked through

00:36:44.792 --> 00:36:46.208
but my package was dry

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:09.875
Peng Xiubing. you son of a gun

00:37:10.292 --> 00:37:11.375
I've been thinking all night

00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:13.083
Sending packages out is also part of delivery service

00:37:13.167 --> 00:37:15.167
Since there aren't many shopping online

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.125
We need to find a way

00:37:16.208 --> 00:37:17.792
to sell what we have here to the outside

00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:20.250
- What should we sell? - You deliver everything with one click?

00:37:20.458 --> 00:37:21.250
Yes

00:37:21.792 --> 00:37:23.042
Can you deliver my mom here?

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.333
Where is she?

00:37:25.667 --> 00:37:27.917
Guangzhou. She didn't come back for Chinese New Year

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:30.875
Yang Tao. this is a gift from your mom

00:37:33.958 --> 00:37:35.583
Will your shop be here forever?

00:37:39.583 --> 00:37:40.417
It will

00:37:40.542 --> 00:37:41.708
Peng Xiubing

00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:42.833
I know you took down my tyres!

00:37:42.917 --> 00:37:44.250
I swear I'll tear down your shop!

00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:46.000
Suit yourself

00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:47.250
I'm going out of business anyways

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:49.250
What happened. idiot

00:37:56.542 --> 00:37:57.250
How about is mine?

00:37:58.167 --> 00:37:59.042
Are you going to drink it?

00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:00.750
I may not. but you have to make it

00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:04.125
I have a few dozen packages to send

00:38:04.208 --> 00:38:06.042
If you have no other things to do

00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:07.458
send them for me

00:38:07.542 --> 00:38:09.125
I don't need your pity

00:38:10.625 --> 00:38:12.042
My bad for taking down your tyres

00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:13.042
I'll put them back on

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:14.042
Whatever

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.167
Shaoqun

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.708
The packages you are sending are all coffee

00:38:16.792 --> 00:38:17.542
Are you selling it?

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:18.833
My coffee is not for sale

00:38:18.917 --> 00:38:20.500
How many coffee trees do you have?

00:38:20.958 --> 00:38:22.917
More than 700. Less than 0.32 acre

00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:23.875
What's the yield?

00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:24.917
According to my standard

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.375
one tree produces 3-5 kg of beans

00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:27.583
After procession 1/8 of them are kept

00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:28.792
Let's say one tree produces 0.5kg of processed beans

00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:30.083
700 trees can produce

00:38:30.167 --> 00:38:31.042
350kg of beans

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:33.917
Let me help you sell your coffee

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.958
I'll help you sell it

00:38:35.208 --> 00:38:35.833
Are you kidding me

00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:36.917
This coffee is far from ready to go into the market

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.417
Plus. every acre of land here is covered with Pu'er tree

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.375
Where can I grow coffee?

00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:40.833
We'll find land for you

00:38:40.917 --> 00:38:42.542
You take charge of farming. I'll do sales and marketing

00:38:42.625 --> 00:38:43.833
I'm sure we can make money together

00:38:44.083 --> 00:38:44.958
Excuse me. now you want to help him?

00:38:45.042 --> 00:38:46.542
You aren't remotely interested in my delivery shop!

00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:47.417
Are you stupid or dumb?

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.708
If Shaoqun sells his coffee

00:38:48.792 --> 00:38:50.042
who do you think will deliver

00:38:50.125 --> 00:38:51.292
all the packages?

00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:52.000
Me.

00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:53.167
It's me.

00:38:53.958 --> 00:38:55.042
Sell it! Don't be stupid

00:38:55.125 --> 00:38:56.042
What's wrong with making money?

00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.542
I'll give you a 20% discount on the delivery fee

00:38:57.625 --> 00:38:58.292
Enough

00:38:58.375 --> 00:39:00.375
I've told you. I grow coffee trees because I like coffee

00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:01.625
There's no way I'm selling it

00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:03.292
You like coffee?

00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:04.625
You could have grown one tree just for fun

00:39:04.708 --> 00:39:05.875
Instead you grew 700 trees

00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:07.167
Isn't that a waste of resources?

00:39:07.333 --> 00:39:08.792
You are meaner than my dad

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:10.333
Hey. you said you like coffee

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:14.000
I wasn't trying to take advantage of you

00:39:14.917 --> 00:39:15.542
Get out

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.292
Wow. I'm so scared

00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:19.417
One day I'll make you sell your coffee. You have my word

00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:20.708
Let's go. he doesn't want us here

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.917
He doesn't want you here. not me

00:39:23.292 --> 00:39:24.583
I'm not done with my coffee yet

00:39:24.792 --> 00:39:27.708
He stole your heart with a cup of coffee

00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:29.792
I'm walking back on my own

00:39:32.208 --> 00:39:33.375
You sure you're not selling?

00:39:33.792 --> 00:39:35.125
I'm sure

00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:39.167
You even took his beans back. It wasn't enough coffee for you?

00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:41.500
It tastes great

00:39:42.125 --> 00:39:43.500
You claimed to be my friend

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:44.750
Now you want to defect

00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:46.542
Go drink it at your place. Don't do it here

00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:48.750
When you go to the town today. send these

00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.708
I was kidding. You're really sending the beans back home?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.833
Wait. you have a home in America?

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.583
And one in Italy?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.083
Hear me out

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:04.458
From tomorrow you treat Shaoqun nicely

00:40:04.542 --> 00:40:05.792
Go check in with him every day

00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:06.708
Even if he threatens to kick you out

00:40:06.792 --> 00:40:07.625
Just stay there

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.583
I'm not going. Not losing my dignity.

00:40:09.917 --> 00:40:10.875
You want to keep the delivery shop right?

00:40:10.958 --> 00:40:12.583
Yes. most definitely

00:40:12.667 --> 00:40:13.750
Then let's find a way

00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:14.875
to use Shaoqun's coffee

00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:16.292
to support your business

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.375
æå¤§å© ä½ç¾å«æ¯

00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.667
Hello?

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:01.792
Yes. I'm Li Shaoqun

00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:02.833
I'm Li Shaoqun

00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:04.042
Ok

00:41:04.125 --> 00:41:06.208
Yang Tao. be quiet

00:41:06.292 --> 00:41:07.250
Yes. I'm Li Shaoqun

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.375
I'm Li Shaoqun

00:41:08.583 --> 00:41:11.458
Hello?

00:41:13.208 --> 00:41:14.125
No signal?

00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:15.167
No signal?

00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:17.833
Hello?

00:41:17.917 --> 00:41:19.667
Can you hear me? I'm Li Shaoqun

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:20.417
I'm Li Shaoqun

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.167
Mr. Li. Li Shaoqun

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.417
Li Shaoqun

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.292
How come you're all Li Shaoqun?

00:41:26.458 --> 00:41:27.250
I sent your beans to a world raw beans competition

00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:29.125
on your behalf

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.250
Who gave you the permission?

00:41:31.583 --> 00:41:32.833
Let's talk about it later

00:41:32.917 --> 00:41:34.292
The results come out today

00:41:34.417 --> 00:41:35.750
Do you want to know?

00:41:39.125 --> 00:41:40.542
I got signal

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.083
Okay

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.792
Thank you

00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:49.333
How was it?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.917
They received several thousand samples this year

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.958
all top quality beans in the world

00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:56.583
Your coffee won second place

00:42:16.208 --> 00:42:18.292
You said you don't think much of your coffee

00:42:18.792 --> 00:42:20.542
now it's internationally recognized

00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:21.583
What was the prize?

00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:23.583
Silver medal. in the coffee olympics

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.667
Olympics silver medal

00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:35.292
We won gold in the Olympics!

00:42:41.875 --> 00:42:43.292
Why does our tea price keep dropping?

00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:45.583
It is not as good as other villages'?

00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.125
They offered us this price

00:42:47.208 --> 00:42:48.042
for our top quality

00:42:48.125 --> 00:42:49.292
The supplier lowered the price again

00:42:49.375 --> 00:42:50.125
We can't undersell

00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:51.500
It's a disgrace

00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:54.583
They are good years and bad years

00:42:54.667 --> 00:42:55.542
For a thousand years

00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:57.458
It's been like this

00:42:57.542 --> 00:42:59.083
We won gold in the Olympics!

00:42:59.167 --> 00:43:01.167
We won gold in the Olympics!

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.542
We won gold in the Olympics!

00:43:17.125 --> 00:43:18.250
When I was a kid I used to hide here

00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:20.125
when my father wanted to beat me

00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:26.625
They say as you grow older

00:43:26.792 --> 00:43:28.042
trees will look smaller

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.792
How come this one still looks so tall?

00:43:32.917 --> 00:43:33.875
Come up here

00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:46.833
You never see a sky like this in Beijing

00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:52.333
I wish I could be a kid again

00:43:54.083 --> 00:43:56.667
I left home at 16

00:43:58.208 --> 00:44:00.250
after a big fight with my father

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.292
I left this village

00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:05.292
I swore that once I left. I'd never come back

00:44:06.042 --> 00:44:07.417
But you're back. aren't you?

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.000
I've learnt in the past ten years

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:15.500
the city is not my home

00:44:16.667 --> 00:44:18.125
I came back

00:44:18.375 --> 00:44:20.250
Turns out the village doesn't feel like home either

00:44:20.667 --> 00:44:22.333
My dad used to fight with me a lot

00:44:22.417 --> 00:44:24.000
Now he doesn't even bother

00:44:24.917 --> 00:44:27.667
At least fighting is a way of communication

00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:29.708
My dad forced me to learn tea making when I was young

00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:32.000
Only he got to decide what taste was good

00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.250
I knew in my life. I would never be good enough

00:44:36.458 --> 00:44:38.042
Coffee

00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:40.375
is probably my way of defiance

00:44:41.042 --> 00:44:44.708
What I didn't expect. is that coffee chose here

00:44:45.958 --> 00:44:47.667
Everything comes full circle

00:44:49.625 --> 00:44:51.000
Call it fate

00:44:52.542 --> 00:44:54.542
It was our fate to be born here

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.250
We can't change it

00:44:56.708 --> 00:44:59.000
But that doesn't mean we can't change this place

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.042
You talked about "in your life"

00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:03.292
but a lifetime is long enough to do anything

00:45:05.875 --> 00:45:07.458
We were quite alike

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.042
So eager to go beyond the mountain

00:45:13.625 --> 00:45:15.292
that we forgot what's like here

00:45:17.583 --> 00:45:18.292
Alright

00:45:18.375 --> 00:45:20.458
I've decided to spend the night here

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:23.792
You?

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.708
He has problem falling asleep

00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:28.875
Not able to sleep?

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:30.125
Ever since I decided to start my own business

00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:32.000
I have never had a good night's sleep

00:45:32.708 --> 00:45:35.500
I was busy researching future trends and the next hot thing

00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.333
Worried that I'd miss out on new opportunities

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.083
But the more you care. the less control you have

00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:44.458
I blamed bad luck for my failures

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:46.583
Later I realized

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:48.208
it was me that had failed

00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:52.292
Because of my insomnia. I started taking diazepam

00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:55.000
One pill per day at the beginning

00:45:55.083 --> 00:45:57.083
Later even four pills couldn't put me to sleep

00:45:57.292 --> 00:45:58.542
I looked it up online

00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:00.792
Someone suggested I take ten pills

00:46:03.208 --> 00:46:04.958
Since the medicine lost effect on me

00:46:05.667 --> 00:46:07.708
I had to stay away from windows

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.125
Whenever I stood near

00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:11.833
I felt a strong urge to jump

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:12.750
He's asleep

00:47:24.125 --> 00:47:25.583
What's the matter with you two?

00:47:26.417 --> 00:47:27.667
You fell asleep!

00:47:28.958 --> 00:47:30.417
I fell asleep?

00:47:36.125 --> 00:47:37.375
I did!

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.500
I worked in the tallest office building in Beijing

00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:54.958
for two years

00:47:56.292 --> 00:47:58.167
But I've never looked this far

00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:05.208
Consultant

00:48:05.458 --> 00:48:07.583
What's our chance of success now?

00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:09.667
I don't want to be a consultant anymore

00:48:10.833 --> 00:48:12.000
You love coffee

00:48:12.375 --> 00:48:13.583
You love delivery

00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:15.125
And I want to be in e-commerce

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:17.792
Let's become business partners

00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:21.208
Let's do it

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:26.000
Three clients from Beijing once told me

00:48:26.083 --> 00:48:29.542
Never start a business with your best friends

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:33.000
Sounds so old-fashioned. What do they do?

00:48:33.458 --> 00:48:35.083
They teach English

00:48:36.708 --> 00:48:37.792
No wonder

00:48:55.417 --> 00:48:57.667
Three factors that determine agricultural commercialization

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:59.333
Product. logistics. and sales

00:48:59.417 --> 00:49:01.500
They fall precisely inside our areas of expertise

00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:03.042
A successful business demands right timing. right location and right people

00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:03.875
We have the right timing and people

00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:05.750
all we need is more land for production

00:49:05.833 --> 00:49:08.000
The current yield of you trees...

00:49:08.083 --> 00:49:09.333
it doesn't worth the effort to build a business around it

00:49:09.417 --> 00:49:10.250
It's too small

00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:11.667
We should apply for poverty-relief loans

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:12.833
Increase our production

00:49:13.042 --> 00:49:14.125
Use our current plantation as a base

00:49:14.208 --> 00:49:15.833
and gradually expand to nearby areas

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.125
It sounds complicated. isn't it?

00:49:19.292 --> 00:49:20.333
I've done the calculation

00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:22.583
There are more than 1000 people in our village

00:49:22.667 --> 00:49:23.625
The conservative estimation of arable land per person

00:49:23.708 --> 00:49:25.417
let's say is 0.22 acres

00:49:25.542 --> 00:49:26.458
With your reputation

00:49:26.542 --> 00:49:28.167
and the great prospect of Pu'er coffee

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:29.583
as long as we can convince

00:49:29.667 --> 00:49:30.667
half of the villagers to grow coffee

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:31.542
we will achieve mass production

00:49:32.833 --> 00:49:34.125
Of all the 1000 potential coffee farmers

00:49:34.208 --> 00:49:35.208
you have to convince one person first

00:49:35.292 --> 00:49:36.833
in order to win the others over

00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:37.917
Who?

00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:43.042
Your dad has that kind of power?

00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:44.208
The villagers all listen to him

00:49:44.292 --> 00:49:45.708
especially the elders

00:49:46.167 --> 00:49:47.500
But you're his son

00:49:47.583 --> 00:49:48.917
Precisely

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.958
I'll go talk to him

00:49:50.542 --> 00:49:51.458
You're not afraid of him?

00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:53.625
Your dad beats you too?

00:49:53.708 --> 00:49:54.667
Yes

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:55.875
Is it bad?

00:49:55.958 --> 00:49:58.167
Last time I woke up in a hospital after the beating

00:49:58.542 --> 00:49:59.583
I couldn't remember a thing

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.917
He's not young anymore

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.167
Is his still in good shape?

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.708
Any chronic diseases I should know?

00:50:05.792 --> 00:50:06.917
What are you thinking?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Our village can't thrive without your support

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:13.208
I'd like to thank you all!

00:50:13.667 --> 00:50:15.208
Isn't the broadcasting room in your home?

00:50:20.792 --> 00:50:21.833
Hello?

00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:23.375
Hello?

00:50:23.458 --> 00:50:25.083
Fellow villagers. this is Peng Xiubing speaking

00:50:26.042 --> 00:50:28.042
Please allow me to say a few words

00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:30.167
He took my place!

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.250
There used to be 1600 people in our village

00:50:32.917 --> 00:50:34.458
Nearly half of them are working somewhere else

00:50:35.292 --> 00:50:38.083
In our village. none of the families is complete

00:50:39.292 --> 00:50:40.417
I...

00:50:42.667 --> 00:50:44.500
like many young people

00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:47.208
chose to go work in big cities

00:50:48.292 --> 00:50:50.333
thinking that our lives could be changed for the better

00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:55.000
And there'd be no need to come back

00:50:55.375 --> 00:50:56.958
But city streets are too clean

00:50:57.042 --> 00:50:58.375
for us to leave our footprints

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.250
On the very day I came back

00:51:00.333 --> 00:51:02.417
I made my own footprint on the dirt road

00:51:02.917 --> 00:51:04.458
An evidence of my being

00:51:05.292 --> 00:51:06.458
There's no place we can call home

00:51:06.875 --> 00:51:08.250
except for this one!

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:09.500
In cities

00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:10.958
perseverance helps us survive

00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:14.208
We need the same spirit here as well!

00:51:15.417 --> 00:51:17.250
I know you all have deep feelings for tea

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:18.875
I do. too

00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:21.333
But it can no longer sustain our village

00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:23.417
Li Shaoqun's coffee just won silver in a world beans competition

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.667
If we grow his coffee

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.292
we will have higher income

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:28.292
And if the coffee sells well

00:51:28.375 --> 00:51:30.125
there will be job opportunities for everyone

00:51:30.208 --> 00:51:32.208
So that no one has to find a job elsewhere

00:51:32.958 --> 00:51:34.167
No more living in the basement

00:51:34.792 --> 00:51:36.708
No more being railed at just to make a few more bucks

00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:39.833
Mo more pretending on phone calls with our families that things are great

00:51:39.917 --> 00:51:41.542
telling them "don't worry about me"

00:51:42.375 --> 00:51:44.208
People like me

00:51:44.292 --> 00:51:45.792
they can all come home

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:49.250
They don't need to be in a place where they can't leave their footprints

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.542
where they can't be with families and kids

00:51:52.125 --> 00:51:53.667
Our mothers and fathers can come home

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.292
Our sons and daughters can come home

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.750
Our wives and husbands can come home

00:51:58.042 --> 00:52:00.667
to where they belong

00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:03.167
Coffee not only changes my life

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.792
It will change yours. too

00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:10.333
You have my promise!

00:52:15.167 --> 00:52:16.583
Son of a gun!

00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:17.667
Run!

00:52:17.875 --> 00:52:18.292
I...

00:52:18.375 --> 00:52:20.583
Who gave you the permission to use my broadcast?

00:52:21.167 --> 00:52:23.625
Anyone who's interested. come to the coffee plantation for seedlings!

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.458
You're destroying our legacy!

00:52:34.792 --> 00:52:36.042
Don't worry

00:52:36.125 --> 00:52:38.292
I'm not going to get physical. or scold anyone

00:52:38.375 --> 00:52:39.375
You are all adults now

00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:41.167
you have your own ideas

00:52:41.792 --> 00:52:43.583
But has it ever occurred to you

00:52:44.042 --> 00:52:46.875
You guys are still young and can afford failures

00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:48.000
But them

00:52:48.083 --> 00:52:48.792
How about them?

00:52:50.583 --> 00:52:52.542
The villagers can't afford it

00:52:52.875 --> 00:52:56.125
You can always go back to cities if you fail

00:52:56.208 --> 00:52:58.833
But for them they have nowhere to go

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.833
I'm being responsible for their lives

00:53:00.917 --> 00:53:01.750
Mr. Li

00:53:03.167 --> 00:53:05.042
You're Shaoqun's father

00:53:06.458 --> 00:53:08.125
Not the villagers' father

00:53:09.042 --> 00:53:10.833
You should let them decide

00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:32.333
I didn't fire you guys

00:53:32.417 --> 00:53:34.708
I'm just pretty strapped recently

00:53:34.792 --> 00:53:36.458
I have no money to pay you

00:53:36.542 --> 00:53:38.083
We are not asking for our pay

00:53:38.167 --> 00:53:39.458
We are here to get coffee seedlings

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.833
You can use my land

00:53:41.083 --> 00:53:42.500
to grow coffee

00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:43.583
But I can't pay you for anything yet

00:53:43.667 --> 00:53:45.667
Not until the plants are grown

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.167
It doesn't matter

00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:49.042
We don't care about coffee

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:50.375
But we trust you

00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:51.750
My whole family

00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.167
we all trust you

00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:04.875
We are to learn how to grow coffee trees

00:54:06.542 --> 00:54:07.917
I'll teach you

00:54:10.917 --> 00:54:12.750
Let's get rid of weeds

00:54:12.833 --> 00:54:13.958
Hurry up

00:55:11.417 --> 00:55:12.750
Drink tea

00:55:44.542 --> 00:55:46.125
It's like you're holding human ashes

00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:47.083
not coffee

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.167
Why don't you do it?

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.083
You want to pick a fight?

00:55:56.875 --> 00:55:59.125

00:55:59.625 --> 00:56:00.542
Guess how much our taobao shop

00:56:00.625 --> 00:56:01.958
made last month?

00:56:04.542 --> 00:56:06.583
What has life done to you?

00:56:07.542 --> 00:56:08.667
To put food on the table

00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:13.917
I've been through everything

00:56:20.875 --> 00:56:22.458
9 point 85!

00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:39.583
What are you doing there?

00:57:39.667 --> 00:57:40.458
Get out!

00:57:40.542 --> 00:57:41.417
Give us a hand

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.708
- Come up here - Give us a hand

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:43.583
Come up here

00:57:43.667 --> 00:57:44.958
No way

00:57:51.833 --> 00:57:52.917
Idiots

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:54.583
My phone

00:58:00.667 --> 00:58:01.708
Here it is

00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:09.250
Hello?

00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.333
Yes

00:58:13.792 --> 00:58:14.792
No problem

00:58:15.167 --> 00:58:16.833
We are the only house here

00:58:18.792 --> 00:58:20.000
Okay

00:58:20.542 --> 00:58:21.708
See you

00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:23.542
Who is it?

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:25.708
Starnest

00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:27.583
What is it?

00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:30.292
Biggest coffee supplier in the world

00:58:30.917 --> 00:58:31.958
Are they buying our beans?

00:58:32.042 --> 00:58:32.583
Yes

00:58:32.667 --> 00:58:33.333
How much?

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.417
Didn't say

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.083
Said he will come visit

00:58:58.125 --> 00:58:59.375
What are you doing?

00:59:00.208 --> 00:59:01.875
I'm talking to the trees

00:59:03.875 --> 00:59:05.667
Talking to trees?

00:59:06.167 --> 00:59:07.500
They came alive?

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:09.208
I'm thanking them

00:59:09.292 --> 00:59:10.792
You really hear them talking?

00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:12.417
Close your eyes

00:59:12.792 --> 00:59:14.292
Feel it

00:59:22.583 --> 00:59:23.833
I hear them

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.708
With so many trees

00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:28.542
you'll probably going to talk till morning

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.375
I know a pretty good therapist in Beijing

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:32.875
You should go see him

00:59:33.333 --> 00:59:34.708
You try it

00:59:37.833 --> 00:59:39.500
Hello Coffee. this is Pu'er Tea

00:59:39.583 --> 00:59:40.708
Do you copy?

00:59:40.833 --> 00:59:41.833
Copy. copy

00:59:41.917 --> 00:59:43.292
Pu'er this is Coffee. What are you doing?

00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:46.167
I have a Mr. Li Shaoqun talking to me

01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:35.000
I choose coffee to distance myself from my dad

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.125
Oddly enough

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:42.958
I couldn't understand him before I grew coffee

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:45.708
Since I choose coffee

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:47.500
I think I understand him better

01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:14.750
I've been waiting for this moment all my life

01:01:15.042 --> 01:01:15.792
I always thought

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:18.292
When I could outdo my father

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.250
I wouldn't care what he thinks of me

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:23.708
But

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.542
now the day has finally become

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.000
I'm dying to hear his thoughts

01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:35.083
Even a good scolding from him

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.792
I don't know

01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:46.208
I think I'm drunk

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.542
I really want some tea

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:10.917
Actually

01:02:13.208 --> 01:02:15.375
I can fulfill your wish

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:17.625
Come here

01:02:20.542 --> 01:02:22.083
I'll brew some tea for you. son

01:02:22.167 --> 01:02:23.250
Buzz off!

01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:32.833
Jump

01:03:32.917 --> 01:03:36.375
and you'll know if you can fly

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:47.292
Jump. Be brave

01:03:47.792 --> 01:03:49.000
Jump

01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:13.458
One Month Later

01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.292
One Month Later
That horse looks so lost

01:04:16.333 --> 01:04:18.250
It doesn't know where to go

01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:21.958
You remember

01:04:22.042 --> 01:04:23.042
last time you came

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.583
you said it was dying

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.417
Did I?

01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:31.667
It's been a while since your last visit

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:34.250
The other patients

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.125
who share your symptoms

01:04:36.417 --> 01:04:37.083
are either

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:38.333
dead

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.417
or

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.875
they are cured

01:04:43.042 --> 01:04:44.833
I followed your advice

01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:46.333
and went to Yunnan

01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:49.583
I thought it was a just trip for relaxing

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.833
but it ended up curing my insomnia

01:04:52.917 --> 01:04:54.458
So I decided to stay

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:55.292
Later

01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:57.333
I even started a coffee business with two friends

01:04:57.792 --> 01:04:59.500
Then I ran into a small mishap

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:02.125
I just came back last month

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:16.208
A car from outside

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:17.583
So rude

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:18.917
Could it be the big client you talked about?

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:40.167
Nice to meet you

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:43.875
Nice to meet you

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.042
Wei Jinbei

01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:48.417
What did she say?

01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:50.042
She said Li Shaoqun is better looking than you

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:52.208
We have pulped natural. washed. and miel

01:05:52.292 --> 01:05:53.167
Which one do you want?

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.667
I'm good. thank you

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:56.708
Give it a try

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.625
Since you here to do your research

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:01.208
You coffee is Arabica

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:02.833
A mixture of Bourbon related-variety

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:03.583
and Tropica-related variety

01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:05.333
Your plantation has a size of less than 23 acres

01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:06.208
50 thousand trees

01:06:06.292 --> 01:06:07.833
Yield last year was 14 tons

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:12.750
You're not here to buy coffee?

01:06:12.833 --> 01:06:14.292
Allow me to introduce myself

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:15.708
I'm the head of Marketing Management

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:17.542
of Starnest Asia

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.458
Of course I'm here to buy coffee

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.667
Not your current beans

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:24.208
but the future ones

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:27.792
What does she mean?

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.417
They want to acquire us

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.250
That's right

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:32.250
According to my research

01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:34.208
Your sales last year was 1.2 million

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:35.333
minus cost. taxes

01:06:35.417 --> 01:06:36.375
and your dividends

01:06:36.458 --> 01:06:37.417
Your net profit

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.792
should be around 280 thousand

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:40.250
Using your growth rate

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:41.917
for the next ten years

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:44.208
I give you 3 million

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.625
3 million?

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:46.875
Each of us one million?

01:06:48.417 --> 01:06:49.875
Indeed you're a big company

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.125
Very accurate research

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:54.208
Sadly your data is a little outdated

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:56.833
Yes. our yield was 14 tons last year

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:59.042
But this year the number will go up to 20 at least

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.417
and 30 next year

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.583
I believe in the near future

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:02.750
We will be able to produce 100 tons annually

01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:04.333
No. no. no. no

01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:07.292
20 tons will be your maximum capacity

01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:09.000
It won't go higher than that

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:12.500
I will offer you 4 million

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:15.292
You decide

01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:17.375
We trust you

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:18.833
The three of us

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.042
2 million each. 6 in total

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:22.583
My bottom line

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.583
You're not worth it

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.792
I'll let you reconsider your price

01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:29.208
I still have

01:07:29.292 --> 01:07:30.417
20 minutes

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.667
That's fine

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.292
The decision is

01:07:33.375 --> 01:07:34.625
above your paygrade

01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:35.750
Kindly reminder

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:37.083
You don't have 20 minutes

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:39.000
We are all busy

01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:41.417
Excuse me

01:07:44.667 --> 01:07:46.208
Isn't 6 million too high?

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:47.375
I've done the calculation

01:07:47.458 --> 01:07:48.750
6 is the max. they can offer

01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:49.958
Hello Peter

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:51.292
They want six

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:52.542
Let's roll the dice

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:53.458
Maybe we'll win big

01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:06.042
6 million

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:10.167
We sign now

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:14.667
If I was in charge

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:16.125
I wouldn't have offered you that amount

01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.208
Any questions?

01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:23.042
Just curious

01:08:23.458 --> 01:08:26.042
If you don't think we are worth the price

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.667
Why did you make the offer?

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:28.375
It's simple

01:08:28.458 --> 01:08:29.583
In the future

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:30.917
in Yunnan or in China

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.875
We don't want to see any plantation that's not ours

01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:34.208
I'll send you our beans

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.167
I'll send you our beans

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:36.458
You will grow coffee

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:37.875
following our standards

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:40.542
We can't grow our own?

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:41.500
After the acquisition

01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:43.458
of course you follow our rules

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:44.417
All good. we can sign the contract now

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.542
So you don't think much of our coffee?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.083
Of course she does

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.250
That's why she offered us 6 million

01:08:50.333 --> 01:08:53.292
That's not true. They're spending 6 million to make us disappear

01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:55.458
I'm not signing it

01:08:58.708 --> 01:09:00.208
Is that what she wants?

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:02.417
Well. I'll leave you guys to discuss

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.167
Li Shaoqun

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:06.625
I raised the price to 6 million

01:09:06.708 --> 01:09:07.667
Now you decided not to sell it?

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:09.250
I have no plan of selling

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:10.708
you know it

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.625
The whole point of starting a business is to sell it one day

01:09:12.708 --> 01:09:14.250
If you're not happy with the offer. I'll talk to her

01:09:14.333 --> 01:09:15.458
Don't be so unreasonable

01:09:15.708 --> 01:09:17.083
We know better than anyone

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:18.250
Our max. yield annually

01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:19.333
is 20 tons

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.875
6 million is as much as we can get

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.625
Take the money. You can do whatever you want with it

01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.542
Growing coffee is what I want to do

01:09:24.833 --> 01:09:26.250
I'm already doing it

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.875
Sorry to interrupt

01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:29.292
You know why I don't support the decision

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:31.833
to spend 6 million on your coffee?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.083
It has nothing to do with money

01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:35.667
I just find it unnecessary

01:09:36.208 --> 01:09:38.250
You know how I feel about this place?

01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:39.458
Hopeless

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.208
It has no future

01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:44.292
Geisha. the best coffee breed in the world

01:09:44.375 --> 01:09:46.750
has been grown in Ethiopia for almost a century

01:09:46.833 --> 01:09:48.167
In the one hundred years

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.708
Starnest has grown into

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.458
the most successful coffee supplier in the world

01:09:52.542 --> 01:09:53.750
What did coffee bring to Ethiopia?

01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:54.958
Nothing

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:56.750
I have every right to believe

01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:57.958
you guys are

01:09:58.042 --> 01:09:59.458
no threat to us

01:09:59.542 --> 01:10:00.958
I just feel bad for you

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:02.667
You are meant to fail

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:03.750
You are meant to fail

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:05.292
Of course

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.208
not everyone is as lucky as you

01:10:07.292 --> 01:10:09.083
Your failure is at least paid for

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:10.958
Even if you don't sign the contract

01:10:11.042 --> 01:10:11.958
Starnest is still

01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:13.667
the most successful coffee supplier in the world

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:14.667
If you sign it

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.167
you will become

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.833
the most successful farmers in China

01:10:17.917 --> 01:10:19.375
Everyone has his place in the world

01:10:19.458 --> 01:10:21.042
Isn't it great

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:22.917
if we can achieve success in our respective positions?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.667
You farmers grow the plants

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:26.750
We entrepreneurs sell the products

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:29.250
Let's just stick to what we're supposed to do

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.458
It's not the kind of success we want

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:37.708
If the purpose of this acquisition

01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:39.667
is to eliminate other coffee beans

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:40.792
please see yourself out

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:41.750
Fine

01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:43.292
About today

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:45.583
I'll report everything to the company

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:47.667
Your coffee is okay

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.333
but you guys are...horrible

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:52.792
- Sorry - Don't bother

01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:54.583
I've made my point very clear

01:10:58.917 --> 01:10:59.917
Shaoqun

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.458
I'll take 1 million. You can take 3

01:11:01.542 --> 01:11:02.500
Just let me succeed one time. can you?

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.542
I don't want the money. I want my coffee

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:09.458
Okay

01:11:10.792 --> 01:11:11.875
Xiubing

01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:13.250
you sign the contract

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:15.500
There are three of us

01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:16.500
Two to one

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:18.042
We don't need your approval

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.042
Sign the contract

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:24.667
I'm not signing it. either

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:28.250
I promised the villagers to make a change

01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:30.333
If we sell our coffee to Starnest

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:31.542
What difference does it make

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:33.542
from selling our tea to the suppliers?

01:11:34.917 --> 01:11:35.958
And I

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:37.792
don't think my hometown is hopeless

01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:41.458
There's no hope here

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:42.833
If you sign the contract

01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:44.542
Starnest can bring it hope

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:45.500
What if it cannot?

01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:46.583
What will I tell the villagers?

01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:47.458
Am I letting an outsider

01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:49.208
decide the fate of my town?

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:51.500
Outsider?

01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:54.250
You mean me?

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.458
No. I didn't mean it

01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:58.917
I'm just saying if we sign the deal

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.667
You can leave with the money. but we can't

01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:05.042
I thought after three years living here

01:12:05.292 --> 01:12:06.792
getting myself all tanned

01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:08.417
I'm finally one of you

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.583
Turns out I'm still not. am I?

01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:11.250
That's not what I meant

01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:12.500
Peng Xiubing

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.417
Listen. I don't care what you meant

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.625
What makes you think

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:17.250
you are able to make a change?

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.542
Everything you say was borrowed from a client

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.208
Do you have your own thoughts?

01:12:21.292 --> 01:12:23.083
Everything you have done since you came home

01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:25.250
I told you to do so

01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:26.917
Are you experienced?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.583
Are you experienced?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.292
You really believe that

01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:32.125
all your wild thoughts could be considered wisdom?

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:35.292
Do you know what you want to do?

01:12:41.042 --> 01:12:42.417
And you...

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.042
If you sign the contract

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:45.083
your villagers

01:12:45.167 --> 01:12:47.375
will be guaranteed a stable income

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:49.417
They offered to help us without asking anything in return

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.875
Have you ever considered them?

01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:52.667
You are not idealistic

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.042
You're just being selfish

01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:55.417
You remind me of how I used to be

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.167
I don't want you to become like that

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.542
Let me tell you this

01:13:00.875 --> 01:13:02.125
A person who's afraid of failing

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:03.583
who can't stay true to himself

01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:05.667
is a total loser

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.125
He was right

01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:11.583
You are an outsider

01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:12.583
You came here

01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:14.500
because you couldn't make it in Beijing

01:13:14.583 --> 01:13:15.458
This is a vacation spot for you

01:13:15.542 --> 01:13:16.750
This is a vacation spot for you

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.042
You stayed because you smelled money

01:13:19.417 --> 01:13:21.208
Are you willing to stay here forever

01:13:21.292 --> 01:13:22.875
treating it like your own home?

01:13:23.208 --> 01:13:24.542
Will you?

01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.750
I used to think I would

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:32.500
But not anymore

01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:34.625
I'm wasting my breath

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.417
It's over

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.667
I know I'm not as smart as you

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.542
But you know what

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:43.625
I know clearly what I want

01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:45.208
so does Shaoqun

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.500
I thought you do too

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.667
Xiubing

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:58.250
On the darkest day of my life

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:01.333
After I came out of the therapist's office

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:03.708
Truth be told

01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:06.042
I went to the rooftop to end my life

01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:08.125
but because the package you delivered

01:14:08.208 --> 01:14:09.583
I decided not to jump

01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.500
I owed you one. You owed my one

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.333
We're even

01:14:17.417 --> 01:14:18.542
Good bye

01:14:44.292 --> 01:14:45.792
I've been back for a month

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:47.917
Every time I close my eyes

01:14:50.292 --> 01:14:51.792
I only see

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:54.750
coffee trees in Yunnan

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.167
its insects

01:14:58.167 --> 01:14:59.292
cows

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:02.125
and stars

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:05.125
Every tree

01:15:06.542 --> 01:15:09.208
I remember where it stands

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.292
I know every person in the village

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:13.667
I know every person in the village

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:18.167
If I could stay there forever

01:15:19.708 --> 01:15:21.542
I would even believe

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:25.792
two friends are all I need in my life

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:27.458
two friends are all I need in my life

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:53.958
I want a cup of coffee

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:58.208
I'd never thought that

01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:01.917
I would stay in a village where delivery was not available

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.375
taking care of coffee trees

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.333
for three years

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:11.458
I'm almost 30 now

01:16:12.792 --> 01:16:15.083
I've been thinking recently

01:16:15.167 --> 01:16:16.375
What have I done

01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:18.167
with the 30 years of my life?

01:16:20.083 --> 01:16:21.208
This projector

01:16:21.292 --> 01:16:22.542
is China's first model

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.417
that supports 4K format

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:26.833
It is connected via bluetooth. very portable

01:16:26.917 --> 01:16:27.708
Wherever you go...

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.208
You are the fifth this month

01:16:29.292 --> 01:16:30.708
to pitch me this product

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.458
This is our best selling coffee

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:37.000
It's from Yunnan

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:40.250
You are not a coffee person right?

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:42.333
Is Chinese coffee even considered coffee?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.083
How is it?

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:12.667
Still tastes bitter to me

01:17:14.792 --> 01:17:17.375
I don't know why people like this taste

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:19.583
Give it a try

01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:20.708
This coffee is pretty good

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:22.208
Next time

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:28.625
Bitterness has its own flavor

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.583
After I came back to Beijing

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:37.208
I noticed for the first time

01:17:38.083 --> 01:17:39.792
how big it is

01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:41.125
Too big that if I don't use GPS

01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:43.375
I will have no idea where I am

01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:46.833
Too big that when I run into familiar faces

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:48.833
I can't remember their names

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.583
The village in Yunnan was small

01:17:56.958 --> 01:17:59.042
But I never lost my direction

01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:01.958
The life you had in the village

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:03.500
wasn't just a dream

01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:05.333
It is how you suppose to live

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:07.458
It is how you suppose to live

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:16.417
The coffee thing you mention

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.792
sadly I don't know much about it

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:18.750
Recently

01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:21.208
I've been reading a classic novel from the West

01:18:21.792 --> 01:18:23.958
A wise old character's words

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:26.167
may help you

01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:27.667
He said

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:29.708
We all face the choice between

01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:31.208
what is right

01:18:31.292 --> 01:18:33.750
and

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.125
what is easy

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:45.125
Did we make the right choice?

01:18:47.208 --> 01:18:49.250
If you want to achieve something

01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:51.542
you need to believe in it

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.458
Did you follow me all the way here?

01:20:05.042 --> 01:20:06.750
I'm listening to the trees

01:20:07.208 --> 01:20:08.542
Close your eyes

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:10.292
Listen with your heart

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.083
Can I bring you home?

01:20:42.292 --> 01:20:44.250
I think I know what I should do

01:20:44.792 --> 01:20:45.833
Thank you

01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:47.083
You're welcome

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.208
By the way

01:20:48.292 --> 01:20:50.333
What was the novel you mentioned?

01:20:50.417 --> 01:20:51.833
I want to take a look

01:20:51.917 --> 01:20:53.083
Harry Potter

01:20:53.167 --> 01:20:55.125
I was quoting Dumbledore

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:04.292
I...

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.875
I never see you as an outsider

01:21:07.917 --> 01:21:09.042
I know

01:21:10.667 --> 01:21:12.292
I saw myself as one

01:21:14.792 --> 01:21:15.833
I used to see your village as a sanatorium

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.125
far away from the city

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:18.792
I'd go back whenever I feel better

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.208
When I was in Beijing

01:21:21.875 --> 01:21:23.125
I spent half the time daydreaming

01:21:23.208 --> 01:21:24.500
half the time in a daze

01:21:24.958 --> 01:21:26.042
Even since I came to your village

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.833
I spent my days working and my nights dreaming

01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:29.917
Those who can fall asleep are able to dream

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.750
I had it figured out before I came back

01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:34.667
Pu'er coffee needs to become its own brand

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:36.250
If we sell it to suppliers

01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:37.833
having them market it as an import

01:21:37.917 --> 01:21:39.667
no one will ever know that the coffee is from China

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:41.125
Why can't we have our own coffee?

01:21:41.792 --> 01:21:43.417
To do this it takes not only the three of us

01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:45.583
but also the whole village's effort

01:21:45.917 --> 01:21:46.958
With your delivery service

01:21:47.042 --> 01:21:49.875
Pu'er coffee can go direct to customer

01:21:49.958 --> 01:21:51.375
Since we cannot change our positions in the world

01:21:51.542 --> 01:21:52.875
let's change the world

01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:54.333
Yes! Let's change the world together

01:21:54.417 --> 01:21:55.750
We are not afraid even if we failed

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:57.917
Because it's the business that has failed. not us

01:21:58.542 --> 01:22:00.208
Which of your clients said that?

01:22:04.208 --> 01:22:05.333
Actually

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.458
You did

01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:15.292
You are not leaving this time?

01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:17.667
No

01:22:18.292 --> 01:22:19.792
I used to think that

01:22:20.917 --> 01:22:22.333
you needed me more

01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:24.417
Turns out

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:26.000
I need you guys more

01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:28.083
And coffee!

01:22:28.167 --> 01:22:29.375
And delivery too!

01:22:29.458 --> 01:22:31.708
To your home with one click!

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:37.708
The product I'm introducing today

01:22:37.792 --> 01:22:39.583
is very special

01:22:39.667 --> 01:22:40.917
Let me ask you

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:41.667
when you hear the word Pu'er

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.833
you will first think of tea right?

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.500
But today I'm going to recommend you

01:22:45.583 --> 01:22:46.500
something different

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:48.583
It is called Pu'er Coffee

01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:51.125
It is 100% Made in China

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.292
Since it came out

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:54.375
it has already won several international awards

01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:56.208
and become the first choice of coffee

01:22:56.292 --> 01:22:57.583
served in Michelin star restaurants

01:22:57.667 --> 01:22:59.583
Pu'er is not just coffee

01:22:59.667 --> 01:23:01.375
but also something we should take proud of as Chinese

01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:03.667
As well as a symbol for quality lifestyle

01:23:03.833 --> 01:23:05.417
Anything else you want to add?

01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:07.083
It took us three years

01:23:07.167 --> 01:23:08.458
to launch this product

01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:09.667
We have one goal

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:11.208
To make coffee about coffee

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:12.875
as opposed to big companies

01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:13.833
that standardize everything

01:23:13.917 --> 01:23:16.083
I think they are not selling coffee

01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:17.667
They are selling the look of their coffee shops

01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:19.542
- I have... - Well said!

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:20.958
As an entrepreneur

01:23:21.042 --> 01:23:21.667
to be honest

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:23.625
if it takes three years to launch a product

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:24.750
Making money is not as important as

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.167
bringing the best coffee to the world

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.208
and share it with all of you

01:23:27.292 --> 01:23:28.750
Most people haven't been able

01:23:28.833 --> 01:23:30.333
to try the real taste of coffee

01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:32.417
The real taste of coffee?

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.375
I'm already loving it

01:23:34.458 --> 01:23:35.333
I'd love know

01:23:35.417 --> 01:23:37.333
what the real taste is like

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:43.583
Does it taste like mountains and forests?

01:23:43.667 --> 01:23:44.583
Yes

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:45.208
I tasted it

01:23:45.292 --> 01:23:47.375
It makes you feel hopeful about life

01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:48.833
Oh my god

01:23:48.917 --> 01:23:49.542
Buy it!

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.833
Girls! We are selling 100.000 bags!

01:23:51.917 --> 01:23:53.667

Ready to place order?

01:23:54.792 --> 01:23:56.458
Pu'er Coffee

01:23:56.542 --> 01:23:57.708
You hear me right

01:23:58.167 --> 01:23:58.875
Don't be nervous

01:23:58.958 --> 01:23:59.625
It's alright

01:23:59.917 --> 01:24:00.667
Three

We're sold out!

01:24:36.583 --> 01:24:38.250
6.6 million yuan!

01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:41.792
Thank you for supporting our own Chinese coffee!

01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:43.833
Thank you!

01:25:07.208 --> 01:25:09.417
I'm the head of Marketing Management of Starnest Asia

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.417
We've been tracking your coffee for a while

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.667
Look who's here

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.167
Sorry. I'm in the middle of an important conversation

01:25:21.292 --> 01:25:22.083
When you get a chance

01:25:22.167 --> 01:25:23.333
please come visit our village again

01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:25.500
It's changed a lot

01:25:27.125 --> 01:25:28.458
My card

01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:35.917
Before Pu'er Coffee

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:38.125
there wasn't any competitive Chinese coffee in the market

01:25:38.208 --> 01:25:39.625
Within just five years

01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:41.167
You expanded your production size ten times

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:42.708
and still maintain top quality

01:25:42.792 --> 01:25:44.375
in the premium coffee market

01:25:44.458 --> 01:25:45.167
To a large degree

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:46.083
you raised the market share

01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:47.625
of Chinese coffee

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:49.333
from 2%

01:25:49.417 --> 01:25:51.042
to nearly 3%

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:52.708
In your word

01:25:52.792 --> 01:25:55.250
what do you think is the reason for your success?

01:25:58.792 --> 01:25:59.875
You don't have to be the fastest river

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:01.708
be the longest

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.667
Don't be like birds fighting for low-hanging food

01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:06.375
Aim for the sky

01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:09.750
Study well. make progress every day!

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:26.833
Does it taste like mountains and forests?

01:26:40.333 --> 01:26:43.708
Yes it does!

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.708
Your coffee has been exported

01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:47.708
to more than 30 countries and regions

01:26:47.792 --> 01:26:48.750
Are there any orders

01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:50.583
that are memorable?

01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:51.750
Not really

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:53.583
Every order is equally important to us

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:55.125
No. there's one

01:26:56.167 --> 01:26:58.000
One order has special importance to me

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:05.833
Someone from our village ordered coffee?

01:27:05.917 --> 01:27:07.083
Let me check

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:11.292
Li Delong

01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:13.500
Isn't that your dad?

01:27:14.667 --> 01:27:16.792
Should I deliver it?

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:18.000
It's okay

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:20.250
I'll do it

01:27:38.917 --> 01:27:41.583
I thought you deliver to home

01:27:41.667 --> 01:27:44.667
Why did you leave it outside?

01:28:08.375 --> 01:28:09.625
Give it a try

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:28.125
Tastes nasty!

01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:30.042
What are you laughing at?

01:28:32.167 --> 01:28:33.333
When you forced me to drink tea

01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:34.708
I said the same thing

01:28:36.042 --> 01:28:37.875
I didn't really mean what I said

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.708
Here

01:28:49.833 --> 01:28:51.250
drink with me

01:28:53.917 --> 01:28:55.292
I want some tea

01:29:21.208 --> 01:29:22.333
Drink your tea

01:29:34.667 --> 01:29:36.250
Not bad. huh?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.667
How about regrets or pities?

01:29:53.167 --> 01:29:55.833
I loved the farmers' market when I was young

01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:57.667
At that time I...

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:00.125
Now

01:30:00.833 --> 01:30:03.083
no one comes to the market anymore

01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:05.917
One time I was at the market...

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.833
I met my husband

01:30:07.917 --> 01:30:09.542
here at the market

01:30:10.042 --> 01:30:11.375
But...

01:30:11.542 --> 01:30:13.333
He died last year

01:30:13.417 --> 01:30:14.792
He's dead and I'm old

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.458
No one sells in the market

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.833
and no one visits it anymore

01:30:33.125 --> 01:30:34.792
Grandma. we need to get going

01:30:35.167 --> 01:30:36.375
Do you guys have cash?

01:30:43.375 --> 01:30:44.542
No

01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:45.500
No pity

01:30:46.208 --> 01:30:47.625
The farmers' market will always exist

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.708
Only it will become bigger

01:30:52.375 --> 01:30:54.792
The thing I'm most proud of is that

01:30:54.875 --> 01:30:56.625
with our sincerity and effort

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:58.125
we've changed a place

01:30:58.208 --> 01:30:58.917
and its people

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.542
Young people like you. is the future tomorrow!

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:04.417
