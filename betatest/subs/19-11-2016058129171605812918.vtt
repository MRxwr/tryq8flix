00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:25.540
That was smooth

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.044
how you did that.
You accidentally on purpose

00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:28.844
called your phone
so you can get my number?

00:17:32.784 --> 00:17:34.686
Can you drop me off
at this store over here?

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.595
I forgot to get something
for Gah-Git.

00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:44.930
What the hell is a Gah-Git?

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.462

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:48.163
- My grandmother.
- Oh.

00:17:48.165 --> 00:17:49.699
So. when we were younger

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:51.102
"Gah git" this. "Gah git" that.

00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:53.738

00:17:54.071 --> 00:17:56.807
I can wait. make sure

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.743
That was sweet. but I'm okay.

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.545
Gah-Git sees me

00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:02.845
She'll send
the whole praise team

00:18:02.847 --> 00:18:04.648
to lay hands on me.

00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:06.117
We don't need that.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:08.754

00:22:58.209 --> 00:23:00.912
to stay awake when Rev
was preaching his sermon.

00:23:01.112 --> 00:23:02.814
Figured that was
punishment enough.

00:23:03.748 --> 00:23:06.683
Now. don't let it happen

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:08.952

00:23:11.255 --> 00:23:14.222
A man wants to go
is between a woman's legs.

00:23:14.224 --> 00:23:15.394
Don't y'all ever forget it.

00:23:24.902 --> 00:23:26.270
Well. Hello.

00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:30.474

So. how'd it go with Quadir?

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:42.383
It was cool.
He dropped me off.

00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:43.753
- That's it?

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.457
Gah-Git know

00:23:46.257 --> 00:23:47.625
Oh. shit. my bad.

00:23:47.858 --> 00:23:50.760
It was worth it. though. G.
Quadir is paid.

00:23:51.061 --> 00:23:53.161
Not only is he makin'
money in the streets.

00:23:53.163 --> 00:23:54.662
but he's got a bunch
of businesses.

00:23:54.664 --> 00:23:56.065
- He's a millionaire.
- Girl.

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.068
I had my share
of drug deal millionaires.

00:23:58.568 --> 00:24:02.473
Please! Jamal
wasn't nobody's millionaire.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.408
Anyway.

00:24:04.608 --> 00:24:06.910
So. Quadir is supposed
to be seeing some girl

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.846
named Cherelle
who lives up in Germantown.

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:10.546
Well. Good for her.
She can have him.

00:24:10.548 --> 00:24:11.615
I feel you.

00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:14.251
Besides. you gon' be

00:24:14.484 --> 00:24:16.520

00:24:17.288 --> 00:24:18.756
That's why I got you this.

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:22.660
- Aww. really?
- Yeah.

00:24:22.926 --> 00:24:24.128
Let me see what this is.

00:24:25.762 --> 00:24:26.932
I love you.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.804
Look. G. on the real. none of us
had it easy comin' up.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.307
I mean. between your momma
and my daddy.

00:24:36.207 --> 00:24:37.774
you still got your dreams. G.

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.442
and that's more
than most of us got.

00:24:39.943 --> 00:24:42.379
But. trust and believe
you always got me.

00:24:43.413 --> 00:24:45.482
And don't be spending
your money on me either.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.450
I got a couple coin from Rasun

00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:50.788
and I couldn't help
but buy it for you.

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:52.990
Rasun know he contributed
to this?

00:24:53.824 --> 00:24:55.657
Not unless he saw me
go through his wallet

00:24:55.659 --> 00:24:59.431
- while he was sleep.
- Girl. you are a mess.

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:01.799
Gena.

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:03.701
Baby. it's dinner time.

00:25:04.134 --> 00:25:06.002
Why don't you set
a place for Sahirah.

00:25:06.237 --> 00:25:08.638
Thank you. Gah-Git.
I appreciate you.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.338
Sugar. you show up

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.076
Why would this Sunday
be any different?

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.376
I just wish you
would show up early

00:25:14.378 --> 00:25:16.346
so you can go
to the services with us.

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:18.480
You know. I'm workin' on that?

00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:21.752
- Hmm. yeah.
- I promise. I am.

00:25:28.558 --> 00:25:30.459
See right there?
I don't like that.

00:25:55.185 --> 00:25:57.655
Excuse me. miss.
Are you Gena Rollins?

00:25:58.522 --> 00:25:59.788
Yes.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.391
but I'm kind of runnin' late
for class.

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:02.661
Is there somethin'
I can help you with?

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:18.543
Tell Quadir I said thank you.
but I'm okay.

00:26:39.763 --> 00:26:40.898
Yeah.

00:26:42.932 --> 00:26:44.935
What the fuck you mean
she didn't get in the car?

00:26:47.337 --> 00:26:48.873
All right. all right.

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:50.574
Listen...

00:26:51.174 --> 00:26:52.943
text me as soon
as she leaves class. all right?

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.778
As soon as.

00:27:09.426 --> 00:27:11.059
Yo. man. I got some chicks

00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:12.862
that's ready to get down

00:27:13.096 --> 00:27:14.663
All right. that sounds good.
Let Rasun handle that.

00:27:14.665 --> 00:27:16.065
- Take this to my mother's.

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:17.234
how come
you ain't bring it. man.

00:27:17.634 --> 00:27:19.235
She knows the answer. that's why
she won't ask no questions.

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.704
Why the fuck
you asking questions?

00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.906
Man. I know y'all niggas think
I'm young

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.276
and only do... runnin' errands.
but let me run. I'm ready!

00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:27.979
Yo. what's up. Mr. Richards?

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:30.312
We're closed. gentlemen.

00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:31.449
Don't look that way to me.

00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:33.282
Y'all need some more security
up in this thang. man.

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:34.583
Anybody can get up in this jawn.

00:27:34.585 --> 00:27:37.055
Trust and believe.

00:27:39.856 --> 00:27:40.857
Somethin' funny?

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:42.958
Nah. I mean that's cute.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.028
My little niece

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:46.131
Hilarious. What's your name?

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:48.132

00:27:48.432 --> 00:27:49.467
Come have a seat.

00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:59.477
You...

00:28:00.411 --> 00:28:02.212
and I have yet to be...

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.214
properly introduced.

00:28:04.448 --> 00:28:05.650
- You thirsty?
- Nah. I'm good.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.285
But you sure are
actin' thirsty.

00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:13.788
I'm not trying to act all joe
and shit.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.524

that you're big time

00:28:15.526 --> 00:28:16.826

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.227
You've got the connects

so that makes you big time.

00:28:19.663 --> 00:28:22.066
I'ma keep it 1.000
with you. James.

00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:24.868
I do not like when people
try to impress me.

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.501
A lot of people talk that talk.

00:28:26.503 --> 00:28:27.902
but me and my crew.
we're showin' you

00:28:27.904 --> 00:28:29.471
that we're the hottest thing
in these streets.

00:28:29.473 --> 00:28:31.907
I don't work in the streets.
Does this look like the streets?

00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:33.843
You think we can't move
how you move?

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:36.045
I don't know. you famous.
Like your man said. you famous.

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:38.082
You wanna be a star?
I don't wanna be a star.

00:28:38.415 --> 00:28:39.451
Huh?

00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:45.022
That move your man Rich pulled
at the club the other night?

00:28:45.655 --> 00:28:46.825
Noisy.

00:28:48.224 --> 00:28:49.557
I don't do noisy.

00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:51.495
Nah. man. Rich is young.

00:28:53.196 --> 00:28:54.998
- We respect you.
- It's not a no...

00:28:56.032 --> 00:28:57.167
but it's not a yes.

00:28:58.368 --> 00:29:00.504
Let's give it a couple months.
let things smooth out.

00:29:03.574 --> 00:29:04.776
I see you. Jerrell.

00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:08.378
We'll work somethin' out.

00:29:11.915 --> 00:29:13.250
- That's fair.
- Fair is fair.

00:29:13.683 --> 00:29:16.754
- And you're the boss. I get it.
- You're tryin' to be a boss.

00:29:17.387 --> 00:29:18.490
I get it.

00:29:21.925 --> 00:29:23.660
And we have been
introduced before.

00:29:36.807 --> 00:29:40.478
I stare in your eyes
and the world disappears.

00:29:41.244 --> 00:29:44.481
Leaving us together.
so no one can see.

00:29:45.482 --> 00:29:48.318
Your body moves closer
so you're next to me.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.155
Your fingers unbutton
and take off my clothes.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.794
Your hands moving all over
from my head to my toes.

00:29:57.428 --> 00:30:00.331
Without delay.
you start to play.

00:30:04.734 --> 00:30:06.002
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

00:30:07.037 --> 00:30:09.705
- You just don't quit do you?
- Man. what would the fun

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:11.440
- be in that?
- Oh. So. what? You just thought

00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:12.741
you would send a car.
I'd skip class

00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:13.742
get in. and. what. we'd go...

00:30:13.744 --> 00:30:14.811
- to Atlantic City?
- I did.

00:30:15.179 --> 00:30:16.510
Spend some money. have some fun.
and I'd throw my panties

00:30:16.512 --> 00:30:17.813
- in the air in gratitude?
- I actually like

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.146
- the panties in the air part.
- I bet you do.

00:30:19.148 --> 00:30:20.649
I bet you could write
a book on it.

00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:22.485
- I've had my experiences.
- I'm sorry to disappoint.

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.286
but I'm not interested
in being your experiment.

00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:25.688
I don't know.
I know it's loud in here.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.989
- but I said. experiences.
- I know what you said.

00:30:27.991 --> 00:30:29.458
You don't have to talk to me
like I'm a child.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.594
Take it easy.

00:30:31.761 --> 00:30:34.529
Relax. I'm not talking
to you like you're a child.

00:30:34.531 --> 00:30:37.401
I just like you and I think
you like me. too.

00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.236
How you know I like you?

00:30:39.936 --> 00:30:41.970
Well. you haven't slapped me
in the face.

00:30:41.972 --> 00:30:43.807
got up and left.
or asked me to leave.

00:30:45.308 --> 00:30:46.676
- I like you.
- Okay.

00:30:46.977 --> 00:30:49.013
- But this isn't gonna happen.
- Why?

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:51.747
- I have been with guys like you.
- You have been with boys.

00:30:51.749 --> 00:30:52.980
You have never been with a man.

00:30:52.982 --> 00:30:54.283
I would never put my hands
on you.

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:55.616
Oh. you did a credit check
on me?

00:30:55.618 --> 00:30:57.152
- Of course I did.
- I'm doing everything

00:30:57.154 --> 00:30:58.990
in my power
to get out of this life.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.728
- I don't trust myself with you.
- I don't trust myself with me.

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.363
Welcome to the club.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.028
- You gotta meet my family.
- Of course.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.765
- They're everything to me.
- Family is everything.

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:10.701
Okay. so dinner.

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:12.767
- Dinner. at my restaurant.
- No. no. no.

00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:14.001
- Lobster.
- You gotta have dinner

00:31:14.003 --> 00:31:15.671
at my Gah-Git's house.
at her table.

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.139
and you can bring some
of your friends

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:18.109
- if you like.
- All right.

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.009
Now get off my bus.

00:31:52.409 --> 00:31:53.611
I'll see you
in a little bit.

00:31:56.012 --> 00:31:58.081
- Who that?
- Aubrey.

00:31:58.548 --> 00:31:59.615
Yeah. I fucks with Aubrey.

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:01.118
She always down for whatever.

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.220
but she always gettin'
into it with somebody.

00:32:03.586 --> 00:32:04.821
She's gettin' us
that money. though.

00:32:05.255 --> 00:32:06.488
True.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:07.890
She remind me
of a white boy rapper.

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:09.091
then when he get
to the nigga part.

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.394
he always throw
a little extra on it.

00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:11.927
She cool. I got her.

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:13.130
But niggas
be getting mad. though.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.432
And then she get mad
and wanna pop a motherfucker.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.801
How this money lookin'?

00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:19.003
We lookin' real good. Rich.

00:32:19.403 --> 00:32:21.239
We'd be lookin' better
if we had Winston's territory.

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.506
Woo!

00:32:23.707 --> 00:32:26.276
Man. Jerrell. don't nobody
do it like you. bruh.

00:32:26.977 --> 00:32:28.477
Just make sure
you keep them bottles poppin'

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.782
- when we get to the club.
- I got you.

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:33.785
You gon' be up there
with Quadir. Rich.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.451
Watch.

00:32:35.719 --> 00:32:38.120
You know my manager.
he move Heaven and Earth

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:40.423
every time Qua call
and make a reservation.

00:32:41.258 --> 00:32:42.924
It's like
he the black Bill Gates

00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:45.663
or some shit.
That nigga famous.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.532
And what about me?

00:32:48.665 --> 00:32:50.632
You? What you mean?

00:32:50.634 --> 00:32:52.036
The fuck your manager say
about me?

00:32:55.405 --> 00:32:58.241
Hey. look. man. you know Qua
on some next level shit. bruh.

00:32:58.575 --> 00:33:01.577
The boy come in.
buy the joint out. every time.

00:33:01.778 --> 00:33:03.347
Rich nigga problems.

00:33:22.732 --> 00:33:24.701
Come here. baby.
Come here.

00:33:26.336 --> 00:33:27.739
Go hook the boy up
with a nice cut.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.715
Over here.

00:33:38.615 --> 00:33:39.948
The real power is knowin'
when to leave

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.182
a little somethin' on the table.

00:33:41.184 --> 00:33:42.752
I thought the real power
ran the table.

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.353
Quadir is strong.
but we're stronger.

00:33:45.355 --> 00:33:47.557
There's nothin'
that he has that we can't take.

00:33:48.792 --> 00:33:50.959
Man. clean this shit up
and get these

00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:52.395
corny motherfuckers
up outta here.

00:33:52.963 --> 00:33:54.932
Y'all heard my man.
get the fuck out.

00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:57.132
I went
to three different outlets

00:33:57.134 --> 00:33:58.336
to find the chairs
that I wanted.

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.304
All of them had pictures
on their websites.

00:34:00.537 --> 00:34:01.904
but none of them had them
in their warehouses.

00:34:02.471 --> 00:34:03.971
Then. when you get there.
they try to pawn

00:34:03.973 --> 00:34:05.075
something else off on you.

00:34:05.608 --> 00:34:07.709
I hate when people play
with my time like that.

00:34:07.711 --> 00:34:09.811
I wanted to beat the shit
out of them with a hammer.

00:34:09.813 --> 00:34:12.046
No. I feel you though.
because the right chairs

00:34:12.048 --> 00:34:14.349
are important if you openin' up
a hair salon.

00:34:14.351 --> 00:34:16.050
Out of all the...
I wouldn't think chairs.

00:34:16.052 --> 00:34:17.619
Why are chairs important?

00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:20.054
Have you ever sat
in the same spot for six hours

00:34:20.056 --> 00:34:21.722
while someone puts
a weave in your scalp?

00:34:21.724 --> 00:34:24.494
- No. I haven't.
- Trust me. chairs are important.

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:26.494
Yeah. because of my charm.
she got the chairs

00:34:26.496 --> 00:34:29.430
she wanted and she didn't have
to kneecap a motherfucker.

00:34:31.034 --> 00:34:32.469
That's because the clerk
was a woman.

00:34:33.036 --> 00:34:34.501
Aww.
how long y'all been together?

00:34:34.503 --> 00:34:35.706
Six years.

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.108
Yeah.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:39.210
All the girls were chasin'
after Tyrik.

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:40.944
including this one singer.

00:34:41.177 --> 00:34:43.211
She even had
a recording contract.

00:34:43.213 --> 00:34:44.244
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:34:44.246 --> 00:34:45.546
Who is she?

00:34:45.548 --> 00:34:47.615
Doesn't matter.
'cause I'm the one who got him.

00:34:47.617 --> 00:34:49.516
- Yes. you did. baby.
- Sweet Lord. Jesus.

00:34:49.518 --> 00:34:52.089
I'm so happy everybody
is enjoyin' themselves.

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:56.258
Oh. and Gah-Git.
this wine is so good.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.829
I can see that. baby.
You need to slow your roll.

00:34:59.128 --> 00:35:01.063
I appreciate you. uh.

00:35:01.898 --> 00:35:04.032
allowing me and my brother
into your home.

00:35:04.034 --> 00:35:06.066
- It means a lot.
- It's my pleasure.

00:35:06.068 --> 00:35:09.706
Gena spoke so highly of you.
I couldn't resist meeting you.

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.108
Yeah. me... same here.

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:15.211
Being our guest.
would you bless the food?

00:35:15.778 --> 00:35:18.280
Uh. with all due respect. uh.
in my religion.

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:21.749
we don't... we just stay silent
before we eat.

00:35:21.751 --> 00:35:23.820
- What kind of religion is that?
- Muslim.

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:25.589
Don't y'all pray.
like. five times a day?

00:35:25.922 --> 00:35:27.555
- Yeah.
- Well. that's nice.

00:35:27.557 --> 00:35:30.326
but in this house
we say our blessings

00:35:30.527 --> 00:35:32.996
- out loud before we eat.
- I am a guest in your home.

00:35:33.396 --> 00:35:34.664
Thank you. Bria?

00:35:41.103 --> 00:35:43.304
Heavenly Father.
we thank you for the gifts

00:35:43.306 --> 00:35:45.175
of your bounty
which we enjoy at this table.

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:47.144
As you have provided
for us in the past.

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:49.146
may you sustain us
throughout our lives.

00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:51.481
We also thank you
for blessing us with the friends

00:35:51.748 --> 00:35:54.518
and family that have gathered
to take part in your gifts.

00:35:54.818 --> 00:35:56.854
May we never forget the needy
and those in want.

00:35:57.353 --> 00:35:59.221
Jesus's name we pray. amen.

00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:00.688
Amen.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.058
- Let's eat.
- Ready.

00:36:03.393 --> 00:36:04.661
Strange.

00:36:04.961 --> 00:36:06.360
I know you've
never been with a big man

00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:08.796
like me. Tell you the truth.
you want lies.

00:36:08.798 --> 00:36:09.965
I'm not here for your lies.

00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:11.999

of time on your phone.

00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:53.710
This nigga gon'

A'ight. fuck it.
I'll get straight to the chase.

00:37:08.891 --> 00:37:10.594
See. I'm startin'
a little self-help organization

00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:11.894
of the strongest brothers
in Philly.

00:37:12.628 --> 00:37:14.229
You know. just tryin'
to bring a little wealth

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:15.599
and dignity back
to our own communities.

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.233
You do it for the youth. then?

00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:19.070
I want you to get down with us.
Winston.

00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:21.338
A brother like you on the team.

00:37:22.172 --> 00:37:23.239
Nah. man.

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:24.773
that's not for me. man.

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.541
You must find someone
else. man. not me.

00:37:26.543 --> 00:37:28.377
- That wasn't really a request.
- Got it!

00:37:28.744 --> 00:37:30.512
I'll call you
when I wanna meet with you.

00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:31.916
Just make yourself available.

00:37:35.085 --> 00:37:38.054
Oh. get yourself
a new piece of pussy.

00:37:38.688 --> 00:37:40.824
We don't want niggas confusin'
us in these streets out here.

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:44.729
Let's head up north
real quick.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.599
Baby. I put my foot in it.
didn't I?

00:37:52.601 --> 00:37:54.770
Mm-hm.
- I like Quadir.

00:37:55.038 --> 00:37:57.271
He don't say much.
but I like him.

00:37:57.273 --> 00:37:58.608
I think he says a lot.

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:02.445
You like him. Gena. don't you?

00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:05.983
- I do.
- Why. because he has money?

00:38:06.715 --> 00:38:07.652
Honestly?

00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:09.786
Because he got on my bus.

00:38:11.755 --> 00:38:12.956
Guys will give you money.

00:38:13.423 --> 00:38:15.057
but they won't give you
their time.

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.561
- That's true.
- He gave me his time.

00:38:18.394 --> 00:38:20.664
Man that gives you his time.
that's somethin'.

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:26.070
And he asked me... he asked me
to go with him to L.A.

00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:28.572
L.A.!
Girl you goin'. right?

00:38:29.572 --> 00:38:30.771
Now. he got on a bus.

00:38:30.773 --> 00:38:32.308
and now he wants
to put you on a plane?

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:33.976
I mean. if it's okay with you.

00:38:34.643 --> 00:38:36.780
Spring break.
you're a grown woman.

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.216
You have to decide
what you wanna do.

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:44.121
Plus. if you don't go.
I'm goin'.

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:45.990
And he does seem
like a nice guy. too.

00:38:46.923 --> 00:38:47.958
Yes.

00:38:48.692 --> 00:38:50.860
He does seem
like a very nice young man.

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.663
You'd never know
he was a drug dealer.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.456
As you can see. our suites
feature vaulted ceilings.

00:39:22.458 --> 00:39:25.495
floor-to-ceiling window walls walls on
three sides. a wraparound city view.

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:26.864
Not to mention...

00:39:28.164 --> 00:39:29.400
Thank you. sir.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.612
You like it?

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.782
I mean. how can I not?

00:39:48.885 --> 00:39:50.821
It's like real
Stanley Kubrick. right?

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.456
What you know
about that Clockwork?

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.958
I know it's orange.

00:39:55.992 --> 00:39:57.128
That's what I do know.

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:00.797
- You got two bedrooms.
- Mm. yeah.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.930
You know what I'm sayin'?
I didn't want to be out here

00:40:02.932 --> 00:40:04.266
jumping to conclusions.

00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:07.571
looking like a clown. so.
yeah. I got two rooms.

00:40:08.271 --> 00:40:09.440
I appreciate that.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.742
I appreciate you
appreciating that.

00:40:30.726 --> 00:40:32.226
Listen to some music in here.
man.

00:40:32.228 --> 00:40:34.229
Keep your hands off
the goddamn radio. man.

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:35.366
Stay focused.

00:40:36.532 --> 00:40:37.967
How many more pick-ups we got?

00:40:38.168 --> 00:40:39.499
Um. just two.

00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:41.237
We got one downtown.
one on the west side.

00:40:44.106 --> 00:40:45.608
You tryin' to go
to that titty bar after this?

00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:47.543
- Titty bar?
- Yeah.

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.209
Man. I don't be fuckin'
with no titty bar.

00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:51.014
That's for little young
boys like yourself. man.

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.682
A'ight. more titties

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.417
'Bout to make it rain
in that bitch.

00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:56.784
Yeah. you make it rain.

00:40:56.786 --> 00:40:58.521
Your pockets gon' be dryer
than a motherfucker.

00:40:58.789 --> 00:40:59.924
Negative.

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.164
Winston?

00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:10.834
Damn.

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.670
Man. fuck that trick. man.

00:41:14.137 --> 00:41:16.137
Every nigga go to his grave.
hatin' on some bitch.

00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:17.374
But why that nigga. though?

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.074
She don't even know. I'm the reason
that that nigga is on right now.

00:41:20.076 --> 00:41:21.844
Man. don't let that get
in the way of this business.

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:23.744
Man.
Winston's just a flashy nigga.

00:41:23.746 --> 00:41:26.081
You know. dumb hoes.
they love shiny shit

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:27.184
even when it's fake gold.

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.413
You know I've never been
horseback riding before.

00:41:56.612 --> 00:41:58.581
I wouldn't be able to tell that.
You're a natural.

00:41:58.882 --> 00:41:59.916
You're a natural.

00:42:00.483 --> 00:42:02.251
Man. Sahirah would go crazy

00:42:02.452 --> 00:42:03.587
- out here.
- Yo.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.354
Sahirah does not need to be here
to go crazy. Trust me.

00:42:06.356 --> 00:42:07.889
You better stop talkin'
about my friend.

00:42:07.891 --> 00:42:09.025
- I'm just sayin'.
- You know.

00:42:09.224 --> 00:42:10.557
if it wasn't for Sahirah
we wouldn't have met.

00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:12.894
I mean. okay. granted.
but I just don't get it.

00:42:12.896 --> 00:42:14.528
you know. you guys are
nothin' alike. nothin' alike.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.197
What do you mean?
She's my best friend.

00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:18.034
We been best friends
since second grade.

00:42:18.268 --> 00:42:21.003
- All right.
- Man. it feels good to be outta Philly.

00:42:21.204 --> 00:42:24.208
I'm tellin' you. sometimes
that place. it just...

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:27.610
just sucks the life out of you.
You know. what I'm sayin'?

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:29.812
Why don't you
live somewhere else?

00:42:30.146 --> 00:42:31.880
Seem like you could live
anywhere you want.

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.985
Because as much as I hate
the city. hate it...

00:42:37.353 --> 00:42:39.889
I still love it. it's the same.
It's crazy.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.655
- Yeah.

00:42:41.657 --> 00:42:43.891
Hey. what would you do
if you weren't doin'

00:42:43.893 --> 00:42:44.994
what you're doin' now?

00:42:45.295 --> 00:42:47.061
All I do know
is I'm not gonna be doin' this

00:42:47.063 --> 00:42:48.197
for the rest of my life.

00:42:48.864 --> 00:42:50.530
You hear me?
You can't be a father.

00:42:50.532 --> 00:42:52.566
a husband with a life like this.

00:42:52.568 --> 00:42:53.737
You just can't. you can't.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.037
You wanna be a father
and a husband?

00:42:56.039 --> 00:42:57.537
Yes. of course I do.
I want it all.

00:42:57.539 --> 00:42:59.074

I want swim meets. track meets.
Christmas. birthdays.

00:43:03.179 --> 00:43:04.713
I want that all.
I didn't grow up with that.

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.283
- I didn't have that.
- Yeah. me neither.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.451
I mean. I dream about it. but...

00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:11.254
So. you dreamed
about it. so you want it. too.

00:43:11.788 --> 00:43:13.222
Yeah. I do.

00:43:13.789 --> 00:43:15.125

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.230
The 405 traffic is nuts.

00:45:33.496 --> 00:45:36.697
Ah. but the sunshine makes up
for the inconvenience.

00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:38.402
Yeah. I gotta get out here
more often.

00:45:39.068 --> 00:45:41.003
- You would benefit from that.
- I would.

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.507
Look. the...
the business has changed a lot

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.074
since my dad put in all
the work back in the '90s.

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:47.244
Yeah. it was crazy times.

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.012
It was.

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.614
Come on. Get inside.

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:05.062
Nowadays. the police see it
as just another vice.

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.597
- Yeah.
- As long as there's no violence.

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.197
Absolutely. Listen.

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.532
a lot has changed for me.
Carlos.

00:46:10.733 --> 00:46:13.170
I don't get my hands dirty
anymore. I'm a businessman.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.738
Violence is bad for business
and I assure you

00:46:16.072 --> 00:46:18.206
anyone I employ
will only resort to violence

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:20.276
unless it is
absolutely necessary.

00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:23.579
If you can guarantee that.
we can proceed as planned

00:46:23.913 --> 00:46:26.380
and immediately a pipeline
will be opened up to you.

00:46:27.617 --> 00:46:29.016
- You have my word.
- Let's do it.

00:46:29.018 --> 00:46:30.751
Let's do it.

00:46:30.753 --> 00:46:33.323
So. what is the shipping method?

00:46:35.891 --> 00:46:36.960
We're sitting in it.

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:44.932
I love it. I love it.

00:47:09.293 --> 00:47:10.794
Is there something
I can help you with?

00:47:11.193 --> 00:47:12.628
Yes. how much is this?

00:47:13.329 --> 00:47:14.662
Eleven.

00:47:14.664 --> 00:47:16.233
Seriously? Eleven dollars?

00:47:16.532 --> 00:47:19.068
No. 1100.

00:47:22.137 --> 00:47:23.973
I'll take it.

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:29.880
You know. I'll take this. too.

00:47:32.114 --> 00:47:33.449
Yeah. Sahirah will like that.

00:47:35.251 --> 00:47:36.820
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

00:47:56.639 --> 00:47:58.338
The easiest way
to get over one chick

00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.476
is to get another one.

00:47:59.742 --> 00:48:01.508
I don't see
that happenin' right now.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.179
- Why not?
- Because she right over there.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.347
- Oh. there she is.
- Hey y'all.

00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:07.215
What's goin' on?

00:48:07.483 --> 00:48:08.552
How's it goin'?

00:48:09.918 --> 00:48:11.219
Girl. you shinin'.

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.487
- What's up. Tyrik?
- How are you?

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:13.456
What's up?

00:48:14.257 --> 00:48:16.358
Eh. eh. eh. man.
cut that out. man.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.260
Huggin' on my lady like that.

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.927
Look. I had a lot
of fun with you. Rasun.

00:48:20.929 --> 00:48:24.063
but I'm not really
the relationship type girl.

00:48:24.065 --> 00:48:26.902
- Winston playin' you out.
- Aww. come on. Rasun.

00:48:27.503 --> 00:48:29.605
Most of the brothers out here
got a woman at home.

00:48:30.106 --> 00:48:31.838
I don't care
who Winston hooks up with

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.242
as long as he takin' care of me.

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:36.911
Look. I am not interested
in bein' nobody's girlfriend.

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:40.680
I say who. I say when.
I control this.

00:48:40.682 --> 00:48:42.749
Naw. money control everything
around you.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:49.092
Look. I like you. Rasun.
We had fun. but...

00:48:50.059 --> 00:48:51.193
I ain't the one for you.

00:48:55.697 --> 00:48:56.799
Take care. okay?

00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:03.940
Where your shorty goin'. my nig?

00:49:04.407 --> 00:49:05.909
You lookin' real lonely.

00:50:43.706 --> 00:50:45.174
The bags in the car.

00:50:55.217 --> 00:50:56.983
- You had a good time?
- Had a great time.

00:50:56.985 --> 00:50:58.219
You already in high heels.

00:51:00.822 --> 00:51:03.225
Big things poppin' out here.

00:51:03.525 --> 00:51:06.026
I'm glad that you had
a good time.

00:51:06.028 --> 00:51:08.729
- I did.
- You lookin' fly. you feel fly.

00:51:08.731 --> 00:51:10.530
- Thank you.
- Huh. you feel fly?

00:51:10.532 --> 00:51:12.398
- Uh-huh. I do.
- Okay good.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.069
- I'm glad you had a good time.
- Thank you.

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:16.138
It was the best time
I've ever had.

00:51:16.438 --> 00:51:19.442
Well. many more to come. I hope.

00:51:20.208 --> 00:51:21.708
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.111
- We'll see.
- We'll see. indeed.

00:51:23.579 --> 00:51:25.378
- All right. you be good.
- You. too.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.482
All right.

00:51:33.255 --> 00:51:34.324
Hey. y'all!

00:51:35.423 --> 00:51:36.626
You miss me?

00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:43.567
Bria. what's wrong?

00:51:46.668 --> 00:51:47.770
Gah-Git. what's the matter?

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:53.910
Baby. I didn't wanna call
or text you this.

00:51:54.376 --> 00:51:58.914
but Sahirah got caught up
in a shootout last night.

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:00.617
Sahirah what?

00:52:01.884 --> 00:52:03.052
Is she... is she okay?

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.025
I'll just call her.

00:52:09.625 --> 00:52:10.594
Gena.

00:52:11.494 --> 00:52:13.296
She didn't make it. baby.

00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:17.132
Enough.
That's not funny. Gah-Git.

00:52:17.766 --> 00:52:21.971
I'm sorry. I know how hard
this must be for you.

00:52:22.804 --> 00:52:24.838
I know it's hard for you.
precious.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.507
Come on. come on.

00:52:26.509 --> 00:52:29.510
I'm not available
to take your call right now.

00:52:51.766 --> 00:52:53.936
What happened?

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.776
- What the fuck happened?
- They hit Winston first.

00:53:01.242 --> 00:53:03.612
Sahirah was there
when it happened. so she gone.

00:53:04.146 --> 00:53:06.615
- That's what happened.
- Sorry. Ra.

00:53:08.617 --> 00:53:09.950
So. we popped their corner boys.

00:53:09.952 --> 00:53:11.487
- You did what?
- We did.

00:53:12.454 --> 00:53:14.423
What the fuck
did you do that for?

00:53:14.623 --> 00:53:15.923
Fuck you mean?

00:53:15.925 --> 00:53:17.224
You expect us to sit
on our hands all day

00:53:17.226 --> 00:53:18.724
while these niggas
just take a shit on us?

00:53:18.726 --> 00:53:20.394
I expect you to be
a motherfuckin' professional.

00:53:20.396 --> 00:53:21.664
that's what I expect you to do.

00:53:21.864 --> 00:53:23.165
- It was professional.
- That was not professional.

00:53:23.365 --> 00:53:25.768
- It was emotional and weak.
- Emotional?

00:53:26.534 --> 00:53:28.202
I apologize that
that happened to Sahirah.

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:30.173
but you know what it is.
She was a casualty.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.911
We cannot afford
to go to war right now.

00:53:36.644 --> 00:53:37.913
Not during this transition.

00:53:40.416 --> 00:53:42.648
- Man. so what we gon' do?
- Let Jerrell know

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.019
that you can't make money
tradin' bullets.

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:46.188
Go see
the little rich white bitch.

00:53:46.454 --> 00:53:47.422
Ashley. Aubrey.

00:53:47.623 --> 00:53:48.924
We'll send a message
through her.

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:51.260
And if we fall back.
they fall back. it's over.

00:53:51.527 --> 00:53:52.929
I'll be back.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.365
- Drop the prices.
- Drop 'em?

00:53:56.231 --> 00:53:57.233
Drop 'em.

00:53:57.833 --> 00:53:59.400
We hit 'em in the pockets.
hit 'em where it hurts.

00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:00.503
make 'em reasonable.

00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:08.612
Dropped.

00:54:16.085 --> 00:54:17.119
I'm sorry.

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.988
Hi. this is Sahirah.

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:57.291
I'm not available
to take your call right now.

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:59.929
but leave a message at the beep
and I'll get back to you.

00:55:00.128 --> 00:55:01.229
Holla.

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.639
Oh. baby.

00:55:11.039 --> 00:55:13.206
Gah-Git. I just wanna
be by myself.

00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:14.510
Oh. come here.

00:55:18.246 --> 00:55:19.382
All right.

00:55:22.818 --> 00:55:24.485
Quadir stopped by again.

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.019
Did you tell him I wasn't here?

00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:28.856
Yeah. but you know
he don't believe that.

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:31.227
I don't care what he believes.
He never liked Sahirah.

00:55:31.427 --> 00:55:34.396
I'm not sayin' what you're doin'
isn't right. it is.

00:55:34.963 --> 00:55:37.032
And you know I don't
want that life for you...

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.369
but I also think

00:55:39.668 --> 00:55:41.538
there's a right way
to do things.

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.142
I don't wanna see him.

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.775
I just wanna be left alone.

00:55:48.777 --> 00:55:51.380
And you have every right
to feel that way.

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:54.483
but you need to look
that man in his eyes

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.184
and tell him it's over.

00:55:57.085 --> 00:55:59.188
Now. I done said
what I have to say...

00:56:00.856 --> 00:56:02.958
but I'm not gonna be lyin'
for you

00:56:03.358 --> 00:56:04.827
if that boy
comes over here again.

00:56:18.039 --> 00:56:19.208
Peace be Allah.

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:40.456
Hi. this is Gena.
Sorry I'm not available.

00:57:40.655 --> 00:57:42.621
Leave a message
and have a blessed day.

00:57:42.623 --> 00:57:44.526
Thanks.

00:58:32.807 --> 00:58:33.809
Gena.

00:58:40.815 --> 00:58:41.850
Gena...

00:58:43.018 --> 00:58:44.019
are you awake?

00:59:03.137 --> 00:59:04.540
I know you're not asleep. Gena.

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:10.479
Damn. Bria.

00:59:11.045 --> 00:59:12.347
Fuck you do that for?

00:59:14.016 --> 00:59:15.217
Quadir stopped by again.

00:59:15.784 --> 00:59:17.153
Do I have to listen to this?

00:59:17.619 --> 00:59:19.385
He said he's sorry
about what happened to Sahirah.

00:59:19.387 --> 00:59:20.255
Stop.

00:59:21.123 --> 00:59:22.258
He never liked Sahirah.

00:59:22.824 --> 00:59:24.657
He ran her down
any chance he got.

00:59:24.659 --> 00:59:26.159
Look.
I'm not the smartest person

00:59:26.161 --> 00:59:27.494
in the world. Shit.

00:59:27.496 --> 00:59:29.097
I'm not the smartest person
anywhere. but.

00:59:29.731 --> 00:59:31.867
I do know what happened
to her. happened to her.

00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:34.034
It don't got nothing' to do
with you or Quadir.

00:59:34.036 --> 00:59:35.901
You don't have to tell me
what he said.

00:59:35.903 --> 00:59:37.938
I got all his texts
about how much he loves me.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.742
How he wants me to come live
with him. yadda yadda. whatever.

00:59:41.009 --> 00:59:42.110
Yeah. well. do you love him?

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:46.449
He sure does act
like he loves you.

00:59:48.583 --> 00:59:50.185
Yes. I love him...

00:59:51.186 --> 00:59:52.621
but that ain't got
nothing to do with it.

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:55.054
I ain't trying to be
no save-a-ho type of bitch.

00:59:55.056 --> 00:59:57.358
Maybe you're not the one
that needs saving. maybe he is.

01:02:17.398 --> 01:02:18.666
Pap!

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.833
She didn't even know
she was president

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:22.568
of the ignorant side piece club.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:23.605
That was awesome.

01:02:24.172 --> 01:02:25.273
- Thank you.
- This is the most

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:27.539
incredible drink I ever had.

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.175
- Mm.
- But you don't drink. Gah-Git.

01:02:29.177 --> 01:02:31.012
Oh. she gets tipsy
after communion.

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.048
Shoog made me this drink.

01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:35.083
I couldn't turn her down.

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.751
Shoog.
what's the name of this drink?

01:02:37.018 --> 01:02:38.184
It's called Linwood.

01:02:38.186 --> 01:02:39.889
It's got grapefruit juice.
vodka.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.258
- and a splash of Midori Sour.
- Whoo!

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:45.960
Make me feel like I'm sittin'
on the beach.

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:49.297
And she also told me
that Quadir...

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:52.066
- why y'all together.
- Really?

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.402
Shoog. what you tell Gah-Git?

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.802
Well. she said
that both of y'all

01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:56.971
raised by your grandmothers...

01:02:58.039 --> 01:03:00.442
and that he don't even speak
to his mom.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.611

You can get one.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:27.066
Speaking of that.
I think it's a good time

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:29.403

01:03:29.804 --> 01:03:30.806

Jerrell wanted us

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.849
I know Winston's your man

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.916
You can get in the car

King's don't live

01:05:15.643 --> 01:05:17.712
Text Jerrell and let him know
we got Blair on lock.

01:05:19.681 --> 01:05:21.616
If not. I'll make him famous.

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:28.224
Yo. I'm like...

But today was a good day.

01:05:32.193 --> 01:05:33.360
Yeah. it was.

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.729
It looked like everybody

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.767
Shoog and Gah-Git was like
old drinkin' buddies. literally.

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:40.768
You know like regular people.

What does that... What does
that mean. regular people?

01:05:43.371 --> 01:05:44.905
We're regular people. baby.

We are regular. look at this.

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:48.477
This is... Those apples.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.479
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean? Huh?

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:53.481
Wait! Wait. wait. wait.
before I forget.

01:05:53.882 --> 01:05:55.150
Uh. here we go.

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:57.550
Gena. you know
I don't like surprises...

01:05:57.552 --> 01:05:58.918
- Okay. close your eyes.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.755
Nope. ab...

01:06:01.056 --> 01:06:02.924
- Okay. don't close your eyes.
- Okay.

01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:06.829
What's this?

01:06:08.463 --> 01:06:10.166
You always askin'
to read my work.

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:14.467
Oh. I made it to the.
"I can read your work phase."

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:16.436
Look at me breakin' you on down.

01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:17.740
- Check it out.
- Yeah. just read it.

01:06:20.275 --> 01:06:22.610
I'm lying still
and I sense you there.

01:06:23.077 --> 01:06:26.248
in fingers all over.
touching me everywhere.

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:29.485
I feel your strength.
I feel you inside.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.754
You're taking me someplace.
insanities hide.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.088
And now you're on top.
you're big and strong.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:39.293
You're makin' me open
and you're taking control.

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.162
The deeper you're able.
the deeper you'll go

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.835
because you have
the power and I can't say no.

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:48.738
Okay. okay. wait. This...

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.838
- This is about us. huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.307
I wrote it when we were in L.A.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:57.913
Well. nobody's ever.
like. this is a first.

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.483
Some of my best work
is about you.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.981
I'm like. I'm your muse.

01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:04.186
That's what they call it. right?

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:06.153
I'm gonna submit it
for my writing competition.

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.224
I think... I think. uh.
this is good material.

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.492
but I think you maybe need
a little bit more.

01:07:12.494 --> 01:07:13.762
- Oh. do we?
- Yeah. Just a little...

01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:15.262
- Oh. yeah. just a little bit?
- Just a little bit.

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.298
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

01:07:17.364 --> 01:07:18.867
- You're great.
- Hmm.

01:07:24.972 --> 01:07:27.009
Yo. Qua. man. I wanna say
I appreciate you

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:29.476
givin' me a shot to step up
and do some things. all right.

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.311
- That's enough of that.
- For real.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.547
I have faith in you.

01:07:32.746 --> 01:07:34.716
You remind me of myself out here
when I was a young boy.

01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:38.153
Listen. you slow down
and watch the road.

01:07:39.153 --> 01:07:41.322
- I'm goin' the speed limit.
- Not that road.

01:07:41.989 --> 01:07:43.192
The game. Black.

01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:46.861
Be anxious for nothin' out here.

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:51.067
Know the players. let the game
come to you. hmm?

01:07:52.266 --> 01:07:53.333
Yeah.

01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:00.876
- Yeah?
- What you doin'?

01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:02.277
I'm busy. Cherelle.

01:08:03.244 --> 01:08:04.145
You tryin' to come over?

01:08:04.545 --> 01:08:06.947
I'm not being mean.
I told you. we're done.

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:09.081
What type of fake ass Muslim
are you?

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.751
Ain't you allowed
to have multiple wives?

01:08:11.286 --> 01:08:12.721
Besides. I know
how to play my role

01:08:13.221 --> 01:08:14.556
and I just want
some dick anyway.

01:08:16.224 --> 01:08:17.693
The problem is I care.

01:08:20.028 --> 01:08:21.130
Well. fuck you.

01:08:23.364 --> 01:08:25.331
You know what.
I always thought of Cleopatra

01:08:25.333 --> 01:08:27.135
and Mark Antony
as such a forbidden love.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:30.436
All the crazy paparazzi.
everybody goin' crazy

01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:32.940
about them hookin' up.
but you know. it worked.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.577
That's an interesting point.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.076
Now. people. we have to remember
that Cleopatra

01:08:37.078 --> 01:08:38.713
was the last pharaoh
of ancient Egypt

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.046
and her
and Mark Antony's relationship

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:43.383
was considered to be
one of the greatest

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:44.719
love affairs of history.

01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:49.356
Okay. people. chapters nine
and ten next time.

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.991
And for those of you submitting
for the writer's internship.

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:53.795

01:08:54.061 --> 01:08:55.163
is on your submission.

01:08:57.131 --> 01:08:58.533
Thanks so much.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.539
Thank you.

01:09:20.287 --> 01:09:22.023
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:26.925
Whoa. snowflake.
I didn't see you back there.

01:09:26.927 --> 01:09:28.096
Your mother and father
know where you at?

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.031
I guess you saw us
following you. huh?

01:09:31.599 --> 01:09:33.534
I heard you like to meet
in empty barber shops.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.336
You still gettin'
the wrong idea about...

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:36.969
No. I think I pretty much got

01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:38.974
the exact right idea about you.

01:09:39.573 --> 01:09:41.441
You do know I'm just trying
to help you out. right?

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.612
Ah. that's what the Nazis told
the Jews. right?

01:09:43.811 --> 01:09:46.778
Yeah. I mean. you wanna know
how a motherfucker

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.682
do what he does.
you study how he does it.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:49.883
Mm.

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:51.353
It's no secret
you loading the city up.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.054
Now. I ain't even mad at you.

01:09:53.287 --> 01:09:54.389
I mean. get that paper.

01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:56.925
But to stay strong
you need a strong army

01:09:57.391 --> 01:09:58.594
or you get overthrown.

01:09:58.993 --> 01:10:01.162
That's what you did to Winston
and Sahirah. you overthrew them?

01:10:02.163 --> 01:10:03.331
Nah.

01:10:03.798 --> 01:10:06.702
I mean. your man disrespected
and underestimated my ability.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.134
And Sariah or whatever
the fuck her name is.

01:10:09.136 --> 01:10:11.372
I mean. she was cool.
I ain't want that.

01:10:11.573 --> 01:10:13.040
but you needed
to see my strength.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.708
- I seen it.
- Look. man. I'm not here

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.844
for a pissin' match.

01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:19.114
Your squad
with my soldiers together?

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.582
We could run this city
like a Fortune 500 company.

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:23.684
Fortune 500. huh?

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.384
- With y'all three.
- Wall Street. my nigga.

01:10:26.386 --> 01:10:27.488
Wall Street.

01:10:28.489 --> 01:10:29.523
Hmm.

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.827
- You up for that task?
- My hand to God I am.

01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:35.197
or whoever you pray to.
No disrespect.

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:42.404
You're in.

01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:48.242
What about your man.
Rasun and Tyrik?

01:10:48.476 --> 01:10:51.078
Oh. oh. oh.
Rasun and Tyrik. let's see.

01:10:52.046 --> 01:10:54.214
No need for us to be crabs
in a barrel.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.083
See. that's the problem
with black people.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.552
No. no. that's the problem
with niggas.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.087
This what we gon' do.

01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:03.123
Meet me at. uh. Cafe Breezers
on the parkway Friday night.

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.827
I'm gonna talk
to the guys and smooth it out.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:07.960
But this little dance
gonna cost you. brother.

01:11:07.962 --> 01:11:09.463
- How much we talkin'?
- A meal ticket.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.500
- We'll be there.
- My dude.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.137
Read page 69.
wonderful write up.

01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:19.305
Bitch ass nigga.

01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:20.743
Told y'all he was soft.

01:11:21.442 --> 01:11:22.644
Just like that.

01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:25.111
If you wanna be king.
you gotta be willing

01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:27.216
to step to the throne
and take that jawn.

01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:40.462
So...

01:11:41.729 --> 01:11:42.898
what'd ya think?

01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:46.300
I think that you should. um...

01:11:47.234 --> 01:11:49.604
kill that intern competition
and just publish.

01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:51.403
What do you mean?
I already submitted

01:11:51.405 --> 01:11:52.772
for the writing internship.

01:11:52.774 --> 01:11:54.610
You know how expensive
it is to publish a novel?

01:11:55.243 --> 01:11:58.311
Gena. I don't see
anybody turning you down.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.980
If they don't see that.
fuck 'em.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.817
We'll self-publish.

01:12:02.783 --> 01:12:04.051
- Hmm.
- You'd do that?

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.355
Of course I would.
It's 'cause you're cute...

01:12:07.255 --> 01:12:08.556
and kind of a good writer.

01:12:11.092 --> 01:12:12.692
I ain't playin'.
you're a wonderful writer.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:17.965
Jerrell and Aubrey on the way.

01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:42.677
She's in another parking lot
but she walkin' over here.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.779
- I'll take care of it.
- All right.

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.520

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.527
- This ain't right. Tyrik.
- You know what...

01:14:59.993 --> 01:15:01.260
it was real good
while it lasted.

01:15:01.262 --> 01:15:02.495
but he has moved on

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:05.867
and I suggest
you do the same thing.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:09.268
Nigga. get your hands off of me.
If Quadir thinks

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:11.004

down to you

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.374
like some hand me
down clothes.

01:15:13.173 --> 01:15:14.208
I don't date down.

01:15:14.809 --> 01:15:16.175
Down. bitch?

01:15:16.177 --> 01:15:17.612
You ain't nothin'
but a side fuckin' piece.

01:15:18.179 --> 01:15:19.812
Now. be a lady
and walk your ass away

01:15:19.814 --> 01:15:23.050
before I gut you and throw you
in the fucking garbage.

01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:25.552
Fuck you and that nigger Quadir.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.655
Oh. yeah. you know

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:34.162

01:15:41.301 --> 01:15:44.171
Seven. twenty-eight. eighty-six.

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.807
in case you ever have
a problem you won't forget 'em.

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.376
- Enjoy your friends.
- You go with Gena.

01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:25.447
Make sure she's good.

01:16:25.713 --> 01:16:27.148
All right? Love you.

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:29.016
Love you. too.
All right. you ready?

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.351
Come on. let's go!

01:16:36.323 --> 01:16:38.092
It was exactly how you said
it would be.

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:41.195
We did our thing.
he was grabbin' the money...

01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:43.764
and that's when I saw
Jerrell wasn't there.

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:45.367
How'd they get Black?

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:49.070
Put a shitload of bullets
into him. Qua.

01:16:51.538 --> 01:16:53.140
I didn't know
Rich was still alive.

01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:55.210
They shot Black.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.578
so I popped
his motherfuckin' ass.

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:00.983
I tried to get Black
to the hospital...

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:05.287
- died in the car.
- Where'd you leave him at?

01:17:07.087 --> 01:17:08.623
Bus stop on the parkway?

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:12.494
Well.
that's a hell of a funeral.

01:17:16.597 --> 01:17:18.365
Make sure his mother
gets whatever she needs.

01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:20.433
Qua. I think we should
put everything on pause

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:21.770
- just for a minute.
- No...

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:25.806
if we freeze now we risk
losin' our connect. Carlos.

01:17:26.474 --> 01:17:27.609
So. no fuckin' way.

01:17:34.515 --> 01:17:35.683
Tyrik's right.

01:17:36.751 --> 01:17:38.020
We gotta end Jerrell.

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:40.856
Get everybody on it.

01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.541
This car is so nice.

01:17:59.807 --> 01:18:01.742
It drives so smooth.

01:18:02.542 --> 01:18:04.478
Now I have to get Tyrik
to buy me one.

01:18:05.012 --> 01:18:06.713
Yeah. it's too bad Tyrik
and Quadir

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.449
had to handle
that fire situation.

01:18:08.815 --> 01:18:10.051
Mm-hm.

01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:12.886
You don't think
there was a fire?

01:18:13.587 --> 01:18:16.123
I'm married to a gangster
and you're dating one.

01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:17.659
You tell me.

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.970

01:18:32.172 --> 01:18:33.839

01:18:33.841 --> 01:18:35.676
Don't you fucking move. bitch.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.862
Tell Quadir to put together
two million dollars

01:18:55.328 --> 01:18:56.497
and wait for my call.

01:19:01.668 --> 01:19:03.335
What you're gonna do
is you're gon' let Ray drive you

01:19:03.337 --> 01:19:05.370
to your mama house.
stay there with the boys

01:19:05.372 --> 01:19:06.574

Well. then. it's a setup

01:26:52.672 --> 01:26:53.840
Always a pleasure.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.002
I woke up...

01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:24.037
and you were gone.

01:27:26.073 --> 01:27:27.842
- I had to go handle business.
- Where'd you go?

01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:32.443
I had to handle my business.

01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:33.314
What did you do?

01:27:35.181 --> 01:27:37.417
I had to handle my business.

01:27:38.752 --> 01:27:39.954
You killed him.

01:27:41.588 --> 01:27:42.623
I'm out.

01:27:44.591 --> 01:27:45.726
It's over.

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:52.097
I'm tryin' to get us
the fuck outta here.

01:27:52.099 --> 01:27:53.299
Okay. all right.

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.469
What do you mean
"All right"?

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.938
What do you... I don't understand
what your problem is?

01:27:57.971 --> 01:27:59.072
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin'.

01:27:59.372 --> 01:28:00.571
What are you doin'?
Don't walk away from me...

01:28:00.573 --> 01:28:01.773
Listen. if we gon' be
in the hood

01:28:01.775 --> 01:28:03.075
we might as well live
in the hood.

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:04.910
not some fake fantasy land.
I'm goin' home.

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.447
You sound ridiculous.
you are home.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.780
I can't believe
I actually convinced myself

01:28:08.782 --> 01:28:09.982
that you would get out
of this game.

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.686
I'm out of the game. Gena.

01:28:13.252 --> 01:28:14.553
If you outta the game.

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:15.823
then tell me
where you were this morning.

01:28:16.923 --> 01:28:19.724
- Where were you?
- I was busy makin' plans.

01:28:19.726 --> 01:28:21.194
- What plans?
- Marry me.

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.699
- Don't fuck with me. Quadir.
- I'm not fuckin' with you.

01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.537
I'm not about this life anymore.

01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:32.673
So. when I say it's over...

01:28:34.574 --> 01:28:35.609
it's over.

01:28:37.243 --> 01:28:38.378
For real?

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:39.980
I swear to you

01:28:40.447 --> 01:28:41.815
on my grandmother's grave...

01:28:42.983 --> 01:28:44.085
I'm out.

01:28:45.085 --> 01:28:46.621
But I'm not goin' by myself.

01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:49.590
Marry me.

01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.527
All you gotta do is say yes.

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:54.826
- Yes.
- All right?

01:28:54.828 --> 01:28:55.827
- Yes.
- That's it.

01:28:55.829 --> 01:28:57.064
Yes.

01:29:48.849 --> 01:29:49.951
Yo!

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.719
You wanna be famous. bitch?

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.422
Get down. get down!

01:30:02.828 --> 01:30:04.864
No! Please!

01:30:05.532 --> 01:30:07.902
Please help!

01:30:09.369 --> 01:30:10.903
Talk to me. come on.
talk to me.

01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:13.106
Help. please!

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.314
Help!

01:30:22.515 --> 01:30:23.550
Help!

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:26.284
Hold on. baby. hold on.

01:30:27.753 --> 01:30:28.789
I love you.

01:30:31.358 --> 01:30:32.793
No. no!

01:32:23.636 --> 01:32:24.835
Viola?

01:32:24.837 --> 01:32:25.939
Hope you don't mind
if I come in.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.039
Of course not.
come in. come in.

01:32:28.041 --> 01:32:29.110
How are you?

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:30.844
I'm doin' well.

01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:32.710
- Movin' forward.
- Yeah?

01:32:32.712 --> 01:32:33.747
And you?

01:32:34.381 --> 01:32:35.516
You know.

01:32:35.815 --> 01:32:37.148
- You look good.
- Thank you.

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:38.417
- so do you.
- It's good to see you.

01:32:39.051 --> 01:32:40.086
Thanks for havin' me.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.989
You know. my attorney sent you
several notices in the mail.

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:45.657
You didn't get them?

01:32:45.659 --> 01:32:47.724
I haven't checked
the mail lately. sorry.

01:32:47.726 --> 01:32:49.063
Oh. no worries.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:55.235
But nonetheless.
I have power of attorney

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:56.737
over Quadir's estate.

01:32:58.972 --> 01:33:00.673
- What does that mean?
- That means

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.909
that this house is goin' up
for sale.

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.512
Now. I can give you
a week to move.

01:33:05.912 --> 01:33:07.213
but that's all I can do for you.

01:33:10.016 --> 01:33:11.750
Your son hasn't even been dead
two weeks

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:13.585
and you're
already selling his belongings?

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:15.422
Quadir's at peace now. Gena.

01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:17.656
The rest of us must move on.

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.359
Quadir bought this place
for me and him.

01:33:19.693 --> 01:33:21.992
- so we share it. It's mine.
- If you look

01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:25.198
at the deed.
you'll see my name is on it.

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.934
The same for his cars.
his businesses.

01:33:28.201 --> 01:33:29.500
Just because you slept here

01:33:29.502 --> 01:33:31.202
doesn't make it your house.
honey.

01:33:31.204 --> 01:33:32.870
You haven't stepped foot
in this house

01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:34.073
before 30 seconds ago.

01:33:34.341 --> 01:33:36.811
Not even one visit to see
how me and Quadir were.

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:38.375
Now you wanna come in here

01:33:38.377 --> 01:33:39.613
and try and take it away
from me?

01:33:40.447 --> 01:33:41.782
That's not gonna happen.

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.484
We'll see about that.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.884
You know what.
you can have all this shit.

01:33:46.886 --> 01:33:48.754
I'll be out in a week.
'cause I got something

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:51.292
you'll never have.
Quadir's love.

01:33:52.826 --> 01:33:53.994
Bitch.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:20.154
Oh. you going to bed
without eating again?

01:34:20.987 --> 01:34:22.021
I'm not hungry.

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:23.824
I just wanna go to sleep.

01:34:24.824 --> 01:34:27.060
Well. what ya need to do
is go to church

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:28.826
with me and Bria tomorrow.

01:34:28.828 --> 01:34:31.731
I'm good.
Tell God I said what's up.

01:35:21.347 --> 01:35:22.850
- Rasun?
- Gena. you okay?

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.717
I've been callin' you.

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:27.085
I'm sorry. Rasun.

01:35:27.087 --> 01:35:29.890
You know. it's just...
you know. with Qua...

01:35:31.958 --> 01:35:33.661
I just needed some time to...

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:35.628
just deal.

01:35:36.162 --> 01:35:38.364
I know. I feel you.

01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:43.036
I didn't really say anything
when Sahirah got killed but...

01:35:43.837 --> 01:35:45.506
it made me feel
some kinda way.

01:35:45.905 --> 01:35:46.940
Me. too.

01:35:47.673 --> 01:35:48.809
And now Qua's gone.

01:35:50.610 --> 01:35:52.113
I haven't felt like
goin' anywhere.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.316
I feel like I'm in a bad dream.

01:35:55.914 --> 01:35:56.917
I feel you.

01:35:57.449 --> 01:35:59.750
Do you know Quadir's parents
didn't even tell me

01:35:59.752 --> 01:36:01.453
- where the funeral was?
- What?

01:36:01.921 --> 01:36:04.421
I didn't even get a chance
to say a proper goodbye to him.

01:36:04.423 --> 01:36:05.458
Damn.

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.163
You talked to Tyrik?

01:36:09.762 --> 01:36:10.730
Nah.

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.567
Everything's just about business
for him.

01:36:14.367 --> 01:36:17.070
Lita died and he's still
on the streets makin' moves.

01:36:17.302 --> 01:36:19.340
Yeah. I'm not like him.
I just can't do it anymore.

01:36:21.573 --> 01:36:24.108
- You goin' back to school?
- I have enough credits

01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:25.912
where I don't have
to go this semester

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:28.780
- and I can still graduate.
- But how you doin' financially?

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:31.415
His mama took everything.
We only had

01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:33.284
a few thousand dollars
in our bank account.

01:36:33.286 --> 01:36:35.419
But you can't hide
that kind of money in the bank.

01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:36.923
Well. he never said anything
to me about it.

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:41.695
This'll hold you
for a little bit.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:43.096
You don't have to do that.

01:36:43.496 --> 01:36:44.597
Look. I'm good.

01:36:44.797 --> 01:36:46.198
If you ever need somethin'.

01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:47.668
all you gotta do
is holla. a'ight?

01:36:48.935 --> 01:36:49.937
Thank you.

01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:51.905
So. I gotta go.

01:37:05.418 --> 01:37:07.253
Thank you for checkin' on me.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:08.922
You're welcome. Gena.

01:37:10.789 --> 01:37:12.827
You think that maybe you wanna
come stay with me?

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.462
You should probably go. Rasun.

01:37:16.496 --> 01:37:17.664
Okay.

01:37:39.085 --> 01:37:41.188
I see you ain't moved
since we left here.

01:37:42.855 --> 01:37:43.990
How was church?

01:37:45.257 --> 01:37:47.192
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:49.196
- You tell him I said what's up?
- Yes.

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:52.266
and he told me to tell you
to get yo' shit together.

01:37:58.805 --> 01:37:59.873
Gena. you are trippin'.

01:38:01.841 --> 01:38:04.577
- What is this?
- It came from your old house.

01:38:06.712 --> 01:38:09.347
- When did this come?
- I don't know. who's it from?

01:38:09.349 --> 01:38:10.851
My college professor.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.901
That's it. times up. people.
Pens down.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.403
Make sure all your information
is on your sheet.

01:38:30.837 --> 01:38:31.805
and I'll see you tomorrow.

01:38:38.011 --> 01:38:39.146
Professor Busby.

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:42.914
Gena. we've been tryin'
to reach you.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.583
I know. I'm sorry.
I've had family issues.

01:38:45.585 --> 01:38:47.087
but I just got the letter.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.654
It's not too late is it?

01:38:48.854 --> 01:38:49.789
Well. you placed second.

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.391
I could probably place
a phone call.

01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:54.060
Could you. please?
I would really appreciate it.

01:38:54.493 --> 01:38:55.628
Should I?

01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:00.701
Listen. Gena...

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:03.637
in light
of your recent disappearances.

01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:06.103
your absences.
I wouldn't be comfortable

01:39:06.105 --> 01:39:07.974
making that call
unless I was absolutely sure

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:11.175
- that you were serious.
- I am. I'm serious.

01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:13.445
You do understand
this is an unpaid internship

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.280
and you'd have
to support yourself

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.615
in New York for a year?

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.918
I understand. I can do it.

01:39:23.088 --> 01:39:24.158
Okay.

01:43:40.345 --> 01:43:43.349
Oh. baby!

01:43:44.216 --> 01:43:45.551
Oh. precious.

01:43:47.653 --> 01:43:48.721
Mm. mm. mm.

01:43:49.154 --> 01:43:51.724
- Why don't you come with me?
- And give up all this?

01:43:53.626 --> 01:43:56.293
My heart and soul is in Philly.

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:59.496
But you been takin' care of
everybody else your whole life.

01:43:59.498 --> 01:44:02.568
Why don't you come let me
take care of you for a while.

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.738
You worried
about bein' on your own?

01:44:06.338 --> 01:44:08.641
I don't know.
I ain't never done it.

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:10.744
Gena. I raised a...

01:44:11.577 --> 01:44:12.546
a strong woman.

01:44:14.113 --> 01:44:15.414
You gon' be just fine.

01:44:19.552 --> 01:44:20.621
You're right.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.822
This is for you. Gah-Git.

01:44:24.222 --> 01:44:26.326
Oh. baby.

01:44:26.759 --> 01:44:28.960
Oh my... No. baby.

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:30.831
- No. Gah-Git you need this.
- God got me...

01:44:31.863 --> 01:44:33.099
and God got you.

01:44:34.533 --> 01:44:35.636
We gon' be fine...

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.604
just fine.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.675
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:44:44.476 --> 01:44:46.613
Precious.

01:44:47.913 --> 01:44:49.248
Okay. go on now.

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:01.328
Philly girls.

01:45:10.403 --> 01:45:13.405
The streets can make you
and the streets can break you.

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.776
To those caught in the trap
of temporary pleasures.

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.310
let me tell you this.

01:45:18.911 --> 01:45:21.780
