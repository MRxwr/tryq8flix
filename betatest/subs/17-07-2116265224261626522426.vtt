<i>Así.</i>

67
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:25.169
That's a cowboy.

68
00:07:41.989 --> 00:07:44.025
Let's get back to work.
Come on.

69
00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:45.895
Come on!

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:51.030
Let's get back to work.

72
00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:04.735
Rosa?

73
00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:06.749
<i>Sí.</i>

74
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.155
How are you doing?

75
00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:09.406
Okay. more or less.

76
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:13.535
Just remember it's
1 kg for 2.2 lbs.

77
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:16.396
Okay?

78
00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:17.873
I'm here for anything you need.

79
00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.828
- Right?
- Right.

80
00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:23.731
- Darius.
- How's she doing?

81
00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:25.895
You know. second week
in the country.

82
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.562
The girl's terrified.

83
00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:29.740
She lucky she got you
to walk her through this.

84
00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:33.373
She is. and you're lucky
you have me to run this place.

85
00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:34.906
I know I am.

86
00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:37.877
The Purge doesn't
release anger.

87
00:08:38.013 --> 00:08:40.311
It increases anger.
It's a virus.

88
00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:43.112
It's an American-born virus
of hate and rage.

89
00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:45.052
and it's injected
with a bullet.

90
00:08:45.187 --> 00:08:48.417
and it's spreading.
it's growing. it's mutating.

91
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.281
Turn that off. Adela. Please.

92
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.458
The Purge is coming.

93
00:08:59.764 --> 00:09:01.630
Mmm.

94
00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:03.366
Mm-hmm.

95
00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:10.646
This...

96
00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:12.942
reminds me
of your mother's house.

97
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.141
You should give it to Darius
so he can make real Mexican food.

98
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.852
Not those terrible burritos.

99
00:09:20.118 --> 00:09:23.021
Juan. please. where are we?

100
00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:25.524
You need to practice
your English.

101
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.592
When in Rome.

102
00:09:27.727 --> 00:09:29.496
When in America.

103
00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:32.265
Just do it for me.

104
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:34.433
Please.

105
00:09:34.568 --> 00:09:38.775
The Tucker family would really
appreciate that. believe me.

106
00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:42.176
Now that your wife is pregnant.

107
00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.175
if you want any extra help.
you're welcome to come by.

108
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:46.976
We could all
lock down together.

109
00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:49.785
Oh. I hate the damn Purge.

110
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.151
It's hard to be social
on that night.

111
00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:54.184
- But thank you for the invite.
- Anytime.

112
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.025
- Baby. that smells so good.
- Mm.

113
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.658
I'm going to the kitchen.
Y'all need anything?

114
00:09:58.793 --> 00:09:59.861
You want another beer?

115
00:09:59.997 --> 00:10:01.862
- Yeah. yeah. I'll take one.
- Another beer.

116
00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:03.695
- Thank you.
- Thank you. honey.

117
00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:07.965
I don't know. I just feel like

118
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.499
a goddamn Hoover these days.

119
00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:13.034
Everything in my line of sight
just gets consumed.

120
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.373
Even things I hate.

121
00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.309
You know. Anna's been
cooking for us

122
00:10:18.444 --> 00:10:21.644
the most amazing Mexican food.
am I right?

123
00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:24.248
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It's so good but so fattening.

124
00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:28.723
- I put on five pounds.
- No. you have not.

125
00:10:28.858 --> 00:10:30.028
Mm-hmm.

126
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.196
You know...

127
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.889
Anna has a sister.

128
00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:35.326
Also a nanny.

129
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:37.394
- You should meet her.
- Yeah. we're all right.

130
00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:40.463
What. baby?

131
00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:43.536
We don't need
to meet her sister.

132
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:44.703
We're fine.

133
00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:47.274
Thank you. though.

134
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.437
Baby. Emily's just trying to be
nice and help out. right?

135
00:10:49.572 --> 00:10:51.243
So you're being
a little bit rude.

136
00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:54.512
Oh. was I?

137
00:10:56.147 --> 00:10:57.583
My apologies. Emily.

138
00:10:57.719 --> 00:10:59.680
Oh. it's fine.

139
00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:02.090
It's just it's really hard
to find good help.

140
00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:04.729
- and Anna's sister's a sweetheart.
- Yeah.

141
00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:07.061
We don't need to meet
Anna's sister. Emily.

142
00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:10.732
I don't even know
if I want our kids

143
00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:13.399
speaking Spanish in this house.

144
00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:17.841
Now. thank you for the offer.
but. no. thank you.

145
00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:21.438
Okay. then.

146
00:11:27.217 --> 00:11:29.620
This is your learn English app.

- Past tense sentences.
- Who would've thought

149
00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:35.657
I would be in Texas?

150
00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:38.462
Who would've. who would've...

151
00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.590
I would be in Texas... Texas?

152
00:11:41.725 --> 00:11:44.495
Who would've thought
I would be in Texas?

153
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:49.070
Who would have
thought I would be in Texas?

154
00:11:50.104 --> 00:11:52.337
Who... who would have thought

155
00:11:52.472 --> 00:11:54.679
I would be in Texas?

156
00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:57.716
I was just visiting
friends in Texas.

157
00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:02.115
Repeat after me.

158
00:12:02.251 --> 00:12:05.416
I was just visiting friends
in Texas.

159
00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:29.011
Hey. Juan.

160
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.679
Kirk tells me that
you were late this morning.

161
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:34.482
I'm never late. sir.

162
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:37.448
You're never late?

163
00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:41.288
Hey. Kirk. Juan here
says you're lying.

164
00:12:41.423 --> 00:12:43.960
Juan's a free man.
He can say whatever he wants.

165
00:12:46.327 --> 00:12:47.492
You know. Juan.
you show up late again.

166
00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:49.398
I'm gonna have to fire you.
That's the rules.

167
00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.462
Yes. sir.

168
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.663
Hey. you know
what somebody else told me?

169
00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:57.204
That he found your lariat
just laying

170
00:12:57.339 --> 00:12:58.704
in the front of the stable
on the ground.

171
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.506
Is that true?

172
00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:02.176
No. sir.

173
00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:04.868
It's called "La Riata."

174
00:13:12.616 --> 00:13:16.419
T.T.. your Purge
protection bonus.

175
00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:18.856
- Thank you. Mr. Tucker.
- Stay safe.

176
00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:19.988
Thank you. sir.

177
00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:21.525
Kirk.

178
00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:36.540
You're doing a good job. Juan.

179
00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:40.241
My son's a hair rattled
'cause of yesterday.

180
00:13:40.377 --> 00:13:41.912
Don't take offense.

181
00:13:42.047 --> 00:13:43.916
Thank you. sir.

182
00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:46.055
I really appreciate that.

183
00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:51.357
Can I be honest. Mr. Tucker?

184
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.657
Please do.

185
00:13:56.528 --> 00:13:59.127
Your son doesn't like me
because...

186
00:13:59.262 --> 00:14:01.103
I'm Mexican.

187
00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:05.141
And I think Dylan believes

188
00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:09.109
a cowboy shouldn't be
from <i>México</i> or...

189
00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:12.443
Argentina
or from somewhere else.

190
00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:14.281
I know that a lot of people
feel that way.

191
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:16.285
but I'm not sure
that's the case with Dylan.

192
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:19.218
Uh. he's a very proud man.
You one-upped him yesterday.

193
00:14:19.354 --> 00:14:21.354
You're a damn fine cowboy.
Juan.

194
00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:24.555
I don't know. sir.

195
00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:30.995
Well...

196
00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:32.897
I don't know either.

197
00:14:33.032 --> 00:14:34.565
I just...

198
00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.504
I always taught my son
to be a proud American.

199
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.212
but maybe I didn't really
teach him what that meant.

200
00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:44.447
I don't even know if I know
what that means anymore.

201
00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:46.816
proud American.

202
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:48.914
World's changing all around us.

203
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.252
At each other's throats.

204
00:14:53.723 --> 00:14:55.652
Confusing times.

205
00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:01.724
I want to give you...

206
00:15:03.793 --> 00:15:07.070
...the goddamn
Purge protection bonus.

207
00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:10.238
Stay safe.

208
00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:13.241
Thank you.

209
00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:28.786
That money's nothing
but a way for these people

210
00:15:28.922 --> 00:15:31.959
to keep us alive so they can
continue using our slave labor.

211
00:15:32.095 --> 00:15:33.855
We're nothing more than that.

212
00:15:35.498 --> 00:15:37.327
I know what I'm-a use
my money for. though.

213
00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:39.465
and it's not for protection.

214
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:47.698
Crazy man.

215
00:15:52.944 --> 00:15:54.816
<i>We are now just one hour away</i>

216
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:56.714
<i>from the annual Purge.</i>

217
00:15:56.849 --> 00:15:59.555
<i>As always.
home is the best place to be.</i>

218
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.916
<i>and we sure hope you're not
out there stuck in traffic.</i>

219
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:04.689
<i>We strongly advise you
to get yourself</i>

220
00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:07.154
<i>and those you care about
to a safe place.</i>

221
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.430
<i>So lock those doors.
set those security systems.</i>

222
00:16:10.565 --> 00:16:13.368
<i>and stay inside
for the next 12 hours.</i>

223
00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:15.871
<i>And for those of you
who are partaking.</i>

224
00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:18.501
<i>may God be with you all.</i>

225
00:16:33.483 --> 00:16:35.092
It's one hour.

226
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.656
T.T. said he would be here
right now.

227
00:16:42.892 --> 00:16:45.201
- He's coming.
- Ay.

228
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:22.339
Spring is
coming. and so is the Purge.

229
00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.241
I've decided that I don't want
to be called Granddaddy...

230
00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.835
We spoke with
tribal leader Chiago Harjo

231
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.607
- earlier today.
- You had your chance.

232
00:17:27.743 --> 00:17:29.507
Well. what the hell
do you want to be called. Dad?

233
00:17:29.643 --> 00:17:30.844
I want to be called
Grandfather.

234
00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:36.451
See. my people have been
watching from the sidelines.

235
00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:38.990
and we see that America's
reached a boiling point.

236
00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:41.959
Hatred like that
can't be contained.

237
00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.293
You'll burn your cities
to the ground.

238
00:17:49.826 --> 00:17:51.968
I'm gonna lock down now. y'all.

239
00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.771
- Okay.
- Yeah.

240
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.954
We're almost there. guys.

241
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.189
We're almost there.

242
00:19:22.562 --> 00:19:24.518
Captain.

243
00:19:24.653 --> 00:19:26.197
Good to see you.

244
00:19:28.364 --> 00:19:29.967
Other half when the job's done?

245
00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.569
I know you're good for it. T.T.

246
00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:32.961
All right.

247
00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:44.106
Make
your way inside. Keep moving.

248
00:19:44.241 --> 00:19:47.548
We will not be opening
our doors until 7:00 tomorrow

249
00:19:47.683 --> 00:19:49.077
when the Purge is over.

250
00:19:49.398 --> 00:19:51.233
Are you sure we are
gonna be safe here?

251
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.610
Of course. Trust me.

252
00:19:56.238 --> 00:19:58.240
We're not gonna die
on the first one. right?

253
00:19:58.282 --> 00:19:59.783
Don't jinx it.

254
00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:08.709
Get comfortable.
We'll be here for the next 12 hours.

255
00:20:10.404 --> 00:20:12.336
Make yourself at home.

256
00:20:21.244 --> 00:20:22.446
Okay. hold on.
hold on. hold on.

257
00:20:22.582 --> 00:20:23.448
Look at this.

258
00:20:23.584 --> 00:20:25.414
Good.

259
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:27.016
Wait. what?

260
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:30.087
- Dang.
- What? How did you know how to do that?

261
00:20:34.157 --> 00:20:35.594
The national holiday
celebrating

262
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.593
our American freedom
is finally back.

263
00:20:38.728 --> 00:20:40.165
Good night. Texas.

264
00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:41.795
and good luck.

265
00:20:44.636 --> 00:20:46.001
It's starting. y'all.

266
00:20:46.136 --> 00:20:48.135
This is not a test.

267
00:20:48.271 --> 00:20:50.645
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System

268
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.809
announcing the commencement
of the annual Purge

269
00:20:52.945 --> 00:20:55.253
sanctioned by
the U.S. government.

270
00:20:55.756 --> 00:21:00.052
Weapons of Class 4 and lower have been
authorized for use during the Purge.

271
00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.429
All other weapons
are restricted.

272
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.973
Government officials
of ranking 10...

273
00:21:05.025 --> 00:21:06.361
...have been granted immunity

274
00:21:06.497 --> 00:21:09.063
from the Purge
and shall not be harmed.

275
00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:10.564
Commencing at the siren.

276
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.095
any and all crime.
including murder...

277
00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:15.817
...will be legal for
12 continuous hours.

278
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:19.655
Police. fire.
and emergency medical services

279
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.698
will be unavailable
until tomorrow morning...

280
00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:24.808
...at 7:00 a.m.
when the Purge concludes.

281
00:21:24.943 --> 00:21:26.544
Blessed be
our New Founding Fathers

282
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.017
and America. a nation reborn.

283
00:21:29.153 --> 00:21:30.886
May God be with you all.

284
00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:51.102
Hmm.

285
00:21:51.238 --> 00:21:53.233
Well...

286
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.619
Never! Never again!

287
00:22:43.864 --> 00:22:45.199
This reminds me of home. Adela.

288
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:48.577
This is home now.

289
00:22:50.204 --> 00:22:51.538
You know what I mean.

290
00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:54.833
Maybe you're right.

291
00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:58.462
Maybe we have to forget
where we came from.

292
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:01.173
And accept where we are.

293
00:23:02.211 --> 00:23:03.909
When in America.

294
00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:05.344
Like you said.

295
00:23:06.746 --> 00:23:09.112
No. that's not what I meant.

296
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:11.814
What did you mean. then?

297
00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:14.790
That America is everything.

298
00:23:16.188 --> 00:23:17.731
What the hell are
you talking about. Adela?

299
00:23:18.053 --> 00:23:20.287
America is <i>México.</i>

300
00:23:20.422 --> 00:23:23.258
America is Africa.
America is Italia.

301
00:23:23.393 --> 00:23:27.004
We can take it all.
we can learn it all.

302
00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.638
and we can embrace it.

303
00:23:31.605 --> 00:23:33.807
You really believe that?

304
00:23:34.876 --> 00:23:36.843
That's what I choose
to believe.

305
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.992
You're so crazy.

306
00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:09.540
Stupid.

307
00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:43.802
- Baby.
- Jesus.

308
00:25:43.937 --> 00:25:45.803
- What?
- Put the gun down.

309
00:25:45.938 --> 00:25:48.269
What are you doing out here?

310
00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:51.148
I thought I heard something.

311
00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:52.612
It's this damn night.

312
00:25:52.747 --> 00:25:55.249
Dylan Tucker. cut the shit.

313
00:25:55.384 --> 00:25:56.679
Fuck the Purge.

314
00:25:56.815 --> 00:25:58.480
Fuck the NFFA.

315
00:25:58.615 --> 00:26:01.081
They don't get to dictate
how we live our life.

316
00:26:01.217 --> 00:26:03.255
This is our country. okay?

317
00:26:03.391 --> 00:26:07.660
And we can choose to bring
a baby into a world of love.

318
00:26:07.795 --> 00:26:09.430
Why are you laughing at me?

319
00:26:09.566 --> 00:26:11.862
- Damn. honey.
- What?

320
00:26:11.998 --> 00:26:14.000
You just kind of turned me on.

321
00:26:29.618 --> 00:26:30.717
Hurry up!

322
00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:50.070
Ma'am. you should
go back inside.

323
00:26:50.205 --> 00:26:52.905
Just need some air. you know.
just for a moment.

324
00:26:56.205 --> 00:26:57.706
It's my first Purge.

325
00:26:57.842 --> 00:27:00.242
- Is it what you expected?
- Well. there's parts of <i>México</i>

326
00:27:00.378 --> 00:27:02.818
that sound like this
every night.

327
00:27:04.455 --> 00:27:06.352
We got a nice spot here.

328
00:27:06.487 --> 00:27:07.854
Quiet.

329
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.387
Good for you.
easy money for us.

330
00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:13.559
You should get back.

331
00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:18.801
Three bogeys inbound.

332
00:27:20.201 --> 00:27:21.670
Do not try to hide.

333
00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:25.368
We are the real patriots
of America.

334
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:31.079
It is our job to keep this land
free and clean.

335
00:27:31.215 --> 00:27:34.345
We will no longer tolerate foreigners

336
00:27:34.481 --> 00:27:38.618
raping and pillaging
the United States of America.

337
00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:43.692
We will find you
and disinfect you.

338
00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:48.094
America will be American
once again.

339
00:27:48.229 --> 00:27:50.030
Those guys are fucking insane.

340
00:27:52.036 --> 00:27:54.104
The purification of America

341
00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:55.963
has begun.

342
00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:03.312
What the fuck are they doing?

343
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:14.214
Help me! Help!

344
00:28:19.128 --> 00:28:20.557
- I have a clear shot.
- Don't.

345
00:28:20.693 --> 00:28:23.294
You'll start a war and put
all your people in jeopardy.

346
00:28:23.429 --> 00:28:25.294
We will not stop until

347
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.565
our great nation
has been fully cleansed.

348
00:28:28.701 --> 00:28:33.234
We will no longer tolerate
foreigners raping and pillaging

349
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.103
the United States of America.

350
00:28:36.239 --> 00:28:38.307
Do not try to hide.

351
00:28:38.442 --> 00:28:42.776
We will find you
and disinfect you.

352
00:28:42.911 --> 00:28:47.153
America will be
American once again.

353
00:28:50.055 --> 00:28:51.454
Hey.

354
00:28:52.954 --> 00:28:55.557
Where'd you learn
to handle a weapon like that?

355
00:29:50.448 --> 00:29:52.655
Oh. my God.

356
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.683
It's over.

357
00:30:04.362 --> 00:30:07.061
We made it through.

358
00:30:08.735 --> 00:30:11.369
I see you. I see you.

359
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:24.087
Harp?
Come on. let's get to work.

360
00:30:27.517 --> 00:30:29.926
- Harper.
- Sis. come on. let's go.

361
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:38.200
The day after the Purge
should be a holiday.

362
00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.469
No?

363
00:30:39.605 --> 00:30:41.436
<i>¿Qué es un holiday?</i>

364
00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:43.533
Holiday? Mm.

365
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.262
It's a holy day. a festive day.

366
00:30:47.503 --> 00:30:49.044
Another day. another dollar.

367
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.885
Take it easy.

368
00:30:50.943 --> 00:30:52.607
<i>Mira.</i>

369
00:30:58.724 --> 00:31:00.385
Ah. <i>chingado.</i>

370
00:31:28.648 --> 00:31:30.854
...busy. jubilant street.

371
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.121
sanitation crews
are out in full force

372
00:31:33.256 --> 00:31:35.817
with the macabre task
of disinfecting streets

373
00:31:35.952 --> 00:31:38.292
and cleaning corpses
from sidewalks and roadways.

374
00:31:38.427 --> 00:31:41.593
The Purge is over.
and now the cleanup has begun.

375
00:31:41.729 --> 00:31:44.593
All over the state. violent
incidents ended hours ago...

376
00:31:44.728 --> 00:31:46.700
Fake news!

377
00:32:17.803 --> 00:32:19.860
Where is everybody?

378
00:33:06.577 --> 00:33:08.381

You can't do this today!

387

The Purge is over!

388
00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.949
No. no.

389
00:34:49.085 --> 00:34:50.543
This is the Forever Purge.

390
00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:51.554

Please!

398

You're gonna fucking die!
You're all gonna die!

Boss!

404

Are you okay?

405
00:35:35.062 --> 00:35:36.529
Boss.

406
00:35:39.201 --> 00:35:41.200
- You okay?
- Yes.

407
00:35:41.336 --> 00:35:42.737
Come here.

408
00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:45.206
- You all right?
- Yes.

409
00:35:49.506 --> 00:35:51.372
Fuck you!

00:35:51.507 --> 00:35:53.348
Fuck you!

411

Go! Darius. go!

412
00:36:09.229 --> 00:36:10.796
Drop your weapon!

413
00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:13.533
- On your knees. Drop it.
- We didn't do anything.

414
00:36:13.668 --> 00:36:14.731
- Get on your knees.
- Get on your knees.

415
00:36:14.867 --> 00:36:16.900
- They attacked us!
- We didn't do anything.

416
00:36:17.035 --> 00:36:18.765
The Purge is over. lady.
What the hell are you doing?

417
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:21.443
Sir. this is a mistake!

418
00:36:21.578 --> 00:36:23.107
- Wait. please!
- We didn't do anything wrong!

419
00:36:23.243 --> 00:36:24.109
Listen to me.

420
00:36:24.244 --> 00:36:26.579
Listen to us. sir!

421
00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:32.755
It's so quiet.

422
00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.719
Where is everyone?

423
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:40.117
Look over there.

424
00:36:40.361 --> 00:36:41.389
Oh. come on.

425
00:36:41.525 --> 00:36:43.260
Stop the car.

426
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.292
Let's get them before
they go too far.

427
00:36:55.407 --> 00:36:57.247
Well. well. well.

428
00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:04.313
Look at this.

429
00:37:14.562 --> 00:37:16.662
This feels like
fucking Christmas.

430
00:37:17.729 --> 00:37:19.764
Any of y'all get me a present?

431
00:37:21.264 --> 00:37:24.631
Caleb. I know you did.
and let me tell you. sir...

432
00:37:24.767 --> 00:37:27.475
I spent your money well.

433
00:37:30.074 --> 00:37:31.807
Today's your day
of reckoning. cowboy.

434
00:37:33.346 --> 00:37:36.680
You become me

435
00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:40.050
and I become you. huh?

436
00:37:40.186 --> 00:37:43.184
The old switcheroo is happening
on every ranch around here.

437
00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:46.725
You and all your rich-ass
neighbors will find out

438
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.457
what it's like to be
penniless and powerless.

439
00:37:49.593 --> 00:37:50.795
To be like us!

440
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.894
These rich motherfuckers
can't hide

441
00:37:54.029 --> 00:37:55.567
behind their steel walls
no more.

442
00:37:55.703 --> 00:37:58.732
This is the way
things are now. boys!

443
00:37:58.867 --> 00:38:00.507
This Purge is forever!

444
00:38:00.643 --> 00:38:01.701
Yeah.

445
00:38:01.837 --> 00:38:03.538
This is the real Purge.

446
00:38:03.673 --> 00:38:05.176
The eternal Purge.

447
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:07.477
Ever After!

448
00:38:07.613 --> 00:38:09.248
Ever After!

449
00:38:11.083 --> 00:38:11.792
It came from the house.

450
00:38:12.668 --> 00:38:13.293
Run.

451
00:38:14.049 --> 00:38:16.183
<i>Ay. cabrón.</i>

452
00:38:16.318 --> 00:38:18.854
I'm gonna give you a chance

453
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.691
to save your family.
Dylan Tucker.

454
00:38:20.827 --> 00:38:24.100
one by one.
but you'll have to pay.

455
00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:26.230
Let's start with

456
00:38:26.365 --> 00:38:29.236
eeny. meeny.

457
00:38:29.372 --> 00:38:30.767
miny. ho!

458
00:38:30.903 --> 00:38:32.267
How much would you give
for her. Dylan?

459
00:38:32.403 --> 00:38:34.670
How much would you give to
stop me from putting a bullet

460
00:38:34.805 --> 00:38:36.905
in your baby sister's head?

461
00:38:37.041 --> 00:38:39.745
Let's say ten bucks.
and she lives.

462
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.712
Oh. that seems like
a fair market price

463
00:38:41.848 --> 00:38:43.351
for this broke-down.
useless woman.

464
00:38:43.486 --> 00:38:45.548
Let's see
how much money you got.

465
00:38:45.684 --> 00:38:47.422
Aw. shit. Dylan! I forgot.

466
00:38:47.557 --> 00:38:50.360
You're me now.
which means you're broke.

467
00:38:51.727 --> 00:38:53.759
You have no money.
That sucks. doesn't it?

468
00:38:54.825 --> 00:38:58.263
See. Dylan. without money.

469
00:38:58.398 --> 00:39:00.261
you have no power.

470
00:39:00.397 --> 00:39:03.804
Without money. you can't save
your own little sister.

471
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.370
and she will die because of it.

472
00:39:06.506 --> 00:39:09.269
But how's that feel?

473
00:39:10.345 --> 00:39:11.876
How's that feel. Dylan?

474
00:39:14.575 --> 00:39:17.046
Feels like shit. doesn't it?

475
00:39:18.054 --> 00:39:19.415
That's my life.

476
00:39:19.551 --> 00:39:20.483
It's our life.

477
00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:22.419
That's how we feel.

478
00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:24.954
That's how we have felt

479
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.925
every day
since the day we were born!

480
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.389
And I want you to fucking feel
that fucking pain

481
00:39:29.524 --> 00:39:31.126
in your fucking stomach. Dylan!

482
00:39:31.261 --> 00:39:32.332
Goddamn it.
it looks like the old man's

483
00:39:32.467 --> 00:39:33.733
got something to say! What?!

484
00:39:33.868 --> 00:39:35.628
Damn it! You're right. Kirk!
You're right!

485
00:39:35.763 --> 00:39:37.405
- You're right!
- I don't give a fuck if you think I'm right!

486
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.905
You're talking about
life in America.

487
00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.842
the way the rich get rich
off the backs of the poor.

488
00:39:42.977 --> 00:39:46.642
the way it's been
ever since we robbed this land

489
00:39:46.778 --> 00:39:49.116
from the Native Americans.

490
00:39:49.252 --> 00:39:51.786
But you got no right

491
00:39:51.921 --> 00:39:56.421
to complain about the
very system you're supporting

492
00:39:56.556 --> 00:39:57.656
by picking up that gun

493
00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.159
and sanctioning
the goddamn Purge...

494
00:39:59.294 --> 00:40:01.022
We need more guns.

495
00:40:01.158 --> 00:40:02.663
...which is all about money.

496
00:40:05.933 --> 00:40:09.000
You know who created
the Purge. don't ya?

497
00:40:09.135 --> 00:40:14.376
A bunch of fat. rich
businessmen in Washington. D.C.

498
00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:17.111
So what would
that make you. Kirk?

499
00:40:17.247 --> 00:40:19.381
What would it make you?

500
00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:23.348
Huh? That would make you
their lackey

501
00:40:23.484 --> 00:40:26.116
and a goddamn hypocrite.

502
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:29.620
They expect you to go out there
and do their violence.

503
00:40:29.755 --> 00:40:31.327
so they can play more golf.

504
00:40:31.463 --> 00:40:32.660
They've never even been
in a fistfight.

505
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:35.102
You take the guys on the left.
and I'll take the right.

506
00:40:36.626 --> 00:40:38.727
So...

507
00:40:38.862 --> 00:40:41.630
from my family to you.

508
00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:43.833
go fuck yourself.

509
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.677
<i>Puto.</i>

510
00:40:54.979 --> 00:40:56.684
Take cover!

511
00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.183
We need backup!

512
00:41:00.318 --> 00:41:02.624
Copy that. We're on our way.

513
00:41:02.963 --> 00:41:04.631
Untie them. I'll cover you!

514
00:41:12.398 --> 00:41:14.101
Harper.

515
00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:16.666
What the fuck?!

516
00:41:16.801 --> 00:41:17.836
What the fuck. Kirk?!

517
00:41:17.972 --> 00:41:19.832
- Dad?
- The Purge is over. <i>cabrón!</i>

518
00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:21.544
Ever After.

519
00:41:28.587 --> 00:41:30.516
The Purge is over. man!

520
00:41:33.688 --> 00:41:35.618
<i>Cuidado.</i> They're coming.

521
00:41:39.991 --> 00:41:41.394
You need to get up here.

522
00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.695
- Go!
- Let's go!

523
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:44.199
You need to get your family!

524
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.727
Harper! Come on!

525
00:41:45.862 --> 00:41:47.432
Harper! Let's go.

526
00:41:47.568 --> 00:41:49.436
Let's go. let's go.

527
00:41:49.571 --> 00:41:51.233
- Come on!
- Come on.

528
00:41:54.002 --> 00:41:55.569
Come on.

529
00:41:55.705 --> 00:41:57.338
Come in.

530
00:42:05.249 --> 00:42:06.619
10-13. we have

531
00:42:06.754 --> 00:42:08.985
three more incidences reported.

532
00:42:09.121 --> 00:42:10.718
Return to precinct.

533
00:42:10.853 --> 00:42:11.928
Copy that.

534
00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:13.152
This is insane.

535
00:42:13.287 --> 00:42:15.290
People not hear the sirens?

536
00:42:15.426 --> 00:42:17.125
- A little busier than last year. huh?
- Yeah.

537
00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.332
I shouldn't even be here.

538
00:42:19.468 --> 00:42:21.197
I did nothing wrong.

539
00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:24.671
There's no such thing
as crime anymore.

540
00:42:27.409 --> 00:42:29.135
Let me fucking go!

541
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.945
Would you shut the fuck up?

542
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:31.981
Make me.

543
00:42:34.483 --> 00:42:35.985
What's going on. Darius?

544
00:42:36.121 --> 00:42:38.017
I don't know.

545
00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:43.252
Adela.

546
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.857
Call me back. please!

547
00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:47.776
No luck?

548
00:42:48.491 --> 00:42:50.022
All right.
let me check the radio.

549
00:42:50.158 --> 00:42:51.257
Maybe there's some news.

550
00:42:51.392 --> 00:42:53.168
People are still purging

551
00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:54.628
all across the country.

552
00:42:54.764 --> 00:42:56.871
"Ever After Purge" is popping
up all over social media.

553
00:42:57.006 --> 00:42:58.869
continuous purging dubbed
the "Forever Purge."

554
00:42:59.004 --> 00:43:00.165
Where the hell are we gonna go?

555
00:43:00.301 --> 00:43:02.302
We'll find somewhere safe.

556
00:43:02.438 --> 00:43:03.636
First we help Juan
find his wife.

557
00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:05.876
then we find somewhere safe.

558
00:43:06.012 --> 00:43:07.140
Stay inside your homes.

559
00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:09.041
Rosa?

560
00:43:09.131 --> 00:43:09.882
What happened?

561
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:11.967
A police van?

562
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.052
Why the...

563
00:43:14.928 --> 00:43:15.688
Take care of yourself. Rosa.

564
00:43:15.753 --> 00:43:16.890
<i>Gracias.</i>

565
00:43:17.026 --> 00:43:18.288
...they will take
action to stop it.

566
00:43:18.424 --> 00:43:20.956
- But still. no one knows...
- I know where she is.

567
00:43:21.092 --> 00:43:22.289
...who defined this movement.

568
00:43:26.196 --> 00:43:29.430
Ever After. Ever After.

569
00:43:30.499 --> 00:43:32.866
This is the first...

570
00:43:33.002 --> 00:43:35.539
real... Purge.

571
00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:40.040
It's never gonna stop.

572
00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:45.153
Let me fucking go!

573
00:44:07.507 --> 00:44:09.771
Shit.

574
00:44:09.907 --> 00:44:11.747
It's blocked.

575
00:44:15.647 --> 00:44:17.245
Hold on.

576
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.386
The station is
just a few blocks away.

577
00:44:19.522 --> 00:44:21.823
I hope she'll be there.

578
00:44:22.855 --> 00:44:25.222
We can walk from here.

579
00:44:34.262 --> 00:44:35.296
You go get your wife.

580
00:44:35.432 --> 00:44:36.562
We'll stay here
and protect the truck.

581
00:44:36.698 --> 00:44:39.034
But you move fast.
It's not safe here.

582
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.472
You don't need to wait for us.

583
00:44:40.607 --> 00:44:41.777
Yes. we do.

584
00:44:43.744 --> 00:44:45.407
I'm coming with you.

585
00:44:46.715 --> 00:44:48.307
You don't have to do that.

586
00:44:48.443 --> 00:44:51.714
No. you don't have to do that.

587
00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:53.855
Yeah. I do.

588
00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:56.726
They saved our lives.

589
00:44:58.892 --> 00:45:00.721
We'll be right here. Now go.

590
00:45:00.857 --> 00:45:02.699
Come on.

591
00:45:14.403 --> 00:45:16.244
I'll take the back.

592
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.180
Come on. guys.

593
00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.145
This side.

594
00:45:25.281 --> 00:45:26.617
<i>Verga.</i>

595
00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:38.966
That is a .30-06.

596
00:45:42.635 --> 00:45:44.536
.30-30.

597
00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:46.308
Yeah. yeah.

598
00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:49.708
AR-15.

599
00:45:49.843 --> 00:45:52.214
Listen to that rhythm.

600
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.349
That is a Glock.

601
00:45:58.449 --> 00:46:00.521
Listen to that bass.

602
00:46:00.656 --> 00:46:02.323
Double-barrel shotgun.

603
00:46:03.755 --> 00:46:05.795
AK-47.

604
00:46:10.595 --> 00:46:13.994
Homegrown music from
the heartland right there.

605
00:46:17.138 --> 00:46:19.869
That is American music.
motherfucker.

606
00:46:23.043 --> 00:46:24.810
Damn!

607
00:46:24.946 --> 00:46:26.678
Oh!

608
00:46:26.814 --> 00:46:29.648
Strike up the band!

609
00:46:29.784 --> 00:46:32.512
The symphony sings!

610
00:46:32.648 --> 00:46:34.056
Hold on! We're under attack!

611
00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:37.057
Dispatch!

612
00:46:37.192 --> 00:46:38.822
We're outside the precinct!
Request backup!

613
00:46:38.957 --> 00:46:40.225
Boom. boom. boom!

614
00:47:13.693 --> 00:47:14.724
What?

615
00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:16.758
Okay.

616
00:47:16.894 --> 00:47:18.598
Honey...

617
00:47:18.734 --> 00:47:20.593
I need you to take this.

618
00:47:20.729 --> 00:47:22.434
Don't ask any questions.
not right now.

619
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.101
I'm gonna get out the car.
I need you to lock the door.

620
00:47:24.236 --> 00:47:26.099
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

621
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.593
Open up. bitch.

622
00:49:03.806 --> 00:49:05.708
Baby!

623
00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:07.603
No!

624
00:49:26.522 --> 00:49:28.729
- Yeah!
- Cover me!

625
00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:32.067
Go. go. go! Forever Purge!

626
00:49:36.404 --> 00:49:38.000
You're fucking dead. <i>puta!</i>

627
00:49:41.315 --> 00:49:42.524
Fucking pig!

628
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.875
Get...

629
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.180
Get off me!

630
00:49:49.081 --> 00:49:50.079
You're a pig!

631
00:49:50.215 --> 00:49:52.681
Get the fuck off of me!

632
00:49:53.987 --> 00:49:55.751
Stop fighting it!

633
00:49:56.588 --> 00:49:59.120
Get the fuck off of me!

634
00:50:08.967 --> 00:50:09.968
Fucking pig!

635
00:50:10.344 --> 00:50:11.678
You're a pig!

636
00:50:11.939 --> 00:50:12.807
Motherfucker!

637
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.577
Help me!

638
00:50:16.712 --> 00:50:18.674
Fucking pig!

639
00:50:20.408 --> 00:50:21.875
Kill him!

640
00:50:41.697 --> 00:50:42.834
- Move.
- Forever Purge!

641
00:50:42.969 --> 00:50:44.436
Open it up!

642
00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:46.399
- Get out of the way!
- Ever After!

643
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.427
Now these assholes
are really pissing me off.

644
00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:54.809
What was that?

645
00:50:57.785 --> 00:50:58.785
Juan?

646
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.412
- Adela.
- Juan!

647
00:51:00.547 --> 00:51:02.821
Juan! Juan.

648
00:51:08.426 --> 00:51:10.726
Purge forever!

649
00:51:15.666 --> 00:51:17.165
- <i>De nada.</i>
- <i>¡Vamos!</i>

650
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.075
Over here!

651
00:51:26.674 --> 00:51:28.308
The truck is coming!

652
00:51:28.443 --> 00:51:29.514
It's Dylan!

653
00:51:29.649 --> 00:51:31.615
Truck! Get in the truck!

654
00:51:32.418 --> 00:51:34.517
- Get in!
- The truck! Come in!

655
00:51:34.653 --> 00:51:36.792
- Come on. boss.
- No! Find safety now!

656
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.360
I need to get to my family.

657
00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:40.229
- <i>¡Adela!</i>
- We'll help you.

658
00:51:40.364 --> 00:51:42.624
I'll move faster on my own.
I'll be fine. Just go.

659
00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.924
- Go. go. go. go!
- Come on!

660
00:51:44.146 --> 00:51:45.397
Adela. get on!

661
00:51:46.097 --> 00:51:46.965
Here.

662
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.133
You saved my life.

663
00:51:48.269 --> 00:51:49.165
- Thank you. Darius.
- Okay.

664
00:51:49.301 --> 00:51:50.463
Adela!

665
00:52:55.029 --> 00:52:57.239
Okay. let's grab
everything we can.

666
00:53:00.868 --> 00:53:02.772
Peanut butter?

667
00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:09.581
You found the jelly.

668
00:53:10.853 --> 00:53:12.518
This could work.

669
00:53:36.942 --> 00:53:38.439
As the violence escalates

670
00:53:38.575 --> 00:53:39.776
across the country.

671
00:53:39.911 --> 00:53:42.149
we are still trying
to get more information.

672
00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:43.349
That's right. Ruth.

673
00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:44.849
And we are still trying
to figure out

674
00:53:44.985 --> 00:53:48.519
if this Forever Purge was
coordinated or spontaneous.

675
00:53:48.655 --> 00:53:50.484
Various hashtags...
#TooMuchHate.

676
00:53:50.619 --> 00:53:52.355
#OneDayNotEnough...

677
00:53:52.491 --> 00:53:53.857
are all over the Internet.

678
00:53:53.992 --> 00:53:56.793
Fringe conspiracy groups
supporting the Forever Purge

679
00:53:56.928 --> 00:53:59.799
are calling for
a new America to emerge from...

680
00:53:59.934 --> 00:54:01.567
Adela.

681
00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:05.604
I'm scared to have my baby
in this world.

682
00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.105
Freedom to hate.
Freedom to purge.

683
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.639
Freedom to die.

684
00:54:09.775 --> 00:54:12.273
The NFFA has advised
that anyone

685
00:54:12.409 --> 00:54:15.146
displaying the Ever After flag
will be arrested immediately.

686
00:54:15.282 --> 00:54:17.878
We're in this together.

687
00:54:18.014 --> 00:54:19.617
Breaking news.

688
00:54:19.752 --> 00:54:21.818
We've just gotten word
that the NFFA

689
00:54:21.953 --> 00:54:23.986
has declared martial law
across the country.

690
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.822
U.S. military will be sent
into nearly every city

691
00:54:26.958 --> 00:54:29.021
to stop the violence
and restore peace.

692
00:54:29.157 --> 00:54:30.558
Citizens are being told
to relinq...

693
00:54:30.694 --> 00:54:31.927
<i>¿Bueno?</i>

694
00:54:33.936 --> 00:54:34.901
<i>¡Bueno!</i>

695
00:54:43.537 --> 00:54:47.180
Wait. Juan. I can't understand
what you're saying.

696
00:54:47.316 --> 00:54:49.215
Come on. The-the cell things.

697
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.986
The-the...

698
00:54:51.122 --> 00:54:53.179
- Towers?
- Yeah. the towers.

699
00:54:53.314 --> 00:54:55.051
The-the cell towers.
They are cutting them.

700
00:54:55.187 --> 00:54:58.551
Hey. We just watched that
a lot of cities have gone dark.

701
00:54:58.687 --> 00:55:00.357
Miami's gone.

702
00:55:00.492 --> 00:55:02.163
Austin is under siege.

703
00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:03.328
First responders
are overwhelmed.

704
00:55:03.464 --> 00:55:04.328
We're in a state of emergency.

705
00:55:04.464 --> 00:55:05.895
It's all over the country.

706
00:55:06.031 --> 00:55:08.729
The violence is spreading
and not stopping.

707
00:55:08.865 --> 00:55:11.369
So there's nowhere safe to go.

708
00:55:11.504 --> 00:55:13.199
There's no way to get help.

709
00:55:17.875 --> 00:55:20.178
There's that symbol again.

710
00:55:20.313 --> 00:55:21.746
This was planned.

711
00:55:25.746 --> 00:55:26.678
I got a map.

712
00:55:26.813 --> 00:55:28.119
I got ammo.

713
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.217
- What?
- Turn it up!

714
00:55:32.353 --> 00:55:34.227
Give it to me.

715
00:55:38.326 --> 00:55:40.400
All right.
Well. we need to make a move.

716
00:55:40.536 --> 00:55:42.734
They're gonna be
coming here for gas.

717
00:55:45.102 --> 00:55:48.077
- Hey. We got news. guys.
- What is it?

718
00:55:48.212 --> 00:55:50.071
I repeat. your safety...

719
00:55:50.207 --> 00:55:51.245
- Take this.
- ...cannot be guaranteed.

720
00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:52.610
All right. Listen up.

721
00:55:52.746 --> 00:55:53.807
Due to the waves of violence

722
00:55:53.942 --> 00:55:55.614
currently sweeping the U.S..

723
00:55:55.749 --> 00:55:57.913
Mexican President
León García Soler

724
00:55:58.049 --> 00:56:00.786
and Canadian Prime Minister
Sophie Poueche

725
00:56:00.921 --> 00:56:03.758
are opening their borders
for the next six hours.

726
00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:07.995
Mexico and Canada will take in
anyone from America unarmed

727
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:09.563
and give them sanctuary

728
00:56:09.698 --> 00:56:12.600
until order is reestablished
in the U.S.

729
00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:15.562
Both countries will then
close down their borders again

730
00:56:15.698 --> 00:56:16.929
in six hours.

731
00:56:17.064 --> 00:56:18.836
Once again. after six hours.

732
00:56:18.971 --> 00:56:21.274
both borders will be
closing indefinitely.

733
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:23.268
There are reports of violence

734
00:56:23.404 --> 00:56:24.836
from all corners
of the United States.

735
00:56:24.972 --> 00:56:26.307
We got to go to Mexico.

736
00:56:26.442 --> 00:56:28.076
Other countries
all over the world stand by

737
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:30.645
in amazement at
what's happening in the U.S.

738
00:56:30.781 --> 00:56:31.948
To recap. Canadian and...

739
00:56:32.184 --> 00:56:33.519
Let's go to Mexico.

740
00:56:37.455 --> 00:56:39.521
Let's go.

741
00:56:39.657 --> 00:56:41.661
We don't have a choice.

742
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.295
<i>Authorities are
urging everyone to get</i>

743
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:49.937
<i>to the closest border
as soon as possible.</i>

744
00:56:50.072 --> 00:56:51.529
<i>With only three
and a half hours remaining.</i>

745
00:56:51.665 --> 00:56:53.266
<i>thousands of troops
have been gathered...</i>

746
00:56:53.401 --> 00:56:54.703
<i>Entries to Mexico and Canada</i>

747
00:56:54.838 --> 00:56:55.971
<i>are already overwhelmed.</i>

748
00:56:56.107 --> 00:56:57.310
<i>Listeners. do not delay.</i>

749
00:56:57.446 --> 00:56:59.007
<i>and get out while you can.</i>

750
00:56:59.143 --> 00:57:00.839
We will be ending
our broadcast here.

751
00:57:00.975 --> 00:57:02.213
Good luck. America.

752
00:57:02.348 --> 00:57:03.782
Stay safe.

753
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:36.518
You don't like me.
do you. Dylan?

754
00:57:38.012 --> 00:57:40.148
You don't like Mexicans.

755
00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:43.585
What are you
talking about. Juan?

756
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:46.856
Come on. be honest.

757
00:57:46.992 --> 00:57:49.822
Let's. uh...
How do you say this?

758
00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:52.032
Uh. slice the shit?

759
00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:53.760
Cut the shit?

760
00:57:53.896 --> 00:57:54.894
Cut the shit. Yeah.

761
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.096
You want to cut the shit?

762
00:57:56.232 --> 00:57:57.737
I want to cut
the shit with you.

763
00:57:57.872 --> 00:58:00.209
All right. I'll cut the shit
with you. Juan.

764
00:58:00.344 --> 00:58:02.610
I got no problem with Mexicans.

765
00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.677
But I will say I don't
understand your culture

766
00:58:04.812 --> 00:58:07.483
just like you don't
understand mine.

767
00:58:09.016 --> 00:58:11.948
God's honest truth...
I don't think white people

768
00:58:12.084 --> 00:58:14.452
are any better or worse
than anybody else.

769
00:58:14.587 --> 00:58:16.888
But this I do believe.

770
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:21.361
We should all just
stick with our own.

771
00:58:21.496 --> 00:58:23.730
Just leave each other alone.

772
00:58:25.532 --> 00:58:28.069
You might be right.

773
00:58:28.205 --> 00:58:30.198
But we are together now.

774
00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:41.517
The hell is that?

775
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:43.815
Okay. everybody. wake up.

776
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:46.087
Wake up! Be alert!

777
00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:50.416
Oh. shit.

778
00:58:50.551 --> 00:58:52.092
Jesus Christ.

779
00:58:52.227 --> 00:58:53.888
Ever After?

780
00:59:03.601 --> 00:59:05.772
Holy shit.

781
00:59:13.144 --> 00:59:15.144
Okay. they're coming up on us.

782
00:59:21.956 --> 00:59:24.116
Holy shit.
They're shooting at us.

783
00:59:29.092 --> 00:59:30.025
Shit. They're slowing us down.

784
00:59:30.161 --> 00:59:32.133
- Pull over!
- How many are there?

785
00:59:33.629 --> 00:59:35.169
- There are two on this side.
- You stay down.

786
00:59:35.304 --> 00:59:36.429
Just keep driving.

787
00:59:38.002 --> 00:59:40.906
Stop this truck! Now!

788
00:59:41.975 --> 00:59:43.475
Stay down. Everyone stay down.

789
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:45.340
Stop this truck!

790
00:59:45.475 --> 00:59:47.207
- I'm just gonna run him over.
- No. baby.

791
00:59:47.343 --> 00:59:48.715
- No. baby. wait.
- Wait. Wait.

792
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:50.345
- Don't. I got an idea.
- What?

793
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.179
Don't do it.
There's too many of them.

794
00:59:52.315 --> 00:59:54.117
Juan. get away from the window.

795
00:59:55.285 --> 00:59:56.458
Stay away from the window.

796
00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:57.688
Ever After. motherfuckers!

797
00:59:57.824 --> 00:59:59.217
Pull that fucking truck over!

798
01:00:03.191 --> 01:00:05.194
Ever After!

799
01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.665
She's one of us!

800
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.937
Purge Ever After!

801
01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.206
They're going away.

802
01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:24.185
<i>¿Estás bien?</i>

803
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.314
Way to go. Harper.

804
01:00:49.077 --> 01:00:50.870
The border will close

805
01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:53.372
in three hours.

806
01:01:11.365 --> 01:01:15.061
Attention.
This area is under martial law.

807
01:01:15.197 --> 01:01:17.062
Weapons are not permitted.

808
01:01:17.197 --> 01:01:18.872
This is the NFFA.

809
01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:23.210
Lay down your weapons.
or you will be shot.

810
01:01:23.345 --> 01:01:25.445
Clear the area.

811
01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.480
I repeat. clear the area.

812
01:01:27.616 --> 01:01:29.111
Surrender your weapons...

813
01:01:29.247 --> 01:01:32.045
The hell is that?

814
01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:34.586
Oh. my God.

815
01:01:34.722 --> 01:01:36.725
Holy shit.

816
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.551
The crossing point
is only one mile away.

817
01:01:38.686 --> 01:01:40.090
There's no way through.

818
01:01:40.226 --> 01:01:41.697
It's blocked.
What should I do?

819
01:01:43.196 --> 01:01:44.826
How are we
supposed to get through?

820
01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:47.131
We find a way. Cassidy.

821
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.232
Just keep driving.

822
01:01:53.368 --> 01:01:54.935
We got less than three hours.

823
01:01:56.472 --> 01:01:57.975
Oh. please don't break down.

824
01:01:58.110 --> 01:01:59.676
Come on. baby.
We're nearly there.

825
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:01.816
Baby. be careful.

826
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.483
- It's blocked.
- What?

827
01:02:07.618 --> 01:02:09.790
She's broke down.
Come on. we got to get out.

828
01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.419
The border's just
a few blocks from here.

829
01:02:11.554 --> 01:02:13.254
We can make it.
Everybody. you follow Juan.

830
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.826
Get ready. Stay low.
Stay together.

831
01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:17.089
I cover you in three. two. one.

832
01:02:17.224 --> 01:02:18.326
Come on! Come on!

833
01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:19.599
This is the NFFA.

834
01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.835
Go! Let's go. let's go!

835
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.094
Lay down your weapons.

836
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.670
or you will be shot.

837
01:02:23.805 --> 01:02:25.134
Purge this country!

838
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:26.264
Clear the area.

839
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.374
I repeat. clear the area.

840
01:02:27.509 --> 01:02:28.970
Stay close. guys.

841
01:02:29.105 --> 01:02:31.335
Dylan. cover the back.

842
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:33.338
Stay close.

843
01:02:40.586 --> 01:02:42.649
- <i>Mano derecha.</i>
- T.T.. cover the right.

844
01:02:42.784 --> 01:02:44.559
<i>Cuida tu derecha.
Cuida tu derecha.</i>

845
01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:49.490
Juan! Go. go!

846
01:02:50.596 --> 01:02:51.998
Clear!

847
01:02:53.361 --> 01:02:55.203
Move. move!

848
01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.404
I'm behind you.

849
01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.332
Stay close.

850
01:03:01.468 --> 01:03:03.438
Revolution!

851
01:03:09.213 --> 01:03:10.718
Get to the wall.
Get to the wall.

852
01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.144
Come on.
Come on. come on. come on.

853
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.020
There's the wall. guys.

854
01:03:15.552 --> 01:03:18.288
Those are innocents.
Let 'em through.

855
01:03:20.392 --> 01:03:21.891
Kill them brownies!

856
01:03:22.027 --> 01:03:23.356
Dylan. get back.

857
01:03:23.491 --> 01:03:24.765
They have a .50 caliber.

858
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.932
Stay with me. Stay with me.

859
01:03:27.067 --> 01:03:28.827
Oh. shit!

860
01:03:28.962 --> 01:03:31.004
- Let's use it as cover.
- Surrender your weapons...

861
01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:32.398
- Let's go!
- You guys go to the wall!

862
01:03:32.534 --> 01:03:33.540
Get cover! Get cover!

863
01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:34.733
Move. move!

864
01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:36.674
This is the NFFA...

865
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.671
To the diner! The diner!

866
01:03:38.806 --> 01:03:40.682
Go. guys!
Go ahead. go ahead. go ahead.

867
01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.879
Clear the area.

868
01:03:43.014 --> 01:03:45.115
Stay close.

869
01:03:45.251 --> 01:03:47.581
Come on!
We're gonna go across!

870
01:03:52.224 --> 01:03:54.187
Come on. guys!
Let's go! Let's go!

871
01:03:58.761 --> 01:04:01.398
Put your heads down
when you come in.

872
01:04:01.534 --> 01:04:03.563
- We can go. Stay back.
- Keep your head down.

873
01:04:03.699 --> 01:04:06.467
- Keep your body down. Go.
- Yeah. yeah.

874
01:04:06.602 --> 01:04:09.609
We need to keep up.
Follow me. okay?

875
01:04:11.572 --> 01:04:13.309
Stay down. Stay down.

876
01:04:17.548 --> 01:04:19.820
- What is that?
- It's a tank.

877
01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:22.614
We're gonna go across
to the theater!

878
01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:24.421
- Across to the theater.
- Okay.

879
01:04:24.556 --> 01:04:26.792
When the truck passes.
let's make a run.

880
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:31.724
We have to cross right now!

881
01:04:31.859 --> 01:04:34.061
There's a fucking tank
down there.

882
01:04:34.196 --> 01:04:36.201
Come on! Come on!

883
01:04:37.971 --> 01:04:39.875
Oh. my gosh!

884
01:04:42.569 --> 01:04:44.477
Come on. Get in.

885
01:04:44.612 --> 01:04:46.440
Get in. Get in.

886
01:04:46.576 --> 01:04:48.476
- Come on!
- Tank is on move!

887
01:04:48.612 --> 01:04:50.318
This is the NFFA.

888
01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.798
Hey.

889
01:05:11.971 --> 01:05:14.335
Adela.

890
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.040
No. no. no. Come on!

891
01:05:16.176 --> 01:05:17.304
- Adela.
- Juan?

892
01:05:17.439 --> 01:05:19.209
- Are you okay?
- Juan.

893
01:05:19.344 --> 01:05:20.976
- It's blocked.
- Are you guys okay?

894
01:05:21.112 --> 01:05:22.781
Adela. we'll go around.

895
01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.852
Find another way out.

896
01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.045
- Baby?
- I can't get it open!

897
01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.180
- Baby. open the door.
- I can't get it open!

898
01:05:29.315 --> 01:05:30.618
Baby?

899
01:05:33.524 --> 01:05:35.128
The border will close

900
01:05:35.263 --> 01:05:37.865
- in two hours and 30 minutes.
- Come on.

901
01:05:42.537 --> 01:05:46.165
Attention.
This area is under martial law.

902
01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.371
We people of the mountains

903
01:05:52.507 --> 01:05:54.706
believe. at the castle...

904
01:05:54.841 --> 01:05:56.979
He wants me to ask
if you can wait

905
01:05:57.115 --> 01:05:59.551
and go on after sunrise.

906
01:05:59.687 --> 01:06:01.655
Well. I'm sorry. but
there's a carriage meeting me

907
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.187
at Borgo Pass at midnight.

908
01:06:03.323 --> 01:06:05.352
- Borgo Pass?
- Yes.

909
01:06:05.488 --> 01:06:07.156
Whose carriage?

910
01:06:07.292 --> 01:06:08.755
Count Dracula's.

911
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:12.524
- Count Dracula's?
- Yes.

912
01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.728
Castle Dracula?

913
01:06:15.864 --> 01:06:18.203
Yes. that's where I'm going.

914
01:06:18.339 --> 01:06:20.903
- To the castle?
- Yes.

915
01:06:21.038 --> 01:06:22.938
Fuck.

916
01:06:24.372 --> 01:06:25.841
A fucking bat.

917
01:06:25.976 --> 01:06:27.676
Fuck.

918
01:06:27.811 --> 01:06:30.552
...at the castle.
there are vampires.

919
01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.721
Dracula and his wives.

920
01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:36.016
They take the form of wolves...

921
01:06:36.151 --> 01:06:40.419
Attention.
This area is under martial law.

922
01:06:40.555 --> 01:06:42.421
Weapons are not permitted.

923
01:06:42.557 --> 01:06:43.895
Oh. shit.

924
01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:45.423
There's another tank.

925
01:06:45.559 --> 01:06:47.068
We can't go around.

926
01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:51.402
- Wait. Wait here.
- Okay.

927
01:06:55.336 --> 01:06:57.243
All clear.

928
01:07:09.022 --> 01:07:11.026
Let's get out of here.

929
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.899
- All good?
- Behind you!

930
01:07:34.913 --> 01:07:36.975
T.T.

931
01:07:37.558 --> 01:07:38.183
Look.

932
01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.354
It's the roses.

933
01:07:43.418 --> 01:07:44.792
<i>There.</i>

934
01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:47.018
Stay next to the wall. okay?

935
01:07:47.153 --> 01:07:49.457
Return to your homes.

936
01:07:49.592 --> 01:07:51.862
I repeat. return to your homes.

937
01:07:51.997 --> 01:07:53.992
Stay next to me.

938
01:07:57.964 --> 01:07:59.971
I need to get to my wife.

939
01:08:00.107 --> 01:08:02.110
What are you looking for?

940
01:08:03.472 --> 01:08:05.178
We Mexicans leave signs

941
01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:07.142
all over our city
to help each other.

942
01:08:07.278 --> 01:08:09.340
Adela is following them.

943
01:08:09.475 --> 01:08:12.981
If we want to find our wives.
we should do the same thing.

944
01:08:13.116 --> 01:08:15.017
Go on.

945
01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:22.955
Fuck.

946
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:24.965
Return to your homes.

947
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.531
- Hold this.
- Okay. Okay.

948
01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:29.032
I repeat. return to your homes.

949
01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:30.495
Adela.

950
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:31.831
Yes?

951
01:08:31.967 --> 01:08:33.875
How come you know
how to fight like that?

952
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:36.070
I was part of the autodefensas.

953
01:08:36.205 --> 01:08:37.639
What?

954
01:08:37.775 --> 01:08:39.714
A group of women
fighting the cartels.

955
01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.049
We did damage to them.

956
01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.876
They forced me and Juan
off our land.

957
01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:48.189
This is how we got here
to the States.

958
01:08:49.218 --> 01:08:50.719
Here.

959
01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:52.853
For you.

960
01:08:53.893 --> 01:08:55.929
Okay.

961
01:08:57.561 --> 01:08:59.066
Army's passed. Come on.

962
01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.502
- Okay.
- Stay with me.

963
01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:01.763
Let's go.

964
01:09:01.898 --> 01:09:03.395
The border
will close in two hours

965
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:05.369
and 15 minutes.

966
01:09:10.203 --> 01:09:12.537
Drop it! Move or I kill you.

967
01:09:12.673 --> 01:09:14.572
Hand 'em over. Down.

968
01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:16.015
Drop your weapons.

969
01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:18.047
There's nothing you can do.

970
01:09:18.182 --> 01:09:20.214
Drop 'em.

971
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:21.545
You. too. amigo.

972
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:22.683
Come on. now.

973
01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.259
You're surrounded.
You will be shot.

974
01:09:28.822 --> 01:09:30.925
That a boy.

975
01:09:31.995 --> 01:09:34.430
It's all right. pretty thing.
Come on. now.

976
01:09:34.565 --> 01:09:36.369
Do it.

977
01:09:37.403 --> 01:09:39.602
Nice and easy. Good.

978
01:09:39.737 --> 01:09:41.600
You fucking deaf. son?

979
01:09:43.603 --> 01:09:45.246
Good boy.

980
01:09:46.577 --> 01:09:48.816
Look what we got here.

981
01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:51.315
Couple of bad hombres.

982
01:09:51.451 --> 01:09:52.650
Well. I'll be.

983
01:09:52.785 --> 01:09:54.388
- There's two of us and two of them.
- Mm.

984
01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:55.949
That right there is
what's wrong with this country.

985
01:09:56.084 --> 01:09:57.489
What do you want to do
about 'em. Daddy?

986
01:09:57.625 --> 01:09:59.951
Why don't we give
our fellow Americans here

987
01:10:00.087 --> 01:10:02.427
an opportunity
to redeem themselves?

988
01:10:02.563 --> 01:10:04.163
Yeah. I like the sound of that.

989
01:10:04.298 --> 01:10:05.932
Mm. let me explain.

990
01:10:06.067 --> 01:10:09.134
You kill the brownies.

991
01:10:09.269 --> 01:10:11.800
and the two of you can live.

992
01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:16.134
stay here in this great.
God-loving country.

993
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:19.137
Help us purify this nation
once and for all.

994
01:10:19.272 --> 01:10:22.712
That's what the
Ever After Purge is all about.

995
01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:25.979
Fuck you. redneck.

996
01:10:27.418 --> 01:10:28.921
Yeah. fuck you. pig.

997
01:10:29.057 --> 01:10:30.591
No. fuck you. bitch!

998
01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.917
This country's gone haywire.
It don't know itself no more.

999
01:10:33.053 --> 01:10:34.789
You don't fucking
know yourself.

1000
01:10:34.925 --> 01:10:36.428
Mother. Mother.
Mother. it's okay.

1001
01:10:36.564 --> 01:10:37.930
Look in the fucking mirror!

1002
01:10:38.066 --> 01:10:39.630
Mother! Hey. it's okay.

1003
01:10:41.169 --> 01:10:43.161
Maybe this will help y'all.

1004
01:10:46.902 --> 01:10:48.201
You happy now?

1005
01:10:48.337 --> 01:10:49.970
Mother.

1006
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:52.247
Gladly.

1007
01:11:01.654 --> 01:11:04.259
T.T.. no!

1008
01:11:08.021 --> 01:11:10.660
Trinidad. <i>¿Estás bien?</i>

1009
01:11:10.796 --> 01:11:12.531
Let the purification begin.

1010
01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:14.225
You whore.

1011
01:11:14.361 --> 01:11:17.235
Fucking dying?
Oh. you fucking little beaner.

1012
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:19.664
You fucking ain't worth shit.

1013
01:11:19.799 --> 01:11:21.837
Get the fuck back.

1014
01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:26.446
Don't even think about it.
brownie.

1015
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.746
This is the NFFA!

1016
01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:31.809
Lay down your weapons.
or you will be shot.

1017
01:11:31.945 --> 01:11:33.816
Shoot the pigs!

1018
01:11:35.222 --> 01:11:37.017
Mother! Call for backup!

1019
01:11:38.354 --> 01:11:40.053
Shit.

1020
01:11:40.188 --> 01:11:43.221
Backup! Backup!
We need backup. goddamn it!

1021
01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:46.829
Backup's coming. baby.

1022
01:11:50.402 --> 01:11:52.164
Fuck!

1023
01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:06.351
Mother. no! No!

1024
01:12:06.486 --> 01:12:08.052
- Mother!
- Harper. let's go!

1025
01:12:08.187 --> 01:12:09.918
Mother!

1026
01:12:16.356 --> 01:12:18.898
- Take cover!
- RPG!

1027
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:26.235
Mother!

1028
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:27.236
Mother. no.

1029
01:12:27.371 --> 01:12:28.937
No. no. Mother.

1030
01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.387
This is Alpha Leader.

1031
01:12:44.523 --> 01:12:46.724
Request recon. all units.

1032
01:12:49.957 --> 01:12:51.564
It's here.

1033
01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.732
If our men are alive.
they will be here.

1034
01:13:05.774 --> 01:13:07.613
Help me with the door.

1035
01:13:13.949 --> 01:13:16.050
Are you sure that this is safe?

1036
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.900
The rose.

1037
01:13:21.235 --> 01:13:21.902
It's here.

1038
01:13:28.663 --> 01:13:30.161
Stay over there.

1039
01:13:30.297 --> 01:13:31.863
Are you sure that they're here?

1040
01:13:31.999 --> 01:13:33.837
They have to be.

1041
01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.255
Drop the weapons!

1042
01:13:42.965 --> 01:13:44.049
Who the fuck are you?

1043
01:13:44.466 --> 01:13:45.801
We followed the signs.

1044
01:13:48.345 --> 01:13:49.221
And the white girl?

1045
01:13:49.972 --> 01:13:51.139
She's with me.

1046
01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:53.517
She's pregnant. Don't scare her.

1047
01:13:55.658 --> 01:13:57.498
<i>Está bien.</i>

1048
01:13:58.981 --> 01:13:59.439
Follow me.

1049
01:14:08.866 --> 01:14:09.741
You're the last ones.

1050
01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:14.713
Sit down.

1051
01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.050
I don't see them.

1052
01:14:18.185 --> 01:14:20.312
Where are they?

1053
01:14:20.447 --> 01:14:24.050
The border
will close in two hours.

1054
01:14:37.832 --> 01:14:39.701
Adela. Adela.

1055
01:14:39.836 --> 01:14:41.839
Ay.

1056
01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:56.550
Cassie. Oh. my God.

1057
01:14:56.685 --> 01:14:57.888
You okay?

1058
01:14:59.555 --> 01:15:01.386
T.T.?

1059
01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:04.087
What happened?

1060
01:15:08.331 --> 01:15:10.131
We have breaking news now.

1061
01:15:10.266 --> 01:15:12.100
This is just coming in.
We have been notified

1062
01:15:12.235 --> 01:15:14.241
that there has been
an attack in El Paso

1063
01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:15.904
at a U.S. Army military base.

1064
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.905
As a result.
the NFFA is pulling all

1065
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.305
military troops out of El Paso.

1066
01:15:19.441 --> 01:15:22.216
Again. the military is
retreating out of El Paso

1067
01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.912
after suffering massive losses

1068
01:15:25.048 --> 01:15:26.477
in their battle
against purgers.

1069
01:15:26.612 --> 01:15:29.656
including an attack
on a U.S. Army base.

1070
01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.956
And now
I'm hearing that in response

1071
01:15:32.091 --> 01:15:34.728
to the Army's withdrawal.
Mexico will now be closing

1072
01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:37.258
their El Paso border
crossing point immediately.

1073
01:15:37.393 --> 01:15:39.997
Again. the El Paso border point
will no longer be open

1074
01:15:40.132 --> 01:15:42.737
to United States citizens
fleeing the Forever Purge.

1075
01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:45.936
Americans left behind
at the now closed border wall

1076
01:15:46.071 --> 01:15:48.268
are being slaughtered
by purgers. It is a war.

1077
01:15:48.403 --> 01:15:51.074
El Paso has fallen
to Ever After purgers

1078
01:15:51.209 --> 01:15:53.338
who are going door-to-door
hunting down anyone

1079
01:15:53.474 --> 01:15:55.109
who is not a part
of their hate group.

1080
01:15:55.244 --> 01:15:57.616
The border is now closed.

1081
01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:03.591
At this point. already.

1082
01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:05.316
you can feel there's
a change in the air...

1083
01:16:05.452 --> 01:16:08.161
This city's gonna get
even worse.

1084
01:16:08.296 --> 01:16:10.125
<i>Ven.</i> Come.

1085
01:16:11.596 --> 01:16:13.264
Get out the back.

Okay. let's go! Follow me.

1093

- I know a way to safety.
- Come on! Come on!

1094
01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.313
I need you to stand up
and walk with us. okay?

1095
01:16:34.449 --> 01:16:35.955
- Okay. I can do it.
- Can you do that?

1096
01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.721
- Come on. come on. come on.
- Come on. baby. Come on. - Okay.

1097
01:16:37.856 --> 01:16:38.822

1099
01:16:42.755 --> 01:16:44.998
The purification will not stop.

1100
01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:49.363
This city is now occupied by
the real patriots of America.

1101
01:16:49.499 --> 01:16:53.706
Our duty is to uphold
American beliefs and values

1102
01:16:53.841 --> 01:16:55.402
while keeping America
pure and free

1103
01:16:55.537 --> 01:16:58.404
from refugees and terrorists.

1104
01:16:58.539 --> 01:17:00.544
We have taken back
what is lawfully ours.

1105
01:17:00.679 --> 01:17:01.913
and we will now embark

1107
01:17:05.217 --> 01:17:09.053
Only full-blooded Americans
are welcome here.

1108
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:11.151
All invaders will be purged.

1109
01:17:11.287 --> 01:17:15.253
We control El Paso
and all of Texas.

1110
01:17:15.388 --> 01:17:17.932
The purification will not stop.

1111
01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:21.160
This city is now occupied by
the real patriots of America.

1112
01:17:21.295 --> 01:17:22.899
You're clear.

1113
01:17:23.035 --> 01:17:25.167
Just keep your voices down.

1114
01:17:27.972 --> 01:17:29.566
Listen. Don't worry.

1115
01:17:29.702 --> 01:17:32.178
- Try to stay calm.
- Head down.

1116
01:17:32.313 --> 01:17:34.044
Who's that?

1117
01:17:35.342 --> 01:17:37.212
It's okay. It's okay.

1118
01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:44.281
Is it here?

1119
01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:45.752
Guys?

1120
01:17:45.887 --> 01:17:47.395
It's them.

1121
01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.391
- Hey.
- It's them!

1122
01:17:52.063 --> 01:17:54.735

to Mexico. please.

1123
01:17:57.497 --> 01:17:59.272
Get 'em on board.
We're leaving.

1124
01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.632
<i>Gracias. Chiago.</i>

1125
01:18:00.768 --> 01:18:02.543
Okay. Come on. come on. come on.

1126
01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.909
- Come on.
- Come on. this way.

1127
01:18:05.044 --> 01:18:06.479
- They're here.
- Go. get in the truck.

1128
01:18:06.614 --> 01:18:08.606
Come on. let's go. let's go.

1129
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.227
Alpha Leader. come in.

1130
01:18:26.227 --> 01:18:28.230
Alpha Leader. do you copy?

1131
01:18:30.738 --> 01:18:32.599
- We've found 'em.
- Where?

1132
01:18:32.735 --> 01:18:35.299
They're headed for the border
through the reservation.

1133
01:18:35.434 --> 01:18:37.001
Follow 'em. Don't lose 'em.

1134
01:18:37.137 --> 01:18:38.471
I'll catch up.

1135
01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.944
How are you getting us across?

1136
01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.012
My tribe has lived
right on the border

1137
01:19:15.147 --> 01:19:17.675
of the U.S. and Mexico
for centuries.

1138
01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:21.013
We were the only people
who could legally cross.

1139
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:22.790
Then the wall split us.

1140
01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:27.855
But there are parts of
the terrain <i>los pendejos</i>

1141
01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:29.493
can't build the wall on.

1142
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:31.663
Too dangerous.

1143
01:19:31.799 --> 01:19:34.400
And we use it to make passage.

1144
01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.835
We'll take you through.

1145
01:19:36.971 --> 01:19:39.664
Some of you deserve
another chance.

1146
01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:55.185
Are you in labor?

1147
01:19:56.624 --> 01:19:57.891
Mm.

1148
01:19:58.027 --> 01:19:59.350
Cassie. we got
to get you to Mexico.

1149
01:19:59.486 --> 01:20:01.228
I know it's bad timing. baby.

1150
01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.730
You'll be okay.

1151
01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:04.256
There'll be help
when we get across.

1152
01:20:04.392 --> 01:20:06.233
Camps have been set up. okay?

1153
01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.000
Thank you.

1154
01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.405
Dylan.

1155
01:20:19.006 --> 01:20:20.045
Look.

1156
01:20:27.718 --> 01:20:28.848
Damn it.

1157
01:20:28.983 --> 01:20:29.915
Juan?

1158
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:32.189
Yeah?

1159
01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:34.224
Looks like
we got trouble coming.

1160
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:35.669
Motherfucker.

1161
01:21:04.121 --> 01:21:05.288
They're here.

1162
01:21:12.595 --> 01:21:13.859
- Let's go. Come on. people.
- Go. go. go!

1163
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.900
This is the crossing point!
We're on foot from here!

1164
01:21:16.036 --> 01:21:17.068
Let's go!

1165
01:21:17.204 --> 01:21:18.472
- Let's move! Fast!
- Come on. let's go!

1166
01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.736
Follow me!

1167
01:21:19.871 --> 01:21:21.071
I will guide you!

1168
01:21:21.207 --> 01:21:22.569
<i>Vámonos.</i>

1169
01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:32.116
They're getting close.

1170
01:21:32.252 --> 01:21:33.520
- Follow me.
- We need to move.

1171
01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:35.122
- Hey. honey?
- Yeah?

1172
01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.947
You go let these people get you
across the border. okay?

1173
01:21:37.082 --> 01:21:39.288
- Baby. where are you going?
- Yeah. you go ahead.

1174
01:21:39.424 --> 01:21:40.684
I love you.
I'll be right behind you.

1175
01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:41.929
- Baby. you have to go with me.
- Go on.

1176
01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.493
- Don't leave me.
- Go. I have to stop them.

1177
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:44.765
- No. baby. You cannot leave me.
- You just focus on the baby.

1178
01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:46.457
- Okay?
- Cassie. I'll protect you.

1179
01:21:46.593 --> 01:21:47.534
- Thank you. sister.
- Yeah.

1180
01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:48.968

1182
01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:52.630

Sit on it.

Put your knees underneath it.

1188
01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:12.323
Yeah. I'm low on ammo.

1189
01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:14.789
- You guys got ammo?
- We have a few guns.

1190
01:22:14.924 --> 01:22:18.731
but when the bullets run dry.
draw them in close. use blades.

1191
01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.594
Give me a magazine.

1192
01:22:22.301 --> 01:22:23.370
It's the last round of ammo.

1193
01:22:23.506 --> 01:22:25.170
Make it count.

1194
01:22:25.305 --> 01:22:27.370
- We'll help you.
- But it's not your fight.

1195
01:22:27.506 --> 01:22:30.439
We've been fighting this fight
for 500 years.

1196
01:22:31.845 --> 01:22:33.644
Take what you need.

1197
01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.492
This is our last stand.

Wait for 'em!
