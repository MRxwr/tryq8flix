HIDDEN IN THE CLOSET.

00:20:02.982 --> 00:20:05.215
?HOW ARE YOU?

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.053
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?

00:20:10.055 --> 00:20:10.721
WHEN YOU DIDN'T
GET BACK TO ME.

00:20:10.723 --> 00:20:13.390
I CALLED YOUR OFFICE.

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:14.258

IT WAS A BABY GIRL.

PLENTY OF TIME TO TALK.

I WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:21:34.538 --> 00:21:37.237

WHO CAME TO SEE YOU.

00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:41.475
AND SHE TOLD YOU

00:21:41.477 --> 00:21:43.677
SHE WAS AFFILIATED
WITH THIS HOSPITAL?

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:48.015
YEAH.
WELL. NO. NOT SPECIFICALLY.

00:21:48.017 --> 00:21:51.785
BUT I APPLIED
AND SHE CALLED RIGHT AWAY. SO--

00:21:51.787 --> 00:21:54.054
WE HAVE NO LYNNE MALLORY
ON OUR STAFF.

00:21:54.056 --> 00:21:55.155

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.326

SHE TOOK MY BLOOD!

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.541
IT'S POSSIBLE SHE WORKS FOR
ANOTHER HOSPITAL IN THE AREA.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.711
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.
SEE IF I CAN LOCATE HER.

00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:20.913

THE MUSIC WENT OFF
IN THE NURSERY.

00:30:56.349 --> 00:30:57.848
I WENT IN THERE
AND I FOUND THE VIDEO CAMERA.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.818

THE NURSE WAS HERE.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.986

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.491
OH.

00:52:17.493 --> 00:52:18.458
WELL. OBVIOUSLY.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.459

FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:20.927
BUT THAT POOR WOMAN.

00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:24.564
WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH.
LOSING A CHILD LIKE THAT.

00:52:24.566 --> 00:52:26.867
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO ARREST HER. ARE YOU?

00:52:26.869 --> 00:52:28.835
WELL. I APPRECIATE
YOUR SENSIBILITIES. MS. PARKER.

00:52:28.837 --> 00:52:30.303

AND ENTERING--

00:52:30.305 --> 00:52:32.738

IS GOOD FOR HER. DO YOU?

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.774

BEEN HOME AT THE TIME.

THE POLICE STATION.

I'M JUST A FRIEND.

I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE FOUND ME.

00:53:39.005 --> 00:53:40.505

I'M EXPOSED.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE CAREFUL.

00:53:41.507 --> 00:53:42.806
I WAS CAREFUL!

00:53:42.808 --> 00:53:43.974
THERE ARE NO PRINTS TO IDENTIFY.

00:53:43.976 --> 00:53:44.975
THE CALLS ARE UNTRACEABLE.

00:53:44.977 --> 00:53:46.510

00:53:46.512 --> 00:53:47.511

00:53:48.881 --> 00:53:50.914
WHY THE HELL
DID I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS?

00:53:50.916 --> 00:53:52.316
MAYBE IF YOU'D MANAGED
YOUR BOOKS BETTER.

00:53:52.318 --> 00:53:54.318
YOU'D HAVE HAD OTHER OPTIONS.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.752
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

00:53:55.754 --> 00:53:57.721
AS LONG AS WE DON'T PANIC.
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

00:53:57.723 --> 00:53:59.556

FOR A WHILE.

00:53:59.558 --> 00:54:00.557
NO. NO.

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:01.892
THAT WOULD RAISE A RED FLAG.

00:54:01.894 --> 00:54:03.694

WITHOUT MY SHARE OF THE MONEY.

THEY'RE FLYING IN TOMORROW.

00:54:06.665 --> 00:54:07.631

00:54:09.268 --> 00:54:10.300

IN THE CLEAR.

00:54:10.302 --> 00:54:11.602
NO. IT WAS THE SMART PLAY.

00:54:11.604 --> 00:54:13.470
NOW SHE LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.

00:54:13.472 --> 00:54:15.239
WHAT IF SHE COMES BACK?

I LOST NICOLE

00:54:33.358 --> 00:54:36.325
AFTER SHE WENT
INTO THE BUILDING.

00:54:36.327 --> 00:54:37.560
I'M SORRY.

00:54:43.167 --> 00:54:44.667

00:54:44.669 --> 00:54:45.668
HER PHONE BILL.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:47.203
MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING IN THERE.

00:54:49.107 --> 00:54:50.573
YOU CAN'T
OPEN HER MAIL.

00:54:50.575 --> 00:54:52.073
THAT'S
A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

00:54:52.075 --> 00:54:57.212
I SAW A BABY'S BOTTLE
ON THE TABLE IN HER HOUSE.

00:54:57.214 --> 00:54:59.014
WHAT DOES THAT PROVE?

00:54:59.016 --> 00:55:00.515
IN THE POLICE STATION.

00:55:00.517 --> 00:55:02.484
SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:55:02.486 --> 00:55:03.952
THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

00:55:03.954 --> 00:55:07.923
WELL. MAYBE THAT'S WHY
SHE POSED AS A NURSE.

00:55:07.925 --> 00:55:09.891
SHE WANTED A BABY. OUR BABY.

00:55:09.893 --> 00:55:12.127
HEY. MAYBE SHE CAN'T HAVE
ANY CHILDREN OF HER OWN.

00:55:12.129 --> 00:55:13.161
SO SHE CAME UP

00:55:13.163 --> 00:55:14.195
WITH THIS WHOLE
CRAZY PLAN

00:55:14.197 --> 00:55:15.130

WENT WRONG.

00:55:18.302 --> 00:55:19.768

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:20.769

TOO FAR.

00:55:20.771 --> 00:55:22.003

00:55:22.005 --> 00:55:23.271

WE'VE FOUND NICOLE PARKER.

00:55:23.273 --> 00:55:24.472
AND LET THE POLICE INVESTIGATE.

00:55:24.474 --> 00:55:26.707
HOCH ISN'T LISTENING.

00:55:26.709 --> 00:55:28.909
SHE SUSPECTS ME.

00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:30.644

FOR A MINUTE?

00:55:39.088 --> 00:55:40.721

TO SIT BACK

01:23:55.568 --> 01:23:58.603
BUT THEN MAGGIE CARTER'S BABY
WAS STILLBORN.

01:23:58.605 --> 01:24:00.237
YES.

01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:01.571
SO NICOLE CAME UP WITH A PLAN.

01:24:01.573 --> 01:24:04.874
KEEP THE BABY ON ICE
WITH BENDIX AT THE MORGUE.

01:24:04.876 --> 01:24:06.776
FIND A REPLACEMENT.

01:24:06.778 --> 01:24:07.944
MAKE A SWAP.

01:24:07.946 --> 01:24:11.047
AND DISPOSE OF THE REMAINS.

01:24:11.049 --> 01:24:13.683
IT'S ILLEGAL TO ACCEPT MONEY
SOLELY IN EXCHANGE FOR A BABY.

01:24:13.685 --> 01:24:15.151
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE.

01:24:15.153 --> 01:24:16.853
STILL. THE FEDS HAVE SHUT DOWN
THE ADOPTION AGENCY.

01:24:16.855 --> 01:24:20.624
THEY'RE PREPARING
A LAUNDRY LIST OF CHARGES

01:24:20.626 --> 01:24:21.658
AGAINST NICOLE AND SEVERS.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.893
AMONG THEM FELONY KIDNAPPING.

01:24:23.895 --> 01:24:25.562
AS FOR THE OTHER BABIES
THEY'VE ALREADY SOLD.

01:24:25.564 --> 01:24:27.530
WE'LL LIKELY NEVER KNOW.

01:24:27.532 --> 01:24:28.498
YOU WERE LUCKY.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.799
JENNA.

01:24:33.438 --> 01:24:36.438
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
HOW I'D IMAGINED THE DELIVERY.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.406
BUT CONGRATULATIONS.

01:24:37.408 --> 01:24:38.974
YOU HAVE A BABY GIRL.

01:24:45.349 --> 01:24:47.349
HI. MADELINE.

01:24:53.457 --> 01:24:56.258
SHE LOOKS LIKE ME.
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:25:00.197 --> 01:25:02.197
EXCUSE ME.

01:25:17.881 --> 01:25:18.913
HI.

01:25:28.792 --> 01:25:30.758
I MISSED YOU.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.727
ME TOO.

01:25:32.729 --> 01:25:35.697
WHERE ARE
ALL YOUR THINGS?

01:25:35.699 --> 01:25:37.765
DON'T TELL ME
YOU CHECKED THEM ALREADY.

01:25:37.767 --> 01:25:39.667
NO. THAT'S IT.

01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:42.937
JUST YOUR CAMERA?

01:25:44.641 --> 01:25:46.073
YOU'RE NOT GOING?

01:25:46.075 --> 01:25:48.575
LOOK. I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT
ME GOING BACK AND FORTH.

01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:51.678
BUT THEN I REALIZED...

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.013
EVERYTHING I NEED
IS RIGHT HERE.

01:25:53.015 --> 01:25:54.948
TOM. YOU DIDN'T JUST
QUIT YOUR JOB?

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.349
IT'S OKAY.

01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:57.951
I TALKED TO A GUY
AT THE LOCAL PAPER.

01:25:57.953 --> 01:26:00.754
AND HE SAID THERE MIGHT BE
AN OPENING NEXT MONTH.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:03.623
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:06.493
LOW PRESSURE.
A STEADY PAYCHECK.

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.597
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:26:10.599 --> 01:26:11.598
YOU WANT ME TO GO?

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.999
OH. NO. HONEY!

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.234
NO. NO. NO. NO!

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:15.335
IT'S JUST...

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:18.105
I GAVE NOTICE
JUST TWO HOURS AGO.

01:26:18.107 --> 01:26:20.240
WHAT?

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.243
WITH EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.746
A SIX-WEEK
LEAVE OF ABSENCE

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.715
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
NEARLY ENOUGH TIME.

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:33.119
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ABOUT MONEY IN THE MEANTIME?

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:36.555
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

01:26:36.557 --> 01:26:38.057
YOU KNOW. AT LEAST
WE FINALLY HAVE

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.458
OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.026
ANYWAY...

01:26:41.028 --> 01:26:44.864
I'VE GOT AN ANGLE
ON A NEW FREELANCE STORY.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.866
OH. YEAH?
OH. YEAH.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:50.870
I'M CALLING IT
"NEW BEGINNINGS."
