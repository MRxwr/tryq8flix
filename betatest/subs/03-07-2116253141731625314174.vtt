12
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.120
NARRATOR: <i>For one group.</i>

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.440
<i>archaeologists are now using</i>
<i>modern forensic techniques</i>

-DR. ESTELLE LAZER: Oh. yeah. lots.
-MIDDLETON: Look at 'em.

17

NARRATOR: <i>To reveal</i>
<i>who these people were...</i>

18

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.160
NARRATOR: <i>How they lived.</i>
<i>and why they became victims</i>

20

21
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.400
<i>Nearly two millennia</i>

22

STIJN LUYCK: Here we are.

27
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.720
NARRATOR: <i>They also found bodies.</i>

28
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.200
<i>The most iconic are a group</i>
<i>of 13 victims known as the Fugitives.</i>

29
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280
LAZER (off screen):
So. I do have a plan.

30
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.240
LUYCK (off screen): Yeah.

31
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.160
LAZER: And I would want
to start at that end.

32
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.680
-I want to go that way.
-LUYCK: Yeah.

33
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.400
NARRATOR: <i>A team of experts</i>

34
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.360
<i>is launching the first ever</i>
<i>forensic investigation</i>

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.520
<i>into their remains.</i>

36
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.200
<i>They're led by Dr. Estelle Lazer.</i>

37
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.440
LAZER: <i>There's a hole in the wall</i>
<i>at the back of the display</i>

38
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.800
and people actually put flowers through
for the tiny children.

39
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.960
<i>They're a very. very powerful reminder</i>

40
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.600
<i>of the event that killed so many people.</i>

41
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.880
-LUYCK: Ready.
-LAZER: Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.920
NARRATOR: <i>For volcanologist</i>
<i>Kayla Iacovino.</i>

43
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
<i>clues in the rocks shed light</i>
<i>on why this eruption was so deadly.</i>

44
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.040
<i>It started with a bang.</i>

45
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.440
IACOVINO: <i>So when</i>
<i>the eruption first began.</i>

46
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.320
<i>you would have seen a jet of material</i>
<i>coming up in the middle</i>

47
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.520
<i>and then branching out.</i>
<i>like an umbrella shape.</i>

48
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.560
They probably would have
felt rumbling. shaking.

49
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.960
<i>as the magma hit</i>
<i>the surface and exploded...</i>

50
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.880
and this huge cloud
just looming over everything.

51
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.520
sort of spreading out above the city.

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.920
NARRATOR: <i>The majority</i>
<i>of Pompeiians left immediately.</i>

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.520
<i>But within the city walls.</i>
<i>over a thousand bodies</i>

54
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.760
<i>have been found.</i>

55
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.560
<i>It's long been assumed these people</i>
<i>were physically unable to run away.</i>

56
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.440
<i>The old. the very young. and the frail.</i>

57
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.040
<i>With the Fugitives.</i>

58
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.800
<i>Dr. Lazer can put</i>
<i>this theory to the test.</i>

59
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.960
LAZER: There's the skull. That's good.

60
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.640
NARRATOR: <i>Her work should determine</i>
<i>if age or disability</i>

61
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.120
<i>prevented their escape.</i>

62
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.880
LAZER: <i>We're using</i>
<i>traditional forensic techniques</i>

63
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.240
<i>to work out what age</i>
<i>the victims were when they died.</i>

64
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.280
if there's any sign of illness or trauma.

65
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.360
<i>any evidence about their lifestyles.</i>

66
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.960
-Looks like two rips.
-MIDDLETON: Two rips.

67
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.840
LAZER: <i>Just to get a sense</i>
<i>of who they were.</i>

68
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.240
NARRATOR: <i>The Fugitives were discovered</i>
<i>by head of excavations.</i>

69
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.160
<i>Amedeo Maiuri in 1961.</i>

70
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.160
<i>They're incredibly life-like.</i>

71
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.320
<i>seemingly frozen at the moment of death.</i>

72
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.120
<i>This was made possible by a technique</i>
<i>pioneered in the nineteenth century.</i>

73
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.240
<i>Local archaeologist Antonio de Simone</i>
<i>explains how it works.</i>

74
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.520
ANTONIO DE SIMONE (off screen):
This is the first plaster cast

75
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.520
that was made in Pompeii.

76
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.440
While the archaeologist was digging

77
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.880
<i>at about 16 feet above road level.</i>

78
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.640
<i>he noticed a hollow space.</i>

79
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.960
<i>and immediately thought</i>
<i>it could be a body.</i>

80
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.640
NARRATOR: <i>Over the years.</i>
<i>the flesh rots away.</i>

81
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.080
<i>but the form of the body is preserved</i>
<i>as a cavity in the ash.</i>

82
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.640
<i>By filling the void with Plaster of Paris.</i>

83
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.000
<i>a three-dimensional replica</i>
<i>of each victim was produced.</i>

84
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.240
DE SIMONE: The cast has accurately
preserved all the details

85
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.840
of the cape worn by the victim

86
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.160
as if it was a sculpture.

87
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.640
NARRATOR: <i>But wherever detail was lacking.</i>

88
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.920
<i>nineteenth century archaeologists</i>
<i>often improved</i>

89
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.800
<i>the casts themselves.</i>

90
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.960
DE SIMONE: If we look closely.
we can see a dividing line.

91
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.760
Above it. the face was
probably a shapeless bulk

92
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.640
which was then redefined
with extra plaster.

93
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.760
so this has all been re-worked.

94
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.560
They didn't set out to deceive.

95
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.640
<i>but the casts are like photos</i>
<i>of the tragedy.</i>

96
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.000
<i>They need to convey what happened.</i>

97
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.400
NARRATOR: <i>When Maiuri's team</i>
<i>worked on the Fugitives.</i>

98
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.320
<i>it's thought that they. too.</i>
<i>sculpted the plaster</i>

99
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.600
<i>to make the casts more lifelike.</i>

100
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.640
<i>To engage the public.</i>
<i>he also created a story</i>

101
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.800
<i>about who they were and how they died.</i>

102
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.000
LAZER: <i>For him. it was</i>
<i>a remarkable discovery.</i>

103
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.680
<i>There were 13 victims together.</i>
<i>so it was the largest number</i>

104
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.400
<i>of casts that had been made at one time.</i>

105
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.240
<i>He wrote a very emotional article</i>

106
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.840
<i>which had a profound impact</i>
<i>on people visiting the site.</i>

107
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.360
NARRATOR: <i>Published in</i>
National Geographic <i>magazine.</i>

108
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.120
<i>that article sketched out</i>
<i>the characters in the group</i>

109
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.640
<i>and the relationships between them.</i>

110
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.960
<i>The bodies were originally found</i>
<i>in three smaller groups.</i>

111
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.640
<i>Now lined up as one. the groups remain.</i>

112
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.360
<i>Maiuri described the first two</i>
<i>as families of farmers.</i>

113
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.720
<i>He claimed the third group</i>
<i>was a merchant family.</i>

114
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.320
<i>giving vivid details</i>
<i>about their final moments.</i>

115
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.440
LAZER: <i>He says they're</i>
<i>two boys who he reckons</i>

116
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.600
<i>were holding hands and fell as one.</i>

117
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.840
<i>And then the mother. "her body</i>
<i>already weakened through childbirth."</i>

118
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.120
<i>supporting the youngest child. a girl.</i>

119
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.040
<i>and trying to ease her pain.</i>

120
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.320
<i>And then. the very end.</i>
<i>"the merchant." in his words.</i>

121
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.200
<i>resting on one arm.</i>
<i>rising up out of the ashes</i>

122
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.040
<i>to try and protect and save his family.</i>

123
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.640
<i>He says that it's based on evidence.</i>

124
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.760
but I cannot see from the information
that I have available to me

125
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.200
what he bases this story on.
and I think this is a real problem.

126
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.320
Can we have another one?

127
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.080
<i>My aim is to actually strip away</i>
<i>all the previous stories</i>

128
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.920
<i>and just give them back</i>
<i>their lives and their stories.</i>

129
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.200
<i>And I do believe that that will impart</i>
<i>a little more respect on them</i>

130
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.840
as victims of a mass disaster.

131
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.680
NARRATOR: <i>What Maiuri did.</i>
<i>was in sync with the times.</i>

132
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.560
<i>The focus then was on creating an exhibit</i>

133
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.480
<i>to attract visitors.</i>

134
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.360
<i>Today. that focus has shifted.</i>

135
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.440
<i>Dr. Lazer's team hope to discover</i>

136
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.800
<i>who the Fugitives really were.</i>

137
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.760
<i>They're using x-rays</i>

138
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.240
-<i>to penetrate the plaster...</i>
-(camera beeps)

139
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.520
<i>...and 3D scanning to create</i>
<i>digital replicas of each cast.</i>

140
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.840
<i>By placing these in a 3D model</i>
<i>of the entire town.</i>

141
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.720
<i>the Fugitives can be seen in context.</i>

142
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.280
<i>They died by the city walls.</i>

143
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.840
<i>apparently so close</i>
<i>to making their escape.</i>

144
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.160
<i>The early stages of the eruption</i>
<i>scared most people away.</i>

145
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.760
<i>The mystery is why</i>
<i>the Fugitives stayed behind.</i>

146
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.680
<i>Work begins on the victim</i>
<i>that Maiuri described</i>

147
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.680
<i>as the head of the first family.</i>

148
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.720
<i>The Merchant.</i>

149
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.880
(beeps)

150
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.600
DR. DZUNG VU: Skull base.
pretty well preserved.

151
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.920
-MIDDLETON: Yes
-LAZER: Look. it's got calvarium.

152
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.880
it's got everything.

153
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.440
<i>Beautiful! Lots of bones inside.</i>

154
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.360
This is a really nice skeleton.

155
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.960
We should be able to get
quite a bit of information

156
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.320
out of it. don't you think?

157
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.920
NARRATOR<i>: Beyond the 2.000-year-old bones.</i>

158
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.880
<i>the scans also reveal</i>
<i>something more modern.</i>

159

VU (off screen): Look at that! There!

160
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.760
LAZER (off screen): What do you think
they've done in there?

161
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.840
-What's this?
-MIDDLETON (off screen): Mmm.

162
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.720
He has a big metal hook in his head.

163
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.320
LAZER (off screen):
Yes. we can see that.

164
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.280
-This huge lump of metal in there.
-MIDDLETON (off screen): Yeah.

165
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.760
LAZER (off screen): There's a lot of
funny wire. in there. isn't it?

166
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.800
-That's a weird wire.
-VU: Yep.

167
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.200
But there's a nail and a rod
holding the plaster of the upper limb.

168
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.400
to the rest of the body.

169
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.480
NARRATOR: <i>This unexpected find</i>
<i>shows that Maiuri went</i>

170
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.560
<i>to extraordinary lengths to preserve</i>
<i>the Fugitives' final poses.</i>

171
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.680
<i>The challenge now is to look</i>
<i>beyond these modifications</i>

172
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.280
<i>and focus on the bones themselves.</i>

173
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.520
-LAZER: So this is the first x-ray.
-KEVIN DICUS: This is iconic.

174
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.480
NARRATOR: <i>To help assess the evidence.</i>

175
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.160
<i>Pompeii expert Kevin Dicus joins the team.</i>

176
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.280
DICUS: <i>It feels strange</i>
<i>to shed these old stories</i>

177
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.760
<i>about these people</i>

178
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.520
because they have been a part

179
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.520
<i>of the modern history of Pompeii</i>
<i>as an archaeological site.</i>

180
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.520
<i>But now we have the technology</i>
<i>to actually go deeper.</i>

181
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.680
<i>literally deeper into the plaster</i>

182
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.800
<i>and I think we actually owe it</i>
<i>to these people</i>

183
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.240
to strip them of these modern narratives

184
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.200
and get it back to who they really were.

185
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.880
NARRATOR: <i>After in-depth analysis</i>
<i>of the x-rays.</i>

186
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.320
<i>subtle details emerge.</i>

187
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.960
LAZER: We've got the frontal sinus.
and it's well developed

188
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.360
so that's an indicator
that we're looking at an adult.

189
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.760
The teeth are all erupted.
the roots are fully formed.

190
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.000
so that's an adult dentition.

191
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.680
NARRATOR: <i>Another x-ray shows a hand.</i>

192
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.160
<i>with the arm bones visible below it.</i>

193
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.200
<i>But between the hand and the arm.</i>

194
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.160
<i>the area containing</i>
<i>the small bones of the wrist</i>

195
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.920
<i>has become abnormally compressed.</i>

196
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.960
LAZER: We've got a case of
quite severe osteoarthritis at the wrist.

197
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.840
Probably the cartilage has been lost.

198
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.440
and there's a likelihood that
we've got bone rubbing against bone.

199
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.080
DICUS: Ooh. Be quite painful.
I would imagine.

200
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.800
LAZER: So certainly
they'd have pain. swelling.

201
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.920
some. p-possibly some weakness.

202
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.400
and I think it would be more likely

203
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.200
to be an older than younger individual.

204
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.480
<i>We're starting to see a human being</i>
<i>emerge from this cast.</i>

205
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.960
<i>which you know. people have often seen</i>
<i>them as being more like statues...</i>

206
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.920
-DICUS: <i>Absolutely.</i>
-LAZER: <i>...than individuals.</i>

207
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.480
NARRATOR: <i>As the team scan</i>
<i>the rest of the cast.</i>

208
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.320
<i>one last x-ray provides a clue</i>
<i>about the Fugitive's final.</i>

209
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.240
<i>desperate moments.</i>

210
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.760
VU: There's bone here.

211
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.600
LAZER (off screen): Ah. yes.

212
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.040
NARRATOR: <i>In Pompeii.</i>
<i>the forensic team is examining</i>

213
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.800
<i>the victim known as the Merchant.</i>

214
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.880
VU: That one there must be broken.

215
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.800
NARRATOR: <i>They've discovered</i>
<i>this is an older individual</i>

216
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.840
<i>with signs of arthritis.</i>

217
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.600
-VU: But funny bits of bones. too.
-LAZER: Yeah.

218
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.960
NARRATOR: <i>And the x-rays reveal</i>
<i>one more intriguing clue.</i>

219
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.280
LAZER: What we're looking at
is the upper arm bone...

220
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.680
-and there are some breaks in it.
-DICUS: Mm-hmm.

221
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.240
LAZER: So. there is evidence
of post-mortem fractures

222
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.320
and peri-mortem. so those that happened
at or around the time of death.

223
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.120
NARRATOR: <i>At the top of the upper arm</i>

224
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.440
<i>is the rounded head of the humerus.</i>

225
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.680
<i>Cutting across it. barely visible.</i>

226
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.400
<i>is a hairline fracture.</i>

227
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.600
<i>possibly the result</i>
<i>of a fall onto the arm.</i>

228
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.720
LAZER: <i>What that suggests</i>
<i>is that this person experienced</i>

229
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.640
something quite violent
at or around the time of death.

230
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.640
DICUS: That really does say something
if they're breaking arm bones.

231
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.680
LAZER: <i>Yes.</i>

232
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.800
NARRATOR: <i>Volcanologist Kayla Iacovino is</i>
<i>in a corner of Pompeii</i>

233
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.320
<i>that's still half buried.</i>

234
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.920
<i>to investigate how the eruption took</i>
<i>its very first victims.</i>

235
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.960
IACOVINO: So. we've just come up
from main street.

236
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.160
And what we're looking at here
is a wall of pumice stones.

237
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.160
So. these pumice stones would have
rained down on the city of Pompeii

238
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.040
during the second phase of the eruption.

239
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.560
And as the magma is rising up
to the surface.

240
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.280
you have so much energy.
that here at Pompeii.

241
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.560
you were able to send stones
like this over 30 kilometers

242
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.400
into the air. up into the atmosphere.

243
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.280
NARRATOR: <i>High altitude winds</i>
<i>dragged the mushroom cloud</i>

244
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.720
<i>across Pompeii.</i>

245
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.360
<i>Then gravity took over.</i>
<i>and pumice began to rain down</i>

246
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.960
<i>on the town below.</i>

247
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.360
IACOVINO: At this point.
there's no escaping it anymore.

248
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.800
You're inside of the eruption.

249
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.720
<i>So. you can imagine walking</i>
<i>outside of your house</i>

250
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.720
<i>and seeing stones falling</i>
<i>from the heavens.</i>

251
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.920
So. while these things are
sort of light and fluffy.

252
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.240
and a single one
maybe hitting you on the head.

253
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320
or even a few hitting you on the head.
wouldn't kill you...

254
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.640
<i>but when you have five meters</i>
<i>of this pumice</i>

255
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.520
<i>sitting on top of a flat roof.</i>

256
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.400
<i>the roofs start to collapse.</i>

257
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.640
And unfortunately for Pompeii.
a lot of the people were killed

258
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.840
<i>because those roofs collapsed</i>
<i>on top of them.</i>

259
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.240
<i>because they decided to shelter in place.</i>

260
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.320
NARRATOR: <i>When archaeologists</i>
<i>dug down through the pumice layers.</i>

261
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.640
<i>the remains of those</i>
<i>that sheltered inside were still there.</i>

262

<i>The eruption's first victims.</i>

263
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.320
<i>Buried in loose pumice.</i>

264
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.880
<i>it wasn't possible</i>
<i>to make casts of these bodies.</i>

265
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.480
<i>Only bones were retrieved.</i>

266
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.000
<i>The Fugitives. however.</i>
<i>did not die inside.</i>

267
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.960
<i>Their bodies were found in a garden.</i>

268
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.320
<i>on top of the pumice.</i>

269
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.440
<i>They survived this part of the eruption.</i>

270
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.280

(siren wailing)

275
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.480
MEYER: <i>It's kind of useful</i>
<i>to think through what exactly</i>

<i>is going through people's brains</i>
<i>at the moment they feel</i>

<i>that something bad is going</i>

287
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.920
<i>one of the deepest instincts that we have</i>

<i>is to stay with things that are familiar.</i>

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.920
<i>like air crashes and earthquakes.</i>

326
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.680
<i>But these 2.000-year-old teeth</i>
<i>contain just as much information.</i>

327
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.000
MIDDLETON: We've certainly got
lots of molar teeth.

328
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.480
they're obviously fully erupted.

329
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.920
I mean. for instance this tooth here.
the roots are fully formed.

330
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.440
LAZER (off screen):
Means that we're not looking

331
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.360
at a really. really young child?

332
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.120
MIDDLETON: No. it's someone who's got
fairly well-developed secondary teeth.

333
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.080
so probably looking
at something around five plus.

334
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.800
LAZER: Okay. this is number two.

335
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.720
(camera beeps)

336
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.880
MIDDLETON: So. teeth.
you can definitely see teeth.

337
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.200
-LAZER: Oh yeah. lots.
-MIDDLETON: Look at them.

338
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.360
They're primary teeth.
But where are the secondary teeth?

339
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.560
That should make it easier
to get an age estimate.

340
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.840
-LAZER: And you reckon it's...
-MIDDLETON: And I--

341
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.160
It would appear to be

342
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.000
probably a little bit younger
than the previous one.

343
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.200
NARRATOR: <i>On this. Maiuri's estimate</i>
<i>of four or five years old was correct.</i>

344
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.760
<i>Young children. with everything</i>
<i>in front of them.</i>

345
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.960
<i>For archaeologists like Kevin Dicus.</i>

346
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.960
<i>understanding what life was like</i>
<i>for children here</i>

347
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.280
<i>is a challenge.</i>

348
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.520
<i>Across Pompeii.</i>
<i>they seem almost invisible.</i>

349
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.760
DICUS: Wow. what a house this is.

350
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.200
This is absolutely
the house of a very wealthy.

351
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.440
influential aristocrat.

352
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.200
How often do you see
an entirely mosaiced atrium?

353
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.040
We even have a mosaiced peacock.

354
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.480
a symbol of opulence.

355
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.560
It's beautiful...

356
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.520
everything suggests leisure.

357
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.480
suggests enjoyment of life.

358
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.160
(birds singing)

359
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.960
NARRATOR: <i>Designed for</i>
<i>entertaining guests.</i>

360
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.360
<i>this was an adult world.</i>

361
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.600
<i>Across Pompeii. there are</i>
<i>no spaces dedicated to children.</i>

362
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.200
<i>To get into their world</i>
<i>requires a closer look.</i>

363
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.800
DICUS (off screen): A plaster wall
can serve as a sort of canvas

364
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.240
for anybody to engrave names or figures
or whatever they wanted.

365
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.840
Here we just have a series
of lines. horizontal. diagonal--

366
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.760
I can't identify anything here.

367
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.800
But I can identify something right here.

368
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.480
Always lower to the ground.

369
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.720
we can find stylized figures
of animals or people.

370
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.560
Here we have an animal.

371
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.240
Here we have a very simple rectangle
representing the torso

372
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.320
and a stylized head. here.

373
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.320
Down below. vertical lines
representing the legs.

374
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.960
I'm not sure what sort of animal it is.

375
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.480
but it's definitely
from the hand of a child.

376
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.480
NARRATOR: <i>Kids' graffiti like this</i>
<i>crops up all over Pompeii.</i>

377
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.720
<i>The wealthier children</i>
<i>had other entertainment. too.</i>

378
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.280
DR. GRETE STEFANI: In a monument
at Porta Nocera necropolis.

379
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.640
I excavated a grave. and inside it I found

380
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.880
this collection of small animals

381
00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.160
made from bone.

382
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.600
It's a mother dog with her puppies

383
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.080
DICUS (in Italian): So lovely.

384
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.640
STEFANI: There were also
some small animals

385
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.440
made from amber. like this cow

386
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.040
and a small amber soldier.

387
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.280
DICUS:
Ah. <i>si. si. si.</i>

388
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.320
STEFANI: And also
some tiny vases. like this.

389
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.040
Like all of these things.
they were children's toys.

390
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.360
(Dicus speaking Italian)

391
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.000
DICUS (in Italian): So beautiful.

392
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.920
NARRATOR: <i>Never before seen on television.</i>

393
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.080
<i>this collection was found</i>
<i>in the tomb of a grown woman.</i>

394
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.440
<i>Objects so precious.</i>
<i>that she had kept them her entire life.</i>

395
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.520
DICUS (off screen): It's incredible.

396
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.240
They're such a tangible reminder
to us that in 79 AD.

397
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.320
there were children everywhere
in the city of Pompeii.

398
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.320
NARRATOR: <i>According to Maiuri.</i>
<i>the second family was made up</i>

399
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.520
<i>of a young farming couple</i>
<i>and another child.</i>

400
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.960
<i>described as their slender</i>
<i>and undernourished daughter.</i>

401
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200
VU (off screen): Go down
the lowest you can get. right?

402
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.200
NARRATOR: <i>Apparently a similar size</i>
<i>to the other children.</i>

403
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.040
<i>this cast has a surprise</i>
<i>in store for the team.</i>

404
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.000
LUYCK (off screen): Ready.

405
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.720
LAZER: I'd say blitz it.

406
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.200
(camera beeps. shutter clicks)

407
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.240
NARRATOR: <i>In Pompeii.</i>
<i>forensic dentist Alain Middleton</i>

408
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.200
<i>is examining one of the smallest children</i>
<i>in the Fugitives group.</i>

409
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.440
MIDDLETON: Well. this is
quite interesting. this view.

410
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.120
because we can see a jumble of teeth.

411
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.440
It's showing us in. right in
the center of the picture there.

412
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.840
a lot of dental information...

413
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.160
And most of these teeth. the development
of the roots is incomplete.

414
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.720
This is the second primary molar.

415
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.640
This tooth hasn't fully erupted.

416
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.880
<i>This is a very good pointer</i>
<i>as to the age of this individual.</i>

417
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.080
<i>It's definitely an infant.</i>

418
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.720
Probably around about 12-14 months

419
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.040
through to about 15-16 months.

420
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.320
NARRATOR: <i>The milk teeth emerge in stages</i>

421
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.880
<i>through early childhood.</i>

422
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.760
<i>A molar like this.</i>
<i>still embedded in the bone and gum.</i>

423
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.480
<i>gives a reliable age estimate.</i>

424
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.960
LAZER (off screen): That's amazing.
because babies don't always survive

425
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.840
very well in the archaeological record.

426
00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.640
The bones weren't recognized
as a scientific resource

427
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.240
until relatively recently.
so they weren't stored very carefully.

428
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.760
and infant bones are quite
different looking to adult bones.

429
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.240
so it's quite possible

430
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.600
that they weren't even recognized
as human.

431
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.280
<i>This is a fantastic discovery.</i>

432
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.880
NARRATOR: <i>This is the youngest child</i>
<i>to be identified by the team.</i>

433
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.480
<i>in Pompeii.</i>

434
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.280
<i>A remarkable discovery...</i>

435
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.400
<i>a child barely able to walk.</i>

436
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.160
<i>Dealing with an infant</i>
<i>would have certainly slowed</i>

437
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.640
<i>the Fugitives down.</i>

438
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.000
<i>But they stuck together until the end.</i>

439
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.480
MEYER: <i>When a disaster occurs.</i>
<i>some people will go rogue.</i>

440
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.520
<i>They'll act for themselves and run off.</i>

441
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.160
(speaking in foreign language)

442
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.320
But the greater norm is to go ahead
and stay with the group.

443
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.480
<i>There's a certain sense</i>
<i>of emotional reassurance</i>

444
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.200
<i>of just being with others.</i>

445
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.840
<i>It's also the case we like</i>
<i>to look after each other.</i>

446
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.680
So. if we see an elderly person

447
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.920
<i>or if we see a child.</i>

448
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.080
<i>our tendency is to.</i>
<i>to wanna stay back and help them.</i>

449
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.920
<i>This instinct to stay with others</i>
<i>is so. so powerful</i>

450
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.480
<i>that often. that trumps</i>

451
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.560
<i>our individual desires</i>
<i>to survive by ourselves.</i>

452
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.800
NARRATOR: <i>The layers</i>
<i>of pumice here are so thick</i>

453
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.160
<i>that volcanologists believe</i>
<i>it kept falling right through the night.</i>

454
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.480
(rumbling)

455
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.400
<i>The Fugitives. found above these layers.</i>

456
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.720
<i>survived until morning.</i>
<i>when a new threat emerged.</i>

457
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.320
IACOVINO: What's really fascinating
about this deposit in particular

458
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.440
is that you can put your finger
on the exact moment

459
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.520
that the eruption switched
from the pumice fallout phase

460
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.000
to the pyroclastic flow phase. just here.

461
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.800
Everything beneath this layer is pumice
that had fallen from the sky.

462
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.400
<i>This was that stuff</i>
<i>that was raining out of a cloud</i>

463
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.600
<i>that had shot more than 30 kilometers</i>
<i>above the summit of the volcano.</i>

464
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.000
<i>Once that pumice rained out.</i>

465
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.680
<i>that column began to collapse in on itself</i>

466
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.200
gathering up and then shooting down
the steep slopes.

467
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.400
NARRATOR: <i>As the eruption lost power.</i>

468
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.760
<i>the central column gave way to gravity.</i>

469
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.320
<i>Clouds of ash and hot gas.</i>
<i>known as pyroclastic flows.</i>

470
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.880
<i>raced down the flanks of Vesuvius</i>
<i>at over 100 miles an hour.</i>

471
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.000
IACOVINO: So you can imagine
being someone in Pompeii

472
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.720
who had survived
this disastrous downpour of pumice.

473
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.240
you're thinking maybe things are safe now
and the eruption is over.

474
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.920
but things were actually about
to get a whole lot worse.

475
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.080
NARRATOR: <i>As pyroclastic flows</i>
<i>raced down the flanks of Vesuvius.</i>

476
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.520
<i>time was almost up for anyone</i>
<i>that had stayed in Pompeii.</i>

477
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.960
<i>Altogether. more than 80 victims</i>
<i>of these flows are preserved in plaster.</i>

478
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.960
-LUYCK: You're ready?
-LAZER: Okay.

479
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.480
NARRATOR: <i>Dr. Lazer plans</i>
<i>to x-ray them all.</i>

480
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.600
<i>Including the casts on display</i>
<i>at the entrance to the ruins.</i>

481
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.720
-LAZER: So. left hand. please and--
-LUYCK: We will see what we get.

482
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.280
LAZER (off screen): Okay. thank you.

483
00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040
(camera beeps)

484
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.760
LAZER: Oh. look. Oh. my god.

485
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.480
What's that there?

486
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.080
That doesn't look like bone at all.

487
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.480
LUYCK: It is metal.

488
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.200
LAZER: It's metal. for sure.

489
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.520
I think we need a clearer view of that.

490
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.640
Okay.

491
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.520
That's super clear now. Look at that.

492
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.040
That looks like a ring. doesn't it?

493
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.200
So. you can see that
the metal has corroded.

494
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.600
But you can still see the form
of the ring around the finger.

495
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.320
Yeah. That's fantastic.

496
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.240
NARRATOR: <i>To find out what the ring</i>
<i>could tell us about this victim.</i>

497
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.920
<i>Kevin has gained access</i>
<i>to some of the valuables found</i>

498
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.160
<i>when Pompeii was excavated.</i>

499
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.680
DICUS: We've got these
beautiful gold chains...

500
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.760
gold earrings with pearl drops.

501
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.560
Many of these were found
in association with the bodies.

502
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.640
We've got these beautiful examples
of gold rings. set with gemstones.

503
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.280
Go down the line. we have silver examples.

504
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.160
This one exhibits
a little bit of corrosion.

505
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.080
It's not quite as perfect
as the gold rings.

506
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.000
When we start to get down the spectrum.

507
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.920
we see more and more corrosion.

508
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.480
We can take a look
at the bronze ring here.

509
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.920
And of course.
coming down here. the iron rings.

510
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.440
Ours. as it looks in the x-ray.
exhibits a lot of corrosion.

511
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.320
So. we could say
it's definitely not a gold ring.

512
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.360
It's perhaps an iron ring.
or maybe even a silver ring.

513
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.680
NARRATOR: <i>The metal of</i>
<i>an oval setting is perfectly preserved.</i>

514
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.520
<i>suggesting the presence of a gemstone.</i>

515
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.320
<i>But the rest of the ring</i>
<i>has clearly corroded over time.</i>

516
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.360
DICUS: <i>So. this is not</i>
<i>an elite piece of jewelry.</i>

517
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.280
<i>it's not remarkably expensive.</i>

518
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.120
<i>But there is a gemstone set into it.</i>

519
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.320
<i>So it's not an incredibly humble model.</i>

520
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.800
<i>it still cost some money.</i>

521
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.760
<i>And it does say something</i>
<i>about this person.</i>

522
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.160
<i>Maybe he is not an aristocrat.</i>
<i>the wealthiest person</i>

523
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.200
<i>but he is trying to communicate</i>
<i>something with this.</i>

524
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.680
<i>And for him this is a very.</i>
<i>very personal piece of adornment.</i>

525
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.720
NARRATOR: <i>This ring was worn proudly</i>
<i>until the day of the eruption...</i>

526
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.840
<i>when all of these valuables</i>
<i>suddenly became worthless.</i>

527
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.200
<i>In the story created by Maiuri.</i>

528
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.480
<i>the third family in the group</i>
<i>was led by a servant...</i>

529
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.400
<i>carrying a sack of provisions.</i>

530
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.640
<i>On the hunt for more artifacts.</i>

531
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.720
<i>it's an obvious target</i>
<i>for the forensic team.</i>

532
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.080
LUYCK: You have to go. like.
that much deeper I think.

533
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.520
What do you think. Julia?

534
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.880
On the right-hand side completely. yeah--

535
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.200
LAZER (off screen):
You can see where the lump is.

536
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.320
LUYCK (off screen): Yeah. we will start
with the shoulder?

537
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.520
LAZER: Start with the shoulder
and just work round.

538
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.800
and as many angles and as possible.

539
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.520
-LUYCK: One. two. three...
-(camera beeps. shutter clicks)

540
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.320
-VU (off screen): Nothing--
-MIDDLETON (off screen): Nothing.

541
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.080
-It's just plaster.
-VU: Nothing.

542
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.600
LAZER (off screen):
And it's not there?

543
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.560
LUYCK (off screen): It's not there.

544
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.440
NARRATOR: <i>There's no sign</i>
<i>of a sack. or provisions.</i>

545
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.720
<i>Nothing that matches Maiuri's suggestion</i>
<i>that this was a servant.</i>

546
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.160
LAZER (off screen):
I think if you. the x-rays...

547
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.960
DICUS: Wow. look at that.

548
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.320
NARRATOR: <i>But further analysis</i>
<i>of the skeleton</i>

549
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.080
<i>does reveal something</i>
<i>of this victim's true identity.</i>

550
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.880
LAZER:
<i>Unfortunately. there are no teeth</i>

551
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.720
<i>that could be studied in the skull</i>

552
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.360
so our age estimate's
purely on skeletal evidence.

553
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.200
And what we're looking at
is the lower leg bone...

554
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.880
and the foot areas around the ankle.

555
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.040
-DICUS: Right.
-LAZER: This is the growth plate

556
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.080
that hasn't yet closed.

557
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.080
So we're looking at someone
possibly in their mid-teens.

558
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.280
DICUS (off screen): Wow!

559
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.520
NARRATOR: <i>In adolescence.</i>
<i>some of the bones are still</i>

560
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.640
<i>in the process of fusing together.</i>

561
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.680
<i>The presence of this growth plate</i>
<i>tells us the age</i>

562
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.680
<i>of this so-called servant when they died.</i>

563
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.960
<i>This teenager</i>
<i>clearly contradicts one theory</i>

564
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.200
<i>about those who failed to escape.</i>

565
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.720
DICUS (off screen): But this was sort
of the legend of the victims

566
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.360
that's been circulated for so long is.

567
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.400
there's been a limitation or some reason
why they were left behind.

568
00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.520
why they died. they were too young.
too old. too infirm.

569
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.600
We're starting to get a sense that this
actually really isn't the case.

570
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.920
LAZER: Mm. yeah. absolutely.
I mean. we have a range of ages

571
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.680
so we do have very young individuals.

572
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.280
but we've also got older ones.

573
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.440
we've got people who are in their teens.

574
00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.120
So. a good selection of the population.

575
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.840
DICUS: <i>Right. right.</i>
<i>suddenly we're not talking</i>

576
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.120
<i>about physical limitations as being</i>
<i>the cause of these deaths.</i>

577
00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.560
<i>It could be a multitude of reasons</i>
<i>why they decided to stay back.</i>

578
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.800
NARRATOR: <i>To complete their work</i>
<i>on the purported servant.</i>

579
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.480
<i>the team move on to the feet.</i>

580
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.240
-LUYCK (off screen): Is that nails?
-LAZER: Oh!

581
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.000
-VU: The metatarsal's there--
-LAZER: Oh!

582
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.000
Oh. my gosh.

583
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.040
You know what. I think
you're right. they are nails.

584
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.800
So. they had shoes on. look at that!

585
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.960
LUYCK: It's part of a shoe. yeah.

586
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.760
LAZER: Wow. they're really good.

587
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.080
VU: Seems to have two rows of nails...

588
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.800
-MIDDLETON: Yeah.
-VU: ...parallel to each other

589
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.760
-LAZER: It's amazing--
-MIDDLETON: One. two...

590
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.000
three. four. five. six. seven...

591
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.680
NARRATOR: <i>Clearly visible</i>
<i>in the x-ray. these are hobnails.</i>

592
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.160
<i>from the sole of a practical</i>
<i>and well-made sandal.</i>

593
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.800
<i>Hardly the footwear of someone</i>
<i>Maiuri described as a lowly servant.</i>

594
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.760
<i>From a victim</i>
<i>in the so-called Merchant's family.</i>

595
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.560
<i>there's also a clue to how</i>
<i>the Fugitive's final moments played out.</i>

596
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.000
LAZER: <i>Well. as you can</i>
<i>see both the feet are together</i>.

597
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.080
DICUS: <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

598
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.840
LAZER: And what we can see
is there's a cluster of metal nails

599
00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.440
associated with the right foot.
none with the left foot

600
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.480
<i>so it looks like while they were fleeing</i>
<i>they lost the left sandal.</i>

601
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.560
DICUS: <i>Oh.</i>

602
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.800
LAZER: The idea that somebody's
running away from a terrible fate

603
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.800
<i>and they lose a shoe</i>
<i>and they just keep going.</i>

604
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.160
<i>it's a very compelling image</i>
<i>of people trying to escape</i>

605
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.080
<i>literally the end of the world.</i>

606
00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.360
(rumbling)

607
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.880
NARRATOR: <i>Just after dawn</i>
<i>on the second day of the eruption.</i>

608
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.560
<i>a huge pyroclastic flow raced down</i>
<i>the flanks of Vesuvius...</i>

609
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.880
<i>and tore through Pompeii.</i>

610
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.920
<i>The Fugitives were engulfed immediately.</i>

611
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.360
<i>To find out what happened to them.</i>

612
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.480
<i>Kayla is examining three nearby victims</i>

613
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.920
<i>that were hit by the same flow.</i>

614
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.800
IACOVINO (off screen): We got clues as
to how these people would have died

615
00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.160
based on the poses
that the bodies are found in...

616
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:09.480
with the arms bent. pulled in
tightly close to the body.

617
00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.320
Here you can see the elbow bent

618
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.560
as if he's bringing his arm in

619
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.080
to protect his face.

620
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.600
That's kind of what it looks like.

621
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.440
as well his legs are bent.
flexed at the knees.

622
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.080
So. we know from modern eruptions.

623
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.040
where pyroclastic flows
have moved through villages

624
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.240
that the bodies end up in poses similar
to what we see here in Pompeii.

625
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.840
(siren wailing)

626
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.800
(people shouting in foreign language)

627
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.760
NARRATOR: <i>In 2018.</i>
<i>a Guatemalan volcano called Fuego</i>

628
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.160
<i>produced devastating pyroclastic flows.</i>

629
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.000
(men speaking in foreign language)

630
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.520
(girl screams)

631
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.360
<i>Bodies pulled from the ash</i>
<i>were frozen in position.</i>

632
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.240
<i>with arms and legs bent inwards.</i>

633
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.800
IACOVINO: <i>A pyroclastic flow</i>
<i>can be 200 or 300 degrees.</i>

634
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.240
and that causes the muscles
to dehydrate instantly.

635
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.280
causing them to then
flex inward due to contraction.

636
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.680
and they end up in this pose.
which we call a pugilistic attitude.

637
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.440
kind of like a boxer protecting
his face with his. with his fists.

638
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.560
But it's really this action
of the dehydration of the muscles

639
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.880
that's causing the body
to contract and tense in this way.

640
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.000
<i>So. they would have instantaneously</i>
<i>swept up in this cloud.</i>

641
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.960
<i>Cooked in place by the hot gases.</i>

642
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.480
NARRATOR: <i>Of the Fugitives.</i>
<i>a number of victims show similar poses.</i>

643
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.320
<i>Contorted by the heat</i>
<i>during their final. desperate moments.</i>

644
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.920
MEYER: These are people
probably who should have left

645
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.600
many. many hours earlier.

646
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.720
They didn't.

647
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.680
<i>And they were left behind.</i>
<i>and they were kind of watching</i>

648
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.480
<i>the world collapse around them.</i>

649
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.560
<i>And then ultimately this group decides.</i>

650
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.320
<i>look. our only chance</i>
<i>for survival is we have to brave</i>

651
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.640
<i>the elements outside.</i>

652
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.560
<i>Of course. in this case what happened.</i>
<i>it was really too late.</i>

653
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.400
NARRATOR: <i>What remains is</i>
<i>a three-dimensional impression</i>

654
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.600
<i>of the moment the Fugitives died together.</i>

655
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.880
MEYER: <i>This is very rare.</i>

656
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.840
<i>We never really get to see people</i>

657
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.240
<i>in the moment</i>
<i>of their last conscious thought.</i>

658
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.800
<i>In some cases. we spend that last moment</i>
<i>trying to protect ourselves.</i>

659
00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.720
<i>And in other cases.</i>
<i>we go ahead and reach out</i>

660
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.440
<i>to someone who is close to us.</i>

661
00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.320
<i>We see that incredible diversity here.</i>

662
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.720
<i>and in that sense it's a remarkable image.</i>

663
00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.360
NARRATOR: <i>Before the investigation.</i>

664
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.520
<i>the Fugitives were known</i>
<i>by the identities created</i>

665
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.080
<i>for them by Amedeo Maiuri.</i>

666
00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600
<i>The Merchant...</i>

667
00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.920
<i>The Farmer's Daughter...</i>

668
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.800
<i>and The Servant.</i>

669
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.960
<i>The team has found nothing</i>
<i>to support these claims.</i>

670
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.520
<i>But a new picture is emerging.</i>

671
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.760
LAZER: <i>We know</i>
<i>the ages range from pretty young infants.</i>

672
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.280
<i>through young childhood</i>
<i>into the teen years</i>

673
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.840
<i>and right into older adult age.</i>

674
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.160
We know something about
the health of the individuals.

675
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.480
<i>So slowly. slowly we're learning</i>
<i>about who these people were.</i>

676
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.720
NARRATOR: <i>By determining</i>
<i>the age profile of the Fugitives.</i>

677
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.960
<i>the team has also challenged</i>
<i>another theory about Pompeii's victims.</i>

678
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.600
<i>that they were too old. too young.</i>

679
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.800
<i>or too infirm to escape.</i>

680
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.720
DICUS: <i>What we're seeing here</i>
<i>is something very different.</i>

681
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.160
We're looking at a full range
and really not one of them.

682
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.000
as I can see.

683
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.280
has a condition that would
preclude them from escaping.

684
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.240
And so. it's something beyond physical
that caused them to stay.

685
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.160
<i>it was decisions.</i>

686
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.960
<i>And this is very important</i>
<i>because they're not passive.</i>

687
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.240
<i>They made decisions.</i>

688
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.600
<i>It's a new way to look</i>
<i>at these individuals.</i>

689
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.880
LAZER: And hopefully we've given back

690
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.200
<i>a little bit of their lives to them.</i>

691
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.400
DICUS:
<i>And a little bit of their voice.</i>

692
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.880
LAZER: <i>And I guess in</i>
<i>the first century AD. in Roman culture.</i>

693
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.600
to be remembered was very important.

694
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.480
So. I think even though
it was completely inadvertent

695
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.520
<i>you know. their death</i>
<i>in this horrible event</i>

696
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.520
<i>has led in some way</i>
<i>towards making them immortal.</i>
