00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.833
Based on the book by Jan Guillou

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:45.833
Arn - The Knight Templar

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:55.000
The Holy Land

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:01.875
The war raged
between Christians and Muslims

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:07.583
in a battle over the city
that was sacred to them all: Jerusalem.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.583
Assaults and robberies made it dangerous
to travel in the inhospitable country.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.083
In order to protect
travellers. the church...

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:15.667
sent their most-feared warriors:

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.708
The Knights Templar.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.417
For some. they were
God-blessed soldiers.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:38.500
For others they were
the devil and evil demons.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.417
It is him.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:14.875
- The devil with the Red Cross.
- "Al Ghouti."

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.875
Why does he help us?

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.833
Al Ghouti.

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:52.333
Arn.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.958
Arn!

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:11.917
Many years earlier. in the cold
Nordic countries. Arn Magnusson grew up.

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:16.708
His fate would be decisive
for many peoples' life and death.

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:18.958
Arn!

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.333
Arn! Where are you?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.333
It is not fun anymore.

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:33.417
Arn. come out now!

00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:36.625
Yes. you are dead!

00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:00.583
What are you doing out here alone? What?

00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:05.958
This is no place for small boys.

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:15.833
Arn was born on the farm Arn s in
West G taland (Gothia) in South Sweden.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.875
a small kingdom where three powerful
dynasties competed for the crown.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.292
Arn?

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:28.333
Arns parents.
who belonged to the Folkung dynasty.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.125
had long kept the peace
with their neighbors.

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:33.417
Eskil!

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.292
- Have you seen the boys?
- No. Sigrid. my wife.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.792
Get Mr Magnus! His brother is here.

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:03.625
- I found them north of the creek.
- Are you completely out of your mind?

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:08.708
What is it with you?
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:13.625
- Never go alone into the forest. Never!
- No.

00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:16.458
In with you now!

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:20.458
- Birger!
- Magnus!

00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.417
- What brings you here. brother?
- The King is on the way.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:34.875
King Erik Jevardsson tried
to strengthen their power

00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:38.958
against the most dangerous enemy:
the Sverkers ("Swedes").

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:46.583
He had allowed construction of a church
that now would bear his name:

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:53.167
I want to cement our long friendship
in the Church's sacred land.

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:56.167
Do I have your support. Folkung-Clan?

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:59.917
Or do I have to leave
your house as your enemy?

00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:05.833
Knut. get your jinx out of here!

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:12.667
Choosing the right side was crucial:
Knut knew from his father

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:17.667
that those who fought for the crown
could gain much.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:21.667
but they could also lose everything.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:35.583
- So you'll be king one day?
- Father says it's decided by God.

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:42.083
He says that my son will be king.
and my grandson. and my grandson's son.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.875
And your great-great-
great-great-grandson.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:54.750
- Can I hold him?
- Mm.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:08:02.000
- Oops. sorry!
- He always comes back.

00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:13.667
Folkung supported the king Erik.
so that he could inaugurate the church.

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:19.250
A "God's house" (church) -
but located on Sverker land.

00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:17.708
How dare you attack God's house?

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.750
No!

00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:41.833
Listen to me. Folkungs!

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:47.500
Now there is only one legitimate king
in West G taland (Gothia).

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:51.208
and it's me. Karl Sverkersson.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.417
Who is he?

00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.583
Is that his son?

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:13.833
No. he is with me.

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:45.750
Knut is not safe here. I say we send him
to his brothers in Norway.

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:57.500
The sword was from the sheath. and...

00:10:57.583 --> 00:11:01.667
the people turned around
to God with fear.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:06.167
Because only God knew
what the future would bring

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:10.792
and who would be friend or enemy.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.667
On Monday the Arn s family prepared
for uncertain times.

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:22.042
and Arn would soon get to know God's
intentions for him and his family.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:38.333
- Will there be war now?
- No. don't worry.

00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:46.417
We have a new king. That's all.

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.500
So it is.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.792
Where is Knut?

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:59.458
He is in Norway.

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:03.417
But should Knut not be king?

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:08.167
With God's help he will
claim the throne one day.

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:15.208
- We have to be patient.
- No. Ingmar! Those go to the forge.

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:19.417
Arn. come!

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:33.500
- Look!
- It is Knut's bird.

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:50.875
No. Arn! You should not go up there.

00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:57.500
Arn! Don't do that!

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.708
Arn!

00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:34.292
Ouch!

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.500
Mother! Mother!

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:43.708
- Mother. come!
- Arn!

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.292
Arn!

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.667
Arn!

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:59.750
- Arn. do you hear me?
- What happened?

00:13:59.917 --> 00:14:04.208
I told him he was not
allowed to go up there.

00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:06.875
Arn?

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:15.000
We must not give up hope. Magnus.

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.750
Come!

00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:44.042
Good God. make Arn healthy again.

00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:51.250
If you let him live.
we promise to repay you.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:07.708
We promise to let him do
your sacred work.

00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:15.125
He will be your servant on earth.

00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:21.958
God. we give you our promise.

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:29.500
God. we give you our promise.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.583
We give you our promise.

00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:47.750
Panem nostrum quotidianum
da nobis hodie...

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:46.542
Magnus...

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.292
Our prayer has been answered.

00:19:00.542 --> 00:19:06.417
- Listen now. I've decided.
- You can't be serious.

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:09.667
He is just a child.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.333
We promised. Magnus.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.292
No. Sigrid. I will not send
my boy to the monastery.

00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:24.250
Do you think I want to do it?

00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:29.333
I can no longer turn a blind eye
for my sin.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.292
- He is just a child.
- We promised. Magnus.

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:43.333
If God let Arn live. we would
give him to his holy church.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.958
God has a task for Arn.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:55.250
For something so large
we should not stand in the way.

00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:08.333
It is God's punishment. Magnus.
We have betrayed him.

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:14.583
This is how he reminds us.

00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:35.667
We must meet our promise.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.750
I take him to Varnhem monastery.

00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:31.000
- Father Henri.
- My children.

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:34.375
Father. I need your help.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.417
What is it. my child?

00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:55.542
We have an extra
blanket if it gets cold.

00:21:56.458 --> 00:21:58.917
Where is mother?

00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:02.500
We will do what we can for her.

00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:33.667
The boy...

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.708
Brother Lucien has examined the mother.

00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:39.958
The sores on her face are
quite consistent with swine fever.

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:44.542
That we can cure.
Her arm...

00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:48.792
It is blood poisoning.
There's only one cure for that.

00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:52.125
It has to be removed?

00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:56.708
The mother refuses.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.958
She says it is the will of God.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.792
She and her husband
promised the child to God.

00:23:08.917 --> 00:23:11.625
Thus the promise is a sacred trust.

00:23:11.792 --> 00:23:15.208
We cannot oppose the will of God.

00:23:15.417 --> 00:23:20.208
But I'm reluctant to raise a child
to become a monk.

00:23:23.167 --> 00:23:27.917
To become one of us
must be a free choice.

00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:48.875
Father Henri has promised
that you are allowed to stay here.

00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:56.583
It is God's will. Arn.
Do you understand?

00:23:57.792 --> 00:24:01.583
Will you stay here as well. mother?

00:24:10.167 --> 00:24:14.750
Be obedient and do as you are told.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.292
Promise me that.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.083
Do you promise?

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:21.167
You want to try? Good.

00:25:23.042 --> 00:25:25.625
Want to try?

00:25:36.292 --> 00:25:39.000
How are you? There. take it.

00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:42.375
Hold it tight.

00:25:43.958 --> 00:25:47.083
And now... Aim.

00:25:49.958 --> 00:25:52.583
And now try to hit the target.

00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:02.417
Very good!

00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:06.583
Good. Again.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.542
Very good!

00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:11.083
Look!

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.500
I told you. always look in my eye.

00:26:13.667 --> 00:26:18.042
- Voce.
- Voce.

00:26:18.208 --> 00:26:21.875
Vocamus... scribo...

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:26.667
- Scribis.
- Scribis.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.500
- Voco.
- Voce.

00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:35.625
- Voco.
- Voce.

00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:53.583
Arn!

00:26:55.333 --> 00:27:00.000
Arn! Arn. wake up!

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:02.083
Come!

00:28:36.417 --> 00:28:41.792
"Thou hast ravished my heart.
my sister. my spouse;

00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:46.417
"thou hast ravished my heart
with one of thine eyes.

00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:52.625
"with one chain of thy neck."

00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:56.083
The song of Solomon is
the most beautiful text...

00:28:56.208 --> 00:28:58.708
about love that has ever been written.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.167
But how can you "ravish"
(take) someone's heart?

00:29:03.417 --> 00:29:08.000
It is meant figuratively. Arn.

00:29:16.417 --> 00:29:22.000
"Legere est omnis
scientiae fundamentum."

00:29:22.167 --> 00:29:25.167
Now write it.

00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:29.458
Reading is the foundation
of all knowledge.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.917
What?

00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:53.333
In which hand does
it feel most comfortable?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.417
Both.

00:30:01.917 --> 00:30:04.292
Again.

00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:06.875
Bien.

00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:12.458
Regarde!

00:30:19.125 --> 00:30:22.625
You seem to be training
him to be a warrior.

00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:28.042
Is that entirely wise?

00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:30.542
I am merely strengthening	...

00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:34.042
the skills that God
has already given him.

00:30:43.792 --> 00:30:46.958
You have a new friend. Look!

00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:49.833
What a beautiful horse!

00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:59.333
- What kind of horse is that?
- Well...

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:05.333
He belongs to the noblest. the fastest
and the most resilient breed there is.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.792
- They are war horses.
- Where is he from?

00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:14.750
The Holy Land.

00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:41.000
- Can you speak to him?
- I can speak to desert horses.

00:31:47.208 --> 00:31:49.708
I think he likes you.

00:31:49.917 --> 00:31:53.250
Tell him that I like him. too.

00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:56.292
What's his name?

00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:58.167
Chamsiin.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.625
Cham... siin.

00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:04.500
It means "Desert Wind."

00:32:04.708 --> 00:32:07.708
Do you want to ride him?

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:19.167
Good! Can you feel
the strength of the horse?

00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:25.167
Good!

00:33:28.958 --> 00:33:33.750
- Help me! I do not want to!
- There she is!

00:33:33.917 --> 00:33:38.583
- I beg you. help me!
- Come on. Gunnar. come!

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:43.125
- Sinner!
- Where is she?! She's my bride.

00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:51.417
- No. let me!
- Let's do justice.

00:33:57.583 --> 00:34:02.375
- You wanted to take my bride?
- He is innocent!

00:34:02.542 --> 00:34:07.667
Just as innocent as you are!
You want to prevent my wedding?

00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:13.000
Do what you have to. brother.

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:17.917
Calm down!
He is only a young monk.

00:34:27.542 --> 00:34:31.042
Take it. boy! Pick it up!

00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:38.708
Pick it up!

00:34:47.542 --> 00:34:50.167
Take it. now!

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.708
Do it. Gunnar!

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:43.875
Forgive me. Father.
for I have sinned.

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:49.875
I have committed the gravest of sins.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.458
I have killed two men.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:02.333
That is the end of your
confession. my son?

00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:09.375
All thy sins I thee forgive.
Ego te absolvo.

00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:12.667
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:17.583
I do not understand.

00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:19.625
Sit.

00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:28.083
You killed those men in self-defense.
They were sinners.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.042
trying to force that poor girl
to marry against her will.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:37.083
It might not have been a miracle
as that simple-minded priest said.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:41.917
but who if not God was it
that put them in your way?

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.083
Arn...

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.250
It was your mother's will. and God's.

00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:54.792
that you'd be raised
here in this monastery.

00:36:54.958 --> 00:36:58.167
Well. and now that you're grown up.
and must do the Lord's calling.

00:36:58.375 --> 00:37:02.125
Brother Guilbert and I
have discussed this.

00:37:02.292 --> 00:37:05.000
And we have reached a decision.

00:37:07.583 --> 00:37:10.958
The time has come for
you to go home. Arn.

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:14.917
You must go back to your family.

00:37:20.042 --> 00:37:23.042
"In this sign thou shall conquer."

00:37:27.292 --> 00:37:31.708
Before I came here
to this peaceful monastery...

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:35.167
...I served another order:

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.833
God's holy army.

00:37:38.042 --> 00:37:39.917
The Knights Templar.

00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:47.958
For twelve years I fought
with this sword in the Holy Land.

00:37:49.917 --> 00:37:53.625
With this sword.
no one has ever defeated me.

00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:01.833
You may never draw it in anger
or use it for your own gain.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.917
It has to serve God's good cause.

00:38:36.083 --> 00:38:40.708
Ave Maria...

00:39:31.542 --> 00:39:33.792
Cecilia!

00:39:33.958 --> 00:39:38.833
- Gra--
- Gracias...

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:06.042
You have let your animals
graze on my land.

00:40:06.208 --> 00:40:11.042
- They must graze there.
- It is not your land.

00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:18.417
- You lie to me. straight in the face?
- The land has always belonged to us.

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:25.333
- I am willing to swear an oath on that.
- We will see what you have to say.

00:40:31.417 --> 00:40:34.292
See you. liar!

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.917
And who are you?

00:40:45.542 --> 00:40:47.458
Eskil!

00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:51.667
Father.

00:40:57.042 --> 00:41:00.000
Arn?

00:41:00.125 --> 00:41:02.750
It's you...

00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:12.542
I didn't recognize you.

00:41:29.833 --> 00:41:34.750
I thought we had lost you
to the monks.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.042
I'm happy to have you back.

00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:50.167
"When you pick bullshit instead".
she says no!

00:41:51.833 --> 00:41:55.750
Arn. my boy! Stand up!

00:41:57.542 --> 00:42:01.708
You are a Folkung now.
Wear it with pride.

00:42:06.417 --> 00:42:10.333
Father. who was the man who was here?

00:42:12.167 --> 00:42:13.792
- Emund Ulvbane.

00:42:13.958 --> 00:42:18.000
He is the bastard who killed King Erik.

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:25.208
Now he says that we have taken his land.

00:42:25.417 --> 00:42:27.458
We'll present this dispute
at the Ting meeting.

00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:30.292
The Ting in Axevalla.

00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:34.833
Quite a lot of things have changed.

00:43:12.125 --> 00:43:15.792
Magnus! Eskil!

00:43:17.208 --> 00:43:22.250
And Arn! I am pleased
that you are back on Arn s.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.125
- Likewise glad to see you.

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:30.208
You've been a few years
in monastery cells.

00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:34.625
Have you learned how to read?

00:43:34.792 --> 00:43:40.167
- So you can really read now.
- Is Knut here?

00:43:40.375 --> 00:43:43.125
No. he is staying in Norway. When the...

00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:46.292
time is right. he'll
come back. but not yet.

00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:50.167
We have to give Ulvbane
silver. although we have...

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.333
the right on our side.
We need to buy time.

00:43:54.375 --> 00:43:56.917
I intend to propose a settlement.

00:43:57.083 --> 00:44:01.542
It worries me that Ulvbane
and the Swerkers are so close.

00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:06.083
A concerned King is an
unpredictable king.

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:35.708
We have gathered here in Axevall
to keep local governments.

00:44:35.875 --> 00:44:40.375
We come in peace and we go in peace.

00:44:40.958 --> 00:44:43.958
Anyone who violates the
peace of the Ting...

00:44:44.042 --> 00:44:46.083
will be regarded as an outlaw.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:50.333
Here and now this Ting is opened.

00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:02.750
The next question concerns the dispute...

00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:07.458
between Magnus Folkesson
and Emund Ulvbane.

00:45:07.625 --> 00:45:11.500
Magnus Folkesson is willing
to make an offer.

00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:19.500
It is true. I am willing to pay
Emund Ulvbane 30 silver coins.

00:45:21.875 --> 00:45:25.167
It is more than what it's worth.

00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:30.500
for peace between neighbours
is worth more than silver.

00:45:41.458 --> 00:45:44.333
The settlement is adequate.

00:45:50.708 --> 00:45:56.542
As the Ting has decided
I have to be content with that.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:11.042
But it is hard that silver is
more valuable than honour and justice.

00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:16.167
It is hard to reconcile
with a man without honour.

00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:21.958
You. Magnus Folkesson.
you're not a man.

00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:31.333
And your sons are not better:
One is a nun. the second a beer barrel.

00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:41.792
That was planned by Sverkersson.

00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:45.167
The words were planted
into Ulvbanes mouth.

00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:50.000
He knew exactly what to say!
Sverkersson wants to weaken us.

00:46:50.167 --> 00:46:54.250
He knows that Knut can come back
and that he could be the next king.

00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:57.417
I wish that there was a loophole.

00:46:57.583 --> 00:47:03.000
This insult can only be settled in
an ordeal by battle.

00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:06.375
Is there any other way?

00:47:11.292 --> 00:47:17.167
- There must be another way?
- I will meet him tomorrow.

00:47:17.333 --> 00:47:19.417
May God be with me!

00:47:59.083 --> 00:48:01.833
Don't worry about me!

00:48:03.708 --> 00:48:06.625
I am not dead yet.

00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:23.958
Let the combattants step forward!

00:48:31.167 --> 00:48:32.208
- Arn!

00:48:32.292 --> 00:48:35.875
Too late. He has taken up the challenge.

00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:52.917
Do I really have to fight against a nun?

00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:05.083
I didn't think
that your father was a coward.

00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:39.917
- Death to Swerker!
- Kill him. Arn!

00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:42.917
Kill! Kill!

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:25.458
Welcome. Magnus!

00:52:25.583 --> 00:52:29.000
Your fame from Axevall
has arrived before you.

00:52:29.167 --> 00:52:31.875
- Algot. thank you
that we may rest here.

00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:33.000
Eskil!

00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:39.917
- There we have a new face.
- It is Arn.

00:52:40.125 --> 00:52:46.208
Last I saw you you where a toddler.
Now everybody's talking about you.

00:52:46.375 --> 00:52:49.333
You must be a proud father. Magnus.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:46.125
- You think I'm ugly.
- No.

00:55:18.417 --> 00:55:22.458
- Send my greetings to mother.
- Do not be sad. Katarina.

00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:27.708
Soon it is my turn again.

00:55:54.958 --> 00:55:56.958
Welcome home. Cecilia!

00:55:57.042 --> 00:56:00.833
Katarina was so sad
when she had to leave last time.

00:56:01.042 --> 00:56:06.042
It's always like that
when it is her turn to be here.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:10.667
- I promised that I would visit her.
- Cecilia. did you?

00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:08.500
Hello...

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:13.125
- Cecilia.
- Yes. mother.

00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:51.917
Arn. Algot P lsson is here.
He has his daughter with him.

00:57:56.625 --> 00:58:01.667
It is not Katarina.
It is. of course. Cecilia.

00:58:02.833 --> 00:58:06.542
Welcome. Algot! What brings you here?

00:58:06.708 --> 00:58:10.500
We were in the neighborhood. so...

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.917
I just wanted to see how it looks.

00:58:19.083 --> 00:58:22.167
It has been a long
time since I was here.

00:58:35.458 --> 00:58:41.417
Father does not like it when I ride out
alone. That's why he's with us.

00:58:42.167 --> 00:58:48.583
You met my sister.
Katarina... well. you met her?

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.625
- Yes. I did.
- What do you think of her?

00:58:54.792 --> 00:58:58.208
You are not alike.

00:58:58.375 --> 00:59:02.542
- You are quite different.
- What do you mean?

00:59:06.167 --> 00:59:09.625
What a beautiful horse you have!

00:59:12.458 --> 00:59:14.667
Come!

00:59:18.667 --> 00:59:21.833
Come and catch me if you can!

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:03.792
- We almost got rid of him.
- Miss Cecilia!

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:09.833
- Miss Cecilia!
- Meet me here at dawn.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.250
Cecilia!

01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:40.208
Cecilia!

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.958
Cecilia!

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:30.625
Arn?

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:35.125
Arn?

01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:43.583
Stop!

01:01:57.292 --> 01:02:00.083
You have--

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.208
What did you say?

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:06.750
What did you say?

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:14.542
"You have taken my heart.
my sister. my bride;

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:22.875
"You have taken my heart
with a single glance."

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:36.917
I think that you have taken mine.
Arn Magnusson.

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:33.958
How are you?

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.875
I am fine. how are you?

01:03:39.042 --> 01:03:43.250
It was my fault
that you ended up in that monastery.

01:03:46.292 --> 01:03:47.750
Knut?

01:03:57.458 --> 01:04:02.833
- I thought you were in Norway.
- Yeah. it's me.

01:04:10.458 --> 01:04:13.917
It is good to see you again. Arn.

01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:19.667
This is Arn. the hero of Axevall.

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:23.958
Was it with this sword that...?

01:04:26.542 --> 01:04:30.208
Let me have a look.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.042
Let all the saints ensure...

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:45.125
that we are always on
the same side. Arn.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:52.708
- Are you coming to Arn s?
- Not this time.

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:55.833
I have a mission to accomplish.

01:04:57.042 --> 01:05:00.167
But I'll see you soon again.
I promise.

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:32.042
Brothers!

01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:39.833
- What happened?
- Knut has returned.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.125
He has killed Emund Ulvbane.

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:47.625
I've heard that you're
after Algot P lsson's youngest daughter.

01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:57.125
Stay away away from her
or people will start talking.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:06:01.417
Everyone knows that you and Knut
are best friends.

01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:09.167
I have to get hold of him before he
gets up to more devilry.

01:06:11.958 --> 01:06:17.000
Algot can not give his daughter
to one of the king's enemies.

01:06:31.792 --> 01:06:38.000
I do not want some Swerker guy.
I want to be yours. Arn.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:30.833
The Holy Virgin is on our side.

01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:38.000
Nothing can divide us.

01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:51.583
Arn. you can't do that. Forget it.

01:07:53.583 --> 01:08:00.875
Cecilia can never be yours as long
as Karl of Sweden is in power.

01:08:38.792 --> 01:08:40.500
Knut?

01:08:43.792 --> 01:08:48.917
- They are looking everywhere for you.
- I'm going to Visings  soon.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.958
To the king's castle?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.458
I will take back what is mine.

01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:58.125
Knut...

01:09:00.458 --> 01:09:06.333
I can understand if you
don't want to get involved. but...

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:09.750
...I can't stop thinking of Cecilia.

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:15.417
Cecilia Algots-daughter.
She is promised to someone else.

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:19.375
I will be king.

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:24.917
If I can count on your support.
you can count on me.

01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:43.625
- How do you know that he will come?
- He will. I am sure.

01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:45.708
He will.

01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:24.458
Tell your people that now Knut

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:28.417
Eriksson is king of
Western G taland (Gothia).

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:26.083
Cecilia!

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:31.542
- Where's mother?
- I wanted to talk to you alone.

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:41.667
I have something to tell you.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:48.042
I am betrothed to Arn Magnusson.

01:13:53.042 --> 01:13:57.500
- What's wrong?
- I knew it.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:00.333
What?

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:05.542
Father cannot afford two weddings.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:13.042
- I will never get away from here.
- Don't say that! I will not leave you.

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:18.000
It will work out in the end.
Arn is a friend of Knut.

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:22.625
When he becomes king.
everything will be different.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:26.208
Sorry. Cecilia.

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:31.250
I am glad for your sake.
When will the wedding be?

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:36.625
It is not decided.
but it must be soon.

01:14:36.792 --> 01:14:42.500
You're the only one I can tell this.
Promise not to tell anybody.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:48.500
I bear his child.

01:15:00.833 --> 01:15:05.833
- Are you quite sure about that?
- Yes.

01:15:10.292 --> 01:15:16.542
And this Arn Magnusson
would be Knut Eriksson's best friend?

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:19.708
Yes. Mother Rikissa.

01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:31.917
One more thing...

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:38.917
Before Arn met Cecilia.
he had sex with me.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:57.000
You do well understand that
this will not stop here?

01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:19.292
Have you lost your mind?
Killing the king...

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:22.500
before we know what kind
of support we have!

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:27.417
Knut is a hothead. but you...
Why?

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.542
- You should keep him
under control (arrest?).

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:32.875
Do you not want Knut on the throne?

01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:36.542
But he is not ready yet!

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:45.958
In order to survive it is not enough
to kill anyone who stands in your way.

01:16:46.125 --> 01:16:51.042
You have to think as he
and his brother is thinking!

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:54.875
He has the Erik-clan and
the Folkung-clan behind him.

01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:57.917
But the Sverkers (Swedes)
still hold Visings .

01:16:59.542 --> 01:17:03.250
They have the church behind them.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:10.208
You have not yet killed the snake.

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:17.083
Honourable bishop.

01:17:17.167 --> 01:17:22.042
it is with a heavy heart
I write these lines.

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:26.208
when the sorrow of our
beloved king's death...

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:29.083
still weighs down our monastery.

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:32.125
But in these anxious times all

01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:36.333
Swerkers need to be
faithful to each other.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.583
This is why I have to write.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:44.375
I have knowledge and written proof...

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:48.917
which is of great importance
for our brothers.

01:17:49.083 --> 01:17:54.875
This is about the
king's murderer's Knut best friend:

01:17:55.042 --> 01:17:58.333
Arn Magnusson of the Folkungs.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.208
Here in Skara is a young man

01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:10.917
whose face is angelic

01:18:11.083 --> 01:18:16.708
but whose heart is
black and full of sin.

01:18:16.833 --> 01:18:22.208
With fine words and false promises
he has seduced a young maiden

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:25.458
into having sinful sexual intercourse.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:35.583
Good Lord. he impregnated
her without being married.

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:44.708
But this is not the worst.

01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:51.083
The young man had already
have an atrocity on his conscience.

01:18:51.208 --> 01:18:53.417
He had already been...

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:58.125
in bed with the younger
sister of the maiden.

01:18:58.292 --> 01:19:01.833
To take two sisters of
the same father is...

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:05.833
against christian law and
the work of the devil.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:13.875
There is no excuse for this.

01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:29.417
Arn Magnusson of Arn s farm and
Cecilia Algotsdotter from P lsg rden

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:36.250
are excommunicated from this day on.

01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:44.167
None of the churches in West G taland
(Gothia) may deal with them.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:49.167
They are condemned to
discipline and penance

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:57.750
in Varnhems and Gudhems monasteries

01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:04.417
for half their lives - 20 years.

01:21:16.875 --> 01:21:18.875
- Cecilia!
- Arn!

01:21:23.417 --> 01:21:26.292
Cecilia...

01:21:32.833 --> 01:21:37.958
Whatever they say.
I have never been with your sister.

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:45.167
I have never loved anyone else.

01:21:50.167 --> 01:21:54.625
I swear
that I will get you out of here.

01:21:54.792 --> 01:22:01.208
We have to pray to the Holy Virgin.
She will hear our prayers.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:07.583
Don't take any monasterial vows.
because they are irrevocable.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:13.042
I'll wait for you.

01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:20.208
Cecilia!

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:31.583
Cecilia Algotsdotter!

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:37.583
No. I do not want to!

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.583
No!

01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:13.750
Take it.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:20.042
Refusing to eat doesn't help.

01:23:34.333 --> 01:23:39.000
- Have you ever had doubts. Guilbert?
- About eating? No. never.

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:44.708
Doubting is one way in
which God tries us.

01:23:50.917 --> 01:23:54.125
When I killed two men I walked free.

01:23:55.458 --> 01:24:00.542
But for love I am punished?
How can that be the will of God?

01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:06.042
What you're speaking of
has nothing to do with God.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.917
These are the plots and schemes of men.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.250
Ora et labora.

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:22.333
Prayer and work. Cecilia.
That's what you have ahead of you.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:28.042
If you think that your life here
will be just as comfortable as it was.

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:32.250
you are badly mistaken.

01:24:32.458 --> 01:24:39.583
You are now among Swerkers
and to be chastised and do penance.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:44.167
Look at me!

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:51.208
Look at me!

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:15.792
I will eventually subdue you.
Cecilia Algotsdotter.

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:41.667
Folkung whore!

01:26:50.833 --> 01:26:53.625
'Many are called. but few are chosen.'

01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:57.458
Guilty or not.

01:26:57.542 --> 01:27:00.458
you have been convicted
of an abomination.

01:27:00.625 --> 01:27:03.958
No man can lift that sentence.

01:27:04.125 --> 01:27:06.917
But you will not stay here at Varnhem.

01:27:07.042 --> 01:27:10.000
I have written to the bishop.

01:27:10.167 --> 01:27:14.208
and he has agreed to our request.

01:27:16.167 --> 01:27:21.500
Under the name of "Arn de Gothia"
you will journey first to Rome

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:25.750
and from there to the Holy Land.

01:27:30.125 --> 01:27:33.833
- Father. I...
- You will be a Knight Templar. Arn.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.875
A soldier in the service of God.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.875
Take good care of Chamsiin.

01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:38.750
You sit here daydreaming again?

01:28:38.917 --> 01:28:43.542
Do you still think that your lover
will come to pick you up?

01:28:43.708 --> 01:28:51.000
He will not. Arn Magnusson has
been sent to the war in the Holy Land.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.458
- No. you are lying!
- You will never see him again.

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.958
Sir?

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:02.958
Sir.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.083
Sir...

01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:10.125
We should be heading back now.

01:30:56.292 --> 01:31:00.167
You saved our lives. Knight Templar.

01:31:04.583 --> 01:31:06.583
You speak our language.

01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:11.667
Then you will understand that I do not
wish to be indebted to a Christian.

01:31:12.875 --> 01:31:15.583
- Allow me to repay you.
- You are very generous.

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:20.292
but as a Knight Templar
I can not accept your money.

01:31:20.958 --> 01:31:22.375
Farewell.

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:26.708
Allez! (Go!)

01:31:31.042 --> 01:31:33.125
Then at least share
a meal with us.

01:31:35.875 --> 01:31:37.708
At our camp.

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.917
Sir?

01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:48.708
I swear by Allah and his prophet.
we mean you no harm.

01:31:48.917 --> 01:31:51.292
If you give us the same assurance.

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:55.667
You have my word.

01:32:02.875 --> 01:32:05.500
God truly moves in mysterious ways.

01:32:08.583 --> 01:32:13.042
Only he knows why he sent
an enemy to our rescue.

01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:16.167
You could have killed us
as easily as you killed the bandits.

01:32:16.333 --> 01:32:18.875
Those bandits have robbed many pilgrims.

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:21.875
and it's our mission to
protect the pilgrims.

01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:27.625
"Take no one else's life."

01:32:28.708 --> 01:32:32.333
"Because each life is
sacred in God's eyes."

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.458
"Only for a righteous cause."

01:32:36.625 --> 01:32:41.792
- You are familiar with the Holy Koran.
- I have been here many years.

01:32:46.042 --> 01:32:48.542
Al Ghouti...

01:32:48.708 --> 01:32:52.167
I have heard of you.
You are a great warrior.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:55.458
I am Youssouf. This is my brother Fahkr.

01:32:57.458 --> 01:33:01.000
We are merchants on our way to Cairo.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.375
Taking this way around the
Dead Sea without an escort?

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:13.750
- It is the shortest route.
- But not the safest.

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:22.917
We have sworn not to raise arms
against each other.

01:33:23.083 --> 01:33:27.250
So let us be honest.
You are warriors. just like us.

01:33:36.083 --> 01:33:37.667
Leave us alone.

01:33:49.583 --> 01:33:52.417
I'll go and see to the horses.

01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:10.083
- Do you know who I am?
- You are Youssouf Sala ad-Din Ayyoubi.

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:12.375
The one we know as Saladin.

01:34:12.542 --> 01:34:16.167
- And you're not afraid?
- You have given me your word.

01:34:22.375 --> 01:34:26.583
You are a man of honour.
Not like your brothers.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.292
It is a shame that
you must lose this war.

01:34:37.458 --> 01:34:40.750
- I have sworn to win.
- So have I.

01:34:40.917 --> 01:34:45.792
And we shall soon see
which one of us is right.

01:34:47.208 --> 01:34:49.250
Very soon.

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:59.750
- De Gothia.
- Sir.

01:35:59.958 --> 01:36:03.750
Back so soon? I trust you
have completed your mission.

01:36:03.833 --> 01:36:05.333
I have. grand master.

01:36:06.042 --> 01:36:09.792
- But I have bad news to report.
- Go on.

01:36:09.958 --> 01:36:11.417
- Saladin is here.
- What?

01:36:11.667 --> 01:36:13.542
He could march
on Jerusalem at any time.

01:36:13.625 --> 01:36:14.583
This is not possible.

01:36:14.708 --> 01:36:17.833
Saladins forces are
scattered across the country.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.292
Surely. we would have heard something
if he had assembled an army.

01:36:22.458 --> 01:36:26.250
Saladin is here.
and he is sure of his victory.

01:36:26.417 --> 01:36:28.875
I have just spoken to
the King of Jerusalem.

01:36:28.958 --> 01:36:31.500
His spies report that
Saladin is in Damascus.

01:36:31.625 --> 01:36:34.417
Not anymore.

01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:37.333
Grand Master. I don't
know what de Gothia...

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.208
hopes to achieve by
spreading these rumours.

01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:44.000
- Who told you this. de Gothia?
- An eye-witness.

01:36:44.167 --> 01:36:46.417
Who told you?

01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:51.625
A man I trust.

01:36:54.792 --> 01:36:57.083
Gentlemen...

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:04.958
Now I understand...

01:37:05.042 --> 01:37:08.500
why you didn't want to
reveal your sources.

01:37:08.708 --> 01:37:10.833
But you kept your word
as Knight Templar.

01:37:10.917 --> 01:37:12.750
and that's of the utmost importance.

01:37:12.958 --> 01:37:15.167
Now. what did you learn?

01:37:15.333 --> 01:37:19.542
He was heading south.
That's where the attack will come from.

01:37:21.667 --> 01:37:26.542
I will inform the king.
We must prepare for a siege.

01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:31.375
Tell me. de Gothia...
What kind of man is he. our enemy?

01:37:33.958 --> 01:37:37.250
He is like us. A man of his word.

01:37:41.333 --> 01:37:46.458
I am glad that God has given me
this chance to get to know my enemy.

01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:50.667
You respect him.

01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:54.125
You must know your enemy to defeat him.

01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:05.500
And you are a most worthy opponent.

01:38:07.667 --> 01:38:11.792
I have sworn my oath
as a Knight Templar.

01:38:11.958 --> 01:38:16.750
but I have also sworn
to return home when my time here is due.

01:38:17.875 --> 01:38:21.083
Perhaps there is
someone waiting for you?

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:06.250
Mother Rikissa has forbidden
to open the prison cell.

01:39:26.083 --> 01:39:32.625
- How long has she been here?
- Several days and several nights.

01:39:33.792 --> 01:39:36.375
Help her up. and get her out of here.

01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:55.333
- What is this?
- We have orders to punish her often.

01:40:01.208 --> 01:40:06.917
I'm not chiding you.
I come with reconciliation.

01:40:07.083 --> 01:40:10.708
Cecilia! Cecilia!

01:40:10.875 --> 01:40:17.500
No one is allowed to talk to her.
and now she does not speak with anyone.

01:40:18.708 --> 01:40:25.167
You can talk to me. Cecilia.
There is no need to be defiant.

01:40:25.583 --> 01:40:30.208
You have to reconcile
yourself with your fate.

01:40:30.375 --> 01:40:34.917
Mother Rikissa only wants your best.

01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:09.542
This child is a child of sin.

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:16.667
Give me my child! Give me my child!

01:41:18.083 --> 01:41:20.917
No!

01:41:32.708 --> 01:41:36.542
It's for her own good.

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:40.917
You've been leeching her?
She was white as a sheet.

01:41:41.042 --> 01:41:46.208
Your Eminence know how effective
it is against the carnal desires.

01:41:46.375 --> 01:41:49.833
She has been stubborn
from the beginning.

01:41:50.042 --> 01:41:53.583
You should not treat her so hard.

01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:59.125
All the years of war
have weakened our dynasty position.

01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:02.625
We do not know how long we
can hold our position...

01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:05.292
against Knut Eriksson and his followers.

01:42:05.458 --> 01:42:11.042
- Those damned blue coats!
- Now you listen to me. Rikissa!

01:42:11.208 --> 01:42:17.292
If they are victorious. God forbid.
it would hardly benefit the monastery

01:42:17.458 --> 01:42:22.083
if Cecilia Algotsdotter
has been harmed.

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:18.583
Cecilia...

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:26.333
You're not alone any more.

01:44:52.083 --> 01:44:55.042
It has come to my attention

01:44:55.208 --> 01:45:00.417
that Cecilia deserves a punishment.

01:45:00.625 --> 01:45:04.250
She has violated the talking rules.

01:45:04.417 --> 01:45:09.958
Not you. Cecilia Algotsdotter.
We have a new Cecilia among us.

01:45:10.125 --> 01:45:13.375
Cecilia Blanka. come here!

01:45:18.708 --> 01:45:25.042
This new Cecilia shall
be called Blanka from now on.

01:45:25.208 --> 01:45:28.500
On the first evening she spoke...

01:45:28.583 --> 01:45:32.833
with Cecilia Algotsdotter
against the ban.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.458
Go!

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.000
Helena!

01:45:47.167 --> 01:45:49.667
Come here!

01:45:58.167 --> 01:46:04.750
Three whippings. in the name of the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:47:37.667 --> 01:47:40.542
Who are you?

01:47:42.125 --> 01:47:47.958
I am the future Queen.
I am betrothed to Knut Eriksson.

01:47:48.125 --> 01:47:52.458
He want me to stay here
until the war is over.

01:47:52.625 --> 01:47:58.958
He asked me to look after
his best friend's fianc e.

01:47:59.125 --> 01:48:01.625
Arn...

01:48:02.625 --> 01:48:06.458
Does someone know anything about him?

01:48:06.625 --> 01:48:11.000
I have not heard anything about Arn.
but little Magnus is well.

01:48:11.208 --> 01:48:15.375
- Magnus?
- Your son.

01:48:19.042 --> 01:48:23.667
Hasn't she told you? You didn't know?

01:48:25.458 --> 01:48:28.625
That ghastly Swerker hag!

01:48:30.208 --> 01:48:33.667
His name is Magnus?

01:48:35.875 --> 01:48:37.542
Thank you!

01:48:37.708 --> 01:48:40.417
He lives.

01:49:31.583 --> 01:49:34.917
- Sir.
- Thank you. Armand.

01:49:38.042 --> 01:49:41.917
Sir. how long can Jerusalem
withstand a siege?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.042
- Are you afraid?

01:49:45.125 --> 01:49:48.125
A Knight Templar is not
allowed to be afraid. sir.

01:49:51.042 --> 01:49:53.292
Nor is he allowed to lie.

01:49:55.083 --> 01:49:57.208
No. sir...

01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:03.667
I am afraid. but I will
not let that stand in my way.

01:50:10.417 --> 01:50:13.375
You'll become
a great Knight Templar one day. Armand.

01:50:19.125 --> 01:50:22.667
Who is it? Who sent you?

01:50:22.833 --> 01:50:26.625
- What are you doing here?
- I will speak only to Al Ghouti!

01:50:26.792 --> 01:50:30.875
- Al Ghouti? What do you want with him?
- I will speak only to Al Ghouti!

01:50:31.042 --> 01:50:35.250
You filthy Saracen.
Let's make him talk.

01:50:37.458 --> 01:50:39.958
Al Ghouti!

01:50:40.167 --> 01:50:43.625
- My Lord has sent me.
- What does he want?

01:50:43.792 --> 01:50:47.125
He wants to talk to you only.
I will bring you to him.

01:50:47.292 --> 01:50:50.042
- You speak his language.
- Let him go.

01:50:52.042 --> 01:50:56.833
How dare you?
This man is to be interrogated.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.542
As you wish. But the Grand Master
won't be pleased. Be assured of that.

01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:08.333
Very well. You'll make your
little friend talk.

01:51:10.042 --> 01:51:12.208
Release him.

01:51:13.167 --> 01:51:16.583
Take me to your master.

01:51:36.083 --> 01:51:39.042
So we meet again.

01:51:39.208 --> 01:51:42.917
It is God's will.

01:51:43.083 --> 01:51:46.167
My brother is waiting for you.

01:51:46.333 --> 01:51:48.625
Wait here.

01:52:02.542 --> 01:52:07.708
He will come here.

01:52:07.875 --> 01:52:11.708
- Do you love him?
- Knut?

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:18.167
I don't know.

01:52:18.333 --> 01:52:23.125
I haven't seen him in a long time.
He's all right. I guess.

01:52:23.333 --> 01:52:25.792
He is the king.

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:31.167
Do you love Arn Magnusson?

01:52:32.917 --> 01:52:36.500
More than anything else.

01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:46.875
I know that it is a sin
but I love him more than God.

01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:56.792
You will certainly learn
to love Knut.

01:53:14.167 --> 01:53:17.250
What is going on here?!

01:53:17.458 --> 01:53:22.292
Rikissa. I have come
to get my betrothed wife.

01:53:22.458 --> 01:53:28.167
Here in Gudhem. I am the abbess!
I am under the bishop's protection.

01:53:28.292 --> 01:53:35.417
Then I think we should get him here.
Bishop Bengt disappeared when Knut won.

01:53:35.583 --> 01:53:41.750
- Rumor says he fled abroad.
- Get her.

01:53:56.625 --> 01:53:59.583
My queen.

01:54:02.542 --> 01:54:05.458
It was about time.

01:54:38.208 --> 01:54:44.958
Birger Bros? Thank you for
taking care of my boy.

01:54:45.125 --> 01:54:50.208
His name is Magnus
and he is a Folkung now.

01:54:50.375 --> 01:54:55.792
- Does he know that...?
- No. he shall not grow up in shame.

01:54:55.917 --> 01:54:58.417
Cecilia. come here!

01:55:04.792 --> 01:55:09.042
Rikissa! I keep an eye on you now.

01:55:09.208 --> 01:55:14.333
If you do Cecilia any harm.
you'll regret it.

01:55:15.083 --> 01:55:20.375
- Is that understood?
- Answer your future queen!

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:25.333
It is understood.

01:55:27.875 --> 01:55:33.125
Cecilia. He will come back.

01:55:34.333 --> 01:55:36.875
He will come back to you.

01:56:39.917 --> 01:56:45.375
Welcome. Have a seat.

01:56:51.292 --> 01:56:57.875
You will lose this war.
You know that as well as I do.

01:56:58.042 --> 01:57:03.875
But because you have saved
my life. I will be merciful.

01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:11.583
Leave Jerusalem
without giving battle...

01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:16.125
and you and your brother Templars will
have safe passage to wherever you wish.

01:57:25.542 --> 01:57:29.292
My duty is to protect Jerusalem.

01:57:30.708 --> 01:57:35.083
Even if the decision was mine to make.
my answer would still be "no".

01:57:35.208 --> 01:57:38.292
Then you will die.

01:57:39.208 --> 01:57:42.292
It's all in the hands of God.

01:57:52.083 --> 01:57:55.750
The king of Jerusalem
sends his blessings.

01:57:57.167 --> 01:57:59.500
The true cross.

01:58:03.458 --> 01:58:06.250
- Now we're safe.
- Thank you. de Ridefort.

01:58:06.417 --> 01:58:07.750
We appreciate the king's kindness.

01:58:07.958 --> 01:58:12.458
is already on his way to Jerusalem.

01:58:15.458 --> 01:58:18.708
Grand Master Torroja.

01:58:18.875 --> 01:58:22.208
The battle for Jerusalem
does not have to be fought in Jerusalem.

01:58:22.292 --> 01:58:23.167
What do you mean?

01:58:23.250 --> 01:58:27.458
Saladin's army is great. but that
also means that it moves slowly.

01:58:27.542 --> 01:58:30.458
Which gives us time to
prepare for the siege.

01:58:30.542 --> 01:58:34.708
Which gives us time to stop him
before he reaches Jerusalem.

01:58:34.875 --> 01:58:37.667
To save time. Saladin will
take the way across Mount Gisard.

01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:40.167
There's a shortcut there
that is used by the Beduin.

01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:41.750
You know of the place.

01:58:41.833 --> 01:58:44.917
A narrow pass through the mountains.

01:58:45.042 --> 01:58:48.250
Saladin would never
expect us to confront them there.

01:58:48.417 --> 01:58:51.208
An ambush could do
Saladin's army a great deal of harm.

01:58:51.333 --> 01:58:53.667
Grand Master.

01:58:53.833 --> 01:58:57.125
We have no evidence that
Saladin will choose that way.

01:58:57.292 --> 01:58:58.833
Unless of course. de Gothia has...

01:58:58.917 --> 01:59:00.958
intelligence from yet
another secret source.

01:59:01.167 --> 01:59:05.250
De Ridefort. this is not the time
or place for personal fights.

01:59:06.583 --> 01:59:09.667
- De Turenne. what's your opinion?
- It's a wise strategy.

01:59:09.833 --> 01:59:13.667
We could avoid a siege.
if God be willing.

01:59:16.333 --> 01:59:20.833
We should get a force out there at once.
We have nothing to lose and all to win.

01:59:26.917 --> 01:59:28.958
Arn de Gothia.

01:59:29.125 --> 01:59:31.250
The encounters that you've had can't be...

01:59:31.333 --> 01:59:33.917
interpreted as anything
other than the will of God.

01:59:34.083 --> 01:59:36.750
You shall lead our
brothers in this battle.

01:59:36.833 --> 01:59:38.208
You will be in command.

01:59:38.375 --> 01:59:41.083
I am honoured. Grand Master.

02:00:34.625 --> 02:00:38.458
We'll wait in ambush here.

02:00:40.167 --> 02:00:45.625
A sandstorm will soon be upon us.
It would be madness to fight in this.

02:00:45.792 --> 02:00:49.250
It is a godsend.

02:00:49.417 --> 02:00:53.292
Saladin will be taken by surprise.

02:00:53.458 --> 02:00:55.333
Dismount.

02:01:52.125 --> 02:01:54.208
Sir?

02:01:54.792 --> 02:01:56.792
Sir?

02:02:00.958 --> 02:02:03.042
Sir!

02:04:35.083 --> 02:04:37.208
Now!

02:06:26.583 --> 02:06:29.458
We have to bring in more troops!

02:06:37.583 --> 02:06:41.375
Sound the retreat.

02:08:17.083 --> 02:08:19.208
He lives.

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:22.500
Arn lives.

02:08:26.333 --> 02:08:31.250
- Is that true? Is that true?
- Yes.

02:08:48.167 --> 02:08:49.833
You have fought well.

02:08:50.083 --> 02:08:54.583
Thanks to you. we have defeated our
greatest enemy and defended Jerusalem.

02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:57.417
You have served our order faithfully
and I want to make sure

02:08:57.583 --> 02:09:02.167
that you receive your rightful reward
when the day comes.

02:09:04.667 --> 02:09:06.625
De Gothia.

02:09:07.833 --> 02:09:12.042
With great honour you can leave
your service in the army of God

02:09:12.167 --> 02:09:15.417
and return to your former life.

02:09:16.708 --> 02:09:22.292
When your time is due.
this is your way out of here.

02:09:26.208 --> 02:09:28.750
May God keep you until then.

02:10:03.375 --> 02:10:07.500
Thank you.
Thank you. Holy Mother of God.

02:10:07.667 --> 02:10:12.917
Watch over him.
Help him to return home.
