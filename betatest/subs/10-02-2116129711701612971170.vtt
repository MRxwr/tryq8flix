00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.653
Asomidin Tohirov?

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:31.903
I did it yesterday.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.445
It's my third time.

00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:36.445
Want me to go?

00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:40.820
No. I will.
You can sleep.

00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:54.278
Yum... here.

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:56.362
- Hot?
- No. it's not.

00:01:58.237 --> 00:01:59.862
I said you could sleep.

00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:01.195
I couldn't.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.820
You okay. Leo?

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:04.070
Too hot?

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:05.153
Yes.

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:08.487
This way I see you.

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:15.487
We don't see much of Mommy
these days.

00:02:20.237 --> 00:02:22.903
We meet at my mom's or here?

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:25.028
It's tonight?

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.737
Virginie. you're a fucking pain.

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:54.278
Is your partner coming along?

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:55.737
No.

00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:01.153
Do you have anyone
to accompany you?

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:02.320
No.

00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:05.820
Tonight. antibiotics

00:03:05.987 --> 00:03:08.903
to prevent infection
during the procedure.

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:53.987
Have a good day.

00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:55.070
Thanks.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.195
What's your problem?

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:10.362
You do things offhandedly.

00:04:10.528 --> 00:04:13.070
- You're imprecise. careless.
- And on the ground?

00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:14.237
Am I a good cop?

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:17.153
Answer me.
Am I good on the ground?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.987
Yeah.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:20.112
So? Why are you railing?

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:21.945
I'm not Oxford Unabridged!

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.987
I'm a cop.
I'm not here to write a novel.

00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:31.612
All good. Miss Norway?

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:34.153
What's wrong?

00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:40.570
Virginie?

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.653
Are you free?

00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:44.862
Yeah. why?

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:48.737
To get this woman's belongings.
Violent husband.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:51.487
He's not in.
Can you come along?

00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:12.362
It'll be fine. ma'am.

00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:16.445
We're here.

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:28.278
- What the fuck?
- Step back.

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:29.445
Step back.

00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:31.237
Sonia. come on...

00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:32.487
Sir. over there.

00:05:33.778 --> 00:05:35.320
- I can't talk to her?
- No.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.278
Back up and stay put.

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:46.862
Bitch.

00:05:51.112 --> 00:05:52.320
Little whore.

00:05:56.237 --> 00:05:57.862
Go wash. dirty whore.

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:00.237
Feel better now?

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.028
You're cumming. right?

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:04.945
Your uniform gets you off.

00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:07.237
Stop pretending you have balls.

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:12.862
I've had enough now.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.695
Let go! Let go. I said!

00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:17.278
Will you let go?

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.778
Bitch!

00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:39.737
Miss Norway!

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:42.862
Aristide. stop calling me that.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.653
What?
Would you prefer Miss Senegal?

00:06:46.903 --> 00:06:48.778
I have an important question.

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:50.612
Primordial.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.195
What do we do for lunch?

00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:56.737
Kebab or kebab?

00:06:57.862 --> 00:06:59.820
Be happy.
I'm leaving you the choice.

00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:01.737
I can't. I have work.

00:07:02.153 --> 00:07:03.362
Cheating on me?

00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:06.028
Eating with another man?

00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:10.778
Okay. then.

00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:35.362
<i>Backup requested by the riverbank.</i>

00:07:35.528 --> 00:07:36.987
<i>36 Quai d'Austerlitz.</i>

00:07:37.153 --> 00:07:38.070
<i>Do you copy?</i>

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:41.862
Cool.

00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:43.862
Time to kick some ass.

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:45.320
Sounds likely.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.570
Good sex last night.

00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:49.653
And a good fight today.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.320
You gonna help?

00:08:37.237 --> 00:08:38.320
Don't move!

00:08:46.528 --> 00:08:47.778
Nice workout!

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.070
What happened?
Rip your pantyhose?

00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:54.403
I haven't slept in 18 months.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.487
So?

00:08:56.987 --> 00:08:58.612
That's women for you.

00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:00.695
You want equality

00:09:00.862 --> 00:09:04.320
then you play the mother card
or the period card.

00:09:04.487 --> 00:09:05.570
Seriously.

00:09:06.153 --> 00:09:09.195
- Leave your ovaries at home.
- Lay off!

00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:10.778
Not today. not you.

00:09:10.945 --> 00:09:11.987
Why "not me"?

00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:15.070
- What did I do?
- You did nothing.

00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:17.153
So what is it?

00:09:18.487 --> 00:09:20.153
I'm getting an abortion.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.237
I couldn't leave my ovaries at home.
Sorry.

00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:29.987
It's not your fault.
I forgot my pill. one fucking time.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:31.112
Here we are.

00:09:32.862 --> 00:09:34.153
You sure it's mine?

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.153
I'm sure all right.

00:09:37.528 --> 00:09:39.945
I'll spare you the details.
100% sure.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.945
<i>- It won't work!
- Why not?</i>

00:10:04.112 --> 00:10:07.320
<i>You can't have
more than one girl in a car.</i>

00:10:07.487 --> 00:10:08.737
<i>I know.</i>

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:11.237
It's the rule
but rules change.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:14.487
Two girls can't patrol without a man.

00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:17.278
Am I not right?

00:10:19.403 --> 00:10:20.403
It's the rule!

00:10:23.362 --> 00:10:25.820
- How do you make a cop?
- Tell us.

00:10:25.987 --> 00:10:27.320
One man minimum.

00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:30.612
Takes more than a woman alone.

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:34.112
- And two women?
- Not even two women!

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.195
You're unbelievable!

00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:38.737
Machos like you still exist?

00:10:38.903 --> 00:10:41.445
It's the truth.
One man minimum!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.362
I need two officers to volunteer.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.278
It's not our sector

00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:24.237
and it means doing overtime.

00:11:24.403 --> 00:11:27.570
The prison fire
has Escort Crew scrambling.

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:28.820
Gregoire?

00:11:30.028 --> 00:11:31.487
No. sorry.

00:11:34.445 --> 00:11:35.528
Aristide?

00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:37.278
No way.

00:11:37.445 --> 00:11:38.987
I have a life. unlike others.

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:43.362
Erik? Up for it?

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.653
Okay. but they have some nerve.

00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:49.862
I'll do it. I'll go along.

00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:51.903
I had nothing to do with it.

00:11:52.653 --> 00:11:53.987
No. it doesn't suit me.

00:11:55.737 --> 00:11:57.570
I told you I wasn't sure.

00:11:57.737 --> 00:12:00.070
An emergency is an emergency!

00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:02.487
Hello?

00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:47.903
- You okay?
- Fine.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.737
I need to search the car.

00:12:50.112 --> 00:12:51.403
You never know.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.737
See?

00:13:01.237 --> 00:13:03.195
This can become a weapon.

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.612
Anything can.

00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:10.403
What's Herve doing?

00:13:35.528 --> 00:13:37.112
<i>Where did you put them?</i>

00:13:38.528 --> 00:13:39.945
Not in there.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.903
You're a pain. Martine.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.487
You're a pain in the ass. you know.

00:13:47.278 --> 00:13:49.403
Can't you stop busting my balls?

00:13:49.653 --> 00:13:50.653
Freezing.

00:13:52.445 --> 00:13:53.528
No. cold.

00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:02.695
Don't come crying
when you get cancer.

00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:05.737
Don't count on me
to take you for chemo.

00:14:06.362 --> 00:14:08.362
Why are you always so nasty?

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.528
Why take it out on me?

00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:14.487
If we'd had a kid.
I'd take it out on him.

00:14:18.695 --> 00:14:21.237
But it's all muscle. no balls.

00:14:33.903 --> 00:14:35.737
I grab the guy and say:

00:14:35.903 --> 00:14:37.153
"I'll whip your ass

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.945
next time you call me 'bro'..."

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:40.028
<i>You upset?</i>

00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:40.945
His bro?

00:14:41.112 --> 00:14:42.695
From what mother?

00:14:42.862 --> 00:14:44.862
Can you take it down?

00:14:45.153 --> 00:14:46.403
You're not happy?

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.070
No. I'm not!

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.695
You know why?

00:14:49.987 --> 00:14:53.070
Your robbery report is full of mistakes.

00:14:53.737 --> 00:14:56.653
Stop nitpicking. They're just typos.

00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:00.820
Want me to write my reports
in sonnet form?

00:15:01.528 --> 00:15:02.653
Enough already.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.820
What's your problem?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.362
You do everything offhandedly.

00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:09.320
You're imprecise. careless.

00:15:10.112 --> 00:15:11.278
And on the ground?

00:15:12.028 --> 00:15:13.487
Am I a good cop?

00:15:15.237 --> 00:15:17.112
Answer me.
On the ground?

00:15:18.945 --> 00:15:20.153
Am I a good cop?

00:15:20.528 --> 00:15:21.487
Yeah.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.987
So why are you railing?
I'm not Oxford Unabridged.

00:15:26.612 --> 00:15:30.112
I'm a cop.
I'm not here to write a novel.

00:15:31.653 --> 00:15:34.653
Take her to her place.
All her stuff is there.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.028
All right. I'll deal with it.

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:40.070
Virginie...

00:15:40.737 --> 00:15:42.028
Are you free?

00:15:42.195 --> 00:15:43.528
Yeah. why?

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:46.528
To get this woman's belongings.

00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:48.070
Violent husband.

00:15:48.237 --> 00:15:50.487
He's not in.
Can you come along?

00:15:51.528 --> 00:15:52.612
Look.

00:15:52.862 --> 00:15:54.987
Broken. as usual.
Pain in the ass.

00:15:56.028 --> 00:15:58.945
How can we work in a clunker like this?

00:16:02.778 --> 00:16:05.737
Sometimes even the automatic locks
don't work.

00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:08.987
They want more arrests
for their statistics

00:16:09.153 --> 00:16:11.903
but the guys can open the doors and run.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.445
It's wild.

00:16:17.653 --> 00:16:19.237
- Step back.
- What the fuck?

00:16:19.403 --> 00:16:20.320
Step back.

00:16:20.487 --> 00:16:22.028
Sonia. come on.

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:23.320
Sir. over there.

00:16:24.612 --> 00:16:26.195
- I can't talk to her?
- No.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.195
Step back and stay put. you hear?

00:16:41.778 --> 00:16:43.945
He's not a bastard. you know.

00:16:45.528 --> 00:16:46.612
Excuse me?

00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:51.487
He's not mean.
He didn't do it on purpose.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.945
It's my fault too.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.153
It'll be fine. ma'am.

00:17:05.153 --> 00:17:07.737
A man who hits a woman is no man.

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:10.862
There's no justifying that. ever.

00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:16.028
Let go! Let go. I said!

00:17:16.362 --> 00:17:17.528
Stay here.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.778
Calm down! You hear me?

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.612
Yeah. I hear you.

00:17:28.528 --> 00:17:30.112
What are you doing to him?

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:33.070
Stop. you're hurting him.

00:17:33.237 --> 00:17:34.237
It'll be fine.

00:17:34.403 --> 00:17:35.695
You're hurting him.

00:17:39.903 --> 00:17:40.945
Leave.

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:44.528
Please...

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.612
leave.

00:18:11.362 --> 00:18:12.320
It's good.

00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:14.403
Take it away.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.445
I need a place like that.

00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:28.653
Change scenery. take a breather.

00:19:04.028 --> 00:19:07.487
<i>Everywhere in the streets
I want them to talk about me</i>

00:19:07.653 --> 00:19:11.403
<i>I want the girls to be naked
and to jump on me</i>

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.153
<i>To admire me and to kill me</i>

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.987
<i>To strip away my virtue</i>

00:19:19.153 --> 00:19:22.945
<i>For the former schoolgirls
I'll be an idol</i>

00:19:23.112 --> 00:19:26.778
<i>And every night.
out of breath in their beds</i>

00:19:26.945 --> 00:19:30.487
<i>they'll cheat on their husbands</i>

00:19:35.778 --> 00:19:37.695
I just wanted to punish him.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:39.778
I love my son!

00:19:40.278 --> 00:19:43.070
I wanted to teach him a lesson.
so he'd cool off.

00:19:43.445 --> 00:19:44.903
I'm not a bad mom.

00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:46.362
I didn't want to kill him.

00:20:00.695 --> 00:20:02.862
Despite the soap. it lingers.

00:20:03.528 --> 00:20:06.778
The smell of death.
Ever notice? It sticks.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.903
When I go home.
I stay on the landing.

00:20:14.028 --> 00:20:15.737
Till the light goes out.

00:20:16.153 --> 00:20:18.487
I undress and count to 60.

00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:22.070
So I don't take the shit inside.

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:24.362
I leave it in the hallway.

00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:26.570
It's stupid.

00:20:30.987 --> 00:20:32.570
For me. it's underwear.

00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:39.570
I always make sure
my underwear isn't too ugly.

00:20:40.695 --> 00:20:42.445
To be presentable. just in case.

00:20:42.612 --> 00:20:45.362
If I end up on a slab at the morgue.

00:20:46.028 --> 00:20:47.612
It's stupid too.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.987
<i>So Granny. what's this all about?</i>

00:21:03.653 --> 00:21:05.487
Trying to get attention?

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.028
Take care of yourself.

00:21:08.362 --> 00:21:09.278
Okay?

00:21:11.028 --> 00:21:13.528
And go easy on the nurses.
I know you.

00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:16.320
I'm coming for Christmas.

00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:18.862
So wait for me.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.862
You promise?

00:21:29.112 --> 00:21:30.070
There you go.

00:21:32.778 --> 00:21:33.612
Love you.

00:22:16.278 --> 00:22:17.612
Something between you two?

00:22:17.778 --> 00:22:18.987
Yeah. right.

00:22:26.195 --> 00:22:27.528
All good. Miss Norway?

00:22:29.778 --> 00:22:30.903
What's wrong?

00:22:32.028 --> 00:22:33.320
Didn't get your bonus?

00:22:45.445 --> 00:22:48.445
- Miss Norway...
- Aristide. stop calling me that.

00:22:48.945 --> 00:22:51.362
- Kebab or kebab?
- I can't. I have work.

00:22:52.195 --> 00:22:53.570
Cheating on me?

00:22:54.695 --> 00:22:56.320
Eating with another man?

00:22:59.862 --> 00:23:01.112
Okay. then.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.778
Hello. chef!

00:23:09.945 --> 00:23:10.903
Hello.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.487
Today I'm on a diet.

00:23:12.945 --> 00:23:16.278
Kebab. no meat. no bread.
Just lettuce and tomato.

00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:17.695
The usual?

00:23:17.862 --> 00:23:19.445
Just kidding. The usual.

00:23:19.612 --> 00:23:21.237
Everything but onions.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.278
No onions.

00:23:22.445 --> 00:23:24.612
- For here or to go?
- For here.

00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:25.820
All right.

00:23:37.903 --> 00:23:39.445
I love my son.

00:23:39.612 --> 00:23:42.987
I wanted to teach him a lesson.
so he'd cool off.

00:23:43.153 --> 00:23:44.820
I'm not a bad mom!

00:23:45.903 --> 00:23:48.945
- I didn't want to kill him...
- Shut up.

00:23:53.612 --> 00:23:54.737
Stop now.

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:16.903
<i>Backup requested by the riverbank.</i>

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.070
<i>What's wrong?</i>

00:24:19.778 --> 00:24:20.695
<i>Nothing.</i>

00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:26.362
Cool.

00:24:27.153 --> 00:24:28.903
Time to kick some ass.

00:24:32.195 --> 00:24:33.278
I mean it.

00:24:33.737 --> 00:24:35.612
Leave your ovaries at home.

00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:37.570
Lay off.

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.987
Not today. and not you.

00:24:40.153 --> 00:24:41.445
Why "not me"?

00:24:42.195 --> 00:24:44.320
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:46.612
So what is it?

00:24:47.278 --> 00:24:49.403
I'm getting an abortion.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.487
I couldn't leave my ovaries at home.
Sorry.

00:24:55.195 --> 00:24:56.862
It's not your fault.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.903
I forgot my pill.
One fucking time. here we are.

00:25:05.445 --> 00:25:07.028
You sure it's mine?

00:25:07.862 --> 00:25:09.278
Yeah. I'm sure.

00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:11.778
I'll spare you the details.
100% sure.

00:25:37.278 --> 00:25:39.237
Why did you become a cop?

00:25:41.445 --> 00:25:44.028
Don't say you dreamt of it as a kid.

00:25:45.112 --> 00:25:46.737
I wanted to figure skate.

00:25:48.362 --> 00:25:49.445
Really?

00:25:50.195 --> 00:25:52.487
How did you go from skates to guns?

00:25:53.612 --> 00:25:55.987
I don't know. It just happened.

00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:57.945
Let me guess.

00:25:58.278 --> 00:25:59.070
Dad a cop?

00:25:59.237 --> 00:26:00.195
Nope.

00:26:00.737 --> 00:26:02.695
- Grandfather a cop?
- Not even.

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:04.487
How about you?

00:26:05.737 --> 00:26:07.028
Well. me...

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.195
My choice was dealer or junkie.
Like my brothers.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.695
What can I say?

00:26:15.278 --> 00:26:16.487
I went astray.

00:26:19.695 --> 00:26:20.987
You believed me?

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.653
It's not true?

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.153
- You believed me?
- Yeah.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.237
Nope.

00:26:25.487 --> 00:26:27.237
Why not?
How would I know?

00:26:27.403 --> 00:26:29.612
- You're so prejudiced.
- Nonsense.

00:26:29.778 --> 00:26:30.737
You are.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.362
It could have been true.

00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:36.570
I have no brothers.

00:26:36.737 --> 00:26:37.653
All right.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.195
Just a sister.

00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:41.070
She's a judge.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.820
Okay. Is that true?

00:26:43.195 --> 00:26:44.070
No.

00:26:44.237 --> 00:26:45.778
- It isn't?
- Nope.

00:26:47.278 --> 00:26:48.862
She's a speech therapist.

00:26:49.778 --> 00:26:50.903
Which is still cool.

00:26:54.862 --> 00:26:55.778
An ice skater.

00:26:58.403 --> 00:26:59.320
Yep.

00:26:59.778 --> 00:27:01.278
I don't believe you.

00:28:04.237 --> 00:28:05.945
When is your curfew?

00:28:08.612 --> 00:28:09.570
Is your husband nice?

00:28:09.862 --> 00:28:11.070
Yeah. he is.

00:28:11.445 --> 00:28:12.612
He's cool.

00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:13.528
And the kid?

00:28:14.695 --> 00:28:15.820
How old is he now?

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:19.237
Young enough to count in months.

00:28:21.987 --> 00:28:23.237
How long you married?

00:28:23.695 --> 00:28:25.778
Is this an interrogation?

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.278
Can I keep my shoes and laces?

00:28:29.445 --> 00:28:31.112
I'm just interested.

00:28:31.903 --> 00:28:32.737
I'm not allowed?

00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:36.612
Seven years.

00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:38.903
Wow. not bad.

00:28:41.153 --> 00:28:43.945
I never went beyond seven days.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.487
Bravo.

00:28:45.862 --> 00:28:47.195
That's the way I am.

00:28:47.903 --> 00:28:49.570
I can't be tamed.

00:28:51.528 --> 00:28:53.653
No one's trying to tame you.

00:28:54.153 --> 00:28:55.445
You mustn't worry.

00:28:55.903 --> 00:28:57.028
Really?

00:28:58.903 --> 00:28:59.987
Not even a little?

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.028
You're being an idiot.

00:29:07.362 --> 00:29:08.987
And I have to tell you.

00:29:09.153 --> 00:29:10.070
What?

00:29:11.737 --> 00:29:12.903
You skate well.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.153
All right.

00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:20.362
I have to go.

00:29:21.987 --> 00:29:23.070
Goodnight.

00:29:56.403 --> 00:29:59.153
I need two officers to volunteer.
It's urgent.

00:29:59.487 --> 00:30:00.487
Aristide?

00:30:00.903 --> 00:30:02.112
No way.

00:30:02.445 --> 00:30:04.570
I have a life. unlike others.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.653
Erik? Up for it?

00:30:09.028 --> 00:30:11.403
Yeah. but they have some nerve.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.320
The fire isn't their fault.

00:30:14.487 --> 00:30:15.487
I'll do it.

00:30:15.862 --> 00:30:18.362
I have no plans.

00:30:20.403 --> 00:30:22.278
We'll meet you at the car.

00:30:24.362 --> 00:30:25.612
Still. I don't like it.

00:30:25.778 --> 00:30:28.153
Escorting a prisoner isn't hard.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320
I don't like it.

00:30:29.487 --> 00:30:32.445
Neither do I.
I'd rather be with my wife.

00:30:32.945 --> 00:30:34.112
Herve!

00:30:35.195 --> 00:30:37.112
I was kidding. I can go.

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.737
No one's expecting me.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.695
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:43.570
All right then.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.320
Asomidin Tohirov?

00:31:05.112 --> 00:31:07.070
We're sending you to your country.

00:31:14.778 --> 00:31:15.903
Understand?

00:31:36.987 --> 00:31:38.237
Sit down.

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.362
Give that to me.

00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:15.320
What is this?

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.570
You meant to swallow it?

00:32:53.487 --> 00:32:55.112
What are you doing here?

00:33:15.612 --> 00:33:16.612
So?

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:19.403
Ready to kick out a foreigner?

00:33:20.528 --> 00:33:22.028
Why do you say that?

00:33:22.403 --> 00:33:24.153
It's what we're doing.

00:33:25.653 --> 00:33:26.903
You hadn't understood?

00:33:28.112 --> 00:33:29.153
Erik. is this true?

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.237
Yes. because of the fire.

00:33:31.653 --> 00:33:34.653
A guy needs to be at the airport.
We're driving him.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.403
It's not our job.
Why do we have to?

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.195
Not our job? Why did you offer?

00:33:40.487 --> 00:33:41.862
You're funny.

00:33:42.028 --> 00:33:46.278
I told you. Escort Crew is busy
transporting detainees.

00:33:46.778 --> 00:33:48.070
I didn't know.

00:33:48.612 --> 00:33:49.778
You volunteered.

00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:51.278
I couldn't guess.

00:33:52.612 --> 00:33:55.028
You just didn't want to go home.

00:34:12.487 --> 00:34:14.570
Where's an all-night drugstore?

00:34:15.403 --> 00:34:17.112
What's wrong now?

00:34:17.653 --> 00:34:20.403
I need to make a quick stop.
Can we?

00:34:21.195 --> 00:34:22.570
Can't wait till tomorrow?

00:34:22.737 --> 00:34:25.070
No. I needed to go after my shift.

00:34:25.403 --> 00:34:27.820
I don't know where there is one.

00:34:28.737 --> 00:34:30.320
There's one at Nation.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.695
We have time to make a detour.
Quickly.

00:35:09.653 --> 00:35:10.570
Anything else?

00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:12.903
A glass of water.

00:35:16.612 --> 00:35:18.945
Prefab units are fire hazards.

00:35:19.237 --> 00:35:21.528
They cram them in
and they're surprised.

00:38:13.112 --> 00:38:14.945
<i>That's the way it is</i>

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:20.820
<i>So damn pretty.
when she goes out</i>

00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:27.028
<i>So damn pretty.
I love her so damn much</i>

00:38:28.987 --> 00:38:32.570
<i>She has eyes like a gun</i>

00:38:32.945 --> 00:38:35.653
<i>She has a killer gaze</i>

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.528
<i>She's pulled the trigger first</i>

00:38:38.695 --> 00:38:40.695
<i>She hit me. I'm dying...</i>

00:38:50.445 --> 00:38:52.570
You're such a cock-block.

00:38:54.945 --> 00:38:57.278
You two are so depressing.

00:38:57.695 --> 00:38:59.778
It's like being in a hearse.

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:09.237
I won a song contest as a kid.

00:39:10.862 --> 00:39:14.112
I had a voice. I swear...
clear as crystal.

00:39:14.445 --> 00:39:15.987
Angelic.

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:19.528
My grandma thought I'd be
the next Michael Jackson.

00:39:21.237 --> 00:39:23.445
But no... my voice changed.

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:26.528
Who cares about your life?

00:39:27.237 --> 00:39:28.653
We don't give a shit.

00:39:29.153 --> 00:39:31.112
You're pissing us off.

00:40:00.737 --> 00:40:01.862
The reception office?

00:40:02.028 --> 00:40:03.445
Down on the left.

00:40:58.112 --> 00:41:01.570
I'm here to take the detainee
to the airport.

00:41:02.612 --> 00:41:03.987
Follow me.

00:41:05.362 --> 00:41:06.695
How did the fire start?

00:41:06.862 --> 00:41:08.362
With a mattress.

00:41:08.653 --> 00:41:11.445
They have lots of imagination.
Lots.

00:41:12.487 --> 00:41:16.612
Some slice open their bellies.
others start fires.

00:41:17.362 --> 00:41:18.945
Each one has his thing.

00:41:20.737 --> 00:41:22.153
We have nothing here.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.903
No equipment.

00:41:24.403 --> 00:41:26.362
Not even an emergency exit.

00:41:26.737 --> 00:41:28.320
We had to cut the bars

00:41:28.487 --> 00:41:30.403
or they'd all have sizzled.

00:41:41.862 --> 00:41:43.820
Guy in the orange sweater.

00:41:43.987 --> 00:41:45.237
A Tadjik.

00:41:46.028 --> 00:41:47.778
He has his belongings.

00:41:48.487 --> 00:41:50.487
- Was he frisked?
- He's clean.

00:41:50.653 --> 00:41:53.612
He had a blade on him. so watch out.

00:43:13.278 --> 00:43:16.195
For the Deportation Unit at Roissy.

00:43:19.237 --> 00:43:20.862
Know where you're going?

00:43:22.362 --> 00:43:23.695
Understands nothing.

00:43:24.278 --> 00:43:26.362
We're taking you to the airport.

00:43:27.362 --> 00:43:31.153
You have a layover in Istanbul.
Then back to Tajikistan.

00:43:32.153 --> 00:43:33.528
Any objections?

00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:35.862
No?

00:43:37.695 --> 00:43:39.778
I'll handcuff you for the ride.

00:44:37.112 --> 00:44:38.362
Tohirov?

00:44:38.987 --> 00:44:41.278
You're not going to the airport?

00:44:41.737 --> 00:44:44.862
We appealed to the European Court
for Human Rights.

00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:46.278
They're ruling soon.

00:44:46.445 --> 00:44:47.612
I know nothing about it.

00:44:47.778 --> 00:44:49.737
They'll kill him back home.

00:44:49.903 --> 00:44:50.987
It's not my call.

00:44:51.153 --> 00:44:53.403
You may as well let him burn.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:54.820
Less hypocritical!

00:44:55.737 --> 00:44:57.653
Noble profession! Bravo!

00:45:01.278 --> 00:45:02.320
So?

00:45:02.612 --> 00:45:03.737
It's all good.

00:45:04.112 --> 00:45:05.320
I was looking for you.

00:45:05.487 --> 00:45:06.487
I'm here.

00:45:29.528 --> 00:45:31.653
We saved you from the flames.

00:45:33.153 --> 00:45:35.362
- Say thanks.
- No French.

00:45:35.528 --> 00:45:37.570
TN12. individual in custody.

00:45:37.737 --> 00:45:38.487
<i>Copy that.</i>

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:05.987
He's not too calm?

00:46:07.612 --> 00:46:09.028
Keep an eye on him...

00:46:11.612 --> 00:46:12.737
Yeah.

00:47:29.695 --> 00:47:30.570
Erik...

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.945
Why did you open it?

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.528
What are you. a cop?

00:47:38.695 --> 00:47:39.987
Is your name on it?

00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:41.737
No? So don't open.

00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:43.528
It was half open.

00:47:43.903 --> 00:47:44.945
Mail theft.

00:47:57.528 --> 00:47:59.195
Something political?

00:47:59.903 --> 00:48:01.362
I don't know...

00:48:03.778 --> 00:48:05.820
Understand what you read?

00:48:08.112 --> 00:48:10.028
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

00:48:11.445 --> 00:48:12.695
And so?

00:48:12.987 --> 00:48:14.112
Just words.

00:48:14.278 --> 00:48:16.612
Excuse me.
"Men in masks led me

00:48:17.362 --> 00:48:19.195
to an isolation cell.

00:48:19.362 --> 00:48:21.653
a dungeon.
I was tortured for days.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.112
Very violent.
Groups of 3 or 4. at all hours.

00:48:25.278 --> 00:48:28.903
They beat me nonstop.
Fists. feet. clubs.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.112
A torturer asked if I wanted a smoke.

00:48:32.445 --> 00:48:33.320
I said yes.

00:48:33.487 --> 00:48:34.737
He lit a cigarette

00:48:34.903 --> 00:48:37.862
and put a gas mask on me.
so I'd suffocate.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.737
Then they put wires around my wrists

00:48:44.153 --> 00:48:46.612
and electrocuted me.
I fainted.

00:48:46.945 --> 00:48:49.820
It lasted ten days.
I thought I'd die."

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:53.112
Just words?

00:48:53.278 --> 00:48:55.903
A story like that costs 15 euros.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:59.487
There are tons of details.
He can't have invented it.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.612
What do you want us to do?

00:49:04.653 --> 00:49:07.403
Envelopes are sealed for a reason.

00:49:12.987 --> 00:49:14.612
They're going to kill him.

00:49:14.778 --> 00:49:16.195
A real sob story.

00:49:16.362 --> 00:49:17.278
Yeah.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.653
They exaggerate the threat
to get refugee status.

00:49:22.903 --> 00:49:24.987
They lie. Embroider.

00:49:25.695 --> 00:49:27.487
Why issue an order to deport

00:49:27.653 --> 00:49:30.278
if he'd be killed upon arrival?

00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:31.737
Think it over.

00:49:38.945 --> 00:49:41.612
Enough.
We're not here to chitchat.

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:43.820
We're cops. not social workers.

00:49:43.987 --> 00:49:46.028
You never loosen up.

00:51:32.903 --> 00:51:33.778
What the hell?

00:51:35.153 --> 00:51:36.445
It's okay. He's fine.

00:51:36.987 --> 00:51:38.987
What's got into you?
Cuff him.

00:51:41.403 --> 00:51:42.278
Go on. breathe.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.278
What's your problem today?

00:51:46.028 --> 00:51:48.570
Is he a friend of yours?
Got family in Tajikistan?

00:51:49.903 --> 00:51:52.278
He's a shrimp.
Why are you scared?

00:51:52.445 --> 00:51:54.820
You're a pain! A real pain!

00:51:55.695 --> 00:51:56.612
Isn't she?

00:51:57.528 --> 00:51:59.112
Yes. She's a pain.

00:52:09.237 --> 00:52:11.112
<i>I'm working. dammit!</i>

00:53:48.528 --> 00:53:50.362
Why not the flashing lights?

00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:03.570
Yeah. run red lights.
take roundabouts counter-clockwise.

00:54:03.737 --> 00:54:05.362
Want the engine on our laps?

00:54:05.695 --> 00:54:08.153
I said we have time.
What's your problem?

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.945
<i>Your mother?</i>

00:54:23.195 --> 00:54:24.362
<i>No. my grandmother.</i>

00:54:24.862 --> 00:54:26.445
She raised me.

00:54:26.612 --> 00:54:28.237
One hell of a woman.

00:54:28.403 --> 00:54:29.820
What about your parents?

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:31.445
What about them?

00:54:32.195 --> 00:54:33.820
What did they do?

00:54:34.487 --> 00:54:35.862
Where are they from?

00:54:39.237 --> 00:54:41.112
Do I ask you questions?

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.862
I can't know?

00:54:45.445 --> 00:54:47.070
They were in France.

00:54:47.528 --> 00:54:49.112
I came afterwards.

00:54:49.278 --> 00:54:50.903
How old were you?

00:55:01.153 --> 00:55:03.070
Do we have to share our lives?

00:55:05.112 --> 00:55:06.028
Yes?

00:55:06.445 --> 00:55:07.278
No.

00:55:11.528 --> 00:55:14.028
We'll have to stop meeting up.

00:55:14.945 --> 00:55:16.070
I know.

00:55:16.237 --> 00:55:18.862
I don't know. like this anyway...

00:55:19.778 --> 00:55:21.945
- I'm trying. I swear.
- Okay.

00:55:23.237 --> 00:55:24.570
Trying very hard.

00:55:24.737 --> 00:55:26.028
I keep saying it.

00:55:26.195 --> 00:55:28.362
I'm also trying hard.

00:55:28.903 --> 00:55:30.570
I keep saying to myself:

00:55:30.945 --> 00:55:33.528
"Miss Norway isn't for you.

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.487
She's not for you.

00:55:37.528 --> 00:55:38.862
She's married."

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.737
So I try to imagine you old. wrinkled.

00:55:44.153 --> 00:55:46.195
Ugly as sin. no teeth.

00:55:46.653 --> 00:55:49.153
So you'll disgust me forever.

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.778
So I can move on.
But then you laugh...

00:55:52.028 --> 00:55:53.528
What can I do?

00:55:54.612 --> 00:55:57.070
My heart melts like snow in the sun.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.945
A poet. You kept that hidden.

00:56:01.695 --> 00:56:03.778
What do I do now?

00:56:03.945 --> 00:56:04.862
Figure it out.

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.862
It's a lost cause.

00:56:13.778 --> 00:56:15.112
Why are you exiting?

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:17.362
I'm hungry.

00:56:34.195 --> 00:56:35.320
Coming?

00:56:37.528 --> 00:56:38.862
Hurry up.

00:57:07.362 --> 00:57:10.903
Keep it up
and Erik's going to lose it.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.320
What are you after?

00:57:14.695 --> 00:57:16.403
Any chance the Tajik can run?

00:57:17.278 --> 00:57:18.278
No.

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:26.445
Would you let him run?

00:57:26.945 --> 00:57:28.487
I have no idea.

00:57:29.403 --> 00:57:31.112
I don't care about him.

00:57:31.903 --> 00:57:35.070
Think Mr. Clean would let you do it?

00:57:36.112 --> 00:57:37.153
But you...

00:57:38.737 --> 00:57:40.278
would you let him run?

00:57:41.362 --> 00:57:42.653
You're talking crap.

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.320
They're playing me for a fool.

00:57:49.528 --> 00:57:51.403
Don't try anything stupid.

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:54.945
I have my eyes on you.

00:57:58.862 --> 00:58:00.403
I'm no fool.

00:58:02.403 --> 00:58:04.112
You play the victim.

00:58:04.278 --> 00:58:06.945
but maybe you came
to blow up a market.

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.945
Who knows if you're an innocent lamb?

00:58:11.195 --> 00:58:14.028
Refugee or terrorist. how can we tell?

00:58:15.612 --> 00:58:17.153
No one is innocent

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.028
until proof of the contrary.

00:58:44.903 --> 00:58:48.195
3- course meal?
They're fucking in the crapper!

00:58:55.112 --> 00:58:56.778
I don't understand what you said.

00:58:58.278 --> 00:58:59.653
I don't understand.

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.653
I understand nothing.

00:59:21.028 --> 00:59:23.528
You're even prettier when you frown.

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.237
You're stupid.

00:59:27.403 --> 00:59:28.737
I wish.

00:59:29.028 --> 00:59:30.195
Wish what?

00:59:30.362 --> 00:59:31.653
That I was stupid.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.778
What you told me earlier...

00:59:41.612 --> 00:59:43.362
about what you're doing...

00:59:47.195 --> 00:59:48.862
I keep thinking about it.

00:59:52.862 --> 00:59:54.195
It kills me.

00:59:56.987 --> 00:59:59.070
I can't get it out of my head.

01:00:05.153 --> 01:00:06.570
When are you going?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.612
Tomorrow morning.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.695
Is anyone accompanying you?

01:00:13.112 --> 01:00:14.028
Yes.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.778
I'm going with a friend.

01:00:16.945 --> 01:00:18.070
Good.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.195
- Just don't go alone.
- Don't worry.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:25.903
Corinne is coming along.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.445
Corinne?

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:38.903
You better watch your guy.
He can up and go.

01:00:40.653 --> 01:00:41.737
No. no.

01:00:42.445 --> 01:00:45.362
He's not hungry.
He'll eat in the plane.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.070
Come on.

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.362
What are you doing?

01:01:12.028 --> 01:01:13.737
Think I don't understand?

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.445
You open the file. uncuff him.

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:21.778
stop for burgers.
stop at every light.

01:01:23.237 --> 01:01:26.862
We're asked to take him to Roissy.
we take him to Roissy.

01:01:27.737 --> 01:01:30.278
Police. airport. airplane.
Understand?

01:01:34.528 --> 01:01:38.362
At least Escort Crew is competent.
Imagine the clusterfuck!

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.362
- Someone shit on your brains?
- Enough!

01:01:42.112 --> 01:01:44.195
Stop bossing us around.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.528
What do you think?

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.570
That your platitudes impress us?

01:02:01.445 --> 01:02:03.445
You'll make me gain weight.

01:02:06.778 --> 01:02:08.153
Find that funny?

01:03:34.737 --> 01:03:36.487
Pain in the fucking ass!

01:03:36.653 --> 01:03:37.820
Pull over!

01:03:38.445 --> 01:03:39.862
What do I do?

01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:41.320
Take the exit.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.945
And he's not cuffed. dammit!

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:04.362
Get up front.

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:28.528
I take the highway?

01:04:31.445 --> 01:04:33.153
Yes or no?

01:04:37.612 --> 01:04:38.737
So?

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.445
Of course. Take the highway.

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.362
What else?

01:04:45.112 --> 01:04:47.320
Open the door and let him run?

01:04:47.945 --> 01:04:49.903
You think it's that easy?

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:51.528
Think so?

01:04:51.695 --> 01:04:54.945
Sure. it's romantic.
but you think it's easy.

01:04:56.778 --> 01:04:59.153
They wouldn't send a chopper.

01:04:59.487 --> 01:05:01.195
He's not a fugitive.

01:05:01.612 --> 01:05:03.028
Yeah. he's nothing.

01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:04.903
No one cares about him.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.903
If he vanished.
no one would go looking.

01:05:10.653 --> 01:05:13.487
He's just a poor guy. not a criminal.

01:05:14.903 --> 01:05:15.737
What do you know?

01:05:16.278 --> 01:05:17.820
I know. that's all.

01:05:35.987 --> 01:05:37.653
And your panic attacks?

01:05:38.487 --> 01:05:39.612
Fine.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.112
Still a tranquilizer a day?

01:05:43.945 --> 01:05:45.695
I'm down to a quarter.

01:05:45.862 --> 01:05:49.028
If it's not enough.
three quarters. or four.

01:05:51.987 --> 01:05:53.653
Meaning a whole pill.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.153
Sometimes it comes back.

01:06:01.903 --> 01:06:03.362
Especially at night.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:07.528
I tell myself
his death wasn't my fault.

01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:12.653
I couldn't know
the guy had a box-cutter.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.362
Bad luck. that's all.

01:06:20.903 --> 01:06:22.153
Bad luck?

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.320
Is that what you really think?

01:06:25.737 --> 01:06:27.362
I don't think.

01:06:28.112 --> 01:06:30.528
I think nothing.
I clear out my head.

01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:37.653
It's like there's a desert inside.

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.362
I listen to the wind blow.

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:43.903
And I move forward.

01:06:45.153 --> 01:06:46.153
That's all.

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.737
I move forward.

01:06:53.695 --> 01:06:54.862
Look at him.

01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:58.820
Look.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.653
Still waters run deep.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.028
Stop with your dumb proverbs.

01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:06.362
Look at him.

01:07:20.612 --> 01:07:22.820
You two are out of your minds!

01:07:23.487 --> 01:07:26.445
We'd be in deep shit
if we let him run.

01:07:26.612 --> 01:07:27.903
You have no idea!

01:07:33.612 --> 01:07:35.653
You're okay
sending him to die?

01:07:36.903 --> 01:07:38.653
I'm the bastard. is that it?

01:07:38.987 --> 01:07:41.737
You're humanists.
I'm a dumb. obedient cop.

01:07:41.903 --> 01:07:44.695
Yes. I follow orders. It's my job.

01:07:45.278 --> 01:07:47.153
It's yours too. Dammit!

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.903
You're all pissing me off!

01:07:56.653 --> 01:07:58.028
Yes. what now?

01:08:02.237 --> 01:08:03.987
Martine. I'm working.

01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:06.487
Understand? Working!

01:08:07.445 --> 01:08:11.070
Unlike you. on my ass
popping pills and watching TV.

01:08:11.237 --> 01:08:13.945
We'll deal with this later.
Okay? Later.

01:08:23.528 --> 01:08:25.195
Pain in the fucking ass!

01:08:26.695 --> 01:08:29.612
TN12. it's cutting out.
No-signal zone.

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.028
You have 6 minutes.

01:08:33.195 --> 01:08:35.487
Do as you please.
I wash my hands of it.

01:09:18.528 --> 01:09:20.320
You played your game well.

01:09:22.612 --> 01:09:23.570
Fuck...

01:09:24.653 --> 01:09:26.112
Unbelievable.

01:09:27.778 --> 01:09:29.570
It's a Topsy-turvy world.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.487
What?

01:10:01.987 --> 01:10:03.612
Got a problem with that?

01:10:05.445 --> 01:10:06.862
Go on. say so.

01:10:08.778 --> 01:10:10.612
Got a problem with alcohol?

01:10:19.195 --> 01:10:21.320
Only remedy that works.

01:11:08.237 --> 01:11:11.028
Martine. where are you?
Why won't you answer?

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.403
Now I'm worried.

01:11:13.862 --> 01:11:16.028
Bravo. you won. call me back.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.237
If I ever had to shoot myself.

01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:48.112
I'd come here.

01:13:04.153 --> 01:13:06.278
What the fuck is he doing?

01:13:11.112 --> 01:13:12.862
Enough already. get lost!

01:13:13.403 --> 01:13:15.028
Go. we'll keep quiet.

01:13:15.278 --> 01:13:16.570
We'll keep quiet!

01:13:17.445 --> 01:13:18.403
Wait...

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:20.278
Here. take this.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.112
Go on. run.

01:13:22.362 --> 01:13:23.778
Move it. move it!

01:13:24.445 --> 01:13:25.320
Beat it!

01:13:25.487 --> 01:13:26.570
Go on. go on!

01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:28.362
I don't believe this!

01:13:46.112 --> 01:13:47.195
Forget it.

01:13:47.362 --> 01:13:48.195
Why?

01:13:48.362 --> 01:13:50.653
He thinks we want to kill him.

01:13:56.903 --> 01:13:57.945
Wait.

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:03.612
Now the airport. Get in.

01:14:03.778 --> 01:14:05.070
What's got into you?

01:14:05.237 --> 01:14:08.195
Stick your consciences up your asses.
Get in.

01:14:08.695 --> 01:14:10.653
- We almost...
- That's enough!

01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:12.570
You're fucking pains!

01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:16.778
I can't take it anymore.

01:14:17.403 --> 01:14:18.528
Enough!

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:24.612
He won't run an inch.

01:14:24.778 --> 01:14:26.903
Stop bothering him and get in.

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:29.237
Good dog.

01:14:29.987 --> 01:14:32.403
A good little retriever. Great.

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:37.070
Get in.

01:14:37.778 --> 01:14:40.070
Stop showing off.
Let's finish the job.

01:14:40.487 --> 01:14:42.528
You got no balls. do you?

01:14:43.528 --> 01:14:45.112
Not yours. in any case.

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:50.653
Get in.

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:53.987
What if I refuse?
What then?

01:14:54.862 --> 01:14:56.028
You'll call the cops?

01:14:56.195 --> 01:14:57.403
That's enough.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.778
Everyone. get in. Let's go.

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:05.653
Get in!

01:18:30.028 --> 01:18:31.695
The file. please.

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:35.195
Hey. What's he like?

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:36.778
Cooperative.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:38.945
This way. sir.

01:18:39.112 --> 01:18:40.278
Come.

01:18:40.612 --> 01:18:42.903
Go inside. We'll search you.

01:18:46.403 --> 01:18:50.028
You leave today. Understand?
You take the plane.

01:18:51.195 --> 01:18:52.487
We'll search you.

01:18:54.403 --> 01:18:55.820
Can we go now?

01:18:56.362 --> 01:18:58.403
You must wait till takeoff.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.695
Are you kidding? Wait an hour?

01:19:02.528 --> 01:19:04.195
Yes. and I'm being nice.

01:19:04.362 --> 01:19:06.362
Rule is you wait 2 hours.

01:19:06.528 --> 01:19:08.862
till the point of no-return.

01:19:22.487 --> 01:19:24.237
Are you hazing us?

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:26.778
Because we're not Escort Crew?

01:19:27.653 --> 01:19:30.612
Not at all. it's just procedure.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.987
- You okay?
- No...

01:22:06.778 --> 01:22:09.195
I don't feel well. Can we stop?

01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.445
Virginie. what are you doing?

01:24:22.862 --> 01:24:24.987
We're in charge of security.

01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:26.778
It's under control.

01:24:26.945 --> 01:24:28.612
He was agitated. but...

01:24:28.778 --> 01:24:30.445
Why the Velcro cuffs?

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.070
They never come off. Procedure.

01:24:33.487 --> 01:24:34.778
- He's calm.
- He's dangerous.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.612
Don't fall for his victim act.

01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:59.070
...he's capable of anything...

01:25:05.862 --> 01:25:07.945
...want to take that risk?

01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:12.778
We'll remove him.

01:26:02.237 --> 01:26:03.737
Watch out for mosquitos.

01:26:04.528 --> 01:26:05.987
They carry malaria here.

01:26:10.487 --> 01:26:11.903
There are rabbits.

01:26:14.445 --> 01:26:16.570
I'm so damn stupid.

01:26:19.112 --> 01:26:22.862
Talking about rabbits.
not the stuff I want to say.

01:26:27.612 --> 01:26:29.028
Like what?

01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:36.945
Even if you're crazy.

01:26:39.237 --> 01:26:41.195
life is less boring with you.

01:27:04.278 --> 01:27:08.445
Remember the schizo who killed his son.
then himself.

01:27:08.945 --> 01:27:09.987
Yeah.

01:27:10.362 --> 01:27:12.237
Remember the mom's cries?

01:27:13.987 --> 01:27:15.903
I still remember the address.

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:17.445
The floor.

01:27:17.612 --> 01:27:19.237
I remember the door code.

01:27:19.403 --> 01:27:21.237
Want me to tell you?

01:27:24.612 --> 01:27:26.570
I'm no retriever dog.

01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:51.612
Thanks for calming down
the Customs agents.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.987
Don't exaggerate.

01:27:56.528 --> 01:27:59.653
I did damage control.
They'll report us.

01:28:01.195 --> 01:28:02.778
A fucking report.

01:28:06.195 --> 01:28:08.653
20 years of service. not one blemish

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.987
and you stir up the shit.

01:28:11.487 --> 01:28:13.112
I feel dirty.

01:28:13.945 --> 01:28:16.153
I lied to cover your asses.

01:28:17.153 --> 01:28:18.695
What got into you two?

01:28:19.570 --> 01:28:20.612
Jesus...

01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:23.028
What got into you?

01:28:23.403 --> 01:28:25.653
What did you buy him. 2 days?

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.445
You don't think
he'll be on the next plane?

01:28:28.778 --> 01:28:30.028
You never know.

01:28:31.278 --> 01:28:34.653
- If the European Court rules...
- Yeah. right.

01:28:37.195 --> 01:28:38.820
Keep lying to yourself.

01:29:19.403 --> 01:29:20.903
Not going home. chief?

01:29:21.237 --> 01:29:23.778
No. as you can see. I'm not.

01:29:30.112 --> 01:29:31.362
See you tomorrow.

01:29:31.778 --> 01:29:32.820
Yep.

01:29:51.945 --> 01:29:55.320
<i>No use coming home.
I changed the lock.</i>

01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:35.945
47. 48. 49...

01:30:51.487 --> 01:30:52.820
60.

01:32:12.945 --> 01:32:15.862
I'll keep my clothes.
You don't mind?

01:32:20.612 --> 01:32:23.320
Just your hands on my arms. my back...

01:32:27.153 --> 01:32:28.487
Gently.

01:32:34.778 --> 01:32:38.195
Just my back and arms.
Don't bother on my skin.
