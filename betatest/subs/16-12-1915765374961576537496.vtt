﻿1
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.030
Now. I'd say we stop off at
Juan Patròn's for one jolly big dram

2
00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.408
..and one ginger beer
with a dollar of whipped cream.

3
00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:11.909
Who gets the whiskey?

4
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.537
Seniority. Doc. the one
closest to coffin. Anyway...

5
00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.250
If I buy you a dram. you must
promise not to tell the other boys.

6
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.751
It's promised.

7
00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:34.264
Oh. no!
Not another hanging.

8
00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:08.129
Howdy.

9
00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:10.381
Come on lad.

10
00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:14.719
Hurry up. don't be afraid.

11
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.089
You want to play games. pendejo?

12
00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.007
You red-assed Mexican greaser.
You do it with your horse!

13
00:03:57.592 --> 00:04:00.095
- Mexican greaser!
- Come here you little white chicken shit!

14
00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:01.763
Greaser! Greaser...
Come on greaser. cut me there!

15
00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:04.599
Hey. hey! Knock it off.
knock it off. hey!

16
00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:10.272
- Cut me there. Mexican!
- Hey! Knock it off! You know better. Chavez!

17
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.024
- Navajo! Navajo!
- Enough!

18
00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:19.321
John's back. Now wash it up
and in your supper clothes! Now!

19
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.739
Both of you!

20
00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.332
Who are them?

21
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:33.877
"They". William. "Who are they?"

22
00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:36.754
They are the boys of the dregs...

23
00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:40.675
the flotsam and jetsam
of frontier society. if you will.

24
00:04:42.051 --> 00:04:44.762
We got room in the
bunkhouse. my young man.

25
00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:49.517
If you don't want to stay. the Santa Fe
runs out of Albuquerque in the morning.

26
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:54.022
Glad you're back. Doc.
Stile hold the rope. inside.

27
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.025
- John bring another hard case in?
- Hope it ain't another Mexican.

28
00:04:58.108 --> 00:04:59.484
Mexican-Indian.
you son-of-a-bitch!

29
00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:04.031
If you do wish to stay. well.
we have just the job for you.

30
00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:11.872
He ain't all there is he?

31
00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:13.749
Christ!

32
00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:32.934
Hey. did you know pigs
are as smart as dogs?

33
00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:35.228
It's true.

34
00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:40.023
I knew a fella in El Capitan...
taught his pig to bark at strangers.

35
00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:44.945
What you doing here. boy?

36
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.491
We work for Mr. Tunstall as regulators.

37
00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.495
We regulate any stealing
of his property. We're damn good too.

38
00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:58.165
Mr. Tunstall's got a soft spot
for runaways. derelicts.

39
00:05:58.374 --> 00:06:02.378
vagrant types. But you
can't be any geek off the street.

40
00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:05.839
you gotta be handy with the steel.
if you know what I mean. earn your keep.

41
00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:08.634
Go on. go on. get!

42
00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:12.596
Not that I'm a pistoleer or
a knife smith like that greaser

43
00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:15.432
Chavez-Chavez. over there.

44
00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:18.018
I'm pugilist.

45
00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:22.314
But then I ain't expecting you
to know the explanation of that word.

46
00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.191
hog boy!

47
00:06:25.943 --> 00:06:27.903
Shit. you don't even know why I'm here.

48
00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:30.990
Sure I do. You're a runaway
derelict. scud bottom vagrant.

49
00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:33.701
ain't you. like the rest
of us. Footpad. maybe?

50
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.662
Petty thief?
Rob a bank? Kill somebody?

51
00:06:40.248 --> 00:06:41.833
Kill somebody. huh?

52
00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.006
- Regulators!
- Hey. you ain't no regulator boy.

53
00:06:48.214 --> 00:06:50.174
you gotta stay here with the pork.
They're smarter than you anyway.

54
00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:51.426
You might learn something!

55
00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.345
Cattle looks spooked in the
lower forty. let's take a look.

56
00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:56.972
Smart ass!

57
00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:04.521
Well now. look at those appetites.

58
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.612
William? Have some more.

59
00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:17.867
Have you ever
worked beef before. Billy?

60
00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:21.120
Yeah... I worked a little
out Fort Sumner way.

61
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:25.124
Pete Maxwell's place.
Did the chow line.

62
00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:28.920
But. I got a way with cattle.

63
00:07:34.842 --> 00:07:37.344
What's so jolly funny.
Master Steven?

64
00:07:38.094 --> 00:07:40.263
That's no proper table manners.

65
00:07:42.724 --> 00:07:44.768
Got a way with hogs.

66
00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:49.105
Congratulations. Charles.

67
00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:52.359
You and Steven will be doing
the dirty crockery alone this evening.

68
00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:57.280
Sorry. John. it struck me funny.

69
00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:00.241
And to William. Both of you.

70
00:08:01.742 --> 00:08:05.371
Apologies William.
Just hacking on you. that's all.

71
00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:08.123
Yeah. we're just hacking on you.

72
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.177
Rumor has it. you killed a man. Billy?
You don’t seem like the killing sort.

73
00:08:21.344 --> 00:08:23.471
Yeah Billy.
what'd you kill him for?

74
00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:28.017
He was hacking on me.

75
00:08:36.693 --> 00:08:44.866
"There are plenty of men...
who will never secede...

76
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.202
"Succeed".

77
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:53.041
"...Who will never
succeed anywhere."

78
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.627
We got a whole roomful
of them right here.

79
00:08:58.379 --> 00:08:59.547
Well done.

80
00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:04.010
William.

81
00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.100
Yeah. sure.

82
00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:16.022
Well. excuse me. Billy...
Very sorry to offend you.

83
00:09:17.148 --> 00:09:20.609
But we're congregated here
to learn to read and write.

84
00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:23.153
You need more than
the skill with the firearm

85
00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:25.447
to succeed in the new world. Billy.

86
00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:27.282
So take up the journal

87
00:09:27.616 --> 00:09:30.327
and start where
the other boy left off.

88
00:09:30.577 --> 00:09:33.538
Or you can go straight back
to your home on the streets.

89
00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:42.046
"Young men who don't know
how to do any kind of business

90
00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:44.840
"and have no energy or application.

91
00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:47.301
"had better stay at a home
near their relatives

92
00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:49.178
"so they can be taken care of.

93
00:09:49.303 --> 00:09:52.056
"They are not wanted here
and will only come to grief

94
00:09:52.264 --> 00:09:56.018
"but men of enterprise
are practically sure of success."

95
00:09:57.645 --> 00:09:58.770
Splendid!

96
00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:05.610
A splendid reading. William!
Thank you.

97
00:10:05.944 --> 00:10:08.780
- Good-night gentlemen.
- Good-night Mr. Tunstall.

98
00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:41.269
Shit!

99
00:10:43.938 --> 00:10:45.064
Pig!

100
00:11:03.707 --> 00:11:06.293
- Good afternoon. gentlemen.
- Good afternoon. John.

101
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.545
John. Mr. Dolan and Mr. Murphy here

102
00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:12.090
are complaining about their
merchandise wagon being plundered

103
00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:15.343
on several occasions
on their way into town.

104
00:11:15.844 --> 00:11:18.346
Quite frankly. John.
they think you're behind it.

105
00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:20.598
- That's a fargin' lie and you know it!
- Richard!

106
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:27.980
Sheriff Brady. Mister Murphy
is going to continue coming to you

107
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.900
claiming I've taken his property
until I'm pronounced a thief

108
00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:32.651
and shaken out of Lincoln.

109
00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.529
I've never touched his property.

110
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.115
I have no cause.

111
00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.200
Well.

112
00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:45.204
the Belted Earl has spoken.

113
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:49.626
Look behind you. Earl...
all I see are hired thieves.

114
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:53.421
These boys are promising young
men acquiring an education.

115
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.299
Well. I had you pegged
as the type that uh...

116
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.468
that likes...

117
00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:03.639
educating young boys. Englishman.

118
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:12.064
Rumor has it that you want
to be bidding against me

119
00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:14.691
for the government beef contracts.

120
00:12:15.525 --> 00:12:20.112
- It is just a rumor. isn't it?
- Lawrence.

121
00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:22.615
You have a beef outfit and a store.

122
00:12:23.407 --> 00:12:25.743
I have a beef outfit and a store.

123
00:12:26.244 --> 00:12:27.745
You're going to try to make money.

124
00:12:27.954 --> 00:12:31.791
I'm going to try to make money.
It's simple and it's fair.

125
00:12:34.377 --> 00:12:37.797
You see our good Sheriff
sitting up there on that horse?

126
00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:41.508
Do you know how much money
he's got invested in my store?

127
00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:44.135
His life savings. John.

128
00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:48.348
And it's not just Brady who
wants me to be getting those contracts.

129
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:51.726
It's the Territorial District Attorney.

130
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.854
the Chief Justice.
The U.S. District Attorney.

131
00:12:54.938 --> 00:12:56.773
The Santa Fe Ring.

132
00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:00.651
It's a family ring. John.

133
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:04.363
And you don't come prancing in here
with your fat foreign capital

134
00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:06.824
and trying to change things.

135
00:13:07.324 --> 00:13:11.120
I made a very long steamship
journey from London. Mister Murphy

136
00:13:12.204 --> 00:13:16.000
So. I should be damned if I'm going
to be dissuaded... by something as ugly

137
00:13:16.208 --> 00:13:20.837
as political corruption.
So. I'd like you to take your threats

138
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:23.798
and your sheriff
and get off my property!

139
00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:26.009
You are ambitious. Earl.

140
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.973
But you'd be better off selling
ladies' undergarments in Hempstead.

141
00:13:34.684 --> 00:13:37.312
Alright men. that's enough.
Clear the way!

142
00:13:38.187 --> 00:13:39.564
This is a new country.

143
00:13:39.772 --> 00:13:42.983
We won't be bowing down
to you no more. Englishman.

144
00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:47.112
Get ready for hell!

145
00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:54.494
Back to work. chaps.

146
00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:32.989
Mr. Tunstall. my name's J. McCloskey.

147
00:14:33.198 --> 00:14:35.575
I heard you're having
some trouble finding help.

148
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.868
McCloskey?

149
00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:38.662
You're one
of the Murphy's boys. aren't you?

150
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.288
I used to be.

151
00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:43.959
He fired me.
I called him a fat sow.

152
00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:45.335
Did you?

153
00:14:47.504 --> 00:14:48.672
Lovely.

154
00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:51.967
The bunkhouse is over there.

155
00:16:04.493 --> 00:16:05.828
Regulators!

156
00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:11.792
Let's dance!

157
00:16:50.704 --> 00:16:54.166
- Look at that buddy go...
- He ain't all there. is he?

158
00:17:01.882 --> 00:17:03.883
Well. he's there enough
to be dancing with a pretty gal

159
00:17:04.092 --> 00:17:06.553
while we sit around here
pulling our tally whackers.

160
00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:08.346
Damn straight.

161
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.060
We have to expose this Ring. Alex.

162
00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:16.938
Can you get me in
to see the Governor?

163
00:17:17.313 --> 00:17:20.608
Murphy's beat us to it.
And he brought the Governor

164
00:17:20.858 --> 00:17:23.443
a nice fat campaign contribution.

165
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.238
They're tightening the yoke
on you. John. Of course.

166
00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:28.073
they want me out. too.

167
00:17:28.282 --> 00:17:31.869
They figure with me gone. no lawyer
would be crazy enough to represent you.

168
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:34.454
You've heard of English
tenacity. haven't you?

169
00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:36.832
A toast to uh...

170
00:17:37.249 --> 00:17:39.877
enough grit to finish the last realm!

171
00:17:44.213 --> 00:17:48.342
Besides... if we gave in and left

172
00:17:49.552 --> 00:17:51.554
who'd look after my boys?

173
00:17:52.263 --> 00:17:55.266
Uh. medicine. Yes.

174
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.228
I should receive my degree
from St. Michael's in July

175
00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:01.397
and then I should be
practicing here in Lincoln

176
00:18:01.564 --> 00:18:04.232

Howdy. My name's Doc.

179
00:18:37.348 --> 00:18:39.225
What... what can I do

180
00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:42.311
Well sir. if you're an acquaintance
of the young miss

181
00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:45.897
I was wondering if I could entreat
the young lady to a dance?

182
00:18:46.189 --> 00:18:49.859
- Why. certainly.
- Thank you.

183
00:18:58.993 --> 00:19:01.621
- What's your name?
- Yen Sun.

184
00:19:02.288 --> 00:19:03.540
That's beautiful.

185
00:19:05.874 --> 00:19:09.878
- You're a friend of Mr. Murphy's?
- He is my guardian.

186
00:19:10.712 --> 00:19:11.630
How?

187
00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:23.933
- Hello there.
- Hello back... William Bonney. sir.

188
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.811

189
00:19:27.895 --> 00:19:31.816
Excuse us. friend. We have
a request for the band.

190
00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:36.696
Pat Garrett!

191
00:19:44.244 --> 00:19:47.247
She'll love that I get
to be as big as him.

192
00:19:48.957 --> 00:19:52.752
No... bigger!

193
00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:59.050
So shows the snowy dove
trooping with crows

194
00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:02.679
As yonder lady
order her fellow's chose.

195
00:20:04.346 --> 00:20:08.017
- Pardon me?
- Uh... That's poem.

196
00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:11.687
I'm a poet. I wrote it.

197
00:20:12.354 --> 00:20:14.148
I'm sorry young man

198
00:20:14.398 --> 00:20:16.859
- but we must be getting along.
- We're getting along famously.

199
00:20:17.067 --> 00:20:20.112
- Thank you very much.
- I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

200
00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:22.907
I was just informed that you're
part of the Tunstall company.

201
00:20:23.115 --> 00:20:24.033
Yes. I am.

202
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.410
Then I'll be expecting
to see you follow

203
00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:30.580
your Englishman
out of Lincoln when he goes.

204
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:34.709
You tell him...

205
00:20:35.418 --> 00:20:38.004
tell that slug to leave
no slime in the road behind him

206
00:20:38.213 --> 00:20:40.715
when he crawls back
to Wharf Street.

207
00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:53.310
- Hey. Alex! How you doing?
- Someone break up your dance. Doc?

208
00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:58.398
- Yeah... yeah. he's the girl's guardian.
- Guardian?

209
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.527
- That's a gentle euphemism.
- Why?

210
00:21:01.735 --> 00:21:04.613
He had a shirt ruined
in the Silver City laundry.

211
00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:08.282
He took the celestial
woman's daughter as payment.

212
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.618
- What?
- She's house entertainment.

213
00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:12.453
as I understand it.

214
00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.542
Come on. you can dance
with Susan. it's safer.

215
00:21:18.167 --> 00:21:19.252
Yeah.

216
00:21:36.268 --> 00:21:39.729
- Out of the way. mister.
- Ah. I do beg your pardon.

217
00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:45.068
- Alright. you and me.
- No. no. no. No it's "you and I".

218
00:21:46.026 --> 00:21:49.905
- Isn't that right John? "You and I"?
- Yes. yes. it is. it is.

219
00:21:56.161 --> 00:21:59.582
You and I.

220
00:22:26.148 --> 00:22:28.150
- Pugilist.
- He's something. ain't he?

221
00:22:28.358 --> 00:22:30.068
Happy New Year!

222
00:22:36.283 --> 00:22:39.453
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

223
00:23:47.434 --> 00:23:50.896
Go on Billy. Boys will be boys.

224
00:24:25.513 --> 00:24:28.348
No! No! It's too many!

225
00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:31.935
Get out of here!

226
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:52.663
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God. in his wise providence.

227
00:24:52.872 --> 00:24:56.375
to take out of this world
the soul of our deceased brother.

228
00:24:56.792 --> 00:24:59.337
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

229
00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:03.883
Ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

230
00:25:05.676 --> 00:25:08.470
Murphy's henchmen
have to be brought in. J.P.

231
00:25:08.637 --> 00:25:11.348
I'm gonna take it to court
and bring Murphy down.

232
00:25:12.182 --> 00:25:14.726
- Have you talked to Sheriff Brady?
- Brady?

233
00:25:15.185 --> 00:25:18.563
Half of the murderers are members
of his posse. He won't touch him!

234
00:25:19.147 --> 00:25:20.649
You're the Justice
of the Peace. Wilson.

235
00:25:20.857 --> 00:25:23.818
You have the power to serve
warrants through special constables.

236
00:25:24.069 --> 00:25:28.280
What special constables? No one's fool
enough to going after Murphy's people.

237
00:25:30.824 --> 00:25:32.493
Deputize them.

238
00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:35.329
McSween. those are just boys.
Ain't one of them over twenty-one.

239
00:25:35.538 --> 00:25:37.915
Murphy's men will shred
them in half within a day.

240
00:25:38.123 --> 00:25:40.417
- Are you gonna deputize them?
- Hell no.

241
00:25:40.918 --> 00:25:42.837
No. I'm not. Alex.

242
00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:46.340
Not me.

243
00:25:47.383 --> 00:25:49.217
Alright. then you go tell them.

244
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.045
Lugar peligroso.

245
00:26:28.004 --> 00:26:31.716
- Bad medicine. my friends.

But you take a message
to your guardian.

00:32:40.067 --> 00:32:42.903
You don't understand. Dick.
By killing Henry Hill you have started a war.

312
00:32:43.112 --> 00:32:46.240
By killing Mr. Tunstall.

Six or Seven?

We're gonna bury you.
You can believe that.

I said quiet. Billy!
I don't need that kind of talk!

325
00:33:16.643 --> 00:33:20.022
Hey. Billy! Easy.

326
00:33:22.107 --> 00:33:26.236
Dick. I don't think we
should go by way of South Fork.

327
00:33:27.154 --> 00:33:30.115
- Why is that?
- I think Murphy'll be watching the trail

328
00:33:30.324 --> 00:33:33.701
in an ambush. I think we should go
straight through to Lincoln.

329
00:33:43.794 --> 00:33:44.962
Hey!

330
00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:48.257

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:58.850
Where is the ambush. McCloskey?
In Lincoln?

334
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.728
You're trying to steer us away
from Capitàn cause you know your men.

335
00:34:01.895 --> 00:34:04.856
Murphy's men. are waiting
to jump on us in Lincoln?

336
00:34:05.065 --> 00:34:07.818
Billy. what you're talking about?
McCloskey's with us. he's a Regulator!

337
00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:10.654
Yeah. but he used to ride with Murphy.
That's what I'm talkin' about!

338
00:34:10.904 --> 00:34:13.405
- That was a long time ago!
- He's a spy!

339
00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:14.990
He's been with us. we made a pact!

340
00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.576
- Right. McCloskey?
- Right.

341
00:34:17.868 --> 00:34:19.078
Jesus. Billy!

342
00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:21.038
Come on...

343
00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:25.251
Come on.

344
00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:41.808
- Shit. I'm sorry McCloskey.
- Hey. it's alright.

345
00:34:42.016 --> 00:34:43.226
We're all upset about John.

346
00:34:43.434 --> 00:34:45.979
Sorry I didn't sniff you up
sooner. goddam traitor!

347
00:34:46.187 --> 00:34:46.980
Billy!

348
00:34:50.066 --> 00:34:52.901
- Billy!
- Billy. what the hell!

349
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.319
Jesus!

350
00:35:02.452 --> 00:35:03.287
No!

351
00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:07.166
Hold you fire!

352
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.668
- Hold!
- Shit!

353
00:35:11.086 --> 00:35:11.920
No!

354
00:35:15.923 --> 00:35:19.510
- Hold you goddam fire!
- Get that son of a bitch!

355
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.473
Oh God!

356
00:35:30.271 --> 00:35:32.565
- Court adjourned.
- Moron!

357
00:35:33.023 --> 00:35:34.733
You're a lawman.
you son of a bitch!

358
00:35:35.108 --> 00:35:38.445
Richard. he was right.
McCloskey was acting strange.

359
00:35:38.653 --> 00:35:41.323
With that rubbish we've just
killed three more Murphy's men. right?

360
00:35:41.698 --> 00:35:42.699
Right.

361
00:35:42.908 --> 00:35:45.243
Oh. Christ Jesus! Brady's
gonna hang us for sure now!

362
00:35:45.452 --> 00:35:47.078
- What we're doing now. Dick?
- Quiet!

363
00:35:47.287 --> 00:35:50.707
Wanna close those fucking lips
for a goddam second and let me think!

364
00:35:52.292 --> 00:35:53.959
We better skim out of here.

365
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.757
Okay. everybody.
Skim up the river! Now!

366
00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:05.054
You! You better
stop believing newspapers!

367
00:36:05.679 --> 00:36:08.808
You ain't no Captain you
and sure as hell ain't no Robin Hood.

368
00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:12.019
Fairly said. Dick.

369
00:36:13.686 --> 00:36:15.647
Put that idiot on a horse.

370
00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:53.433
"Advices from Lincoln say the young lad

371
00:36:53.517 --> 00:36:56.644
"of lightening rapidity.
iron nerve and marvelous skill

372
00:36:56.853 --> 00:36:58.396
"apparently single-handedly.

373
00:36:58.729 --> 00:37:01.399
"took down Morton and Baker
of the Murphy-Dolan faction

374
00:37:01.482 --> 00:37:04.610
"including a miraculous
shot of fifty yards."

375
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:08.489
There's a picture here. It says
'Billy the Kid' but it ain't Billy.

376
00:37:11.075 --> 00:37:12.243
Let me see that.

377
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.580
Well. that's me.

378
00:37:18.582 --> 00:37:21.918
That's bullshit. The papers
don't get anything right!

379
00:37:25.005 --> 00:37:28.341
"Advices from sources say
that 'the Kid'. a left-hander.

380
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.844
"is tall. handsome
and unequalled in the elements

381
00:37:31.052 --> 00:37:33.180
"that appeal to the holier emotions."

382
00:37:33.388 --> 00:37:35.347
Jesus Christ!
This country needs a hero!

383
00:37:35.764 --> 00:37:40.186
"However. Murphy of Lincoln has hired
none other than John Kinney

384
00:37:40.352 --> 00:37:43.606
"and his Dona Ana Bunch
to help hunt down Billy the Kid

385
00:37:43.814 --> 00:37:44.982
"and the gang."

386
00:37:45.191 --> 00:37:48.402
- Great! John Kinney!
- Well. who's Kinney?

387
00:37:48.944 --> 00:37:51.447
It says here he's an ex-soldier
who suffered an injury

388
00:37:51.655 --> 00:37:54.991
- and is now a bounty hunter.
- But what's that mean?

389
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.118
It means he can whip some ass.

390
00:38:14.177 --> 00:38:17.262
- Hey Doc? Come here for a minute?
- Yeah.

391
00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:27.898
What's up?

392
00:38:28.649 --> 00:38:31.109
Well. we can't go North
because Murphy's got men

393
00:38:31.318 --> 00:38:32.528
coming out of Fort Sumner.

394
00:38:33.529 --> 00:38:35.655
We can't go South because
he's got Brady coming in..

395
00:38:35.863 --> 00:38:37.114
Yeah.

396
00:38:37.323 --> 00:38:40.618
East is no good cause we have
John Kinney coming up now.

397
00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.665
We can go west
through the Valley of Fires

398
00:38:45.873 --> 00:38:48.543
but there's the
Mescalero Reservation.

399
00:38:48.751 --> 00:38:51.671
And they're having a good year
with scalps. no thanks Richard.

400
00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:55.006
I don't know what the hell to do.

401
00:38:56.216 --> 00:38:58.218
What the hell is he doing?

402
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.186
We've come to a place
where we are lost. no?

403
00:39:08.854 --> 00:39:11.481
When an Indian is lost.
he must reach into the spirit world

404
00:39:11.773 --> 00:39:15.068
to find the way. On the
Spirit Road. he'll be shown a sign.

405
00:39:15.776 --> 00:39:17.862
This is the way to the Spirit Road.

406
00:39:18.571 --> 00:39:22.533
We're lost right now.
But I'll find us the way.

407
00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:26.453
Oh Christ. Chavez! That's all we need
is some more of your red-ass

408
00:39:26.662 --> 00:39:31.083
Navajo mambojahambo.
We're running out of time here. Chavez.

409
00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:38.506
Is that any good?

410
00:39:40.633 --> 00:39:44.721
- Chavez. what is that?
- Peyote.

411
00:40:00.904 --> 00:40:02.238
Dick.

412
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.097
Butterflies.

413
00:40:32.643 --> 00:40:37.230
Yeah. it's just like a butterfly.

414
00:40:38.773 --> 00:40:42.777
A butterfly flies.
to a flower...

415
00:40:43.778 --> 00:40:45.530
stays with it.

416
00:40:48.741 --> 00:40:52.829
Doesn't know why. it just feels in.

417
00:40:54.622 --> 00:40:56.122
Oh yeah!

418
00:40:57.499 --> 00:40:58.458
She's

419
00:41:05.507 --> 00:41:07.384
She's my flower.

420
00:41:08.885 --> 00:41:10.595
and I'm her...

421
00:41:14.724 --> 00:41:19.478
Did you guys see
the size of that... chicken?

422
00:41:19.687 --> 00:41:21.564
I'm her butterfly.

423
00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:51.801
We don't know why.
We just feel in.

424
00:41:54.721 --> 00:41:56.139
Oh God!

425
00:41:57.347 --> 00:42:00.058
You guys! You guys!

426
00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:18.159
This is great!

427
00:42:19.785 --> 00:42:22.330
This is great!

428
00:42:23.956 --> 00:42:26.292
Did you see the size of that

429
00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:30.171
cock-a-doodle goddam doo?!

430
00:42:43.183 --> 00:42:46.561
That's real! That's real...

431
00:42:56.196 --> 00:42:59.365
I'm her butterfly! She's mine!

432
00:43:00.282 --> 00:43:02.409
Regulators! Saddle up!

433
00:43:05.079 --> 00:43:06.997
Godless heathens.

434
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.132
Regulators!

435
00:43:25.765 --> 00:43:30.728
Hey. Doc. did you see
the size of that chicken?

436
00:43:44.616 --> 00:43:45.826
Howdy.

437
00:43:48.203 --> 00:43:49.830
Morning sir.

438
00:43:55.377 --> 00:43:58.754
Hey. Chavez.
how come they ain't killin' us?

439
00:43:58.963 --> 00:44:02.884
Cuz we're in the Spirit world. asshole!
They can't see us!

440
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.732
Hey. did you know
we're in the Spirit world?

441
00:44:40.586 --> 00:44:43.714
Lord. forgive us for our low doings.

442
00:44:44.799 --> 00:44:47.593
for our misguidance
by heathen religions.

443
00:44:49.637 --> 00:44:52.014
Thank you for keeping us alive.

444
00:44:55.017 --> 00:44:58.728
Please Lord. guide us
doing the right thing.

445
00:45:02.857 --> 00:45:07.779
Our Father. who art in heaven.
hallowed be thy name...

446
00:45:08.154 --> 00:45:09.739
Please Dick. it's getting cold!

447
00:45:13.368 --> 00:45:15.203
I could have killed you. Dick.

448
00:45:16.204 --> 00:45:17.622
I could have killed you.

449
00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:22.626
But I don't wanna kill you.
I wanna eat.

450
00:45:22.876 --> 00:45:25.504
When we've finished
this meal. you little rodent.

451
00:45:25.712 --> 00:45:26.964
we're gonna go
out in the yard and see

452
00:45:27.172 --> 00:45:29.258
who has the right to run
this group of Regulators.

453
00:45:29.716 --> 00:45:32.803
Richard. would you be so kind
as to pass the potatoes please?

454
00:45:35.222 --> 00:45:36.974
Far away hill man coming this way.

455
00:45:37.224 --> 00:45:38.475
Just one?

456
00:45:41.352 --> 00:45:46.357
- Oh no! It's Buckshot Roberts.
- We got a warrant for him.

457
00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:48.818
Do you think
he's coming to surrender?

458
00:45:49.318 --> 00:45:50.736
It don't look that way.

459
00:45:50.945 --> 00:45:52.280
He any good?

460
00:45:54.115 --> 00:45:56.742
He's killed more people
than smallpox.

461
00:46:02.873 --> 00:46:05.709
Well? Introduce us.

462
00:46:28.272 --> 00:46:29.899
I got a warrant for you. old man!

463
00:46:30.483 --> 00:46:33.277
I ain't got no business
with that warrant no more.

464
00:46:33.527 --> 00:46:36.947
Dickhead. son of a bitch.
I'm on my own.

465
00:46:37.156 --> 00:46:39.365
I've come here to get that
150 dollars sheriff Brady

466
00:46:39.574 --> 00:46:40.867
is putting down for the Kid.

467
00:46:41.367 --> 00:46:45.246
I bet that little shit
is only worth 110. but I'll take it.

468
00:46:45.455 --> 00:46:47.290
What a sweet disposition.

469
00:46:50.168 --> 00:46:51.252
Let's dance!

470
00:46:59.177 --> 00:47:00.427
Chavez!

471
00:47:07.935 --> 00:47:09.144
Shit!

472
00:47:14.441 --> 00:47:15.943
Chavez!

473
00:47:16.652 --> 00:47:17.903
What?

474
00:47:20.446 --> 00:47:23.366
- Get out. you sons of bitches!
- He's gone into the shitter!

475
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.621
Billy. go in there and cut
the son of a bitch into half.

476
00:47:32.834 --> 00:47:34.627
I'm daring you. Billy.

477
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.265
Screw that!

478
00:48:16.459 --> 00:48:17.501
Cover me.

479
00:48:33.225 --> 00:48:34.185
Dick!

480
00:48:43.943 --> 00:48:46.738
Son of a bitch! Dick.
we're coming to get you!

481
00:48:47.447 --> 00:48:51.701
- He's dead. Charley.
- We gotta go get him!

482
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.661
We gotta go get him!

483
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:55.955
You wanna go close
and find out. shithead skin?

484
00:48:56.164 --> 00:48:59.250
What we're gonna do?
Dick has got his ass blown up!

485
00:48:59.542 --> 00:49:01.668
He's our foreman!

486
00:49:03.587 --> 00:49:05.589
Doc. what are we gonna do?

487
00:49:05.798 --> 00:49:08.926
In a while it's gonna be crowded with
Murphy's men! Get the hell out of here!

488
00:49:09.092 --> 00:49:10.219
Come on Charley! Come on!

489
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.265
Regulators!
Let's rock out! Now!

490
00:50:25.415 --> 00:50:29.169
- Where to. Doc?
- Going to Patricio if it looks safe.

491
00:50:29.794 --> 00:50:32.255
I gotta ride to
Dick's mother in Vermont.

492
00:50:32.881 --> 00:50:34.716
and get some clean wraps for this.

493
00:50:34.924 --> 00:50:37.135
Hey. whatever you do.
don't go near Lincoln.

494
00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:38.761
See ya.

495
00:51:02.366 --> 00:51:05.912
- What you doing there. Billy?
- Well sir.

496
00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.290
with the sight filed down

497
00:51:09.624 --> 00:51:13.544
I got an eighth of a second drop
on our good sheriff Brady.

498
00:51:18.216 --> 00:51:22.594
Billy. we can't touch the sheriff.
Dick said so. you know that.

499
00:51:23.136 --> 00:51:25.555
Besides. we can't keep this up.

500
00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:28.767
Yeah. Well. Dick
ain't around anymore. is he. Charley?

501
00:51:29.851 --> 00:51:31.770
And right now sheriff
Brady's in desperate need

502
00:51:31.978 --> 00:51:33.480
of being removed from office.

503
00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:38.443
We're not going after Brady.
nor Murphy men. no more.

504
00:51:39.653 --> 00:51:42.404
I told you I would find the way.
and the way is west.

505
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:43.823
West. huh?

506
00:51:45.366 --> 00:51:47.368
West is that way.

507
00:51:48.285 --> 00:51:51.288
and the bastards we gotta kill
are that way.

508
00:51:51.539 --> 00:51:54.834
The only bastards who are gonna
get killed are us. chivato. Let it go.

509
00:51:55.042 --> 00:51:56.335
Let it go?

510
00:51:56.544 --> 00:51:59.380
Murphy's taking inventory
in Tunstall's store right now

511
00:51:59.505 --> 00:52:01.757
and you're saying
that means nothing to you?

512
00:52:06.761 --> 00:52:08.972
It means nothing to me?

513
00:52:11.766 --> 00:52:14.894
Murphy and his politicians
have taken more blood from me

514
00:52:15.103 --> 00:52:17.897
- than they ever will from you.
- Oh yeah?

515
00:52:18.106 --> 00:52:22.026
- How do you figure?
- The Red Sands Creek Reservation.

516
00:52:23.652 --> 00:52:26.029
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

517
00:52:26.238 --> 00:52:30.075
207 people butchered in the snow
with their stomachs empty.

518
00:52:31.368 --> 00:52:33.370
My mother's people.

519
00:52:35.122 --> 00:52:37.583
You see. Murphy and company
was under government contract

520
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:40.627
to supply us with beef
and two winters ago

521
00:52:40.836 --> 00:52:44.213
he sent only rotten meat.
No corn. no flour.

522
00:52:44.422 --> 00:52:46.757
only rancid beef
crawling with worms.

523
00:52:46.966 --> 00:52:48.009
So I went out
with a band in the night

524
00:52:48.217 --> 00:52:50.094
to the traders' camp
to try and get food.

525
00:52:50.303 --> 00:52:52.638
Oh yeah. they welcomed us in.

526
00:52:53.139 --> 00:52:56.809
and then they opened fire on us.
I got away. only me.

527
00:52:58.019 --> 00:53:02.356
But when I got back to the Red Sands.
I found out that the army

528
00:53:02.565 --> 00:53:06.234
had already heard about
our big Indian uprising

529
00:53:06.443 --> 00:53:07.903
and they paid us back.

530
00:53:08.153 --> 00:53:12.157
My mother was cut by a saber
from her privates to her neck.

531
00:53:12.365 --> 00:53:14.284
My sisters were just babies

532
00:53:14.367 --> 00:53:16.912
and they had their heads
bashed in with boot heels

533
00:53:17.078 --> 00:53:19.581
so the army could save bullets.

534
00:53:19.998 --> 00:53:25.085
Everybody at my reservation
was butchered and it means nothing to me?

535
00:53:27.171 --> 00:53:28.589
Oh yeah.

536
00:53:28.798 --> 00:53:31.884
Yeah. I went to Lincoln
to take Murphy's head.

537
00:53:32.802 --> 00:53:35.679
And that's when
John Tunstall found me

538
00:53:36.639 --> 00:53:40.684
and he took me in.
and he taught me

539
00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.520
a better way to bury Murphy.

540
00:53:42.728 --> 00:53:45.855
Murphy buried him
the old Irish way. Chavez.

541
00:53:46.064 --> 00:53:47.857
That's right. Steve.

542
00:53:49.317 --> 00:53:51.736
And he starved out
your family. Chavez.

543
00:53:51.945 --> 00:53:54.948
And now he's doing it to every
small farmer in the territory.

544
00:53:56.574 --> 00:54:00.578
But if you wanna run go ahead.
Just go run on ahead.

545
00:54:01.079 --> 00:54:04.164
Bye.
You got no loyalty. Navajo.

546
00:54:04.373 --> 00:54:05.874
Navajo.

547
00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:09.795
Ain't nothing more than
a piece of chicken shit in the rain.

548
00:54:10.087 --> 00:54:11.630
No.

549
00:54:12.172 --> 00:54:15.551
We had our ceremony back
there on the ridge. chivato.

550
00:54:16.218 --> 00:54:19.179
Now. I don't know
what your vision told you.

551
00:54:19.263 --> 00:54:22.141
But my vision told me
we're headed for blood.

552
00:54:22.224 --> 00:54:23.517
Blood like a river.

553
00:54:23.724 --> 00:54:28.146
I'm the last of my clan.
the last of my people.

554
00:54:28.604 --> 00:54:31.858
If I die. and I am not
afraid of dying. chivato.

555
00:54:32.066 --> 00:54:34.485
the sacred hoop is broken.

556
00:54:35.987 --> 00:54:39.699
No. I have to go west
and make my people live again.

557
00:54:52.461 --> 00:54:56.047
Charley. you'll come with me?

558
00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:08.184
- You ain't gonna say much. dirty Steve?
- Cause he ain't got much to say. Charley.

559
00:55:09.018 --> 00:55:12.855
Or Steve understands the meaning
of the word "pals". don't you Steve?

560
00:55:13.522 --> 00:55:18.319
Cause if you got three or four good pals
well then you got yourself a tribe.

561
00:55:18.611 --> 00:55:21.113
There ain't nothing
stronger than that.

562
00:55:21.447 --> 00:55:23.657
We're your family now. Chavez.

563
00:55:24.657 --> 00:55:27.911
You walk away from us.
you break our sacred hoop.

564
00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:34.501
We gotta stick together. fellas.
It's the only way I see it.

565
00:56:32.264 --> 00:56:33.515
It's me. Doc.

566
00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:39.146
And that's our bet!

567
00:56:40.647 --> 00:56:41.731
I'll miss it!

568
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:43.984
I know what you desire.

569
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:47.279
You've come to lay with me
and cut me into tiny pieces with a knife.

570
00:56:47.362 --> 00:56:50.031
You're a bandit who eats
children and old people.

571
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:53.660
I eat meat and potatoes.
Who told you that?

572
00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:55.579
My benefactor.

573
00:56:56.329 --> 00:57:00.000
Your benefactor?
That's the man that eats people

574
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.507
Yen. if you want to stay here.
tell me now and I'll go.

575
00:57:09.884 --> 00:57:11.802
Do you wanna stay here?

576
00:57:14.847 --> 00:57:17.391
In China. girls are not necessary.

577
00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:20.811
When we have floods. fathers
let the girl babies wash by.

578
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.648
- My benefactor has made me necessary.
- He's not made you necessary.

579
00:57:24.857 --> 00:57:27.025
he's made you a slave.

580
00:57:27.692 --> 00:57:29.569
I'm sorry.

581
00:57:31.279 --> 00:57:35.825
Necessary
is something you can't do without.

582
00:57:36.701 --> 00:57:39.204
I can't do without you.

583
00:57:42.332 --> 00:57:45.043
I keep the flowers
that you offered me

584
00:57:45.709 --> 00:57:51.340
in a little room... inside my head.
Inside my heart.

585
00:57:51.715 --> 00:57:54.426
Often. you come in
and you ask me to dance.

586
00:57:55.427 --> 00:57:57.137
I often say yes.

587
00:57:58.555 --> 00:58:01.183
I want to ask
something else of you now.

588
00:58:02.518 --> 00:58:04.812
I want you to go with me
to Roswell.

589
00:58:05.562 --> 00:58:07.438
There's a railroad
going to New York City.

590
00:58:08.022 --> 00:58:10.358
Two days we can be
on the train. We can be

591
00:58:10.566 --> 00:58:13.194
in another country.
In a city together.

592
00:58:16.531 --> 00:58:21.035
"The Bird".
by Josiah G. Scurlock. That's Doc.

593
00:58:21.661 --> 00:58:24.205
Once upon a midnight dreary

594
00:58:24.622 --> 00:58:28.041
as I pondered weak and weary.
they came knocking at my

595
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.753
back porch.

596
00:58:33.505 --> 00:58:35.715
He ain't very original. is he?

597
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:41.304
He been gone off a long time.

598
00:58:42.597 --> 00:58:45.767
I've been feeling he's gonna be
making a run for it.

599
00:58:47.935 --> 00:58:49.562
Who. Doc?

600
00:58:49.895 --> 00:58:53.023
Nah. Doc likes me.

601
00:58:53.232 --> 00:58:54.900
I can't stand him.

602
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:58.112
He gets an idea in his head.
you can't get rid of it.

603
00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:00.406
If I stay with him much longer.
I'll be a stiff in a photograph.

604
00:59:00.614 --> 00:59:03.242
The only chance I have is
to get hell-bent for leather now!

605
00:59:03.451 --> 00:59:06.453
- They would chase us.
- I'm used to that.

606
00:59:08.747 --> 00:59:09.998
No.

607
00:59:10.874 --> 00:59:14.461
I'm unclean.
That is not for a young man.

608
00:59:14.669 --> 00:59:19.299
Yen. I used to ride with the dirty underwear
gang out of Liberty. Missouri.

609
00:59:19.591 --> 00:59:24.095
Then John Tunstall taught me that the past
is like an old yellow-back novel.

610
00:59:24.304 --> 00:59:28.307
When you're finished with it
you toss it out. you start a new one.

611
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.561
Okay?

612
00:59:39.485 --> 00:59:41.612
You're necessary.

613
00:59:43.697 --> 00:59:44.740
No.

614
00:59:45.032 --> 00:59:46.699
- Go with me.
- No.

615
00:59:46.908 --> 00:59:49.327
- Come with me. Yen.
- Yen Sun?

616
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:54.248
Yen Sun?

617
01:00:18.897 --> 01:00:20.148
Hey. Steve!

618
01:00:20.357 --> 01:00:22.484
- What?
- Doc's back!

619
01:00:22.692 --> 01:00:24.569
I told you he'd come back!

620
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:27.488
Regulators!

621
01:00:27.863 --> 01:00:29.824
Let's saddle up!

622
01:00:30.908 --> 01:00:33.035
Sheriff Brady.

623
01:00:33.828 --> 01:00:36.038
we're gonna have
a lot of fun now.

624
01:00:45.172 --> 01:00:46.715
What the hell is he doing?

625
01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:52.220
He ain't all there. is he?

626
01:00:53.972 --> 01:00:55.473
Is he?

627
01:01:03.731 --> 01:01:05.859
Top of the morning to you. girls!

628
01:01:40.057 --> 01:01:42.852
Reap the whirlwind. sheriff Brady.

629
01:01:44.771 --> 01:01:46.272
Reap it.

630
01:01:49.858 --> 01:01:52.819
- It's for you. Alex.
- You weren't supposed to touch Brady!

631
01:01:53.028 --> 01:01:55.447
Sheriff Brady sent
the men who killed John.

632
01:01:55.655 --> 01:01:56.990
It was a good move for us. Alex.

633
01:01:57.074 --> 01:01:58.658
- Was it Billy?
- Yes it was!

634
01:01:58.867 --> 01:02:00.368
Have you seen 'The Independent'?

635
01:02:00.577 --> 01:02:02.829
The Governor's revoked
your deputation powers.

636
01:02:03.038 --> 01:02:04.790
You're now wanted
by the legitimate law

637
01:02:04.998 --> 01:02:06.750
as well as those outside the law.

638
01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:09.251
You're not only being hunted
by John Kinney and Murphy's men.

639
01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.920
You're being hunted by troops!

640
01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.089
Fort Stanton. Billy.
The U.S. Army!

641
01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.050
The government's put
a 200 dollar bounty on your head.

642
01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:21.388
You were supposed to serve
eleven warrants and expose the Ring.

643
01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:24.558
Instead you went out and you
went on the warpath... on a rampage!

644
01:02:24.642 --> 01:02:27.770
Now Richard's dead! And
we're living up here like fugitives!

645
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.230
What the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

646
01:02:30.438 --> 01:02:31.981
I don't know.

647
01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.443
Maybe I'm trying to get some attention.

648
01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:38.363
Maybe I'm trying to get
President Hayes to look this way.

649
01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:40.198
They'll let Murphy and his bankers

650
01:02:40.407 --> 01:02:43.159
get away with anything
and I can't allow that!

651
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.538
The more bastards I dust.
the more news stories they write.

652
01:02:46.788 --> 01:02:48.622
The more troops
they send out after us.

653
01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.916
the more President Hayes
is gonna have to raise an eyebrow.

654
01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:53.544
Come down and see for himself
what's going on here.

655
01:02:55.129 --> 01:02:58.006
Then he'll find out who's
really doing the killing.

656
01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:07.724
Alex? What are you gonna do?

657
01:03:09.642 --> 01:03:12.979
I'm gonna try to reach
the President myself... legally.

658
01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:17.191
It won't be easy to get past
the Governor. he's got so many.

659
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.776
Yeah. I got plans for the Governor.

660
01:03:18.985 --> 01:03:21.779
Alex. what if you can't
get in touch with Hayes?

661
01:03:24.198 --> 01:03:26.993
I go back to Lincoln
and re-open John's store.

662
01:03:27.201 --> 01:03:29.703
Try to deal with that.
That's what John would want.

663
01:03:29.953 --> 01:03:31.621
We'll escort you.

664
01:03:32.414 --> 01:03:34.332
You'd be a death sentence
to anybody right now. Billy.

665
01:03:34.541 --> 01:03:36.084
I don't want your help.

666
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.298
Alex. you didn't see
what they did to John.

667
01:03:42.758 --> 01:03:44.426
We did!

668
01:03:53.726 --> 01:03:55.269
Christ. Billy.

669
01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:01.358
Thank you. Billy.

670
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:05.071
Billy. please
go to old Mexico. Please.

671
01:04:20.627 --> 01:04:22.712
Gentlemen. let's ride.

672
01:04:43.399 --> 01:04:46.318
- Alex...
- What the hell happened. Doc?

673
01:04:48.987 --> 01:04:50.822
There's a whirlwind out there.

674
01:04:53.366 --> 01:04:56.160
When you're in it. you can't get out.

675
01:04:56.285 --> 01:04:57.829
I'm sorry.

676
01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:03.709
I was wondering if you
remember that China doll?

677
01:05:04.127 --> 01:05:07.213
You know at the dance. fandango?

678
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:11.592
I was sort of thinking that.
cause you're lawyer and all...

679
01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:13.803
maybe that there was
a legal way to...

680
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:17.181
I don't even have enough ground
to stand on anymore. Doc. I mean it.

681
01:05:20.393 --> 01:05:22.478
Okay. yeah.

682
01:05:23.104 --> 01:05:26.190
Okay.
Thanks.

683
01:05:29.152 --> 01:05:32.362
Take care of yourself. Alex. okay?

684
01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.331
But what the hell's
the matter with him?

685
01:05:43.582 --> 01:05:46.835
I don't know. he's just belly-achin'

686
01:05:47.085 --> 01:05:50.504
about something or another
that he read in the newspaper.

687
01:05:51.297 --> 01:05:53.299
He got mighty spooked.

688
01:05:57.636 --> 01:05:59.680
Dirty Steve told me. Billy...

689
01:06:00.431 --> 01:06:02.391
told me what
they're writing in the papers.

690
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.062
Steven told him about the party
sheriff Peppin's planning for us.

691
01:06:06.812 --> 01:06:10.940
- Party? Oh. you mean the hanging.
- Callate. chivato.

692
01:06:11.149 --> 01:06:13.234
Goddamn it. Billy?

693
01:06:14.527 --> 01:06:16.780
You've ever see a man hanged?

694
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:20.408
His face turns flat purple...
and his eyes come up on him.

695
01:06:20.658 --> 01:06:24.412
Yeah. I seen Red Smitty hang.
Seen his head come clean off!

696
01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.290
It was a hell of a sight!

697
01:06:27.624 --> 01:06:29.834
I don't think Charley
wants to hear about Red Smitty.

698
01:06:30.043 --> 01:06:33.045
I think that what he'd like
to hear is that we're not going to hang.

699
01:06:34.588 --> 01:06:37.132
You mess your trousers they say.

700
01:06:37.674 --> 01:06:40.052
Gals watching and everything.

701
01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:44.765
If we get caught.
Charley. we're gonna hang.

702
01:06:47.601 --> 01:06:50.978
But there's many a slip
twixt the cup and the lip.

703
01:06:53.689 --> 01:06:56.526
We gotta do something
before they catch us.

704
01:06:58.653 --> 01:07:00.947
You all gotta let me do something.

705
01:07:02.615 --> 01:07:03.866
Okay. Charley.

706
01:07:33.978 --> 01:07:35.896
Damn Charley.
this is your last wish?

707
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.607
Did your little carrot wet?
You could've done that back in Juarez!

708
01:07:38.816 --> 01:07:42.945
Some kind of a special woman.
Dirt Face. You'll understand that one day.

709
01:07:49.201 --> 01:07:53.455
Alright gentlemen. square up
and shell out for Bowdre.

710
01:07:56.082 --> 01:08:00.044
We'll be in the den.
Just yell if you need any help.

711
01:08:00.253 --> 01:08:02.297
You know
what to do. don't ya?

712
01:08:23.025 --> 01:08:26.612
- What's your name?
- Charley.

713
01:08:28.447 --> 01:08:30.240
Well. Charley.

714
01:08:31.283 --> 01:08:34.077
I don't remember you
but I guess you remember me.

715
01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:36.704
I meet so many young men
after the first.

716
01:08:36.871 --> 01:08:38.498
You know how it is.

717
01:08:40.208 --> 01:08:42.585
Why don't you
come over here. Charley?

718
01:08:46.547 --> 01:08:48.341
Hm. ma'am...

719
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.386
I just wanna hold you.

720
01:08:54.638 --> 01:08:56.807
Whatever your pleasure. Charley.

721
01:08:57.557 --> 01:08:59.851
But it all cost the same.

722
01:09:25.918 --> 01:09:28.838
Darling when a man rides
200 miles to do a job

723
01:09:29.088 --> 01:09:32.632
you just bet your Spanish land grant
he's gonna get that job done.

724
01:09:34.384 --> 01:09:37.095
Now if this Billy the Kid's
around town like people say.

725
01:09:37.387 --> 01:09:40.473
he is 200 dollars
flat dead on this bar.

726
01:09:41.391 --> 01:09:44.102
You can't kill
what you can't catch.

727
01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:49.649
You know. these "mestizos"
they say that Billy's half horse

728
01:09:49.858 --> 01:09:51.401
half devil.

729
01:09:52.901 --> 01:09:58.741
But who knows. Maybe a strong
big Texas man like you could do it.

730
01:09:58.949 --> 01:10:00.492
Are you really
gonna kill Billy the Kid?

731
01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:03.620
As a horse piss
whereas he pleases.

732
01:10:04.163 --> 01:10:06.915
Yet his men are not
to come around here.

733
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.376
Is that the gun you're
gonna shoot him down with?

734
01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:13.046
Can I touch it? Please.

735
01:10:15.548 --> 01:10:19.719
You know. Sir. I do admire you.
and I sure would like to touch the gun

736
01:10:19.927 --> 01:10:21.846
that's gonna kill Billy the Kid.

737
01:10:22.972 --> 01:10:25.933
- You know arms boy?
- Yessir.

738
01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:32.190
Go ahead then. Have a look.

739
01:10:34.399 --> 01:10:36.276
Pass it back.

740
01:10:36.485 --> 01:10:39.529
- That's the gun that killed Ed Rollins.
- Is that right?

741
01:10:40.697 --> 01:10:43.492
Hey Mark. let's have
a little round of

742
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.328
"Stone Fence" prep
for the little lady in the house.

743
01:10:46.536 --> 01:10:49.498
Okay. pass it back son.
You stroke a gun like that.

744
01:10:49.706 --> 01:10:51.833
you might as well
be stroking a man's woman.

745
01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:53.584
Pass it up.

746
01:10:59.757 --> 01:11:00.966
Alright.

747
01:11:01.175 --> 01:11:03.844
Now you're best behind
your way before you get hurt.

748
01:11:04.387 --> 01:11:07.306
I'm leaving right now and
wanna know what he looks

749
01:11:07.515 --> 01:11:09.183
for in case I run to him
I'll come back and tell you.

750
01:11:09.392 --> 01:11:11.977
He's a good looking kid.
a way with women.

751
01:11:12.186 --> 01:11:14.562
he dresses like a dandy
and he's a left-hander.

752
01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:18.358
And people say he's fond
of whistling sad ballads.

753
01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:22.237
Now you get out there in the street.

754
01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.155
If you see somebody
that fits that Bill

755
01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:28.159
- you just come whispering to me.
- Okay.

756
01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:30.412
Bye bye.

757
01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:38.836
Hey! I see him!

758
01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:42.131
Right there. right there!
Don't you see him?

759
01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:45.926
That's all now.

760
01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:51.098
You know boy. I'm getting
a little tired of your wise lip.

761
01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:55.893
Now you. you get yourself
some place else before I

762
01:11:56.102 --> 01:11:58.855
have to drop your britches
in front of all these fine ladies

763
01:11:59.063 --> 01:12:01.524
and spank you little bottom blue.

764
01:12:11.659 --> 01:12:15.162
Yeah. sure you are a
chesty little cuss.

765
01:12:39.268 --> 01:12:42.646
Hey Doc! How many
does that make. 25?

766
01:12:42.938 --> 01:12:44.231
Five.

767
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.862
We'll call it ten.
Ten even. how'll that be?

768
01:12:50.112 --> 01:12:51.739
Whatever you say.

769
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.950
It's John Kinney!

770
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:34.446
Come on!

771
01:14:09.731 --> 01:14:12.442
"His hat was covered with
gold and jewels.

772
01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:15.318
"It sparkled and shone
in a dazzling and blinding manner

773
01:14:15.527 --> 01:14:17.112
"when one looked upon it."

774
01:14:17.571 --> 01:14:20.574
I know. I know!
It breaks my heart too.

775
01:14:22.868 --> 01:14:26.413
"The shoes worn by this young
left-handed prince of the planes

776
01:14:26.538 --> 01:14:29.958
"were low-corded. with patterned
silver spurs on the heels."

777
01:14:31.168 --> 01:14:32.878
l ain't left-handed.

778
01:14:34.296 --> 01:14:38.049
Billy. I was thinking about our course.

779
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:41.552
and it looks like we've
just done a vague circle twice.

780
01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:42.970
And?

781
01:14:43.888 --> 01:14:46.057
It also looks like we're going
back into Lincoln. and I know

782
01:14:46.265 --> 01:14:48.642
- we can't be going back into Lincoln so...
- We are.

783
01:14:51.979 --> 01:14:54.398
Ain't a good idea. Billy.

784
01:14:54.732 --> 01:14:56.483
What's in your head. Billy?
What are you thinking?

785
01:14:56.691 --> 01:15:00.570
Billy. we're lucky to be alive!
I mean. going back to Lincoln! That's crazy!

786
01:15:00.779 --> 01:15:02.822
Lincoln's where we'll find
the rest of the men who killed John.

787
01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.824
It's a hundred against five!

788
01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:08.995
It's a hundred against five!
We take Murphy and the Ring falls.

789
01:15:09.412 --> 01:15:12.374
We take him. we win this war.

790
01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:16.085
- Then it'll be over.
- You can't even get to him. Billy.

791
01:15:16.251 --> 01:15:20.214
It's not just a hundred man. there's
the bounty hunters too everywhere we go.

792
01:15:20.422 --> 01:15:23.092
- But not west.
- Oh Christ! Here we go again...

793
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.888
No. I followed you. I chose your way
chivato. but I don't trust it anymore.

794
01:15:28.514 --> 01:15:30.724
California's where we have to go.

795
01:15:31.225 --> 01:15:34.603
Damn with the money. I believe
in that spirit worlds as Chavez. Let's go.

796
01:15:34.812 --> 01:15:37.480
Yeah California
sounds about right to me.

797
01:15:39.732 --> 01:15:41.192
You're all scared.

798
01:15:47.657 --> 01:15:50.535
- And you gonna fail the test.
- What test?

799
01:15:50.743 --> 01:15:52.995
You have to test yourself
every day. gentlemen.

800
01:15:53.204 --> 01:15:56.748
Once you stop testing
yourself. you get slow.

801
01:15:56.915 --> 01:15:59.042
And when that happens they kill ya.

802
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:04.548
You fellas don't feel that?

803
01:16:05.841 --> 01:16:08.927
Up on John Kinney's riding up
on your ass and the balls are flying

804
01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:11.096
and the blood goes
right to your head?

805
01:16:14.141 --> 01:16:16.934
- It's quite a sensation.
- Yeah. I bet it is.

806
01:16:17.601 --> 01:16:19.603
And I'm sure in your mind
you hear trumpets sound

807
01:16:19.812 --> 01:16:24.191
and angels sing a fargin'.
and I shit my goddam breeches! Okay?

808
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.569
We've taken enough
goddam Murphy's scalps!

809
01:16:26.736 --> 01:16:29.905
We cannot win this war.
not the five of us!

810
01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.992
Do you understand?

811
01:16:33.492 --> 01:16:35.327
Now... Billy.

812
01:16:35.536 --> 01:16:38.496
you want to get
the President's attention? Go ahead.

813
01:16:40.582 --> 01:16:43.126
You wanna keep on
testing yourself? Alright.

814
01:16:43.293 --> 01:16:44.377
Let me tell you something.

815
01:16:44.586 --> 01:16:46.713
Tonight I'm riding at the border.
I'm gonna get myself a hot meal

816
01:16:46.921 --> 01:16:50.091
and a good night of sleep.
Come morning I'm a Mexican.

817
01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:54.012
Yeah. Billy.
yeah. me too.

818
01:16:56.097 --> 01:16:59.141
- Mexico. huh?
- Yeah.

819
01:16:59.391 --> 01:17:01.810
- Yeah.
- I see.

820
01:17:02.019 --> 01:17:04.688
You're all testing yourselves
and you don't even know it.

821
01:17:04.938 --> 01:17:06.899
Trying to make it all
to Mexico. that's a hoot!

822
01:17:07.232 --> 01:17:08.525
What d'ya mean?

823
01:17:08.734 --> 01:17:12.654
They'll be covering every possible
which way in from Texas to Arizona.

824
01:17:12.863 --> 01:17:15.324
John Kinney knows everyone
down along the border.

825
01:17:15.532 --> 01:17:18.117
There's a full day's ride through
them thorns we all love so much

826
01:17:18.326 --> 01:17:21.579
which also make a good hiding place
for scalp hunters and renegade Indians.

827
01:17:21.788 --> 01:17:24.082
The chances to make it all to Mexico?

828
01:17:25.166 --> 01:17:26.376
Well.

829
01:17:27.168 --> 01:17:29.796
that's the test of all tests.
if you ask me.

830
01:17:30.838 --> 01:17:32.423
I'm in.

831
01:17:37.511 --> 01:17:39.763
I'm really not liking him.

832
01:18:04.286 --> 01:18:06.247
Dear Governor Axtell...

833
01:18:06.455 --> 01:18:08.290
- Axtel.
- Right.

834
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:11.752
I've heard that you will give...

835
01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:13.546
- What is it?
- 200.

836
01:18:13.754 --> 01:18:16.716
...200 dollars for my head.

837
01:18:17.298 --> 01:18:19.968
Perhaps we should meet and talk.

838
01:18:20.635 --> 01:18:23.555
I am at the Juarez
village at the border.

839
01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:26.182
Send 3 men.

840
01:18:26.725 --> 01:18:29.185
and instruct them not to shoot.

841
01:18:29.728 --> 01:18:31.688
as I am unarmed.

842
01:18:35.817 --> 01:18:37.609
In short. Sir:

843
01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:40.612
I surrender.

844
01:18:42.698 --> 01:18:44.700
Your obedient servant.

845
01:18:46.035 --> 01:18:47.953
William H. Bonney.

846
01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:03.676
Damn good riding with you. Chavez.

847
01:19:07.055 --> 01:19:09.015
Many nights. my friend...

848
01:19:10.725 --> 01:19:14.812
Many nights I've put a blade
to your throat while you were sleeping.

849
01:19:16.939 --> 01:19:19.608
Glad I never killed you. Steve.

850
01:19:19.941 --> 01:19:21.985
You're all right.

851
01:19:50.346 --> 01:19:51.889
P.S.:

852
01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:56.519
I changed my mind.
Kiss my ass.

853
01:19:59.437 --> 01:20:01.147
Charley's getting married!

854
01:20:39.851 --> 01:20:42.353
If anybody asks you
where you got that hat

855
01:20:42.729 --> 01:20:44.981
tell them Billy the Kid
gave it to you.

856
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.233
Come on. get out of here.

857
01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:52.405
Pat Garrett.

858
01:20:52.613 --> 01:20:55.283
- That's right.
- What are you doing in here?

859
01:20:56.075 --> 01:20:57.785
No one's supposed
to come in here.

860
01:20:57.994 --> 01:21:00.162
Going back to Louisiana
for family business.

861
01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:02.831
Wanted to see the boy
who'd become such a sensation.

862
01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.667
- How'd you find me here?
- I'm a tracker.

863
01:21:06.084 --> 01:21:08.170
Gonna be held as sheriff.
if they elect me.

864
01:21:08.378 --> 01:21:11.548
- What are you saying. Pat?
- The officials have asked me to run.

865
01:21:11.757 --> 01:21:14.134
Well. then I'm asking you to run too.

866
01:21:14.426 --> 01:21:15.969
That way!

867
01:21:16.553 --> 01:21:19.764
Or I'll take your
shittin' scalp like I did Brady's.

868
01:21:19.972 --> 01:21:22.892
Billy... I ain't the law yet.

869
01:21:23.142 --> 01:21:25.644
And I ain't here
to get your ass hairs up.

870
01:21:25.936 --> 01:21:29.065
I've come to tell you some bad news
about a friend we share.

871
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.276
McSween. Tunstall's lawyer.

872
01:21:32.651 --> 01:21:36.572
- What about Alex?
- He's gonna die. Tomorrow.

873
01:21:36.781 --> 01:21:38.699
He and his wife at his house.

874
01:21:39.074 --> 01:21:41.534
Murphy knows he's coming
back to Lincoln tomorrow.

875
01:21:41.743 --> 01:21:43.870
They're gonna wait till he's home
and go pay a visit.

876
01:21:44.079 --> 01:21:46.790
- What time are they expecting him?
- Supper time.

877
01:21:46.998 --> 01:21:49.292
I figure you were the only fellow
with the pluck to get up some

878
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:51.753
McSween partisans and go
give the man and his wife

879
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:54.214
a rightful escort across the border.

880
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:56.883
Ain't been to Louisiana for a spell.

881
01:21:57.926 --> 01:21:59.552
I'll see you. Billy.

882
01:22:00.178 --> 01:22:01.429
Hey. Garrett!

883
01:22:07.185 --> 01:22:08.895
Are you my friend?

884
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:15.610
Yes I am. Bill.

885
01:22:29.206 --> 01:22:31.041
Regulators!

886
01:22:32.084 --> 01:22:33.585
Let's mount up.

887
01:22:57.775 --> 01:22:59.110
Hey. Charley.

888
01:23:00.527 --> 01:23:02.070
Maybe you should stay.

889
01:23:02.738 --> 01:23:04.990
You can't shoot
worth a piss anyhow!

890
01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:09.161
Besides. your girl's crying.
She's really giving me a headache.

891
01:23:09.327 --> 01:23:11.163
Charley. you got a wife now.

892
01:23:11.496 --> 01:23:13.165
You should stay.

893
01:23:30.598 --> 01:23:32.391
Ain't easy having pals.

894
01:23:55.372 --> 01:23:57.123
- Alex!
- Alex!

895
01:23:58.208 --> 01:23:59.542
What in the name of...

896
01:24:01.293 --> 01:24:03.754
Alex. let's go. The word's out.

897
01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:06.507
- They're gonna come kill you.
- Damn it. Billy.

898
01:24:06.715 --> 01:24:08.342
I told you not to come here.

899
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:10.052
I'm not leaving my house.

900
01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.845
Alex. if you stay
they're gonna kill you.

901
01:24:12.054 --> 01:24:13.263
And then I'm gonna
have to go around

902
01:24:13.472 --> 01:24:15.182
and kill all the guys
that killed you.

903
01:24:15.391 --> 01:24:17.434
- Now. that's lot of killing.
- You heard me. Billy.

904
01:24:17.643 --> 01:24:19.978
- Alex. maybe...
- You heard me!

905
01:24:20.603 --> 01:24:21.854
We can't just stay here and hope

906
01:24:22.063 --> 01:24:23.815
that the good Lord
saves us from an all out...

907
01:24:24.899 --> 01:24:26.442
I'm sick.

908
01:24:26.693 --> 01:24:29.112
- I can't go to old Mexico.
- Come on!

909
01:24:30.321 --> 01:24:33.533
Put it at the middle
of the street! Come on!

910
01:24:34.867 --> 01:24:37.912
Don't fret. Alex.
The trip's postponed.

911
01:24:38.121 --> 01:24:40.623
- They're coming around the front.
- Shit!

912
01:24:40.747 --> 01:24:44.251
Bring those caravan chariots. quickly!
Get the house covered!

913
01:24:45.293 --> 01:24:46.753
It's Peppin.

914
01:24:54.636 --> 01:24:55.971
Hey Chavez?

915
01:24:56.179 --> 01:24:59.808
- How is it from the East side?
- Murphy men.

916
01:25:03.602 --> 01:25:07.398
Charley. how is it all about you?
Can we break?

917
01:25:19.493 --> 01:25:22.120
Hey Charley!
How is it?

918
01:25:22.954 --> 01:25:25.623
He... he is John Kinney!

919
01:25:26.124 --> 01:25:30.587
I think the word you got was just a trap
to get us all together in the same place.

920
01:25:31.713 --> 01:25:34.007
My God! Look at them all!

921
01:25:34.215 --> 01:25:36.092
It's gonna be a massacre.

922
01:25:42.097 --> 01:25:44.641
- He's John Kinney!
- Well. maybe they just want us.

923
01:25:45.851 --> 01:25:46.894
No.

924
01:25:47.978 --> 01:25:50.189
They think that they can end the war

925
01:25:50.439 --> 01:25:52.316
right here at one fell swoop.

926
01:25:52.733 --> 01:25:54.443
And that's what
they're just about to do.

927
01:25:54.777 --> 01:25:58.697
- He's John Kinney.
- Thank you very much. Charley!

928
01:25:59.365 --> 01:26:00.449
Jesus!

929
01:26:04.327 --> 01:26:05.912
- Come on. move it!
- Right!

930
01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:12.168
Charley...

931
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:18.257
Oh God!

932
01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:21.177
Hanging for sure now!

933
01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:33.855
Alright!

934
01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:35.273
Bonney!

935
01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:37.818
We got you Billy the Kid!

936
01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.153
Take a look at the
fire power down here!

937
01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:43.781
You all come on out!
Real slow!

938
01:26:46.575 --> 01:26:48.494
You up there. Bonney?

939
01:26:52.623 --> 01:26:54.500
Let's have some fun. Doc.

940
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.419
Yeah I'm here. you bastard!!

941
01:27:51.012 --> 01:27:53.056
Billy. what the hell
are we gonna do now?

942
01:27:53.264 --> 01:27:55.725
We're gonna show these guys
they've finally met their match.

943
01:27:55.933 --> 01:27:57.268
What?

944
01:27:58.186 --> 01:28:01.397
- Hey Peppin!
- I'm hearing you Bonney!

945
01:28:01.606 --> 01:28:04.816
I see you got Charley Crawford
down there with you.

946
01:28:05.025 --> 01:28:06.985
Yeah. we got a whole lot...

947
01:28:08.695 --> 01:28:10.906
- Oh my God!
- Damn!

948
01:28:12.407 --> 01:28:14.117
Hey. Peppin?

949
01:28:14.368 --> 01:28:16.536
Charley Crawford
ain't with you anymore!

950
01:28:18.038 --> 01:28:20.290
Bastard!
Fire!

951
01:28:39.642 --> 01:28:41.602
- You alright. Doc?
- Yeah.

952
01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:45.313
When are these boys
gonna give up?

953
01:28:47.774 --> 01:28:49.150
You okay ma'am?

954
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:52.779
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

955
01:28:53.196 --> 01:28:55.115
- Charley!
- Yeah?

956
01:28:55.323 --> 01:28:58.243
Take two rifles. go on upstairs!
Doc?

957
01:28:58.702 --> 01:29:00.829
You goin' with him and load heavy!

958
01:29:01.162 --> 01:29:03.998
Steve! Go on up
and cover the north side!

959
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:06.041
Alex.

960
01:29:07.668 --> 01:29:10.379
This may be your last chance
to handle John's case.

961
01:29:12.047 --> 01:29:14.717
Active participation in a gun battle

962
01:29:14.925 --> 01:29:17.261
would negate
my life insurance policy.

963
01:29:17.761 --> 01:29:19.138
I can't do that!

964
01:29:19.346 --> 01:29:20.848
We know you can shoot Bonney.

965
01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:24.350
- but we can too! Give it up!
- Chavez!

966
01:30:59.609 --> 01:31:01.111
Chivato...

967
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:32.098
They're sending the troops.

968
01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:42.066
Billy. we're good.
but this is getting ridiculous.

969
01:31:42.275 --> 01:31:43.651
Dismount!

970
01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:01.460
I like these odds.

971
01:32:06.756 --> 01:32:09.216
Mr. Murphy. judge Bristol.

972
01:32:09.425 --> 01:32:11.635
We got all the rats in one hole.

973
01:32:11.844 --> 01:32:15.431
Why has it been taking so long?
We didn't want the army here.

974
01:32:15.639 --> 01:32:19.977
- We don't need that kind of attention.
- They got thirty boys up there. maybe forty.

975
01:32:20.728 --> 01:32:23.397
- Son of a bitch.
- Wait a bit of excitement.

976
01:32:23.606 --> 01:32:24.607
Hello judge.

977
01:32:24.774 --> 01:32:27.901
- Why are you here. Nathan?
- I was dispatched here

978
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:30.070
to make sure it doesn't get out
of the hands of the civil authorities.

979
01:32:30.403 --> 01:32:33.490
If you have any hope for
a political future in the County seat

980
01:32:33.782 --> 01:32:36.826
you will respond our suggestions.

981
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:42.165
- And what do you suggest sir?
- Whole military attack. Destroy them!

982
01:32:42.374 --> 01:32:46.126
- China? Soldiers. stop her!
- Yen!

983
01:32:47.086 --> 01:32:50.089
Stop her! China!

984
01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:55.386
- China!
- Yen!

985
01:32:59.056 --> 01:33:01.392
Hey you colonel
can allow your troops to get fired on?

986
01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.851
Cover me!

987
01:33:03.018 --> 01:33:05.687
Gotta get a move
into that house and catch it!

988
01:33:05.937 --> 01:33:08.189
- But that's a girl!
- Burn it!

989
01:33:08.398 --> 01:33:09.899
Excuse me?

990
01:33:10.984 --> 01:33:12.527
Burn it!

991
01:33:15.113 --> 01:33:17.573
- Mr. Murphy!
- Never mind. colonel.

992
01:33:17.782 --> 01:33:19.701
just tell your troops
not to mind my men

993
01:33:19.909 --> 01:33:22.453
when they're going
on the back and do it.

994
01:33:23.121 --> 01:33:25.998
Burn it!
Put your men on the right!

995
01:33:33.005 --> 01:33:34.214
Let's go.

996
01:33:43.181 --> 01:33:44.307
Fire!

997
01:34:15.045 --> 01:34:17.881
- Cease fire!
- Hey. Billy...

998
01:34:18.089 --> 01:34:20.967
Please. I've got to go.
I've got to go.

999
01:34:21.176 --> 01:34:22.969
I've got to get my wife.
I've got a wife.

1000
01:34:23.219 --> 01:34:25.805
She's this little
Mexican gal. Please...

1001
01:34:26.014 --> 01:34:28.432
Charley. if you don't stand up
and start whooping some ass.

1002
01:34:28.641 --> 01:34:30.643
you ain't ever
gonna see her again.

1003
01:34:30.851 --> 01:34:32.478
Come on. Charley!

1004
01:34:34.104 --> 01:34:36.148
- Come on out!
- Come on. get out!

1005
01:34:37.816 --> 01:34:39.526
That's it. Come on. let's go then!

1006
01:34:45.407 --> 01:34:48.368
They lit it boys!
They lit the house.

1007
01:34:51.329 --> 01:34:55.792
Mr. Bonney. Mr. McSween.
This is colonel Nathan Dudley

1008
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.252
out of Fort Stanton.
Come on out.

1009
01:34:58.461 --> 01:35:00.088
with your hands high.

1010
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:04.342
With your hands high?

1011
01:35:07.928 --> 01:35:09.471
I better reason with him.

1012
01:35:10.681 --> 01:35:14.476
Hey. Colonel shithead.
you can kiss my ass!

1013
01:35:15.018 --> 01:35:16.895
Goddamit Billy!

1014
01:35:17.104 --> 01:35:19.231
You get President Hayes
