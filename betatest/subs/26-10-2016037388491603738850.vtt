00:00:01.074 --> 00:00:02.919
(dramatic music)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Downloaded from
YTS.MX

00:00:02.994 --> 00:00:04.679
Anderson: Growing up in montana.

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.319
I thought I knew mountain lions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:12.719
I've tracked these cats
through my back yard.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.152
A kill.

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.679
And filmed them on their kills.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:21.792
I know these cats.

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.512
I've studied them
my entire life.

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.472
These tracks are
less than 24 hours.

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.839
She's definitely hunting.

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:32.279
They're solitary. elusive.

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:36.279
But everything I thought
I knew. I was wrong.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.159
On the other side of the world

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.279
These cats are re
-writing the text book.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:46.439
Their social dynamics
are evolving.

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:48.679
And they're teaming up.

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:52.719
Arenada: This is when you
need to stand your ground.

00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:55.792
Anderson: In the mountains
of patagonia.

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.832
Nature's creating.

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:57.799
Look at them!

00:00:57.874 --> 00:00:59.879
A pride of pumas.

00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:01.559
If someone told me
this was happening.

00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:02.919
I would never believe them.

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:06.439
Arenada: If this is
not a pride of pumas.

00:01:06.514 --> 00:01:07.519
Tell me what this is.

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:11.792
We're just trying to understand
what's going on here.

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:12.599
(imitating explosion booming)

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:14.272
Anderson: Like mind-blowing

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:17.959
Visual that I can't
even comprehend.

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.919
This is the mountain lion
like never seen before.

00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:27.439
(puma growling)

00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:35.799
(bright upbeat music)

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:38.999
My name's casey anderson.

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:42.119
I'm heading to torres del
paine national park. in chile.

00:01:43.074 --> 00:01:45.919
One of the last truly
wild places on the planet.

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:49.232
An area that may hold
the densest population

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.559
Of pumas on earth.

00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:05.552
I've been invited by rene
arenada. a chilean filmmaker.

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:08.199
To come down here and
witness their pumas.

00:02:09.074 --> 00:02:11.799
It's basically the same
species that lives in montana.

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.319
But for all my
years of tracking.

00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:18.512
I've rarely ever
seen one close up.

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:20.912
Here. things are different.

00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:22.832
The pumas prowl out in the open.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.992
And hunt by the
light of the day.

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.959
It defies everything I
know about mountain lions.

00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:29.559
Arenada: What do you
think about this?

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:31.872
It's like a postcard.

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:33.232
Anderson: That's the thing
about this place.

00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.479
The highest
concentration of pumas

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.719
In the most beautiful
place on the planet.

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:39.392
Arenada: A safe
paradise for them.

00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:41.952
They don't have to
struggle against a bear.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.959
Struggle against a wolf.

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:46.759
That changes the picture
completely for them. isn't it?

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.159
Anderson: It's got to.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.072
Arenada: Well there's things
we've been watching

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.272
For the last couple of years.

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:53.079
We're trying to learn
more about this also.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:54.672
Because there's a
lot of things that.

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:56.679
You know. they're
not on the books.

00:02:56.754 --> 00:02:59.952
Anderson: In all my life. until
I was 30 years old.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:03.392
Right around there. I'd only
seen six mountain lions.

00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.072
Like just short glimpses.
in all of my entire life.

00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:08.879
Arenada: You need to
turn the radar on.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.952
Anderson: Turning it on now.

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:14.559
(upbeat music)

00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:20.032
So what's the next move?

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:22.432
Arenada: Prepare ourselves
and go for a walk.

00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:25.199
Anderson: We should
go out there.

00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:30.592
We've got a special
permit for just five days

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:33.792
To explore what's known
as the puma triangle.

00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:36.399
(gentle music)

00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:39.072
Two sides of the
triangle are fortified

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:40.879
By natural barriers
within the park.

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:45.712
The third side is bordered
by private farmland

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:47.679
Where pumas are
protected from hunting.

00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:52.352
This island of safety
creates a puma paradise

00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:54.079
At the southern tip the world.

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:58.279
Arenada: So this is the
puma triangle.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.039
One of the best
places in the world

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:01.472
To see these animals up close

00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:03.799
And witness their
social dynamics.

00:04:03.874 --> 00:04:05.152
The park is very well protected

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.072
By the mountain
and the ice fields.

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.039
Anderson: This is one of the
most beautiful things

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.079
I've ever seen.

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:14.832
Arenada: And now having
that farmland

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:16.992
That is not hunting pumas.

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.152
It's actually opening
a corridor for them

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:20.639
To go out if necessary.

00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.199
So that's really
good for the species.

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:26.199
So it's a perfect storm.

00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:29.799
There's many pumas
but they're hiding

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:31.159
And we need to find them.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:33.879
(gentle music)

00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:40.679
Anderson: Rene's spent years
following the pumas here.

00:04:40.754 --> 00:04:42.919
He knows the individual
cats by name.

00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:46.079
Can recognize them. knows
their family lineages.

00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:50.639
He's watched mothers raise
several generations of cubs.

00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:54.079
And knows which males
are dominant in the area.

00:04:57.874 --> 00:05:02.799
If anyone can show me the secret
lives of pumas. it's rene.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.679
But so far. I'm not
seeing any signs.

00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:17.119
This is an area that rene
often sees pumas on the move.

00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.319
Arenada: This trail. it is
open for tourism.

00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:25.712
And it's one of
our favorite spots.

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:29.719
Inside the national park.
outside the national park.

00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:32.519
(dramatic music)

00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:38.192
These patches of forest.

00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.919
It's full of puma
trails here inside.

00:05:40.994 --> 00:05:42.752
Actually here.
this is a puma bed

00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:44.759
And it's very recently used.

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:49.239
They use these forests to
sleep. and to raise their cubs.

00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:52.359
Isn't it amazing and
scary that I'm pretty sure

00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:54.439
There's a puma around
us right now watching.

00:05:54.514 --> 00:05:56.279
They're always around us

00:05:56.354 --> 00:05:59.119
And you are only going to
see them if they want you to.

00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:08.999
Anderson:  I always used to say.
"keep your head on a swivel."

00:06:10.921 --> 00:06:12.519
I just always do this.

00:06:12.594 --> 00:06:14.672
Not a kind of a paranoid thing.

00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:17.312
It's literally you're
walking by something

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.679
Almost guaranteed every time.

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.432
Arenada: Yeah.

00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:23.519
(guanacos squawking)

00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:30.599
Anderson: At home in montana.

00:06:30.674 --> 00:06:32.432
The magpies will always tell me

00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:33.959
When there's a predator around.

00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.479
Here. apparently.
it's the guanacos.

00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:42.359
Arenada: Can you see it. casey?

00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:45.159
Anderson: Oh yeah. I see it too.

00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:46.199
Arenada: Can you see it?

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:47.472
Anderson: Definitely.

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.039
Sitting on the hill.
about 200 yards from us.

00:06:50.114 --> 00:06:52.832
Is my first chilean puma.

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:54.512
I can't believe
he's just out there

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:56.832
In the open watching
us like that.

00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:57.759
That's the male?

00:06:58.441 --> 00:07:01.399
The head looks big.

00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:05.239
Arenada: We should try to
approach that animal.

00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:08.192
Just. there's enough distance.
and we have enough space

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:11.359
To approach a little bit
more to have a closer look.

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:13.959
Anderson: I forgot something
at the truck.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:16.679
(rene laughing)

00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:20.199
Let me just put
this in perspective.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:23.792
I've lived my entire life
in montana trying to peer

00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:25.399
Into the lives of these animals.

00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:27.639
But they are ghosts.

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:31.239
I literally had a puma
living in my backyard.

00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:32.359
That I named mama mo.

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:37.719
For a year I tracked her every
day with the best technology.

00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:39.159
And even then I was lucky

00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:42.239
Just to catch an occasional
glimpse of her and her cubs.

00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:46.752
Now. on my first day in chile.

00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.479
I'm face to face with one.

00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.999
And he doesn't seem to
care about me at all.

00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:55.559
So. looking at this cat.

00:07:55.634 --> 00:07:57.399
We're trying to
figure out who it is.

00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:00.192
These guys know these
cats like their family.

00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:02.039
But this cat is
a little unknown.

00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:04.599
Do you know why he has no scars?

00:08:04.674 --> 00:08:05.479
Arenada: Why?
Anderson: And he's beautiful?

00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:06.359
'cause he never loses a fight.

00:08:06.434 --> 00:08:08.399
So. I think we name him casey.

00:08:10.674 --> 00:08:12.352
Arenada: He's too
handsome for that.

00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:14.199
He's too handsome
to be called casey.

00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:19.072
Okay. casey. let's see how
close you can get to this puma.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:21.392
Anderson: So the guys have come
up with this great idea.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.352
Tap into all your puma
experience over the lifetime.

00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:26.919
And see how close you
can get to this cat.

00:08:26.994 --> 00:08:28.199
Arenada: You go first.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:32.199
You want to try to see.
test the tolerance level.

00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:36.359
Once you find a spot. you
sit down. very relaxed.

00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:38.272
You sit down and I'll join you.

00:08:38.281 --> 00:08:42.199
Anderson: And I'm thinking to
myself. sounds cool. maybe.

00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:46.039
(laughs) all right.

00:08:46.114 --> 00:08:47.959
Arenada: Good luck. sir.

00:08:48.034 --> 00:08:49.072
Anderson: I'm on my own.

00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:51.679
(gentle music)

00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.359
I'm really out of
my comfort zone.

00:09:03.074 --> 00:09:04.519
There's no way a mountain lion

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:06.679
Would let me
approach in montana.

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:09.919
But this cat doesn't seem
to have any fear of humans.

00:09:13.314 --> 00:09:14.519
Arenada: He's doing something

00:09:14.594 --> 00:09:16.039
That he never thought
was possible to do.

00:09:18.434 --> 00:09:21.639
If you've tried to see pumas
anywhere else in the world.

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:26.039
You realize how
impossible this is.

00:09:26.114 --> 00:09:29.559
This is not the elusive
ghost like you see

00:09:29.634 --> 00:09:31.632
In the rest of the
american continent.

00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:33.952
This is an animal that is safe.

00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:37.959
That is very confident
in his surrounding.

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:41.799
And he's not feeling
threatened by us. by humans.

00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:44.272
That's why you get these
interactions right now.

00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:47.152
Someone that can approach
the animal. observe him

00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.592
And follow if necessary

00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.479
Without disturbing
their natural behavior.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:55.559
Anderson: I've never
been in a place

00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:56.439
Where animals are looking at me

00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:58.512
Like this cat's looking at me.

00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:00.352
Just no fear.

00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:03.079
This is as close as I've
been to a wild puma.

00:10:03.154 --> 00:10:04.512
And the cat just doesn't care.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.839
And it just like. it made
me like a little kid again.

00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:09.072
I couldn't contain my
excitement in this moment.

00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:12.912
It was just. this is exactly
what I came here for.

00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:14.839
And here it is right
in front of me.

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.959
Arenada: He has a massive
smile on his face.

00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:33.312
This is amazing isn't it?

00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:36.199
Having a chance of spending
time with an animal like this.

00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:38.999
As elusive as these pumas are.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.119
Anderson: It doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:51.959
This is more true to
its self. in many ways.

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:53.879
The way this confidence

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:57.072
And this relationship
is the way it should be.

00:10:57.081 --> 00:11:00.199
This is a cat that has not
been ruined at some level.

00:11:00.274 --> 00:11:01.159
Arenada: By anyone.

00:11:01.234 --> 00:11:02.272
Anderson: Right.

00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:03.312
Arenada: Humans.

00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:04.832
Anderson: This is pure.
pure puma.

00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:06.992
(gentle music)

00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:10.432
As we watch casey. the
mystery male walk away.

00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:12.119
He's moving with purpose.

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:25.239
He knows where he's going.

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:32.159
And then a second puma
appears out of nowhere.

00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:36.512
(both laughing)

00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:38.999
And this cat rene
knows very well.

00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:41.879
Arenada: Oh. this is amazing.

00:11:41.954 --> 00:11:43.792
This is sister.

00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.559
So we know this cat for
years. since she was a cub

00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:49.872
About six or seven years ago.

00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:50.999
She's unmistakable.

00:11:52.674 --> 00:11:55.159
Anderson: Are they flirting
or are they playing?

00:11:55.234 --> 00:11:56.639
Arenada: Definitely flirting.

00:12:03.954 --> 00:12:04.992
Anderson: Just coming
over the top

00:12:05.001 --> 00:12:06.272
Of that little ridge
right there

00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:10.432
And looking up and seeing
two pumas on the ridge.

00:12:10.441 --> 00:12:11.839
With that in the background.

00:12:13.074 --> 00:12:15.199
This is like all my
dreams come true.

00:12:26.274 --> 00:12:28.119
Back home. this would
be the greatest shot

00:12:28.194 --> 00:12:32.032
I've ever shot in
my life. (laughs)

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:33.199
It's ridiculous.

00:12:36.674 --> 00:12:37.239
Arenada: She's cool.

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.152
She's a cool cat.

00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:41.152
She's like the aunt
of this neighborhood

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:42.919
'cause she's never
had cubs before.

00:12:43.954 --> 00:12:45.872
It's really cool that's
she's hanging out

00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:46.839
With this new male.

00:12:50.994 --> 00:12:52.999
Anderson: They're just
doing their thing.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:58.119
(puma snarling)

00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:03.712
As soon as you put the female
aspect into this equation.

00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:06.079
Arenada: Things can become
a little bit unpredictable.

00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:09.632
Anderson: He's just got this
look on his face.

00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:11.799
This cat has no fear.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.319
And all of a sudden. he
starts walking over to us.

00:13:15.474 --> 00:13:19.712
And they're getting closer
and closer and closer.

00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:22.439
(dramatic music)

00:13:26.274 --> 00:13:27.959
As rene and I watch.

00:13:28.034 --> 00:13:31.399
The mystery male keeps
coming straight at us.

00:13:31.474 --> 00:13:32.879
Guarding his potential mate.

00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.879
Arenada: This is when you
need to stand your ground.

00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:50.159
Anderson: We group together.

00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:51.959
Essentially forming
a pack of our own.

00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:26.512
I never expected to get
this close to a wild puma.

00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:30.239
And in that moment rene and I
had the exact same reaction.

00:14:31.314 --> 00:14:31.959
Arenada: It felt like
you shouldn't

00:14:32.034 --> 00:14:33.159
Be looking to the eyes.

00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:34.199
Anderson: I agree.

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:35.079
Arenada: You felt the same.

00:14:35.154 --> 00:14:37.079
Anderson: Yeah. I totally did.

00:14:37.154 --> 00:14:39.959
Just breaking eye contact.
dipping our heads.

00:14:40.034 --> 00:14:41.119
Letting him walk by.

00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:45.952
Arenada: I wouldn't say that
this is a threat.

00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:49.479
I wouldn't say that this is
the animal watching us as.

00:14:49.554 --> 00:14:51.879
You know. we will become a prey.

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:54.039
They will see us as something
that is not very common.

00:14:54.114 --> 00:14:55.999
Like sort of we are
on the same level.

00:14:57.714 --> 00:14:59.479
Anderson: You're having new
experiences too.

00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:03.232
Arenada: That was a
brilliant day.

00:15:03.241 --> 00:15:04.359
Anderson: It is.

00:15:04.434 --> 00:15:07.232
(gentle music)

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:10.519
I've learned on day one
to expect the unexpected.

00:15:11.394 --> 00:15:14.679
This is nothing like tracking
mountain lions in montana.

00:15:14.754 --> 00:15:17.879
And I've never felt more
alive in my entire life.

00:15:26.354 --> 00:15:27.872
In the morning we set out to see

00:15:27.881 --> 00:15:32.119
If we can find sister and casey.
the mystery male once more.

00:15:32.194 --> 00:15:34.519
Often a male and female
will stay together

00:15:34.594 --> 00:15:36.239
For several days while mating.

00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:40.839
But the male is a visitor.

00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:43.319
This is sister's home range.

00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:46.432
And rene knows where her
favorite hunting grounds are.

00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:49.552
(dramatic music)

00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:52.272
Just walking up here and
seeing these guanaco here.

00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:54.272
Seems like they're
in a bad spot.

00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:55.399
Arenada: Horrible spot.

00:15:56.754 --> 00:15:59.792
Anderson: Heck. a puma could get
right in here so easy.

00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:02.079
Arenada: There must be pumas
somewhere around.

00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:06.039
The guanacos. they
don't mind about us.

00:16:06.114 --> 00:16:07.232
They don't care about us.

00:16:07.241 --> 00:16:09.399
And that's why when
you hear an alarm call

00:16:09.474 --> 00:16:11.319
It's like 100% a puma.

00:16:11.394 --> 00:16:12.199
Anderson: Yeah.

00:16:12.274 --> 00:16:13.639
Arenada: It's not afraid of..

00:16:13.714 --> 00:16:15.952
Anderson: No. we're definitely
not on the danger radar.

00:16:15.961 --> 00:16:17.399
The pumas don't care at all.

00:16:17.474 --> 00:16:19.072
This is the one
place in the world

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:21.552
That you could literally
be part of the landscape

00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:24.439
Without influencing any of this
predator/prey relationship.

00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:26.032
(radio beeping)

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.639
Until the radio goes off and
just blows the whole thing.

00:16:27.714 --> 00:16:28.912
(both laughing)

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.392
Arenada: That's pizza.
that's hamburger.

00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:34.839
And if pizza gets nailed.
hamburger will learn the lesson.

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.559
He will see it happening
in front of his eyes.

00:16:39.954 --> 00:16:42.199
Anderson: Look out dude. there's
some pumas around here.

00:16:42.274 --> 00:16:43.639
Don't say we didn't warn ya.

00:16:44.994 --> 00:16:47.559
(somber music)

00:16:58.281 --> 00:16:59.079
The guanacos don't lie.

00:16:59.154 --> 00:17:00.359
If they see a cat.

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:02.839
They're gonna call them
out with this alarm call.

00:17:02.914 --> 00:17:05.152
Arenada: That is what these
guanacos do most of the day.

00:17:05.161 --> 00:17:08.519
They will feed. raise
their heads. look around.

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:09.872
Guanacos are clever animals.

00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:11.159
Anderson: So what you try
to do is you watch

00:17:11.234 --> 00:17:12.679
Where that guanaco's looking.

00:17:12.754 --> 00:17:14.032
And you'd watch where
the other one's looking.

00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:15.872
And you'd try to
triangulate and figure out.

00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:18.032
Look in that area and try
to find this cat moving

00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:19.319
Across the landscape.

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:22.199
Could be 10 meters away.
or three kilometers away.

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:24.999
Their eyesight is amazing.
and for good reason.

00:17:25.074 --> 00:17:26.512
They have to watch
this landscape

00:17:26.521 --> 00:17:30.432
Because at any second a puma
could be sneaking up on them.

00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:33.159
(dramatic music)

00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:38.439
(guanacos squawking)

00:17:38.514 --> 00:17:39.479
Arenada: This one. and that one.

00:17:39.554 --> 00:17:42.479
They're looking
to the same point.

00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:51.232
Anderson: Sure enough. with the
help of the guanacos

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.999
We find sister patrolling
the border of the park.

00:17:55.234 --> 00:17:58.519
Casey. the mystery male.
is nowhere to be seen.

00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:03.559
I feel like we're just one
of the guanacos right now.

00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:06.919
Watching a puma
stalk towards you.

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:09.639
Arenada: So this is definitely
her territory.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:12.752
And she's the one that's
using the fence to hunt.

00:18:12.761 --> 00:18:13.599
She's clever.

00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:16.752
She lives right in the border

00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:19.959
Between the national
park and the farmlands.

00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:21.312
There's a fence in there.

00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:24.239
And she kind of patrols
that fence most of the time.

00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:28.159
(dramatic music)

00:18:29.874 --> 00:18:33.239
Anderson: She basically just
walks back and forth.

00:18:33.314 --> 00:18:35.039
Working. patrolling the fence.

00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:48.839
(guanaco squawking)

00:18:48.914 --> 00:18:51.559
Arenada: He's the lucky guy
today. he's safe now.

00:18:51.634 --> 00:18:56.439
Anderson: I'm going to name that
guanaco rene. in your honor.

00:18:56.514 --> 00:18:59.759
Arenada: So you have a puma
and I have guanaco?

00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:04.439
Your puma's gonna endure for
a couple of years. for sure.

00:19:04.514 --> 00:19:06.999
But this one might die tonight.

00:19:08.594 --> 00:19:09.472
Anderson: I hope not.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.759
Arenada: No.

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:12.352
Anderson: I really hope not.

00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:13.319
Arenada: He's a brave guy.

00:19:16.034 --> 00:19:17.239
Standing his ground.

00:19:17.314 --> 00:19:19.919
Anderson: He just saved his
family. he's a hero.

00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:24.752
She's still on the move
right. we should follow.

00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:25.952
Arenada: Totally.

00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:27.232
Anderson: Let's go.

00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:29.759
Arenada: We've got our
puma now. it's still early.

00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:31.952
Anderson: We know
where she's at.

00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:32.959
Thanks guanacos.

00:19:38.674 --> 00:19:42.639
Arenada: We've been following
this puma for 500 meters.

00:19:43.874 --> 00:19:46.919
And we saw her stalking
on the top of this hill.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:52.432
So we came down. and there's
a guanaco in position

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.079
To be eaten by the puma.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.879
Anderson: Yeah. this is
a great situation

00:19:59.234 --> 00:20:01.399
Just to wait up the hill.

00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:02.999
But the shrubbery there.

00:20:03.074 --> 00:20:05.712
It's thick. it's thick
as it gets around here.

00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.632
So she's got the cover.

00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:10.519
The guanaco doesn't
seem to notice anything.

00:20:10.594 --> 00:20:14.352
There's not a lot around
that could bust her.

00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:18.919
So this is a recipe for
potentially witnessing

00:20:18.994 --> 00:20:21.559
A puma making a kill.

00:20:21.634 --> 00:20:24.359
(dramatic music)

00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:31.839
(dramatic music)

00:20:40.034 --> 00:20:42.759
Just a few days ago I
thought it was impossible

00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:45.079
To be this close to
a puma on the prowl.

00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:48.432
And now here we are.

00:20:48.441 --> 00:20:51.239
Watching one of nature's
greatest hunters in action.

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:57.392
It's fun to watch.

00:20:57.401 --> 00:21:00.272
'cause it's like a game
of red light. green light.

00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:04.199
The guanaco head goes
down. sister moves in.

00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:09.319
Guanaco head comes up. freeze.

00:21:24.361 --> 00:21:27.359
Arenada: Patience means
waiting when to do your move.

00:21:28.194 --> 00:21:30.599
And that's. that's a skill.

00:21:31.641 --> 00:21:32.839
Anderson: It is a skill.

00:21:53.074 --> 00:21:56.599
The guanaco's head's
down. turned away.

00:21:56.674 --> 00:21:57.952
Arenada: Oh. that's perfect.

00:21:57.961 --> 00:21:59.839
Anderson: This
guy's not looking.

00:22:01.161 --> 00:22:03.559
This is working
out. I don't know.

00:22:03.634 --> 00:22:05.952
That guy is looking now.

00:22:05.961 --> 00:22:07.679
Arenada: She's 20
meters away now.

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:14.119
She still needs a
couple of meters.

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:17.079
Anderson: She's low
enough now that.

00:22:17.154 --> 00:22:18.199
Arenada: She's moving.

00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.919
She's getting the
right position.

00:22:24.354 --> 00:22:25.159
(guanaco squawking)

00:22:25.234 --> 00:22:26.992
Anderson: Oops. busted.

00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:27.799
Dang it.

00:22:30.034 --> 00:22:31.312
Arenada: That was close though.

00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:32.159
Anderson: That was close.

00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:41.792
Seeing sister get so close.
yet still fail reminds me that.

00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:43.872
Even for a master predator.

00:22:43.881 --> 00:22:47.632
Hunting alone in the wide
open is extremely difficult.

00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:49.952
It could easily take
20 or more attempts

00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:51.079
Just to make a kill.

00:22:52.674 --> 00:22:54.432
She moves on. she's gotta do it.

00:22:54.441 --> 00:22:56.239
She's gonna have
to do it some time.

00:22:57.241 --> 00:22:59.879
Watching this play
out. in broad daylight.

00:22:59.954 --> 00:23:02.272
Just blows my mind.

00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:03.599
Arenada: You never
expected this.

00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:06.999
Anderson: Nah. no.

00:23:07.074 --> 00:23:08.759
Arenada: You didn't
believe me then.

00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:10.839
Anderson: No.

00:23:10.914 --> 00:23:13.719
(both laughing)

00:23:13.794 --> 00:23:16.119
Sure enough. there's
a pot of gold

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:18.759
At the end of the rainbow.
and it's this big.

00:23:20.754 --> 00:23:21.799
That's how this feels.

00:23:23.954 --> 00:23:27.079
(upbeat music)

00:23:27.154 --> 00:23:29.959
Arenada: So now we are
literally following the puma.

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:34.999
It's like following at her back.
observing what she's doing.

00:23:36.361 --> 00:23:38.839
Anderson: We're on the hunt.
right. part of the pride.

00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:43.872
In my wildest dreams I couldn't
imagine the possibility

00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.159
Of walking alongside
a puma like this.

00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:54.832
This is not affecting her.
the guanacos or anything else.

00:23:54.841 --> 00:23:59.599
We're literally in the moment
with this puma. and that's.

00:24:01.074 --> 00:24:02.519
Arenada: It's a very
intimate moment.

00:24:03.554 --> 00:24:06.512
Having the chance
to spend five hours

00:24:06.521 --> 00:24:09.319
With an individual is an
awesome reward from nature.

00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:15.199
(guanacos squawking)

00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:37.559
As sister continues to
search for her next meal.

00:24:37.634 --> 00:24:39.119
She slips out of sight.

00:24:46.594 --> 00:24:49.239
(bird chirping)

00:24:51.714 --> 00:24:52.999
By the time we find her.

00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:56.399
She's stalked into another
position to strike.

00:24:57.394 --> 00:25:01.639
Wow. (laughs) I can't keep
my binoculars off of it.

00:25:01.714 --> 00:25:05.959
Arenada: It's just one more neck
down to eat some grass.

00:25:08.434 --> 00:25:10.679
And that could be the last
grass of this guanaco.

00:25:13.001 --> 00:25:15.072
Hunting here is not easy at all.

00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:18.239
It's open landscape. you
have nothing to hide.

00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:27.159
So it takes years for
you to get these skills

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.152
And become a good hunter.

00:25:29.161 --> 00:25:30.752
Anderson: The head down.
she's making a last move.

00:25:30.761 --> 00:25:32.079
Arenada: She's making a move.

00:25:33.394 --> 00:25:36.519
Anderson: Making a move.
come on. come on. come on.

00:25:42.994 --> 00:25:44.199
She's getting close. man.

00:25:46.114 --> 00:25:48.719
This is gonna happen. this
is gonna happen. isn't it.

00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:51.039
Come on.

00:25:53.314 --> 00:25:54.759
Arenada: So. this is
her style of hunting.

00:25:54.834 --> 00:25:56.912
She's trying to get
as close as possible.

00:25:56.921 --> 00:25:58.599
She's not a runner.

00:25:58.674 --> 00:26:01.239
Anderson: The cats back
home would have run

00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:03.519
At these guys a long time ago.

00:26:09.874 --> 00:26:11.439
Arenada: It's gonna happen
at any moment.

00:26:14.441 --> 00:26:15.552
Now. now.

00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:16.199
Anderson: Here it goes.
here it goes.

00:26:16.274 --> 00:26:18.079
She is in the zone.

00:26:23.074 --> 00:26:23.952
Arenada: I'm nervous.

00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:25.399
Anderson: Yeah.

00:26:25.474 --> 00:26:27.279
Arenada: I really
hope she gets this.

00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:38.519
Anderson: Oh. come on.

00:26:40.441 --> 00:26:41.959
Look how low she is.

00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:44.559
She's basically
doing a belly crawl.

00:26:52.841 --> 00:26:55.399
Uh-oh. up on. the one up
top might have busted her.

00:26:56.354 --> 00:26:57.552
Arenada: Not yet.

00:26:57.561 --> 00:27:00.119
Anderson: Don't see
her. don't see her.

00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:09.439
Oh man. this shows how
hard this can be. you know?

00:27:14.594 --> 00:27:17.319
The one closest to her has
no idea what's going on. no.

00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:21.079
Arenada: She's still close.

00:27:22.034 --> 00:27:24.719
(dramatic music)

00:27:26.201 --> 00:27:29.072
(guanaco squawking)

00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:31.079
Anderson: (groans) that close.

00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:39.639
(bright music)

00:27:42.201 --> 00:27:43.632
Arenada: Seems like
they don't want

00:27:43.641 --> 00:27:46.759
To waste the energy on
something that is not 100% sure.

00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:48.192
Anderson: Yeah.

00:27:48.201 --> 00:27:51.959
Arenada: And that's
what we've seen.

00:27:52.034 --> 00:27:53.319
Anderson: But she's
right back to it.

00:27:53.394 --> 00:27:57.999
She's like okay. failure.
now no time to sit around

00:27:59.561 --> 00:28:00.999
And be depressed about it.

00:28:01.074 --> 00:28:02.999
It's time to go kill something.

00:28:03.074 --> 00:28:03.879
Move on.

00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:09.072
Sister's odds of making a kill

00:28:09.081 --> 00:28:10.799
Dramatically improve at night.

00:28:12.161 --> 00:28:16.079
Her enormous eyes can
virtually see in the dark.

00:28:16.121 --> 00:28:19.079
A difficult weapon for
guanacos to defend against.

00:28:23.561 --> 00:28:25.319
Under the cloak of darkness.

00:28:25.394 --> 00:28:27.439
Pumas have their
greatest success.

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:34.839
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

00:28:40.434 --> 00:28:44.119
In the morning we are back
out searching for sister.

00:28:44.194 --> 00:28:45.639
Hoping that she's made a kill.

00:28:52.834 --> 00:28:54.039
Arenada: It's cold today.

00:28:56.121 --> 00:28:57.879
Anderson: Suddenly.
out of nowhere.

00:28:57.954 --> 00:29:00.679
A family of four pumas
appears on the move.

00:29:00.754 --> 00:29:03.072
Arenada: If we're lucky.
they might be moving

00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:05.239
From the kill or to the
kill. we don't know.

00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:07.399
Anderson: Rene recognizes them.

00:29:07.474 --> 00:29:09.799
Arenada: I've known these guys
since they were born almost.

00:29:09.874 --> 00:29:11.159
This is mother.

00:29:11.234 --> 00:29:14.279
We call her mother because
she is sister's mother.

00:29:14.354 --> 00:29:16.272
It's cool to see her again.

00:29:16.281 --> 00:29:17.472
Anderson: That's sister's mom?

00:29:17.481 --> 00:29:18.999
Arenada: Oh yeah. so you
know a family now.

00:29:21.074 --> 00:29:24.759
So these guys are the
next litter after sister.

00:29:24.834 --> 00:29:26.759
They're very close
to independence now.

00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:31.319
Now they need to
find a place to rest

00:29:31.394 --> 00:29:32.559
For the rest of the day.

00:29:33.474 --> 00:29:35.719
Anderson: Looks like they're
gonna lay down right there.

00:29:37.634 --> 00:29:39.879
As the family beds
down for the day.

00:29:39.954 --> 00:29:42.039
Another puma appears above them.

00:29:42.994 --> 00:29:44.199
Arenada: There's a fifth puma.

00:29:44.274 --> 00:29:46.672
Which we don't really
know which puma is. yet.

00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:48.199
We need to have a closer look.

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:51.872
Anderson: That's
definitely a female.

00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:53.079
Arenada: Yeah.
Anderson: Adult female.

00:29:53.154 --> 00:29:56.759
Arenada: Yeah. you know
what. that's sister.

00:29:58.034 --> 00:29:59.279
That's definitely sister.

00:30:01.401 --> 00:30:02.519
Anderson: So she's
watching her mom?

00:30:02.594 --> 00:30:03.879
Arenada: She never left home.

00:30:04.994 --> 00:30:07.959
She's telling us something
about the social behavior

00:30:08.034 --> 00:30:09.712
That we don't fully understand.

00:30:09.721 --> 00:30:12.959
It's rare. it's really rare.

00:30:13.801 --> 00:30:16.432
Anderson: Yeah. I know. you
don't see this back home.

00:30:16.441 --> 00:30:19.152
Obviously. I've been filming
a mother with three kittens.

00:30:19.161 --> 00:30:23.399
About the same age.
but never. ever saw her

00:30:23.474 --> 00:30:24.519
With another cat.

00:30:26.354 --> 00:30:28.999
These are supposed to
be solitary animals.

00:30:30.201 --> 00:30:32.272
Why is sister. an adult puma.

00:30:32.281 --> 00:30:33.879
Still hanging around her mother?

00:30:35.234 --> 00:30:38.679
Does she still depend on
her for occasional meals?

00:30:38.754 --> 00:30:41.119
Or does she just like
being close to her family?

00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:46.359
Arenada: Knowing sister
and her mother for years.

00:30:46.434 --> 00:30:49.919
It's not hard to understand
why these bonds remain strong.

00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:53.552
Sister. and these three
younger cubs are lucky

00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:56.599
To have one of the best
moms I've seen in nature.

00:30:59.554 --> 00:31:01.712
(gentle music)

00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:05.039
I first filmed these cubs when
they were three months old.

00:31:11.481 --> 00:31:15.559
The kittens have spent every
minute of their lives together.

00:31:15.634 --> 00:31:18.399
Safe under the tireless
protection of their mother.

00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:26.039
Day after day this
mother teaches the cubs

00:31:26.114 --> 00:31:29.679
To stalk. and pounce.

00:31:33.954 --> 00:31:36.352
It's how they learn
everything they need

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:38.879
To one day survive on their own.

00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:47.999
She brings them to
her kills to feast.

00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:53.199
It's the first step in
weaning them off her milk.

00:31:57.314 --> 00:31:59.232
And patiently nudges them

00:31:59.241 --> 00:32:01.039
Towards more and
more independence.

00:32:06.681 --> 00:32:10.599
Do they just forget these
close bonds when they grow up?

00:32:10.674 --> 00:32:11.799
I don't think so.

00:32:12.834 --> 00:32:16.599
Perhaps the bonding even
continues into adulthood.

00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:25.399
Anderson: As we're
watching the family.

00:32:25.474 --> 00:32:27.119
Something interesting happens.

00:32:28.034 --> 00:32:31.039
All the cubs get up with
a clear sense of purpose.

00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:33.639
They just start going somewhere

00:32:33.714 --> 00:32:36.672
And it's really evident
they're going somewhere.

00:32:36.681 --> 00:32:38.032
Arenada: So we need
to follow them.

00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:39.559
Obviously something's going on.

00:32:39.634 --> 00:32:41.552
They're maybe moving to a kill.

00:32:41.561 --> 00:32:44.359
(dramatic music)

00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:46.679
Anderson: They're
straight-lining to this spot.

00:32:46.754 --> 00:32:49.879
Mom knows where they're going.
she's not too concerned.

00:32:49.954 --> 00:32:50.839
Let them go.

00:32:50.914 --> 00:32:52.079
She'll follow up behind.

00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:00.439
Arenada: Sister's coming down.

00:33:00.514 --> 00:33:01.639
She's following them.

00:33:01.714 --> 00:33:03.359
Anderson: She's totally
gonna follow them.

00:33:04.194 --> 00:33:06.512
This is getting even better.

00:33:06.521 --> 00:33:09.319
Do you think the mom will let
sister come near the cubs?

00:33:09.394 --> 00:33:10.992
Arenada: I don't know.

00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:12.912
Anderson: Sister's
keeping a safe distance

00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:15.599
But clearly she wants to
stay close to her mother.

00:33:16.841 --> 00:33:18.432
But why?

00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:20.119
Does she know where
they're going?

00:33:21.234 --> 00:33:23.959
Arenada: Maybe she's gonna
try to get food.

00:33:24.034 --> 00:33:26.559
Maybe she's just gonna
try to be around her mom.

00:33:28.914 --> 00:33:31.792
Anderson: What we discover
next changes everything

00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:33.719
We thought we knew about pumas.

00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:37.479
Arenada: Right here.
there's one. two.

00:33:44.354 --> 00:33:46.559
Anderson: There's
literally eight pumas

00:33:47.401 --> 00:33:49.399
All starting to come together.

00:33:52.194 --> 00:33:53.639
(imitates explosion booming)

00:33:53.714 --> 00:33:57.919
Like mind-blowing visual
that I can't even comprehend.

00:33:59.074 --> 00:34:00.199
The mother with those kittens.

00:34:00.274 --> 00:34:01.872
The kittens left. they
were going somewhere.

00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:04.352
And it's like they were going
over to their cousin's house.

00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:05.472
Arenada: We're just
trying to understand

00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:07.079
What's going on here.

00:34:07.154 --> 00:34:08.519
Anderson: Yeah. there's
something definitely

00:34:08.594 --> 00:34:09.472
Happening here.

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:12.199
And that's. they
know each other.

00:34:12.274 --> 00:34:14.592
(bright music)

00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:17.359
(birds chirping)

00:34:18.674 --> 00:34:20.352
There's nothing
in the wild world

00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:22.039
That's cooler than
this right now.

00:34:26.434 --> 00:34:30.039
Four cats walking
out in the wide open.

00:34:30.114 --> 00:34:32.359
And three cats going down

00:34:32.434 --> 00:34:34.799
And meeting with them
right in front of us.

00:34:35.874 --> 00:34:37.679
And there's another
cat on the ridge.

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:39.799
What's gonna happen?

00:34:39.874 --> 00:34:41.639
Is there a fight. is
there a kill there?

00:34:41.714 --> 00:34:42.679
What's gonna happen?

00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:49.879
There's no aggression.

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.072
There's actually the
opposite of that.

00:34:51.081 --> 00:34:53.719
It's like you're seeing
the same greeting

00:34:53.794 --> 00:34:55.792
That you would see between
a mother and its kittens.

00:34:55.801 --> 00:34:58.999
Except for this is two
mothers and their kittens.

00:34:59.074 --> 00:35:00.279
Arenada: It could be
either sisters

00:35:00.354 --> 00:35:03.639
From different generations
or mother and daughter.

00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:08.512
Anderson: Whether it's
direct. mother/sister.

00:35:08.521 --> 00:35:11.159
Or if it's just like two groups

00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:12.672
That have decided to get along.

00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:15.072
And what we're seeing here
is the ultimate tolerance.

00:35:15.081 --> 00:35:18.912
We have seven pumas laying
out in the wide open.

00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:20.279
Just like african lions.

00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:23.312
If someone told me
this was happening.

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.639
I would never believe them.

00:35:28.921 --> 00:35:31.072
Arenada: And then you have this
other female. the sister.

00:35:31.081 --> 00:35:34.119
Our sister. and she's waiting
for a chance to go in.

00:35:38.841 --> 00:35:40.599
Anderson: I used to think a
cat's a cat's a cat.

00:35:40.674 --> 00:35:43.159
Until today this is
not the cat I thought

00:35:43.234 --> 00:35:44.679
I would come here to see.

00:35:44.754 --> 00:35:47.279
They're doing things that
I would never even imagine.

00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.792
Here's the big question.

00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:51.792
Is this what pumas have
been doing all along?

00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:53.072
Or is this new behavior.

00:35:53.081 --> 00:35:55.399
Evolution happening
right before our eyes?

00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:59.239
Arenada: What if we are able to
watch for the first time

00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:03.232
A pride like this hunting
a guanaco altogether?

00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:05.639
Cooperating and
doing a strategy.

00:36:05.714 --> 00:36:07.632
Anderson: If they decided
to start to do that.

00:36:07.641 --> 00:36:09.472
If that started to
evolve. that behavior--

00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:10.759
Arenada: It's a
learning process.

00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:12.279
Anderson: Definitely.

00:36:12.354 --> 00:36:13.239
Arenada: It's just a matter of
one trying to kill a guanaco.

00:36:13.314 --> 00:36:14.119
And the other one's
getting close.

00:36:14.194 --> 00:36:16.159
And eventually trying to help.

00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:17.072
Anderson: Yeah. there's
no reason

00:36:17.081 --> 00:36:18.119
Why that couldn't happen here.

00:36:21.634 --> 00:36:23.712
Then this group
of pumas together

00:36:23.721 --> 00:36:26.039
Just starts to move as one.

00:36:26.114 --> 00:36:27.079
Look at that.

00:36:27.154 --> 00:36:28.352
Look at that!

00:36:28.361 --> 00:36:29.479
You should shoot that.

00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:35.719
It looks like we're
in the african savanna

00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:37.232
Watching african lions walk.

00:36:37.241 --> 00:36:41.072
But we're here in patagonia.
watching pumas walk together.

00:36:41.081 --> 00:36:43.279
And it just takes
my breath away.

00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:46.752
Have you ever read
this in a book before?

00:36:46.761 --> 00:36:47.952
Arenada: No. never.
Anderson: Exactly.

00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:49.152
Arenada: None of us.

00:36:49.161 --> 00:36:51.079
Anderson: So I think the
lesson learned here is.

00:36:52.194 --> 00:36:55.279
It's time to rip the books up
and start writing them again.

00:36:58.834 --> 00:37:00.319
Arenada: As we were
watching those.

00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:03.239
We just got a puma
walking behind us.

00:37:04.994 --> 00:37:06.512
Anderson: Yeah. that's
the eighth puma.

00:37:06.521 --> 00:37:08.999
Arenada: That's sister.
she's following her mom.

00:37:11.154 --> 00:37:13.639
(dramatic music)

00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:15.839
Arenada: I keep expecting like
five more to go by.

00:37:21.554 --> 00:37:22.839
Look how this
one's going around.

00:37:22.914 --> 00:37:24.992
It's almost like they're.
it's got like a tactic.

00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:27.312
If there was a guanaco
on the other side.

00:37:27.321 --> 00:37:29.879
That would be exactly
the hunting strategy

00:37:29.954 --> 00:37:31.792
That an african lion would have.

00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:33.792
You guys push them
around the mountain.

00:37:33.801 --> 00:37:34.992
Arenada: I'll be waiting.

00:37:35.001 --> 00:37:36.112
Anderson: Wabam!

00:37:36.161 --> 00:37:36.832
Arenada: There's something
going on. dudes.

00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:38.359
We need to follow.

00:37:38.434 --> 00:37:39.239
Anderson: Let's go.

00:37:41.954 --> 00:37:44.279
We have eight pumas all
heading off together

00:37:44.354 --> 00:37:45.399
In the same direction.

00:37:45.474 --> 00:37:47.159
We have to see
where they're going.

00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:51.639
The pride's on the move
and for half an hour

00:37:51.714 --> 00:37:53.599
It's all we can do to keep up.

00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:06.912
Arenada: There's definitely
communication between them.

00:38:06.921 --> 00:38:09.552
They're hanging out together.
they're walking together.

00:38:09.561 --> 00:38:11.152
They're following each other.

00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:12.319
They're vocalizing now.

00:38:14.354 --> 00:38:17.319
Anderson: And then we see
what's brought them together.

00:38:17.394 --> 00:38:18.199
Look at them.

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:22.359
(pumas snarling)

00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:30.599
Rene and I have followed these
cats to the ultimate feast.

00:38:30.674 --> 00:38:35.072
Arenada: It took us a while to
follow. and they have a kill.

00:38:35.081 --> 00:38:40.079
So the pumas we saw moving
together. interacting.

00:38:40.441 --> 00:38:45.152
Communicating. they're
also feeding together.

00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.839
(gentle music)

00:38:46.914 --> 00:38:48.079
Is your brain exploding now?

00:38:48.121 --> 00:38:49.952
Anderson: Yeah. it's exploding.

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:52.999
So they've all came down to
share this kill. looks like.

00:38:53.074 --> 00:38:54.599
Arenada: That's why they
were all moving together.

00:38:54.674 --> 00:38:56.519
That's why sister
is following them.

00:38:57.634 --> 00:38:59.519
So the question is
who killed that guy?

00:39:01.801 --> 00:39:04.359
(puma hissing)

00:39:05.641 --> 00:39:07.479
(pumas growling)

00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:09.799
Arenada: A little eruption of
a fight here and there.

00:39:09.874 --> 00:39:12.439
Sharing when you're a predator.

00:39:12.514 --> 00:39:14.759
Might mean eating
off the same carcass.

00:39:14.834 --> 00:39:17.599
But every once in a while
you'll give them one of these.

00:39:25.881 --> 00:39:28.599
You've got this intermixed
relationship of different pumas

00:39:28.674 --> 00:39:31.399
That have decided to
come together as one.

00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:36.639
Arenada: That's not tolerance
anymore. that is sharing.

00:39:39.474 --> 00:39:43.239
If this is not a pride of
pumas. tell me what this is.

00:39:44.361 --> 00:39:47.039
Anderson: It's a pride of pumas.

00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:55.952
Arenada: Four pumas down
here and three pumas

00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:57.239
That they already ate.

00:39:57.314 --> 00:40:01.079
And this other cat coming
down. which makes eight.

00:40:01.154 --> 00:40:04.199
Anderson: Eight pumas.
this is crazy.

00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:05.879
Arenada: It's a big barbecue.

00:40:05.954 --> 00:40:08.039
Anderson: It is a
barbecue. puma barbecue.

00:40:12.841 --> 00:40:15.152
Anderson: We have this
other cat. sister.

00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:18.119
Just waiting there for
her turn to go and eat.

00:40:18.194 --> 00:40:21.599
Like a very well
-behaved older sister.

00:40:28.841 --> 00:40:29.712
Anderson: There she goes.

00:40:29.721 --> 00:40:30.559
There she goes.

00:40:33.561 --> 00:40:37.159
Arenada: She's always pushing
these social boundaries.

00:40:39.394 --> 00:40:43.679
And potentially could be
dangerous and she's on her own.

00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:46.919
But she's taking that risk.

00:40:46.994 --> 00:40:48.752
Will they let sister
come in and feed?

00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:49.759
That's the question.

00:40:51.394 --> 00:40:56.359
(pumas growling)
(dramatic music)

00:41:14.761 --> 00:41:17.072
Anderson: Looks like everybody.

00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:20.039
Everybody's kind of stopped
eating and stepped away.

00:41:55.634 --> 00:41:58.032
Sister's patience pays off.

00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:01.552
The other pumas finally
allow her to share the kill.

00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:04.159
(gentle music)

00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:18.352
Arenada: This is probably the
most amazing social dynamic

00:42:18.361 --> 00:42:20.519
That we will ever witness.

00:42:20.594 --> 00:42:23.079
A group of two
different families.

00:42:23.154 --> 00:42:25.152
Vocalizing between each other.

00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:28.279
Obviously they know each
other and they gather together

00:42:28.354 --> 00:42:29.872
And they walk to a kill.

00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:32.599
That. who knows who killed
it. that's the other question

00:42:32.674 --> 00:42:36.119
That get our brains
exploding. what happened here?

00:42:36.194 --> 00:42:40.752
And then having this extra
puma which is the sister.

00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:43.479
And she's being allowed
to be around them

00:42:43.554 --> 00:42:46.599
And going and feeding.
with their food.

00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:52.879
This is really not a solitary
cat as the book says.

00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:57.072
It's a social animal. that
interacts with others.

00:42:57.081 --> 00:42:58.599
And they know their neighborhood

00:42:58.674 --> 00:43:00.239
And the cats that live around.

00:43:01.154 --> 00:43:02.479
And they help each other.

00:43:03.794 --> 00:43:06.679
(triumphant music)

00:43:11.801 --> 00:43:14.439
Anderson: In this vast
patagonia landscape.

00:43:14.514 --> 00:43:18.119
I see a vision of the wild I
thought had long disappeared.

00:43:19.154 --> 00:43:20.679
Just five days ago.

00:43:20.754 --> 00:43:23.239
I couldn't even imagine
what we've witnessed here.

00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:29.792
A place where large predators
have the space to roam free.

00:43:29.801 --> 00:43:32.519
Where they're protected
and have no fear of humans.

00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:37.319
And there's enough food
that they can cooperate

00:43:37.394 --> 00:43:38.399
Instead of compete.

00:43:40.921 --> 00:43:43.119
But so many questions
still remain.

00:43:44.034 --> 00:43:46.119
Will the pumas learn
to hunt together?

00:43:47.954 --> 00:43:49.159
Could this be a step

00:43:49.234 --> 00:43:50.919
In the evolution of
their social behavior?

00:43:54.114 --> 00:43:55.959
And. when can I come back?
