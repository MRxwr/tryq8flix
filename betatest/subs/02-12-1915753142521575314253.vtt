00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:59.560
<i>Way up in the Arctic.
there's a small town called Taigasville.</i>

3
00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.312
<i>A remote berg lost in time.</i>

4
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.648
<i>where everyone knows everyone.</i>

5
00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:13.865
<i>That's me.</i>

6
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.242
<i>Right there.</i>

7
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.201
<i>You see?</i>

8
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.412
<i>Swifty's the name.</i>

9
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:19.871
<i>I'm an Arctic fox.</i>

10
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.333
<i>And my kind evolved
to blend into the environment.</i>

11
00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.043
<i>Oh. you see?</i>

12
00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.128
<i>There we go again.</i>

13
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.549
<i>So why dressed in all white. you ask?</i>

14
00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.510
<i>Well. let's just say
my parents were a little old-fashioned.</i>

15
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.971
<i>To them. being invisible meant being safe.</i>

16
00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:39.224
<i>Out of sight. you're all right.</i>

17
00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.101
<i>That's the Arctic fox mantra.</i>

18
00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.769
<i>But. for me. being invisible...</i>

19
00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:44.146
Hello. Mr. Musk Ox.

20
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.439
<i>...well. just meant being...</i>

21
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.359
<i>...invisible.</i>

22
00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:53.530
<i>And that's the last thing
any kid wants to be.</i>

23
00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:59.494
<i>All I wanted was to be seen.
to be noticed like...</i>

24
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:01.872
<i>...these guys.</i>

25
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.749
<i>The Top Dogs.</i>

26
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.209
<i>Duke. Dakota. and Dusty.</i>

27
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.794
<i>Taigasville's biggest celebrities.</i>

28
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:10.631
<i>and easily the most visible citizens
in town.</i>

29
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.887
<i>Being noticed was never a problem
for them.</i>

30
00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:48.460
Sorry.

31
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.421
I'll fix it.

32
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:53.674
Hold on a second.

33
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.390
Uh... there you go.

34
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:04.768
Hmm?

35
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:05.769
Thanks.

36
00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:13.360
<i>The Top Dog delivery
was cause for celebration.</i>

37
00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.654
<i>They were our connection
to the outside world.</i>

38
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.823
<i>through the packages and letters
that they brought us.</i>

39
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.745
<i>And for a town as isolated as Taigasville.
trust me. that really meant something.</i>

40
00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:39.678
Hm.

41
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.691
Hey there. citizens.

42
00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.401
Arctic strong.

43
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.652
Yeah!

44
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.663
Arctic strong!

45
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:07.956
Wow.

46
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.333
Hey. this is so cool.

47
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.377
Thanks. Awesome.

48
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.336
Wow.

49
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.588
Thank you.

50
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.424
Arctic strong!

51
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.137
Excuse me.

52
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.139
Oh. hey there. little girl.

53
00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.474
What can I do for you?

54
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.726
Is there anything for him?

55
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:28.643
Hm.

56
00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.979
Oh. I almost didn't see you there.
little fella.

57
00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:32.689
Let's see.

58
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.484
Nope. afraid not.

59
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.279
Here. what's your name?

60
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:40.906
Swifty.

61
00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.449
Swippy?

62
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.450
Swifty.

63
00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:44.910
Ah.

64
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.953
There you go. Shifty.

65
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.705
Whoa.

66
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:56.630
Now. remember kids.
when put to the test. deliver your best.

67
00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.632
Arctic strong!

68
00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.050
Arctic strong!

69
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.386
<i>Now that's recognition.</i>

70
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.962
<i>Ah. youth.</i>

71
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.381
<i>Warm memories of being cold.</i>

72
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.759
<i>Once Jade left for school.</i>

73
00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:45.971
<i>I turned my focus towards working
at the place of my dreams.</i>

74
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:49.766
<i>Yep. that's me.</i>

75
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:51.560
<i>Years later.</i>

76
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.855
<i>Talk about bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Literally.</i>

77
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.567
<i>I was finally hired on
as an ABDS junior employee.</i>

78
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:09.786
Uh-uh.

79
00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.455
Not so fast. Fox go there.

80
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.090
Oop.

81
00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:30.807
Hey. there.

82
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.893
Welcome to the jungle.

83
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.853
Well. all right. thanks.

84
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.527
<i>I was on my way.</i>

85
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.487
<i>The dream of being a Top Dog.</i>

86
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.616
<i>of being recognized
and standing out from the pack.</i>

87
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.535
<i>was so close that I could taste it!</i>

88
00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:55.457
<i>Yeah. okay. well...
maybe it wasn't that close.</i>

89
00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.341
Oh. what is this?

90
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.010
Employee of the year?

91
00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.681
And a lingonberry pie in my honor.

92
00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.560
You shouldn't have.

93
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.896
<i>FM The Blast.</i>

94
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.565
<i>Good morning.
Taigasvillians.</i>

95
00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.568
<i>You're listening to Nasty Naz Narwhal.</i>

96
00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.820
<i>Today's gonna be a balmy one.</i>

97
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.781
<i>with a record-breaking high...</i>

98
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.616
<i>...of 34 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

99
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.034
<i>So pack up those parkas</i>

100
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.536
- <i>and break out the wind breakers.</i>
- Nailed it!

101
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.499
<i>Scientists from around the globe
have been scratching their heads</i>

102
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.378
<i>trying to figure out why the sudden spike
in global temperatures.</i>

103
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.463
<i>which have managed to level off...</i>

104
00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.340
<i>...in recent years.
but now. all of a sudden.</i>

105
00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:48.009
<i>pow. it's hot. hot heat out there.</i>

106
00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.886
<i>and no one knows why.</i>

107
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.304
<i>That's the bad news.</i>

108
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.682
<i>So how about some good news. folks?</i>

109
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:57.894
<i>It's Duke's 25th anniversary
with the ABDS.</i>

110
00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.312
<i>Yes. siree.</i>

111
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.230
<i>A big shout-out...</i>

112
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.691
<i>...to our favorite mail-carrying canine.</i>

113
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.818
<i>This one goes out to you. big guy.</i>

114
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.072
So. who's gonna be a good boy?
Who's gonna be Top Dog?

115
00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.073
Oh. that's you.

116
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.534
And look at me.
Oh. no. it's you. Top dog.

117
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.869
You are... Top Dog!

118
00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:18.665
Come on. come on...

119
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:20.500
Yes!

120
00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:24.587
No!

121
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.465
PB. open up.

122
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.844
PB!

123
00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.053
Wait. what the...

124
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.265
What is that?

125
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.315
Swifty. what are you doing here so early?

126
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.484
I lost my pound.

127
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.444
What pound?

128
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.487
The pound I gained
to hit the 20-pound minimum

129
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.655
to pull the Top Dog sled.

130
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.743
- Well. you can't fight your metabolism.
- I can and I will.

131
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:58.246
Put to the test.
I'm going to deliver my best. Come on!

132
00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.999
Swifty. how have I
put this repeatedly in the past?

133
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.042
- Look out!
- Oh. yes.

134
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.335
Deliveries have only ever been made

135
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.920
by dogs. and you are not a dog.

136
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.839
- What?
- You are a small Arctic fox

137
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:11.468
who was not meant to pull a giant sled
with even gianter packages on it.

138
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.054
- Are you hearing me?
- What? Yeah. every word.

139
00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:15.055
Come on. buddy.

140
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.848
We've got a found to find. Let's go.

141
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:17.766
Whoo!

142
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.727
Maybe you should just be happy

143
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.020
with what you have.

144
00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.606
Swifty.

145
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.983
I mean. you could break your legs

146
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.234
pulling one of those sleds.

147
00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.489
Or catch hypothermia.

148
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.659
Or fall into a crevasse
and have to eat your own feet.

149
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.912
At least I'll be remembered
for something.

150
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.999
The only thing I'll be remembered
for now is not being memorable.

151
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.626
like that other guy.

152
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.044
What guy?

153
00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.504
Exactly.

154
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.593
Oh. the work bell.

155
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.971
Oh. no. we're going to be late.

156
00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.516
It's going to take forever
to walk from up here.

157
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.267
Who said anything about walking?

158
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.186
Okay. give me a second.

159
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.354
Here we go.

160
00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:08.858
I'm bathing.

161
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.695
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy like a fox!

162
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.573
Take a risk
once in a while. It's good for you.

163
00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.367
This is not a good idea!

164
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.371
- Hang on. buddy! I'll get us there.
- Slow down!

165
00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.997
We can't slow down in the air.

166
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.999
I think I'm gonna lose a pound.

167
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.632
Come on. PB.
Enjoy the ride!

168
00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.384
Too fast.

169
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.468
Watch out!

170
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:48.481
- We're gonna die!
- We're gonna die!

171
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.445
Whoo!

172
00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.326
So you think Jade would ever go out
with a fox like me?

173
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.620
Really? Now you're talking about this?

174
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.081
She's been back for a year now
and you haven't done anything.

175
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.669
A year? Well you know.
these things are all about timing!

176
00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.303
Whoo!

177
00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.640
Sorry!

178
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.355
Watch out!

179
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.903
Look out!

180
00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:36.988
Ah!

181
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.540
- Swifty. what are you doing?
- Hey there. Jade. Hi. how's it going?

182
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.917
Sorry!

183
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.338
Argh!

184
00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.387
See? Like I said. we made it.

185
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.225
Ew.

186
00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.393
Yeah. better not let Magda see that.

187
00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.270
Magda see everything.

188
00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.606
PB on line.

189
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.734
Swifty. my office. now.

190
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:18.696
Hm.

191
00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.907
What are you looking at?

192
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:26.663
Adequate?

193
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.289
Extremely.

194
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.875
Extremely... adequate.

195
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.462
Up from last year's
competently sufficient.

196
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:38.967
but down from the year before's
satisfactorily appropriate.

197
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.303
Still. no promotion for you this year.

198
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.306
Now. get back to work.

199
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.516
Magda. I...

200
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:47.976
I've worked really hard for this.

201
00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:51.020
- I mean this... It's not fair!
- Life is not fair.

202
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.231
Is it fair that I have to run business

203
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:57.568
with antique equipment and employees
who are only extremely adequate?

204
00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:03.074
Is it fair that ex-husband run off
with wild elk ten years younger? No!

205
00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:05.285
I'm sure I had nothing to do with that.

206
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.623
Was that an earthquake?

207
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.838
Don't try to change subject.

208
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:21.759
I know you have big dream
of being Top Dog. but you're not dog.

209
00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.261
You're just fox.

210
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:27.557
Did you have to say "just a fox"?
Couldn't you just say "a fox"?

211
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.350
I mean the "just" thing
is really kind of...

212
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.311
Look. what if I just had
a small delivery route?

213
00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:32.645
- Just a little one?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

214
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.897
I run serious business here.

215
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.032
Ow.

216
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.283
Quiet.

217
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.076
I didn't say anything.

218
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.161
I'm okay!

219
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.540
So how did it go?

220
00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.417
It was promising.

221
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.835
Very... Very promising.

222
00:13:58.796 --> 00:13:59.881
All right. team.

223
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.759
let's get ready for the daily slog.

224
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:05.011
Arctic strong.

225
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.638
- Yeah. yeah... Arctic strong.
- Arctic strong.

226
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.272
Game faces. guys.

227
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.025
Okay.

228
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:21.569
Three. two. one.

229
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.321
Showtime.

230
00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.323
Yeah!

231
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.828
- Arctic strong!
- Whoo-hoo!

232
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.247
I swear that's gonna be me one day.

233
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.083
Not on my watch.

234
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:36.709
Back to work!

235
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.223
That's one.

236
00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.395
That's two.

237
00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.065
That's three.

238
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.881
I don't know how much longer
I can take this. PB.

239
00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:27.885
You just need to learn
how to go to your happy place.

240
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.931
Take a look at Lemmy over there.
He's in his happy place all the time.

241
00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.148
Here. I'll help you get started.

242
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:44.026
Plus. you never know
what's around the corner.

243
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.945
Jade is around the corner.

244
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.029
Yeah. right.

245
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.114
Wait. what?

246
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.578
No. she can't see me like this.

247
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.745
What do I do?

248
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.497
You just be yourself.

249
00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.125
Lemmy. what have you got for me?

250
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.463
Oh. boy.

251
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.174
Hey. PB. Lemmy.

252
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.509
Where is Swifty?

253
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.138
Oh. hey. Jade.

254
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.639
Give me a second. would you?

255
00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.683
I'm sorry. Nasty Naz Narwhal.

256
00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:19.187
I don't have time for a radio interview
for tomorrow morning's show.

257
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.231
I know. I realize that all my fans
want to hear from me.

258
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.109
but they're just going to have to take
a number and get in line. right?

259
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:29.280
'Cause when Swifty says he doesn't
have time. he doesn't have... time.

260
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.325
So famous you don't need
to plug your phone in?

261
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.577
Okay. I gotta go.

262
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:35.953
'Sup. Jade?

263
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.414
Hey. is that my coffee maker?

264
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.415
Oh. yeah.

265
00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:40.958
Whoa.

266
00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:43.920
I re-tempered the glass on the carafe.
added a hydraulic press.

267
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.005
and juiced up the tiered percolation unit.

268
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.048
Thanks.

269
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.383
Does it still make coffee?

270
00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.011
Yes. PB. It still makes coffee.

271
00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.723
Now. please tell me I didn't miss
the delivery cut-off time.

272
00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:56.974
Sorry. Jade.

273
00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.227
The delivery run done already begun.

274
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.144
Ah!

275
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.480
I have to get
this package out this morning.

276
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:07.193
and I would have been here earlier.
but someone dumped a pile of snow on me.

277
00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.278
Snowbody's perfect.

278
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.404
Hm.

279
00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:15.117
Lemmy. can you fly up
and see how far Duke is?

280
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.202
Fly?

281
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.537
Oh. no. Uh-uh.

282
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.080
Lemmy don't play that.

283
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.873
Lemmy doesn't do flying.

284
00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:24.627
Wait. but you're an albatross.
I thought albatrosses were great fliers.

285
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.964
Okay. first. it's albatrosseses.

286
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.258
Second. don't go labeling me.

287
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:31.884
It's my job.

288
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:32.927
Oh.

289
00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.346
I can deliver that for you.

290
00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:37.515
What. are you a Top Dog now?

291
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:39.141
I... Well. I'm in training.

292
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:43.145
Working my way up. but by this time
next year. I'm taking over Duke's spot.

293
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.897
I mean. you're looking
at the next lead dog

294
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.857
for the Arctic Blast Delivery Service.

295
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:47.900
Right. PB?

296
00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:49.485
Tell her.

297
00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.070
Um...

298
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.367
Well. nothing's official yet.

299
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.244
See?

300
00:17:58.786 --> 00:17:59.620
He knows.

301
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.914
Oh. ah!

302
00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.749
Oh. no. it's gonna blow!

303
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.212
Lived it!

304
00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.673
That darn sorting machine.

305
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:11.841
I'll take care of it.

306
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.677
Just please remember
to handle that delivery with care.

307
00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.264
You got it. Jade. It's my job.

308
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.183
Your package is safe with me.

309
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.312
Lemmy. show me
where Magda keeps those old sleds.

310
00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:33.821
Whoa. mama.

311
00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:35.865
Tell me I can do this.

312
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.658
There is no way you can do this.

313
00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.535
Reverse psychology. nice.

314
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.584
This doesn't look good.

315
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.794
What are you talking about?
This is beautiful.

316
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.881
Yeah. I never seen
rust and mold shine like that.

317
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.508
If Magda finds out you took this.

318
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.636
she might actually destroy you.

319
00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.179
Just cover for me. okay?

320
00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.805
I'll be back before Magda
even knows it.

321
00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:02.350
Eh?

322
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:09.482
Yes!

323
00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:14.070
I got the package. I got a sled.

324
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.946
I'm ready to go! Wah!

325
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.573
What else do I need?

326
00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:18.949
Besides a tetanus shot?

327
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:20.785
You'll need this.

328
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:23.037
- Right. for autographs. Good thinking.
- No.

329
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.455
Customer signatures.

330
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.248
And that. too. I knew that.

331
00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.250
Are you sure about this. Swifty?

332
00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.878
What's the worst that could happen. right?

333
00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:39.428
My first delivery
to the middle of nowhere.

334
00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.598
- Thanks. Jade.
- Thank you.

335
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.809
Couldn't have been
three blocks away. no.

336
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:42.867
Whoo.

337
00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.912
<i>Yes. who is it?</i>

338
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.957
Hello.
Arctic Blast Delivery Service.

339
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.544
I have a package for... Mr. Occu Pant.

340
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.505
<i>Just leave the package by the mailbox.</i>

341
00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.924
Yeah. sorry. I need a signature.

342
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.552
<i>I've never had to sign before.</i>

343
00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:02.803
It's official procedure.

344
00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:04.805
<i>Since when?</i>

345
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.391
Since procedures became official. sir.

346
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.227
- <i>What?</i>
- Oh. you know... I can wait.

347
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.188
I can wait a long time.

348
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.106
I can wait
until the cows come home.

349
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.818
I can wait until the pigs. donkeys.
the frogs and the turtles.

350
00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.905
and the. you know...
Wait. do turtles even come home?

351
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:23.199
I mean. technically.
they're kind of home already. right?

352
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.158
Home's on their back.

353
00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:28.037
<i>Stop. please. Stop. for goodness' sake.</i>

354
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:38.964
Whoa.

355
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:48.808
Oh. I'm a puffin
and I will sign for the package.

356
00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:49.725
Thank you.

357
00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:52.728
Okay.

358
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.605
Here... Here you go. ma'am.

359
00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:58.317
Or sir.
Or either way is fine.

360
00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.902
Just give it here.

361
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:00.820
Here.

362
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.030
Oh. okay.
I got it.

363
00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:05.157
Oh. wait. Oh!

364
00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:18.796
Right then.
Mr. Official Procedure. Where do I sign?

365
00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:22.007
Right there. Mr. Occu Pant.

366
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.649
Hey. I love puffins.

367
00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.901
Wow. look at those little guys go.

368
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:42.444
What are they doing?

369
00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:44.905
Aren't you a fuzzy little nosy parker?

370
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:49.827
Isn't there a delightful maxim
about how curiosity killed the cat?

371
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.538
Well. it's a good thing
I'm a Top Dog then. isn't it?

372
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:55.040
You? You're just a fox.

373
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:57.793
There's that "just" again.

374
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.212
Look. no time to talk. sir.

375
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:02.756
I've got to head back to headquarters
to continue my duties.

376
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.924
Top Dog!

377
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.759
Thank you very much.

378
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:11.432
Those Top Dogs are becoming a nuisance.

379
00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:14.560
Something will have to be done about them.

380
00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:48.844
Mm.

381
00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:57.311
Jade!

382
00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.146
Jade.

383
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.774
Jade!

384
00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:07.279
Jade!

385
00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:09.406
Oh.

386
00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:10.449
Hey. Swifty.

387
00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:12.034
Hey. Hi.

388
00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:14.828
I made sure your package got delivered.

389
00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:18.165
No mistakes. no delays.
custom holdups. nothing.

390
00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.334
Sure was far out there though.
wasn't it?

391
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.003
I mean. really. really far out there.

392
00:24:23.087 --> 00:24:24.922
I must say I'm impressed.

393
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.549
That's about as efficient a delivery
as you'll find anywhere.

394
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:31.595
Well. I guess you would know. right?
Miss Worldly Traveler.

395
00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:33.305
You've been just about everywhere.

396
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:35.474
Well. not everywhere.

397
00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:37.768
Well. almost everywhere though. right?

398
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.562
What's it like out there
in this big. wide world?

399
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.732
Big and wide.

400
00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:45.818
And hot. Too hot.

401
00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.111
I missed the Arctic air.

402
00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:48.612
Is that why you came back?

403
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:53.617
That. and this is my home.
I mean. it was funny.

404
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:56.495
There I was. going to
all these amazing engineering schools

405
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.914
in all these exotic countries.

406
00:24:58.998 --> 00:25:02.918
and as the months turned into years.
for some reason I...

407
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.628
I just kept thinking about home.

408
00:25:05.713 --> 00:25:06.839
And then it hit me.

409
00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:08.007
My heart was here...

410
00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:09.633
in Taigasville.

411
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:12.219
Must have been exciting though.

412
00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:16.515
Whoa.

413
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:19.893
That's Spanish for.
"Yes. it was very exciting."

414
00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:21.020
<i>Oui. oui.</i>

415
00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:23.147
That's French.

416
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:24.690
I know. that's...

417
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.567
I'm just saying it.
you know. I...

418
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.028
I'm fluent in... in all the fluencies too.

419
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.323
So what do you...
What do you got here?

420
00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:36.035
I'm just putting the final touches
on the town snowblower.

421
00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:38.662
and I've upgraded it
to a three-stage power system

422
00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:42.499
with hydro-static transmission
and a gross torque of 56 pounds per foot.

423
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:45.461
Right. wow.
Fifty-six pounds of feet.

424
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.004
Whoo! That's a lot of feet.

425
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:52.509
Yeah. now have you considered adding.
like. flame decals on the side?

426
00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:55.012
You know. wouldn't that be... hot?

427
00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:57.014
I'll think about it.

428
00:25:57.723 --> 00:26:00.392
All right. well. look. I should just
get going before I keep talking.

429
00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.144
Oh.

430
00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:03.937
Okay. Sure.

431
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.985
Hey. Swifty.

432
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:11.737
Yeah.

433
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.656
Thanks for delivering
that package for me.

434
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.158
Sure. sure.

435
00:26:16.784 --> 00:26:17.701
Anytime. Jade.

436
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:23.373
So Jade. I was thinking.
do you wanna go out sometime?

437
00:26:23.457 --> 00:26:27.377
We could... Come on. Swifty. Come on!

438
00:26:27.544 --> 00:26:29.713
Hey. Jade.

439
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.591
Hey. Ja...

440
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.202
Looking good. Swifty.

441
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.084
Ah! Oh...

442
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:10.712
Oh...

443
00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:13.173
- No. no. no. no. no...
- Whoa!

444
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:16.093
I am freaking out. man!

445
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.096
PB!

446
00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:20.848
What took you so long?

447
00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:24.017
Oh. you should have seen me!
That was amazing.

448
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:25.936
I was. like. swooshing and whooshing.

449
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.438
I was all like. "Sign here.
Here's your package. sir."

450
00:27:28.522 --> 00:27:31.525
They were like. "Thank you." and I was
like. "You're welcome. Mr. Occu Pant."

451
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.944
And there were these little puffins.
Oh. there are so many...

452
00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:35.779
Swifty. Where have you been?

453
00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.781
I was... out.

454
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.825
Out delivering packages?

455
00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.493
No. no. not exactly.

456
00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:44.872
No. it was a...
single package.

457
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.167
Aha. You lie.

458
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.460
Wait. I was just answering
accurately. right?

459
00:27:50.544 --> 00:27:51.962
I mean accuracy...

460
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.214
is important. isn't it?
All right. who sold me out?

461
00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:56.383
Oh.

462
00:27:56.633 --> 00:27:58.260
I didn't know it was a secret.

463
00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:02.181
You said you got promoted to a Top Dog
and. let's see. what else?

464
00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:03.682
Shh. shh!

465
00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:04.683
Oh!

466
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.686
You said something
about replacing Duke...

467
00:28:09.313 --> 00:28:12.107
This Lemmy. you know. he's...

468
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:17.487
That's it. Fox break rules and tell lies
to everybody about promotion.

469
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:20.949
Fox never get promotion
so long as Magda here.

470
00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:21.867
Never.

471
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.330
Fox suspended from official ABDS work
until further notice.

472
00:28:27.623 --> 00:28:29.625
Suspended? Really?

473
00:28:42.638 --> 00:28:43.722
Hm.

474
00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:48.393
What are you looking at?

475
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.066
Yeah. I feel you. bro.

476
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.785
I don't know about you guys.

477
00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:09.122
but I'm looking forward to 40 winks
of good old-fashioned shut eye.

478
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:11.792
Yeah. my dogs are barking all right.

479
00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:15.837
Can you believe Swifty today?
Getting caught stealing that old sled.

480
00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:18.548
If that fella had an inkling
of what this job actually entails...

481
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:22.844
Let the little guy have his dream.
He's not hurting anyone.

482
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:25.264
Well. what have we got here?

483
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:28.016
Hello. little guy.

484
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.601
Are you lost?

485
00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:31.061
You want us to call your...

486
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:34.523
mama.

487
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:43.323
<i>Ninety-nine FM The Blast.</i>

488
00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:45.033
<i>Good morning. Taigasvillians.</i>

489
00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:47.619
<i>You're listening to Nasty Naz Narwhal.</i>

490
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.830
<i>Temperatures continue

491
00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:50.956

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.457
<i>to scramble for a plan.</i>

493
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:55.043
<i>Well. Naz got a plan for you.
Slap on the bathing suit</i>

494
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.045
<i>and grab that piña colada.</i>

495
00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:00.299
<i>It's pool party time!</i>

496
00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:12.769
Huh?

497
00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:21.069
Hm.

498
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:23.363
No return address.

499
00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:25.532
Okay.

500
00:30:26.783 --> 00:30:28.285
What kind of delivery is this?

501
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:30.329
- Special.
- Hey. whoa.

502
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.915
Let me out! Hey. let me out!

503
00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.754
What's going on?

504
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.548
Quiet. we ask the questions here.

505
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:43.342
Explain this.

506
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:45.135
It's a feather.

507
00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:48.347
A feather from perhaps a puffin!

508
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.682
Probably from the puffins
that work for that walrus.

509
00:30:50.766 --> 00:30:52.434
- You got some sunglasses?
- Walrus?

510
00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.311
Take note.
This is new intelligence.

511
00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:58.482
It appears the shadowy conspirators
are finally coming to light.

512
00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:00.192
- Shadowy conspirators?
- <i>Oui.</i>

513
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:02.736
Something very bad
is going on in the Arctic.

514
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:05.238
Ever since the puffins turned up.
so has the heat.

515
00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:08.158
Look. I just met them when I delivered
a package to their place up north.

516
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.117
Okay?

517
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:10.952
He knows where they live!

518
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:15.499
Do you think he's telling the truth
or could he be one of them?

519
00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:17.417
Why would he tell us
about their whereabouts

520
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:19.336
if he was one of them? Hm?

521
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:20.629
This is true.

522
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:22.547
- It is official.
- Ah!

523
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:26.802
He must become one of us.
Commence the initiation ceremony.

524
00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:32.099
Ah!

525
00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:33.892
What'd you do that for?

526
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:36.103
That was the initiation ceremony.

527
00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:38.397
Well. that's a terrible
initiation ceremony.

528
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.524
Okay. fox. welcome to the team.

529
00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:43.568
You are now part of <i>la Résistance.</i>

530
00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:46.988
I am Bertha
and this is my life partner. Leopold.

531
00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:49.616
And together we uncover conspiracies.

532
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:52.702
- An honor to meet you. Mr...
- Swifty.

533
00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:53.995
- Swifty!
- What?

534
00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.122
You're about to be assigned

535
00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:56.623
your first mission.

536
00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:57.958
Do you see?

537
00:31:58.458 --> 00:31:59.918
Hm.

538
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.046
Well. that is weird.
I wonder what's going on?

539
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.548
Don't we all?

540
00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.467
Find out what kind of happening
is happening down there.

541
00:32:07.551 --> 00:32:10.303
Okay. Well. I'll start
the recon mission right away.

542
00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:12.305
The truth...

543
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:14.766
she's out there.

544
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.351
And you must bring her to us.

545
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:18.854
Okie dokie. guys.
Well. it's been real.

546
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:21.523
<i>Vive la Résistance.</i> Fight the power.

547
00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:25.318
- We shall not be assimilated.
- Exterminate. exterminate.

548
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:29.698
- He is a strange fellow.
- <i>Oui.</i>

549
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.234
Hey. we didn't get
our hospital supplies today.

550
00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:07.652
What's happening?

551
00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:09.237
No deliveries today.

552
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:10.780
No deliveries?

553
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:14.242
Who's gonna tell Doc Grizzly?

554
00:33:19.623 --> 00:33:21.333
Swifty. what are you doing here?

555
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:23.543
- What's going on?
- It's the Top Dogs.

556
00:33:23.627 --> 00:33:24.628
They quit.

557
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:26.922
- What do you mean they quit?
- He means like Splitsville.

558
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:30.842
Gonestown. Vamooselvania. Look.

559
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.095
"Sorry. moose lady. We quit."

560
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:38.934
No Top Dogs. no deliveries.

561
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:42.270
No deliveries. no ABDS.

562
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.855
What will Magda do?

563
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:48.818
And Magda not moose. Magda caribou.

564
00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:52.280
You're not thinking...

565
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.450
You are thinking.

566
00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.996
I hate when he's thinking.

567
00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:05.085
Magda. I've been waiting
my entire life for this moment

568
00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:06.920
and you're not going
to turn me down again.

569
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.380
Now. I'm going out there.

570
00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:11.800
I'm taking a sled. delivering packages
whether you like it or not.

571
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:16.221
Why? Because when put to the test.
we deliver our best!

572
00:34:20.642 --> 00:34:21.685
I stepped in your ink pad

573
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:24.437
and made little footprints
all over your desk. didn't I?

574
00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:28.608
Well. it doesn't change the fact
that I'm going out there today.

575
00:34:28.692 --> 00:34:29.568
you understand?

576
00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:32.571
All right.

577
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.073
Just get filthy paws off desk.

578
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:38.076
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

579
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.496
Magda. you have made
the smartest decision of my life!

580
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.498
- Swifty!
- Yes?

581
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:48.712
Magda bend rules one time.

582
00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:53.425
If fox screw up. miss one delivery.
damage one package.

583
00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:57.596
or even lose single pen
that belongs to office. that's it.

584
00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:59.472
You're done here forever.

585
00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:02.183
Don't you worry. Magda.
You won't regret this.

586
00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.727
Your pen's safe with me.

587
00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:15.113
Pen's safe.

588
00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:18.366
Magda regret this already.

589
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:21.953
All right. everybody.

590
00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:24.164
Top Dog here. ready for action.

591
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:25.582
What? Really?

592
00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.375
Yeah. really. PB. Really.

593
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:29.336
Now. what'd I tell you guys?
Okay. everyone here?

594
00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:30.503
Listen up.

595
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:32.547
Now. let's go get those doors open.
It's showtime.

596
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.383
I got my game face on. How's it look?

597
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.345
Floyd.

598
00:35:38.428 --> 00:35:39.429
Uh?

599
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.598
Door. please. Top Dog here.

600
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.308
Game face.

601
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:53.234
I'm ready. You ready? Let's do this.

602
00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:54.569
Hook me up. PB.

603
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.154
Let me come with you. to help pull.

604
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:58.114
Come on. no way. Not gonna happen.

605
00:35:58.198 --> 00:36:01.993
If you feel faint or a cramp coming on.
don't hesitate to just leave the sled...-

606
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:03.995
I stretched. Don't worry about it.

607
00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:04.996
Would Duke do that?

608
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.289
No. I think not.

609
00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:12.045
'cause you're about to see the magic show
in three and a two and a one and shoot..

610
00:36:15.048 --> 00:36:17.217
Yah!

611
00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.594
Abracadabra.

612
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:21.805
Ooh. oh... Oh.

613
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.014
Swifty.

614
00:36:23.098 --> 00:36:27.102
Ninety-eight. 99. 100.

615
00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:30.730
Ah! Yeah. okay. that's the third set.

616
00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:32.857
Did Magda change her mind
about the suspension?

617
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:35.443
Let's just say she picked
the right canine for the job.

618
00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:40.407
I gotta tell you. sure feels nice
being recognized more than just a fox.

619
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.991
I'm just a fox.

620
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:45.245
Yeah. but. no. no. you're a fox.

621
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:47.247
Well. no. that sounds weird too.
You're great.

622
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.375
Everyone loves how you do
the gadgets and trinkets and...

623
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:51.543
the stuff.

624
00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:53.545
Gadgets and trinkets?

625
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.092
You have anything
that needed delivering?

626
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.136
Is this for real?

627
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:02.345
You're not pretending?

628
00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:05.557
That's so... No. not pretending.
Not at all.

629
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.559
Hundred percent.
super-duper Top Dog here.

630
00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:09.686
I know it must be hard to stay calm
in my presence.

631
00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:11.187
Don't worry. I'm getting used to it.

632
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:15.233
Here you go.

633
00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:18.069
This one is even more important
than the last one.

634
00:37:18.153 --> 00:37:21.531
Jade. all of your packages
are important to me.

635
00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:24.784
Can I ask you something?

636
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:26.411
Yes. of course.

637
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.539
Would you like to...

638
00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:32.292
get a four percent discount
on your next delivery?

639
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:33.334
Oh.

640
00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:35.044
Sure.

641
00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:40.091
Just gotta get going here.
Then it's smooth sailing.

642
00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:42.510
I think I'm going uphill. Are we uphill?

643
00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:48.600
Ooh. oh! Whoa!

644
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.063
I hope he makes it back okay.

645
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:56.733
I hope he doesn't hurt himself
pulling that sled.

646
00:37:56.816 --> 00:38:00.779
I hope someone figures out
why all the beavers have Italian accents.

647
00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:17.712
Whoo!

648
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:21.716
Ow!

649
00:38:41.694 --> 00:38:43.279
Here you go.

650
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.907
Uh?

651
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:48.743
Ah...

652
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.669
Yah!

653
00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:01.673
Yeah.

654
00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:05.760
Whoo.

655
00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:08.638
Whoo.

656
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:13.643
Why don't they make smaller sleds?

657
00:39:21.484 --> 00:39:22.986
Kidnapping the Top Dogs

658
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:25.029
was not an order.

659
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:31.202
How dare you carry out such an operation
without my permission!

660
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:34.581
Now that the Top Dogs
have seen our operation.

661
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:36.833
we can't let them go. can we?

662
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.960
They know too much.

663
00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:43.548
So. who will deliver Jade's packages
to me now. you bird brains?

664
00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:54.934
Ah! There's my favorite delivery pup.

665
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:57.562
Yes. sir. Got another package for you.

666
00:39:57.645 --> 00:40:01.357
Your timing couldn't be better.

667
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:04.235
Whatever you say. Just sign here
and you're good to go.

668
00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:10.158
Wow. how many puffins
have you got in there?

669
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:16.205
Oh. I'm not about to discuss the specifics
of my nefarious plans with you.

670
00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:18.374
Wait. what? Nefarious... plans?

671
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:20.418
Oh. did I say nefarious?

672
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:21.794
I meant hilarious.

673
00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:25.590
Oh. we're starting
an all-puffin aquatic cabaret.

674
00:40:40.063 --> 00:40:43.608
You should see our collection
of swimming caps.

675
00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:45.610
Swimming caps.

676
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:47.612
I thought you weren't discussing
any specifics.

677
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:48.905
Uh...

678
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.156
Look over there.

679
00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:56.287
Hey. wait. no. You still have my pen.

680
00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:57.830
No. I don't.

681
00:40:57.914 --> 00:40:59.374
Now. go away.

682
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:01.417
Yes?

683
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:03.002
Uh...

684
00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:04.462
I'm sorry.

685
00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:07.131
It looks like you got another package
out here on the sled.

686
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:09.592
Oh. all right. Please wait.

687
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:13.054
Go retrieve the package.

688
00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:40.456
Whoa.

689
00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:43.751
That's a little aggressive
for a cabaret show.

690
00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:11.279
Jade. what have you gotten yourself into?

691
00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:20.079
Aha.

692
00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:25.960
<i>Meeting time. puffins. Let's go.</i>

693
00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:28.963
<i>Gallop and carry your wits. Hurry up.</i>

694
00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:38.765
Huh?

695
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.934
What the...

696
00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:46.230
Once we finish the preliminary
core sampling and pre-boring

697
00:42:46.314 --> 00:42:48.441
on the outskirts of town...

698
00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:52.737
...we shall sweep in from the north.
a united cold front.

699
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.406
A high-pressured systematic attack

700
00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:00.369
will rain down on those unsuspecting fools

701
00:43:00.453 --> 00:43:04.082
as our thunderous machine twists
into the heart of town.

702
00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:05.374
- Yes!
- Any questions?

703
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:24.685
Oh. for goodness... Good-bye.

704
00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:33.486
PB!

705
00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:39.242
The delivery! Middle of nowhere! Puffins!
Swim caps! Since wo...

706
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:42.537
Heya. Swifty.
Congrats on your first delivery run.

707
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.663
Way to go. bud.

708
00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:46.124
Yeah. listen. There is something
going on out there...

709
00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:47.291
Hold that thought.

710
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.001
There's something I wanna show you.

711
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.631
Surprise!

712
00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:57.969
- What the...
- The Top Dog returns. Oh. yeah.

713
00:43:58.052 --> 00:44:00.471
- Guys! You have to listen...
- That's my boy.

714
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:01.556
Yahoo!

715
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:04.350
- Yeah!
- Jade. I need talk to you.

716
00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.268
Whoo-hoo!

717
00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:06.561
Oh.

718
00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.437
Okay. All right.

719
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:18.823
- You the man!
- Way to go. dog.

720
00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:20.700
All right!

721
00:44:22.076 --> 00:44:23.911
Swifty.

722
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.038
Yeah...

723
00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:29.000
There's my number one star.

724
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:30.918
Look. I just need to tell you... W... Wait.

725
00:44:31.544 --> 00:44:33.379
- Number one star?
- Of course.

726
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:37.758
Quite honestly. Magda thought fox
would throw packages in ocean. so...

727
00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:39.218
good job.

728
00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:40.887
Oh. thanks.

729
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.471
You even brought back pen.

730
00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:43.389
Keep.

731
00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:45.266
You've earned it.

732
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:47.476
Okay. back to party.

733
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:08.080
- Hey! Hey!
- Congratulations. Swifty.

734
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:10.249
Hey. all right. you hear what she said?

735
00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:14.212
Number one star. y'all. That's me.
I got a pen.

736
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.631
- Swifty?
- Yeah. Yeah...

737
00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:18.090
You wanted to talk to me.

738
00:45:18.174 --> 00:45:20.843
Oh. yeah. but I gotta give the fans
what they want.

739
00:45:20.927 --> 00:45:22.470
Hang on. just one second.

740
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:25.806
Yo. everybody.
Who let the dogs out?

741
00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:30.019
Let me hear you say hey.

742
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:32.730
Come on!

743
00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:35.399
Rock on! Yeah.

744
00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:41.572
Yah!

745
00:45:42.782 --> 00:45:43.616
Aw...

746
00:45:51.207 --> 00:45:54.168
Hold on. Look. just a minute.
I'll be right back.

747
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:59.840
- Jade! Wait. Wait a second.
- Oh. is it my turn now?

748
00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:03.010
I gotta tell you what I was trying to tell
you earlier. Those packages that you...

749
00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:04.720
That's what you wanted
to talk to me about?

750
00:46:04.804 --> 00:46:07.098
No! Well. yeah.
Look. something's going on...

751
00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:09.433
You know. Swifty.
ever since I got back.

752
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:12.853
it just seems like you've been trying
to act like someone else.

753
00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:14.563
What's wrong with being yourself?

754
00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:15.940
Come on. Jade. It's...

755
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:17.692
I'm Top Dog.

756
00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:21.112
- My dream has come true.
- What's wrong with that. right?

757
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.905
Yeah. I get it. Swifty.

758
00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.783
I'm glad you finally got what you wanted.

759
00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:28.411
Jade.

760
00:46:28.494 --> 00:46:29.996
Come on. Jade...

761
00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:32.081
Come on back. hero.

762
00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:35.334
We've got some celebrating to do.
You saved the day.

763
00:46:35.418 --> 00:46:37.378
You're flying high. bro.

764
00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.964
This is your night! Enjoy it.

765
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:40.923
Party time.

766
00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:42.675
Oh. yeah!

767
00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:43.884
Whoo!

768
00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:46.345
Ah!

769
00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:11.704
Is someone there?

770
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:35.311
Oh.

771
00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:36.937
How did you get in here?

772
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:47.281
<i>Ninety-nine FM. The Blast.</i>

773
00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:49.283
<i>Hey. hey. Taigasvillians.</i>

774
00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:51.118
<i>We got another cooker outside today</i>

775
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.912
<i>at 41 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

776
00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:54.914
<i>Gotta say. I am loving this thaw.</i>

777
00:47:54.997 --> 00:47:57.958
<i>Best thaw I ever thaw!</i>

778
00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:59.418
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Oh.

779
00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:00.628
<i>And a big shout out</i>

780
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.671
<i>to Taigasville's newest Top Dog.
Swifty.</i>

781
00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:06.092
<i>We finally have a replacement
for that old chestnut Duke.</i>

782
00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:08.511
- <i>Maybe things will actually get delivered</i>
- Oh...

783
00:48:08.594 --> 00:48:10.346
- <i>on time now.</i>
- Oh...

784
00:48:12.348 --> 00:48:14.350
Has anybody seen my self-respect?

785
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.240
There's the guy.

786
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:31.075
Come on. buddy. It's showtime.

787
00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:32.743
Don't you yearn for the burn?

788
00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:35.871
I'm getting ready to blast my abs
and max my glutes!

789
00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:36.997
Yeesh.

790
00:48:38.124 --> 00:48:40.084
No offense. but you look awful.

791
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:43.629
Are you keeping hydrated?
What's your electrolyte count?

792
00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:46.090
Wait. PB. come on.
Just time out for one second.

793
00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:48.968
Be stronger than your excuses. Swifty.
Let's go!

794
00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:52.138
We're jogging to work today. big guy.
Whoo!

795
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.601
PB. what do you think is causing

796
00:48:57.685 --> 00:48:58.978
all this warm weather suddenly?

797
00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:01.188
Don't know. buddy. But I'm loving it.

798
00:49:03.232 --> 00:49:05.109
Hey. Swifty. Hi. Swifty. You're the best.

799
00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:06.944
- Hey. can you sign this?
- Okay. Yeah. okay.

800
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:09.113
- Yeah. here you go.
- Thanks.

801
00:49:09.196 --> 00:49:10.114
Awesome.

802
00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:12.032
- Aren't you worried?
- Worried?

803
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.577
I signed up for hot yoga this afternoon.

804
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.662
It's gonna be cooking.

805
00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:18.372
Yeah!

806
00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.374
What about the earthquakes?

807
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.711
You know. I saw something
while I was delivering Jade's package.

808
00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.588
Focus. Swifty! Fountain rounds.

809
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:28.591
PB. there's this huge hidden lair
out in the middle of nowhere.

810
00:49:28.674 --> 00:49:30.676
- I love you. Swifty.
- Hey. Swifty.

811
00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:33.220
- Over here. Swifty.
- Can I get an autograph?

812
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:36.974
Yeah. okay. Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

813
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.225
Here you go.

814
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:40.144
Can I get your picture?

815
00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:41.270
All right. that's enough!

816
00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:44.064
Swifty.

817
00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:45.107
Sorry. kids.

818
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.153
Huh?

819
00:49:50.779 --> 00:49:52.448
Uh? Uh...

820
00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:54.158
Hey. Top Dog. What gives?

821
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:56.577
Don't call me that. I don't deserve it.

822
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.996
Sure you do. pal. You've worked hard.

823
00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:01.832
No. I only got the chance
because Duke and the others disappeared.

824
00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:04.293
They didn't disappear. They quit.

825
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:05.419
That's just it.

826
00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:07.588
- I don't think they did.
- What do you mean?

827
00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.757
I think something is going on. PB.

828
00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:11.509
I'm all ears.

829
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.848
There is this crazy walrus
with robotic legs and a British accent.

830
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:20.809
I know. weird. already. right?
Okay. it gets better.

831
00:50:20.893 --> 00:50:23.020
Now. they're holed up in a secret fortress

832
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.231
filled with adorable.
yet evil. little puffins

833
00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:27.525
that are building
a huge machine which I think

834
00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:29.735
may have something to do
with the rising temperatures.

835
00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:35.533
And I saw harnesses in a garbage can
which makes me 90% sure the Top Dogs

836
00:50:35.616 --> 00:50:39.078
have been dog-napped.
and there are sleeping gas blasters.

837
00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:41.455
It's weird. man!
I'm just telling you!

838
00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:46.377
- I sound like I'm crazy. don't I?
- Certifiable.

839
00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:49.338
How about now?
Do I sound crazy now?

840
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.049
You gotta believe me.

841
00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:53.717
Why don't you believe me?

842
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:57.846
Because for years you've been stretching
the truth to get attention. that's why.

843
00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.765
And quite frankly. I've had enough.

844
00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:02.268
You don't have to make up
a bunch of stuff to impress me.

845
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:03.852
I'm not Jade.

846
00:51:03.936 --> 00:51:05.187
Are you listening to me?

847
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:09.358
Yes. Oh. wait. no! What?
I forgot about Jade.

848
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:11.860
They're using her to build the machine.

849
00:51:11.944 --> 00:51:13.988
- Who?
- The walrus.

850
00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:15.948
The one with the robo-legs?

851
00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:17.866
- Yes.
- Okay. that's it.

852
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.410
You need to go see Doc Grizzly.

853
00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:20.619
No!

854
00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:22.580
I don't like him. Come on. PB.

855
00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:24.748
I'm... Look. I'm sorry. okay?

856
00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:27.585
- I just need you...
- You always need me to do something.

857
00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:29.086
Well. I need to get to work.

858
00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:32.506
That's what I need to do.
but you're probably not listening anyway.

859
00:51:33.382 --> 00:51:34.466
You never do.

860
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:03.996
- Closed due to flooding?
- Hm.

861
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.166
Lemmy. get mopping.

862
00:52:07.249 --> 00:52:09.710
On it like a baby bonnet riding a comet.

863
00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.211
Oh. yeah.

864
00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:16.550
Ah! Who put that wall there. man?

865
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.470
Water everywhere.

866
00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:23.182
Jade need to fix machines.
I call. but she no answer phone.

867
00:52:23.265 --> 00:52:24.350
I'll go get her.

868
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.144
So reliable. that fox.

869
00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:30.022
Lemmy. mop is for cleaning.
not for licking!

870
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:40.532
Hello?

871
00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:41.492
Jade?

872
00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:43.869
Hello?

873
00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:10.771
"Dear Jade.

874
00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.357
our machine is almost complete.

875
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.610
As promised. I shall reveal it to you
once the final piece is finished.

876
00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:18.904
In the meantime.
rest assured that your name

877
00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:22.991
will go down in history
alongside the world's greatest engineers.

878
00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:27.496
Without the parts you've built.
none of this would have been possible.

879
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:28.539
OVW.

880
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.165
World's greatest engineer."

881
00:53:33.752 --> 00:53:34.670
Huh?

882
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:40.342
Puffins!

883
00:53:40.676 --> 00:53:41.844
I knew it!

884
00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:43.262
Who's going to believe me?

885
00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:44.430
Hm.

886
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.060
Agent Swifty. He's back.

887
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:51.395
Did you bring intel?

888
00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:54.815
I brought intel. out-tel. up-tel
and down-tel. Let me tell.

889
00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:55.941
Do tell.

890
00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:03.198
So the walrus and his puffins
kidnapped the Top Dogs.

891
00:54:03.282 --> 00:54:06.243
And Jade. who's been building parts
for his machine.

892
00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:07.286
Exactly.

893
00:54:07.369 --> 00:54:08.746
- Agent Swifty.
- Yes.

894
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:10.956
You are truly one of us now.

895
00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:13.500
and it is time for you to see
behind the curtain.

896
00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:17.087
It's all here. every suspicious happening

897
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:19.548
in the Arctic
since the puffins first appeared.

898
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:21.216
We knew something was going on.

899
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.719
We just didn't have
all the pieces of the puzzle.

900
00:54:25.304 --> 00:54:27.014
Wait a minute. What is that?

901
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:29.391
I've seen that before.

902
00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:40.736
The walrus has the same map in his lair.
only there's a big X over Taigasville.

903
00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:42.362
<i>Sacrebleu!</i>

904
00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:44.364
It shows where the puffins
have drilled so far.

905
00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:45.866
Drilled for what?

906
00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:46.992
The gas!

907
00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:50.120
Biolipadium Aradithic Dipsodium gas.

908
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:53.332
B-A-D. BAD gas.

909
00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:54.917
Very bad gas.

910
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.502
Unknown to the establishment.

911
00:54:56.585 --> 00:54:58.253
Denied by the establishment.

912
00:54:58.337 --> 00:54:59.421
It is prehistoric.

913
00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:00.589
It is mutant.

914
00:55:00.672 --> 00:55:02.883
It is hot and incredibly stinky.

915
00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:06.136
If allowed into the atmosphere.
it would speed up global warming.

916
00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:08.972
and melt the ice caps within minutes.

917
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.141
So those weren't earthquakes.

918
00:55:11.225 --> 00:55:13.727
It was the puffins
drilling into the underground pockets.

919
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:15.354
releasing gas into the atmosphere

920
00:55:15.437 --> 00:55:16.647
to heat it up.

921
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.650
There must be a big one
right underneath Taigasville.

922
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.903
and that mega drill they're building
is so they can reach it.

923
00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.947
The truth. She's in here.

924
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:26.615
We've got to do something.

925
00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:30.953
We could go to the puffin camp
beyond the hills. perhaps find new intel.

926
00:55:31.453 --> 00:55:33.956
It's far. What do you say. Agent Swifty?

927
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:36.542
<i>Vive la Résistance.</i>

928
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.752
Ow!

929
00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:41.380
Hey. come on.
I've already been initiated.

930
00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:43.215
It's also the secret handshake.

931
00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:46.593
I'm really beginning to hate this club.

932
00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:57.855
There it is.

933
00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:00.232
The truth lying naked...

934
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:01.733
...before your eyes.

935
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:08.782
Gotcha.

936
00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:13.328
All right. Bjorn. start the drill.

937
00:56:14.997 --> 00:56:16.665
Go ahead.

938
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:18.625
Go on then.

939
00:56:26.842 --> 00:56:30.012
I'll just be over here.
enjoying the view from behind this...

940
00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:32.306
...snowbank.

941
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:33.974
Hold onto your whiskers.

942
00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:39.438
Gas.

943
00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:42.858
Ah!

944
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:47.779
Oh. that smell.
It's like the planet made a poopy.

945
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:49.489
Uh-oh.

946
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.372
Maybe they didn't notice.

947
00:57:07.633 --> 00:57:08.884
I think they noticed.

948
00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:10.886
Run!

949
00:57:24.399 --> 00:57:25.317
Oh!

950
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.361
Oh...

951
00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:32.741
Ah!

952
00:57:52.177 --> 00:57:53.512
What?

953
00:57:56.848 --> 00:57:59.017
Good morning. Ms. Jade.

954
00:57:59.101 --> 00:58:02.688
I'm really sorry about the present state
of the accommodations.

955
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:05.774
Certainly not befitting
of the greatest mechanical engineer

956
00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:08.068
north of the 47th parallel.

957
00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:08.986
Who are you?

958
00:58:09.444 --> 00:58:10.404
Who am I?

959
00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:14.408
Eh. perhaps my biographer Anders here
can illuminate you.

960
00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:22.249
Oh. Anders.

961
00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:27.963
Well. anyway. you may know me as OVW.
the world's greatest engineer.

962
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:31.091
You're the one
I've been doing all the work for?

963
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:34.928
Indeed. and I'm so very thankful for it.

964
00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:39.891
However. we're on a tight schedule
and seeing as though the mail has become.

965
00:58:39.975 --> 00:58:42.644
how shall I say.
not entirely dependable these days.

966
00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.814
I decided to have you work in house.

967
00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:47.649
You kidnapped me.

968
00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:51.153
Well. we prefer the term
surprise relocation. so...

969
00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:53.030
surprise!

970
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:57.242
Now. as promised.

971
00:58:57.325 --> 00:58:59.995
I will reveal what we've created
once it's complete.

972
00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:04.416
and for that to happen.
I need one final piece of the puzzle.

973
00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:08.545
I need you to make the control panel.

974
00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:12.049
In any case. time is ticking.

975
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:16.803
Oh. and I'd really like the main button
to be fuchsia.

976
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:20.057
Can you do that. please.
a fuchsia engage button?

977
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.061
To work. my dear. To work.

978
00:59:32.778 --> 00:59:35.530
Oh. you'll get
your control panel all right.

979
00:59:36.114 --> 00:59:38.366
And a little something extra too.

980
00:59:45.499 --> 00:59:48.877
- We made it.
- Time to expose the conspiracy.

981
00:59:50.712 --> 00:59:51.797
Come on out.

982
00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.800
There's something I need to tell you.
Let's wake up!

983
00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:59.304
Everybody wake up.

984
00:59:59.387 --> 01:00:01.056
Everybody come out.

985
01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.558
- Swifty. where have you been?
- Where's Jade?

986
01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.143
It'll all become clear in a minute.

987
01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.604
First I want to introduce you
to some friends of mine.

988
01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.481
- <i>La Résistance!</i>
- <i>Bonjour!</i>

989
01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.233
<i>Guten Morgen.</i> everyone.

990
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.318
- Now listen.
- We're listening.

991
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.278
Ah! Stop doing that.

992
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.947
They are drilling all around the Arctic.

993
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.865
- Who?
- The puffins.

994
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.283
What puffins?

995
01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.702
The ones in the pictures I took. Look.

996
01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:28.542
They are going to use the BAD gas
to melt the ice and snow.

997
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.044
<i>Oui.</i> The BAD gas beneath Taigasville.

998
01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.047
Ah. BAD gas. I love it.

999
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.173
What about Jade?

1000
01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.550
She's with them.

1001
01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.386
- Who's them?
- Them are the same as they.

1002
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.846
BAD gas.

1003
01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:42.222
Who is they?

1004
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.849
They is the walrus.

1005
01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.809
Wait. what walrus?

1006
01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.144
This walrus.

1007
01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.606
I thought Paul was the walrus.

1008
01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:56.736
Magda know Otto von Walrus all too well.

1009
01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:02.951
Many years ago. before you worked at ABDS.
Walrus was employee.

1010
01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.954
<i>Before that. he lived in ocean.</i>

1011
01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:09.374
<i>obsessed with idea
of fame and immortality.</i>

1012
01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:12.627
<i>confusing his crazy for genius.</i>

1013
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.841
<i>For years.
Walrus present his cuckoo ideas...</i>

1014
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.802
<i>...until they kick him out.</i>

1015
01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:26.516
<i>Resentment grew inside Walrus.</i>

1016
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.060
<i>bitterness. all-encompassing...</i>

1017
01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:34.107
<i>until one day. Walrus find the ABDS.</i>

1018
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.359
<i>Magda take him in.</i>

1019
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.448
<i>Then ideas start.</i>

1020
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.450
<i>So many ideas.</i>

1021
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:48.955
<i>Walrus present innovations.
modifications. never ending. like mail.</i>

1022
01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.749
<i>At first they were good.</i>

1023
01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:51.875
[gear cranks[

1024
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:54.127
<i>Make processes better.</i>

1025
01:01:54.711 --> 01:02:00.175
<i>Magda promote him.
but then came pneumatic tube system.</i>

1026
01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:03.178
<i>powered by crazy gas.</i>

1027
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:08.141
<i>The system was brilliant. yes. and would
revolutionize global mail delivery.</i>

1028
01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.894
<i>but gas was also dangerous.</i>

1029
01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:15.815
<i>If you were to lick.
the results would have been catastrophic.</i>

1030
01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.985
<i>Walrus go postal.</i>

1031
01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:26.034
<i>Magda fire him same day.</i>

1032
01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.834
Look. Magda.
you can't blame yourself for crazy.

1033
01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.586
We just have to find a way to stop him.

1034
01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.507
Fox know Walrus lair best.

1035
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.384
Fox must lead.

1036
01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:44.010
Lead?

1037
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.178
You know. I...

1038
01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.013
- You think that I...
- Magda know.

1039
01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.098
Fox lead.

1040
01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:55.021
Taigasvillians.
if we don't stop the walrus.

1041
01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.275
the Arctic will melt
and Taigasville will fall into the ocean.

1042
01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.445
We have to band together.
kick down the door.

1043
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.781
and open up an ice-cold can
of Arctic justice.

1044
01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:08.994
How's that taste. Lemmy?

1045
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.329
Now. who's with me?

1046
01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:20.922
Magda with you.

1047
01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.508
<i>Vive la Résistance!</i>

1048
01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.802
Me too. I'm in. Yeah!

1049
01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:30.223
<i>Vive la Résistance.</i>
Viva the resis-dance.

1050
01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:32.600
PB?

1051
01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:35.562
This is all pretty unbelievable. Swifty.

1052
01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.688
Very much so. I know.

1053
01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.862
But I'm always there for you. buddy.
You know that.

1054
01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:44.904
Count me in.

1055
01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.072
Thanks. PB.

1056
01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.824
How are we supposed to get there?

1057
01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.163
We're gonna drive
right through the front door.

1058
01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.622
Then what?

1059
01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:58.376
Inside. right next to the door.
is a wall of sleeping gas blasters.

1060
01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.503
- Where else would you put 'em. man?
- Exactly.

1061
01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.172
Everyone grabs a blaster.

1062
01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.424
We start gassing.
They all go nighty-night.

1063
01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.301
Bertha and Leopold
will hack into the mainframe

1064
01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.511
where we find Jade.
Duke. and the others are being held.

1065
01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.431
We rescue them. round up the bad guys.
bada-bing. bada-boom.

1066
01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.475
Justice served. How about ya?

1067
01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.018
<i>Magnifique.</i>

1068
01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.479
What could possibly go wrong?

1069
01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:36.122
Incoming!

1070
01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:50.637
Ah!

1071
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.891
- No!
- Oh.

1072
01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.146
Ow!

1073
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.940
Whoa!

1074
01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:09.989
Oops.

1075
01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:17.288
Yeah. well. this wasn't part of the plan.
but everyone's okay. Right?

1076
01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.248
- <i>Oui.</i>
- Yeah.

1077
01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:19.666
- Kind of.
- Barely.

1078
01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.836
No! Not okay. We're trapped.

1079
01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:29.467
Duke. Dakota. Dusty.

1080
01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.594
They got you too. huh?

1081
01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:32.679
This is great!

1082
01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.641
I mean. well it's not great that we're all
stuck in here. but we're all together.

1083
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.060
Right? You can help us all escape now.

1084
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.062
Escape.

1085
01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.191
Look. little fella.
you can't defeat these guys.

1086
01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.651
- There's no way.
- What?

1087
01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.820
What are you guys talking about?

1088
01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:50.363
You're Top Dogs.

1089
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.032
Taigasville needs you. You're heroes.

1090
01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.367
Heroes?

1091
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:58.371
We're three overworked mutts
who just want to retire somewhere warm.

1092
01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.873
With a beach.

1093
01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:03.084
And those coconut shell drinks
with the little umbrellas in them.

1094
01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:08.840
What happened to
"when put to the test. deliver your best"?

1095
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.762
You kids. you grow up idolizing us
thinking we're larger than life.

1096
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.307
But the truth is...

1097
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.727
we just deliver the mail.

1098
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.396
No.

1099
01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.940
Look. the show's over kid.

1100
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.650
We're done.

1101
01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.915
Jade.

1102
01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.125
It's finished.

1103
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.502
Ah!

1104
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.923
I've done what you've asked.
Now let me go.

1105
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.343
Yes. well. I have
some other ideas about that.

1106
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.929
First. as promised.
I'd like to fill you in

1107
01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.224
on what all your work
has actually been used to build.

1108
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:01.434
A drill?

1109
01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:02.769
A colossal drill.

1110
01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.563
to smash through the heart of Taigasville.

1111
01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.066
burrow eight miles below the surface...

1112
01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:11.611
...and puncture a pocket
of ancient pre-Cambrian...

1113
01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:16.824
gas to melt the polar ice caps.

1114
01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.243
Why?

1115
01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:22.121
Ever since I was a pup. I've tried
to make the world a better place

1116
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.124
by way of my limitless genius.

1117
01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:29.879
But the world's rejected that gift
again and again.

1118
01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:34.884
Well. now it's my turn to take back.

1119
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:38.388
The Arctic will fall
and the world along with it!

1120
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:41.766
Then we'll see who comes running
to my doorstep for help.

1121
01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:44.561
We'll see who's rejected then!

1122
01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.731
If you're such a genius.

1123
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.776
why do you need me
to make a control panel for you?

1124
01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:09.627
I had such high hopes for you. my dear.

1125
01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:13.006
You were going to have the honor...
of being my apprentice.

1126
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:17.218
but it turns out you're just
like all the rest of them. aren't you?

1127
01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:20.179
Ah. well. you've chosen your fate then.

1128
01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:25.226
What button was it again? They all look
the same. just like those bloody puffins.

1129
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.936
Ah. yes. here we are.

1130
01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:28.896
Ta-ta.

1131
01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.108
Ah!

1132
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.030
Jade!

1133
01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.741
Swifty. PB. Lemmy.
What are you doing here?

1134
01:08:39.824 --> 01:08:41.868
We came to save you and stop the walrus.

1135
01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:43.995
Totally failed.

1136
01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:44.912
Are you all right?

1137
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.750
Don't trust her. Swifty.
She works for the walrus. remember?

1138
01:08:48.833 --> 01:08:50.460
I didn't know what I was building! I...

1139
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:54.047
Where was she all those years?
Huh? Off planning with the walrus.

1140
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:55.256
Hm.

1141
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.674
It's not true.

1142
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.261
You don't believe that. do you?

1143
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:04.223
Why did you keep making the parts
for him all the time. Jade?

1144
01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.141
I mean...

1145
01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:07.143
why didn't you clue in?

1146
01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.520
Because I didn't know. Swifty.

1147
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.482
Look. I saw the letters you got from him.

1148
01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:13.399
What?

1149
01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.401
"Rest assured.
your name will go down in history.

1150
01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.695
Jade. world's greatest engineer."

1151
01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.907
He played you. Jade.

1152
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.201
He knew what buttons to push
and you let him.

1153
01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.953
- I'm sorry. If I had known...
- It's okay.

1154
01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:27.914
I get it.

1155
01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.458
That's what I wanted after all.
the same thing.

1156
01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.295
And once I got that in my head.
I couldn't see anything else.

1157
01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:37.507
It's like I had blinders on.
So. yeah. I get it.

1158
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.385
But it's too late now.

1159
01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.303
We're done.

1160
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:43.846
Show's over.

1161
01:09:44.681 --> 01:09:46.057
Curtain's closed.

1162
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.850
How could you say that?

1163
01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.019
'Cause it's true. Look around.

1164
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.022
I am looking around.
And you know what I see?

1165
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.984
That we're trapped in prison
and there's no way out.

1166
01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.153
I see someone who never gave up.

1167
01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.657
Someone who could always turn
a situation around and make it better.

1168
01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:07.662
Someone who has always been optimistic
and positive and hopeful and...

1169
01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:12.750
and sweet. but for some reason
never felt like he was good enough.

1170
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.796
You may not see how great you are.
but I do.

1171
01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.172
I always have.

1172
01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:21.759
I came back for you.

1173
01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.262
What?

1174
01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.264
I can back for you. Swifty.

1175
01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:27.181
For you.

1176
01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:39.694
Aw.

1177
01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.196
That's just beautiful. man.

1178
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.082
Jade!

1179
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.877
- Huh? What?
- What is happening?

1180
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.128
Swifty!

1181
01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.756
Oh!

1182
01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:06.012
Oh! I do love a captive audience.

1183
01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.474
My goodness. is that Magda?

1184
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:13.770
I almost didn't recognize you.
You've aged terribly.

1185
01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:17.106
Magda should have mailed Walrus
to prison years ago.

1186
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.984
Otto von Walrus.
you don't have to do this.

1187
01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:22.779
Oh. but I do. my dear boy.

1188
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:27.408
Now. in case you didn't already think
you were in hot water.

1189
01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:30.661
allow me to be painfully literal.

1190
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:44.133
Good-bye. you fabulous group
of simpletons. Ta-ta.

1191
01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.691
Jade. you okay?

1192
01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:02.693
I'll be better once I get us out of here.

1193
01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:06.948
We still don't trust her.

1194
01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:08.366
But you trust me. right?

1195
01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:09.951
Now. we need to come together.

1196
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:13.037
'cause that's the only way
we're getting out of here. Together.

1197
01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.123
Jade!

1198
01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.377
Ah!

1199
01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.300
Ah...

1200
01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:27.593
Oh...

1201
01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.096
Trust me now?

1202
01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.973
- Yeah. pretty much.
- Okay. yeah. that'll do.

1203
01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.019
Everyone out. Let's go.

1204
01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:38.938
All aboard!

1205
01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.524
Careful with the antlers.

1206
01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.486
PB. can you throw us up there?

1207
01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:46.821
Wah!

1208
01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:48.197
Whoa!

1209
01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.995
I can't do this.

1210
01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.664
PB. come on.
You can do this. Jump.

1211
01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:57.748
Oh...

1212
01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.044
You're right.
There's no way you can do this.

1213
01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.797
Reverse psychology. Nice.

1214
01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:12.805
Someone has to turn off
the controls up there.

1215
01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:15.808
Lemmy. fly.

1216
01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.227
What? Oh. Excuse me.

1217
01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:22.189
No. not that fly. You're the only one
who can get the controls.

1218
01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:23.524
You have to fly.

1219
01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:24.901
Oh. man.

1220
01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.236
I'm afraid of heights.

1221
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.947
We need you. Lemmy.
We need you to fly.

1222
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.616
Plus. this'll help.

1223
01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.534
Oh. hey. wait. It's too far.

1224
01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.411
I'll never make it.

1225
01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.538
You can do it. You know you can.

1226
01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.333
Okay.

1227
01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.251
- <i>Bon voyage.</i>
- Ah!

1228
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.423
Huh?

1229
01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.218
Look at me!

1230
01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:54.639
Look at me. Ma. I'm flying!

1231
01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:55.973
Pull the lever.

1232
01:13:58.935 --> 01:13:59.936
All right.

1233
01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.271
Lemmy!

1234
01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.483
Oops. Wrong way.Sorry.

1235
01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:12.114
No. Lemmy!

1236
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:20.039
I see all systems are a-go.
And how are our guests doing?

1237
01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.669
Screams of agony. Wonderful.

1238
01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:29.340
Looks like Taigasville
is in for a floody good time.

1239
01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.438
Stop. stop. stop!

1240
01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:55.282
How about that. guys?

1241
01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.451
Perfect landing.

1242
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.663
Listen. I put a self-destruct
in the control panel.

1243
01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:01.914
All right. Jade!

1244
01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:04.792
All I have to do is trigger
the self-destruct with this remote.

1245
01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:09.463
Oh. no. it must have fallen into the water
when I jumped out of the cage.

1246
01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:11.757
Anybody want to go for swim?

1247
01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.884
Is there any other way
to trigger the self-destruct?

1248
01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.553
Well. yes. but...

1249
01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.013
But what? What is it?

1250
01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.472
You have to do it manually.

1251
01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:19.724
Okay. how? Where's the panel?

1252
01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:21.851
- On top of the drill.
- Which...

1253
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.561
Will then self destruct.

1254
01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.607
Okay. Just help me get to that drill.

1255
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.284
There's something you don't see every day.

1256
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:48.294
I love a good turnout.

1257
01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:50.755
Time to break the ice.

1258
01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:44.016
Citizens of Taigasville.
if I might have your attention.

1259
01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.436
Drum roll. please.

1260
01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.940
It's just an expression.

1261
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:52.775
Where was I?

1262
01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:58.989
Oh. yes. The good news is
I'm here to unleash the devastating power

1263
01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:03.702
of an ancient gas
buried deep beneath Taigasville.

1264
01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:06.288
The bad news is...

1265
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.624
I'll have to destroy your town
to get at it.

1266
01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:09.542
No!

1267
01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.085
Chins up. everyone.

1268
01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:26.058
<i>Five minutes to impact.</i>

1269
01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:29.228
Yes. very nice. Jolly good.
Jolly. jolly good.

1270
01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:33.274
Whoa.

1271
01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.194
We've got to hurry. Let's go.

1272
01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:41.198
I hope you've all
been practicing your doggy paddle.

1273
01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:46.787
<i>Four minutes to impact.</i>

1274
01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.039
Ah. Shouldn't be long now.

1275
01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.959
Oh. what is it?

1276
01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:54.879
Oh. for pete's sake.

1277
01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:58.174
Will someone please take care of them
once and for all?

1278
01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.188
Get him. yeah.

1279
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.106
Oh. wonderful. Thank you.

1280
01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:17.693
We need to find a clear path to the drill.
We're pinned down here.

1281
01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:19.111
It's all good. bro.

1282
01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.363
I don't think we're...

1283
01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.407
stuck.

1284
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.701
If we move at all. they will see us.

1285
01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.286
Let me double-check.

1286
01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:31.999
They saw me.

1287
01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.586
- They won't see me.
- Uh...

1288
01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.006
Where's his clothes?

1289
01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:40.758
Yeah. let's go streaking.

1290
01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.426
No. no. Lemmy. Watch.

1291
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:49.558
Yeah.

1292
01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:53.604
Swifty. this is crazy. I can't let you
do this. You could be killed.

1293
01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:55.105
- I have to. Jade.
- You don't.

1294
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:57.358
Look. there's no other way.
and you know it.

1295
01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.276
I'm the only one who has a chance.

1296
01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.654
Look. I'm still gonna need some help
getting to that drill.

1297
01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:02.988
Magda clear way.

1298
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:11.247
Magda with Special Forces. lifetime ago.

1299
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.414
Yeah.

1300
01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.171
Get ready.

1301
01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:20.089
On my mark.

1302
01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.762
Jade. tell me what I need to do again.

1303
01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.348
Pull the surge capacitor.
third from the bottom right.

1304
01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.641
Right from the bottom third.

1305
01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.310
- Third from the bottom right.
- Third from the right from the bottom.

1306
01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.187
- No!
- The red one.

1307
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.146
Red one. Got it.

1308
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.231
- Swifty.
- What?

1309
01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.818
It's going to start coming apart.
so get off that rig as soon as you can.

1310
01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:41.986
I hear you.

1311

- Swifty.
- What?

1312
01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:52.955
Um. guys.

1313
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.374
I'll see you soon.

1314
01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:56.500
Charge!

1315
01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.546
Bring it to Magda. puffin scum!

1316
01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.719
Sorry!

1317
01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:13.767
Yeah!

1318

Whoo-hoo!

1319

Ooh!

Going up.

Yeah!

1323
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.642
Stop him!

1324
01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:09.782
Duke!

1325
01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.075
Arctic strong!

1326
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:15.913
Ah!

1327
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.127
Do your thing. Top Dog.

1328
01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.697
- Special delivery.
- Wah!

1329
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.866
You!

1330
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.702
I'll make a rug out of your hide.

1331
01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.165
Stop that naked jackaninny!

1332
01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.716
<i>One minute to impact.</i>

1333
01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.220
Yah!

1334
01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.105
<i>Forty seconds to impact.</i>

1335
01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:28.360
Ah!

1336
01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.782
No!

1337

Take that. That. you...

1338
01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:44.168
<i>Twenty seconds to impact.</i>

1339
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.211
You can't stop me.

1340
01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:48.213
Ah!

1341
01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:56.555
- <i>Ten seconds to impact.</i>
- Where'd he go?

1342
01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.062
<i>Two seconds.</i>

1343
01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:07.107
No!

1344
01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.194
He did it!

1345
01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.575
Swifty. get off of there!

1346
01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:19.369
Whoa! It's going to blow!

1347
01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.288
Swifty.

1348
01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:22.456
Help me.

1349
01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:26.418
Don't leave me here. please.

1350
01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:29.922
Here.

1351
01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.965
Thank you...

1352
01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:33.800
for being an idiot!

1353
01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.346
Ah!

1354
01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:41.183
Swifty!

1355
01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.770
Puffins. it's time for my escape.
Let's go.

1356
01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.606
Come and get me. you little freaks.

1357
01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:49.483
Where are you?

1358
01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:52.444
Swifty! Oh. no.

1359
01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:21.348
Oh. there you are.

1360
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:25.143
Listen. puffins. I know
it doesn't look good. but it's not over.

1361
01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.229
We can still win this.

1362
01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:30.274
True. everything's been destroyed.
but that doesn't mean

1363
01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:33.485
we can't keep on fighting on and on

1364
01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:36.321
and start over and...

1365
01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:50.794
All right. guys.
that's it. We're out of here.

1366
01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.839
You can talk!

1367
01:24:54.172 --> 01:25:00.095
Come! Come back.
I order you to come back this instant!

1368
01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:02.931
Please?

1369
01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.059
Please!

1370
01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:14.610
Oh! Hello. angry mob of townsfolk.

1371
01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.278
How are we today?

1372
01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.072
Nice to see you're not converging
on me to do...

1373
01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:21.366
Oh. I see. you are converging on me.

1374
01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.619
Uh. well. I...

1375
01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.790
Swifty. where are you?

1376
01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:31.001
Swifty!

1377
01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.296
Swifty.

1378
01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.675
Thank goodness you're alive.

1379
01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:41.011
But I'm blind.

1380
01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:42.054
I'm blind!

1381
01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:47.726
Ah! I'm not blind.

1382
01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:49.394
I can see.

1383
01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:52.230
Look at... Look. I can see. Ow!

1384
01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:53.565
We did it.

1385
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:55.484
We did. didn't we?

1386
01:25:58.987 --> 01:25:59.863
Oh!

1387
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.906
Sorry.

1388
01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:01.823
That's okay.

1389
01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.998
Hey. Swifty.
You're the best Top Dog ever.

1390
01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.043
You know what?
I'm no Top Dog.

1391
01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:14.961
I'm just a fox.

1392
01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.717
- Yeah!
- It's streaking time. dudes.

1393
01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.053
Yeah.

1394
01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:28.141
All right. Yeah!

1395
01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.689
<i>After that.
Magda actually allowed me</i>

1396
01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:36.400
<i>to make some changes around the old ABDS.</i>

1397
01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:42.114
<i>PB became
the health and wellness supervisor</i>

1398
01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.991
<i>and that helped boost
employee morale through the roof.</i>

1399
01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:55.711
<i>Now that Lemmy was flying free. he became
a one-man centralized processing system.</i>

1400
01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:56.670
Whoa!

1401
01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:57.838
<i>Oh. look at him go.</i>

1402
01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.382
<i>And Bertha and Leo?</i>

1403
01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.884
<i>Well. they were
natural safety and security officers.</i>

1404
01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:14.938
<i>But the one I am most proud of
is the new fleet.</i>

1405
01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:19.109
<i>Now anyone can be Top Animal.
not just dogs.</i>

1406
01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:22.028
<i>because everyone has something unique
and special to offer.</i>

1407
01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.072
Who's ready
for some serious rock climbing?

1408
01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:26.158
That's what I was born to do. boss.

1409
01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:28.869
Hey. looking good. guys.

1410
01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:33.623
I know none of these will get
crushed now with you on the job.

1411
01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:35.083
You can count on me.

1412
01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.336
<i>And as for the Top Dogs?</i>
