00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:16.416
Hurry up!

2
00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:17.751
I'm going as fast as I can.

3
00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.619
No. you're not. You're milking
it to piss me off.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.354
You're so paranoid.

5
00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.255
Come on.

6
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.870
Whoo!

7
00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:43.076
Slow down!

8
00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:44.843
Come on.

9
00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:48.214
Whoo! Baby!

10
00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.549
How's it handle?

11
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.352
Steering's mushy. front end alignment's
soft. and RPMs are running a bit hot.

12
00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:54.387
My God. You're such a nerd.

13
00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.221
Pull over. I want to drive.

14
00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.423
Forget it.

15
00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:57.757
I stole it. I get to drive it.

16
00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.891
Come on. Em.
You always get to drive it.

17
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:03.695
But this is really fun.

18
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.137
- Crap.
- Just pull over.

19
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.439
It's okay. it's okay.
We'll be fine.

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.707
We're in a stolen car.

21
00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.725
It's fine. okay?
Trust me.

22
00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:18.943
I've talked my way out of
worse situations. Don't worry.

23
00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:24.317
There's something
I didn't tell you.

24
00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.618
I don't actually have
my driver's license.

25
00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.919
What?

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.221
My mom wouldn't even let me
take the test.

27
00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:29.522
She's scared I'll die
in a crash.

28
00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.123
Em. my God.
Are you kidding me right now?

29
00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:34.394
I've got possible suspects.

30
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:35.661
What do we do?

31
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.362
Hang on.

32
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.366
Hey! Hey! Hey!

33
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.437
My God.

34
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.955
Holy crap.

35
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.827
I don't see them.

36
00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.494
Em. where are we going to go?

37
00:02:10.498 --> 00:02:11.763
Hang on.

38
00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.559
That was awesome.

39
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.860
Yeah. I'm glad you liked it.

40
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.162
because we are so not
doing that again.

41
00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:43.663
Yeah. right. Where have I
heard that before?

42
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.499
I'm serious. Max!
No more joyriding.

43
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.202
Okay. Jeez.
Bite my head off.

44
00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.803
Can't a girl just have
a little fun?

45
00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:08.720
I'm sorry she's
still in pieces. Dad.

46
00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.858
Parts cost money and
minimum wage sucks.

47
00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:15.861
Maybe you should ask
for more shifts.

48
00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.499
They can barely afford to
keep me on as it is.

49
00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.470
Maybe you should
look for a better job.

50
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:27.840
I need a car for a better job.
and a driver's license.

51
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:29.674
Nice try.

52
00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:32.445
Is there something you
want to tell me?

53
00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.813
Like how awesome of
a mom you are?

54
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.350
It's a school night. Em.

55
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.501
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

56
00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:41.654
Yeah. right. Well. I don't know
where you and Max go every night

57
00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.490
but a little bit more
focus on the future

58
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.057
wouldn't hurt either of you.

59
00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:48.927
Come on. don't you
have homework or something?

60
00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.929
I already did it.

61
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.117
All right.

62
00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:57.669
Well. just call next time
so I'm not worrying.

63
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.773
Deal.
Anything else?

64
00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:04.109
Yeah. Get your butt in bed.
it's almost 11.

65
00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:16.633
<b>watch movies and series
w w w . p i t k i n i . c o m</b>

66
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.485
Miss Wheeler. can I have a word?

67
00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:48.488
What?

68
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.357
First of all. you
can drop the attitude.

69
00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:52.708
Second of all.

70
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.060
you're supposed to be
on the machine press today.

71
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.895
You have a project
due. remember?

72
00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:58.064
You said I could
do engines first.

73
00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.000
When you're
done your other work.

74
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.436
By the time I get back you
better be well on your way

75
00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:06.037
to a lawn dart. young lady.

76
00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.544
Lawn darts. really?
What a prick.

77
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:16.181
He just resents the fact that
I'm a better mechanic than him.

78
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.518
Really? Are you?

79
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:24.022
You've been here
for what? Two days?

80
00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:26.859
So I forgive you for
not knowing that.

81
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.027
I see.

82
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.531
So you think you're the queen of
this little ant farm?

83
00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.201
What do you say we...
we prove it to you?

84
00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:40.171
Be my guest.

85
00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.610
You're sure you're up for this?

86
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.646
Bring it. new guy.

87
00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:49.615
Okay. neither of these
cars can start without a key.

88
00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:53.051
On your mark. get set...

89
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.221
hotwire!

90
00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:25.651
Yeah! That's the stuff!

91
00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:26.918
Keep going. Keep going.

92
00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:31.590
Car.

93
00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.105
How the hell did you do that?

94
00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:49.107
Powered the starter.

95
00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:51.042
All right.

96
00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:53.813
Thanks.

97
00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:56.482
- I'm Dylan.
- Emily.

98
00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:57.984
Nice ink.

99
00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:00.686
You like? Got that
my first week in juvie.

100
00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:02.622
So that's why I haven't
seen you around.

101
00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:04.924
Yeah.
Not my finest six months.

102
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.561
Six.
What'd you do? Rob a bank?

103
00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:11.896
Do you really have to ask?

104
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:51.670
My God. Is this where
tires come to die?

105
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.906
How did you even
find this place?

106
00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:55.675
An old friend of my
dad's recommended it.

107
00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:57.243
You can find any tire you want.

108
00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.011
Yeah. well. the only thing we're
getting here is the evil eye.

109
00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.682
Hi. I called about
the '70 Dodge Charger.

110
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.519
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
We got that.

111
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.055
- You sure you don't need two?
- I'm good.

112
00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:12.157
- All right.
- Yeah. Here you go.

113
00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.661
Yeah. cash only.

114
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.998
I don't have enough.
Can you spot me?

115
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.200
I'll pay you back as soon as
I get to an ATM.

116
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.668
Em.

117
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.703
Thank you.

118
00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.205
All right.

119
00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:31.042
God. this place is so weird.

120
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.445
- I love it.
- Of course you do.

121
00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.082
Stevie.

122
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.288
You got it. you got it.

123
00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:02.774
Em!

124
00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:07.178
Hey.

125
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.081
- Cool.
- Pleasure doing business.

126
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:11.617
Thanks.

127
00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.084
- You got it?
- Yup.

128
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.157
What?

129
00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:21.561
The VIN number from that car
was missing.

130
00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.562
So?

131
00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.764
So that's illegal.

132
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:25.965
I think that car was stolen

133
00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.767
and they were stripping
it for parts.

134
00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:30.970
Stop. You think Homeboy's
running a chop-shop in there?

135
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:32.772
What do you want to do?
Go get our money back?

136
00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:34.874
No. It'll be twice as much
anywhere else.

137
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.441
Let's just go.

138
00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.879
You sure you don't want
to drop off a resume?

139
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.147
Funny. Ha-ha!

140
00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.703
Hey! I'm so sorry I'm late.

141
00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:05.254
The bus driver wouldn't
wait for me

142
00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:07.255
and then I had to take a cab
and there was traffic.

143
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.975
What?

144
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.481
"Things are tight"?

145
00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:19.534
Really?

146
00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:20.735
You're like her best employee.

147
00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:23.356
My mom will be happy.

148
00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:25.257
She wanted me to get
a better job anyway.

149
00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.559
Like what?
Stocking boxes?

150
00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:31.130
Maybe you could
scrape gum off of

151
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.632
the bleachers at school.

152
00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.566
Okay. it's not like I have
a lot of options.

153
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.670
I'm making a point.

154
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:40.172
Working more of these
crappy jobs

155
00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:41.774
isn't going to get you anywhere.

156
00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.276
You want me to go back to that
chop-shop. don't you?

157
00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:45.944
Yes. I do.

158
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:51.050
I can't steal cars for money.

159
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.754
We're already stealing cars
for free.

160
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:56.288
Why not get
a little more out of it

161
00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:58.489
other than just a good old
lady boner?

162
00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:01.994
Come on!

163
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.829
What's the worst
that can happen?

164
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.066
We're underage. which means
we're practically untouchable.

165
00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:12.004
If they catch us. we go to
juvie for a few months

166
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.206
and. you know. say hi to your
boyfriend's friends.

167
00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:15.841
Big deal.

168
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.743
Okay. he's not my boyfriend.

169
00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.278
Not yet.

170
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.348
Can we do this?

171
00:11:28.404 --> 00:11:29.987
Just let me do all
the talking. okay?

172
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:34.058
And please. take the stick
out of your butt.

173
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:40.199
I don't think
I heard y'all right.

174
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.566
I think you did.

175
00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:44.870
You trying to play me. girl?

176
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.039
We're just trying to do
a business deal. that's all.

177
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.009
You need inventory.
and let's be real.

178
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.676
you don't really care
where it comes from.

179
00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:53.713
We can help with that.

180
00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:56.648
As long as you're willing
to cut us in.

181
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.622
Y'all either real
stupid or cops.

182
00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.228
And I know y'all ain't no cops.

183
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.329
Right?

184
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.532
Show 'em. Em.

185
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.973
Where is she going?

186
00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:22.341
Just watch. okay?

187
00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.042
No. hold up.

188
00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:25.745
No. seriously. just wait.
Girl. do your thing.

189
00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.413
I ain't got no
time for all of this. man.

190
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.248
Trust me. You're going to want
to see this. okay?

191
00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.350
This is my shop.
You understand that?

192
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.385
- Just give her a second.
- So get you girl out of there.

193
00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:35.286
I ain't got no time.

194
00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:43.428
We should talk about money.

195
00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:49.467
We were thinking a flat fee
of $500 per car to start.

196
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.336
What do you say?

197
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:57.041
Yeah. Okay.

198
00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.331
Hit it. girl!

199
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.399
Let's see how fast
this one can go!

200
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.139
Push it!

201
00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:03.041
Whoo!

202
00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.059
Honey! Dinner.

203
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.427
Wash your hands. okay?

204
00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.461
- Soap.
- Be right there.

205
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.241
How was school today?

206
00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:21.779
I don't know. it's school.
What do you want me to say?

207
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.750
Well. how's the car
coming along?

208
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.519
Spending a lot of time in there.

209
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.590
I think I'm going to have to
rebuild the engine.

210
00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.424
Sounds expensive.

211
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:38.364
Not really.
I can get cheap parts.

212
00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:40.532
For a car like that?
Where?

213
00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:41.732
Scrapyard.

214
00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:44.670
Scrapyard?

215
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.205
I thought the point was
to fix it up.

216
00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:50.508
You don't know anything
about cars. Mom.

217
00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:54.345
That was your father's
area of expertise.

218
00:16:56.483 --> 00:16:58.983
You know I'm not trying
to punish you. right?

219
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.186
Could have fooled me.

220
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:05.691
I just don't want you growing up
thinking that the only thing

221
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.127
that matters in life is how fast
you go from zero to 60.

222
00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:09.811
Do we have to talk about
this right now?

223
00:17:09.812 --> 00:17:11.932
- We never talk about this.
- You never talk about it!

224
00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:15.334
Dad dies in a crash and suddenly
I'm not allowed to do

225
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:17.302
the one thing I actually
want to with my life.

226
00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:18.569
It's not fair. Mom.

227
00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:20.404
Yeah.

228
00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:24.575
Maybe it's not.

229
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:27.311
And maybe you're right.

230
00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.116
Look. I've been doing
some thinking.

231
00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:32.184
I...

232
00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:35.120
I'm going to let you take
a driver's test.

233
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:37.689
but I do not want you
driving too fast.

234
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:42.628
And as long as you get straight
A's this semester.

235
00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:45.697
- Mom.
- And not just in shop class...

236
00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:47.166
Or industrial arts.

237
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.068
Why do grads matter so much?

238
00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.136
You and Dad went to
community college.

239
00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:53.072
Why do you act like if I'm not
on the honour roll.

240
00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.473
then my life is over?

241
00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:55.808
Because your father wanted
the best for you.

242
00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:57.643
He didn't want you living in
the past. in his past.

243
00:17:57.644 --> 00:17:59.844
obsessed with this damn car.

244
00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:02.247
Em! Em!

245
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.781
I didn't...

246
00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:15.026
It is an
impressive presentation.

247
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.497
Your words.

248
00:18:22.836 --> 00:18:26.704
You know. cars are. um.
they're my passion.

249
00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.574
Well. the passion is
certainly on the page.

250
00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.544
Well. I'm glad you think so.

251
00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:39.351
Unfortunately. I just don't
see how exotic car rentals

252
00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:42.987
can generate enough income to
make sense on a balance sheet.

253
00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:48.494
I... I hear you.

254
00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:50.863
I do. Um...

255
00:18:50.864 --> 00:18:53.365
I know that the margins
are not much.

256
00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:55.334
but if you take a close
look at my estimates

257
00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:58.570
you'll see that I've put a lot
of thought into this and -

258
00:18:58.571 --> 00:19:00.172
I ran the numbers. Mr. Curnow.

259
00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:03.642
So did I. So did I.
I... Many times.

260
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:07.579
I ran them twice.
And I'm... I'm sorry

261
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.248
but with your credit history...

262
00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:10.582
Hold on now. I'm working
on that credit history.

263
00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.983
That's something... I'm in
the middle of fixing.

264
00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:17.356
With your current
credit history.

265
00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:20.325
I... I just don't see
how I can help you.

266
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.592
And to be frank.

267
00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:25.896
I don't know of any
bank that would.

268
00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:48.820
I appreciate you time.

269
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:51.422
- Your artwork. Mr. Curnow.
- Yeah.

270
00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.427
Throw that in the trash.

271
00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:46.645
Sure you want to do that?

272
00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:47.779
Do what?

273
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.747
Walk away from me?

274
00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:52.651
Are we flirting?

275
00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:55.687
'Cause I've been away for a
while and I'm a little rusty.

276
00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:56.954
What do you think?

277
00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:02.960
I think if you're not doing
anything Saturday night.

278
00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:05.496
maybe we could hang out.

279
00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.570
Is that a yes?

280
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:13.939
Emily was so good.
She hotwired the car.

281
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.942
Absolutely amazing. Look at
Em. she was going so fast.

282
00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.609
I swear to God.

283
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.847
Mr. Curnow. I'm sorry.

284
00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:24.148
What is so funny that you can't
watch where you're going?

285
00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:26.517
I wasn't a part of it.

286
00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:30.455
You got this. Em! Whoo!

287
00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:33.157
- Go back to class.
- Okay.

288
00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:35.593
Sorry.

289
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.738
Six stolen cars over two weeks.

290
00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:21.972
all within a five mile radius.

291
00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:25.676
We've got a new gang of car
thieves on our hands.

292
00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:31.483
You're joking. right?

293
00:22:31.484 --> 00:22:33.085
Is it really that bad?

294
00:22:33.086 --> 00:22:36.855
Em. I know the military
thing is your look

295
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:39.557
but are you sure you want to
wear that on a date?

296
00:22:40.093 --> 00:22:41.827
It's not a blind date. Max.

297
00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:44.228
He's going to go blind if
he sees you in that.

298
00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:46.898
What time is he
picking you up at?

299
00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:49.101
Actually. I'm picking him up.

300
00:22:49.102 --> 00:22:51.702
In what?
You don't drive.

301
00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:56.007
No. you didn't.

302
00:22:56.008 --> 00:22:58.042
Thought I may as well
make use of it. right?

303
00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:02.114
Okay. I mean. picking up a
rando ex-con's not really

304
00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:03.982
what I had in mind. but...

305
00:23:03.983 --> 00:23:06.283
he will love you in that.

306
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:13.057
Cute. right?

307
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.697
Pfft.

308
00:23:29.008 --> 00:23:30.207
Nice ride.

309
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.076
Going my way?

310
00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:45.991
So there's a rumour
going around school

311
00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:47.758
that you don't have
your license yet.

312
00:23:48.494 --> 00:23:49.893
I don't.

313
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.979
So. this is it.

314
00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:13.350
My favourite spot.
Pretty cool?

315
00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:18.722
Yeah. it's beautiful.

316
00:24:22.028 --> 00:24:24.328
So. you like to drive fast.
Emily Wheeler?

317
00:24:25.498 --> 00:24:27.097
I like speed.

318
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:31.835
Gives me freedom.

319
00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:35.707
- Freedom?
- Yeah.

320
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.644
From... school.

321
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:41.912
my mom...

322
00:24:42.748 --> 00:24:44.014
life.

323
00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:50.954
I like to be the only one
behind the wheel.

324
00:24:51.691 --> 00:24:54.092
So you like to be in control?

325
00:24:54.093 --> 00:24:56.827
And what you have... an
obsession with cars?

326
00:24:58.564 --> 00:25:00.330
It's more of an addiction.

327
00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:02.866
Yeah. I've been down that road.

328
00:25:05.238 --> 00:25:09.373
And I'm going to take a wild
guess that this isn't yours.

329
00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:13.844
Nope.

330
00:25:15.748 --> 00:25:17.181
Then whose?

331
00:25:17.984 --> 00:25:20.050
I didn't get their name.

332
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.257
I thought you'd be impressed.

333
00:25:29.377 --> 00:25:31.894
Look. you get that I was in
juvie for auto theft. right?

334
00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:36.268
It's okay. I'll have you home
before you turn into a pumpkin.

335
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:38.136
Emily. it's not a joke.

336
00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:40.772
All right. screwing around in
shop class is one thing.

337
00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:43.275
but actually boosting cars.
that almost ruined my life.

338
00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:45.809
Okay. I didn't know you
felt that way.

339
00:25:46.546 --> 00:25:48.212
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:55.587
Please just tell me this
was a one-time thing.

341
00:25:55.588 --> 00:25:57.421
It was.

342
00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:00.424
It was just a one-time thing.

343
00:26:01.827 --> 00:26:03.260
I promise.

344
00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:10.569
Hey. 'Kay.
you were lying. right?

345
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.870
About not ripping rides anymore?

346
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:13.204
- Yeah.
- Obviously.

347
00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:15.106
Okay. good. because Nestor
just texted me like.

348
00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:16.808
a list of stuff he needed
yesterday.

349
00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:18.310
So. let's hit it
after school. okay?

350
00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:19.777
Okay.

351
00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:31.356
No. there's no way.

352
00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:33.291
You always get to drive.
'm driving my own car.

353
00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:35.559
- Fine.
- All right. let's go.

354
00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:04.221
Stop the car.

355
00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:19.503
That's the one.

356
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.290
Wait here.

357
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:24.041
Okay.
Hurry it up.

358
00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:49.867
Mr. Curnow?

359
00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:52.135
Hello. Max.

360
00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:56.240
What are you doing here?

361
00:27:57.877 --> 00:27:59.377
I would ask you
the same question

362
00:27:59.378 --> 00:28:01.178
but I think I know the answer.

363
00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:14.259
You going for a joyride?

364
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.194
It's my cousin's car.
He left his keys inside.

365
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:17.729
I was just helping him.

366
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.330
Save your breath. Miss Wheeler.

367
00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:21.700
You can either talk to the
police or you can talk to me

368
00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:23.968
and I think you'll be
a lot more interested

369
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.235
in what I have to say.

370
00:28:31.744 --> 00:28:33.344
Max. you're going to
take me to my car

371
00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.312
and then you two
are going to follow me.

372
00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:32.235
Didn't know you were a farmer.

373
00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:35.140
Nobody farms anymore.

374
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:38.810
Been trying to sell this dump
since my Pop kicked the bucket.

375
00:29:38.811 --> 00:29:41.278
So what are we doing here?

376
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:46.451
Coming to a mutually beneficial
arrangement. I hope.

377
00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:48.186
We already have one of those.

378
00:29:48.187 --> 00:29:49.988
Let me guess.

379
00:29:49.989 --> 00:29:53.490
you two boost cars that are
easy to steal. yeah?

380
00:29:54.827 --> 00:29:57.796
Your silent partner
pays you a pittance

381
00:29:57.797 --> 00:29:59.164
while turning around
and making a mint

382
00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:02.032
stripping them for parts.
How'd I do?

383
00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:06.805
Ladies. that is a sucker's game.

384
00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:09.439
There are bigger fish
out there; much bigger.

385
00:30:10.176 --> 00:30:11.976
We're not interested.

386
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:13.478
Maybe I wasn't clear.

387
00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:16.114
Either come and work for me.

388
00:30:16.115 --> 00:30:17.949
or spend the rest
of your teen years

389
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.617
making licence plates
in county lock-up.

390
00:30:21.353 --> 00:30:22.921
Maybe we should
hear him out. Em.

391
00:30:22.922 --> 00:30:24.122
Listen to your friend.

392
00:30:24.123 --> 00:30:25.957
I already know
what he's gonna say.

393
00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:28.025
He wants us to go
after luxury models.

394
00:30:28.494 --> 00:30:31.429
That is exactly
what I'm going to say.

395
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.899
But those cars all have
that smart-key system thing.

396
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.434
I thought they were. like.
impossible to steal.

397
00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.102
Not impossible. Just risky.

398
00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:40.537
With great
risk comes great reward.

399
00:30:41.273 --> 00:30:43.007
You're talking about
a relay station attack?

400
00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:44.576
Yes. Yes. I am.

401
00:30:44.577 --> 00:30:46.311
What's a relay station attack?

402
00:30:46.312 --> 00:30:48.313
That is a good question.

403
00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:51.381
Smart keys use RFID.

404
00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:54.252
Radio frequency identification.

405
00:30:54.253 --> 00:30:56.154
It is the same tech
that allows you

406
00:30:56.155 --> 00:30:59.023
to buy anything with
the tap of a credit card.

407
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:00.959
Now. the trick is

408
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.262
making the car think
that you are the owner.

409
00:31:04.263 --> 00:31:05.597
So. how do we do that?

410
00:31:05.598 --> 00:31:06.865
You need two people.

411
00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:09.466
Miss Wheeler is correct.

412
00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.369
Allow me to demonstrate.

413
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.171
Let's say that you
were the owner.

414
00:31:13.172 --> 00:31:15.540
Miss Wheeler.
you will be our thief.

415
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:18.475
Take this. Come with me.
Stand here.

416
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.948
Now. in order to trick the car

417
00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:25.383
into thinking that Miss Wheeler

418
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:27.285
has a legitimate key.

419
00:31:27.286 --> 00:31:29.420
I have to get
close enough to you

420
00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:32.222
to ping your fob with this.

421
00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:36.159
The closer. the better.

422
00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:40.098
Disco.

423
00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:42.433
Once I've captured
the car's unique signal.

424
00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:44.135
I then transmit it
to my accomplice.

425
00:31:44.136 --> 00:31:45.569
Press the button.

426
00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:47.237
Go ahead.

427
00:31:48.274 --> 00:31:49.641
There it is.

428
00:31:49.642 --> 00:31:51.910
Allowing her access to
the vehicle. yeah?

429
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:53.210
Hop in.

430
00:31:56.015 --> 00:32:00.151
Now. since most new cars
have keyless ignition

431
00:32:00.152 --> 00:32:01.885
as well as keyless entry.

432
00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.621
once you're past the security
system. starting the engine

433
00:32:03.622 --> 00:32:05.356
is simply a matter of
pushing a button.

434
00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:06.623
Go ahead.

435
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.634
Yeah.

436
00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:18.835
So. what do you say.
Miss Wheeler?

437
00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:21.838
Are you ready to play
in the big leagues?

438
00:32:53.405 --> 00:32:55.639
- That's it.
- She's a beaut.

439
00:33:05.184 --> 00:33:06.783
Okay.

440
00:33:08.087 --> 00:33:09.286
Who's going to do this?

441
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:11.255
Rock. paper. scissors?

442
00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:13.390
Okay.

443
00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:20.098
All right.
Here you go.

444
00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:21.032
Thank you.

445
00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:24.168
I can do this.

446
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:25.602
Okay. okay.

447
00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:40.851
Very well.
How are you?

448
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.186
- Good. thank you.
- Reservation this evening?

449
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:43.253
Yeah. For two.

450
00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:44.654
- Under what name?
- Under Williams.

451
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.524
Mina will show you
to your table.

452
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.434
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

453
00:33:56.435 --> 00:33:57.602
'Evening. folks.

454
00:33:57.603 --> 00:33:59.803
Reservations
for McDonald. please.

455
00:34:06.745 --> 00:34:09.746
Come on. Come on. Max.

456
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.457
Come on. Please work.

457
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:29.933
How can I help you. ma'am?

458
00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:38.808
Hey. excuse me.
Which way is...

459
00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:42.746
Just a second.

460
00:34:43.515 --> 00:34:44.549
Come on.

461
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.683
Come on. come on. come on.

462
00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:02.332
I'm sorry. My lunch date
actually just cancelled.

463
00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:06.770
Yes!

464
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:20.617
It worked!

465
00:35:38.904 --> 00:35:40.805
Now. this?

466
00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:42.840
This is a car.

467
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:44.142
Glad you're happy.

468
00:35:44.143 --> 00:35:45.209
Where's our money?

469
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.513
As soon as I land a buyer.
you will get your cut.

470
00:35:48.514 --> 00:35:49.780
That wasn't the deal.

471
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:51.514
Yeah. What are you
trying to pull?

472
00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.116
Don't do that.

473
00:35:55.654 --> 00:35:57.722
I'm not trying to pull anything.

474
00:35:57.723 --> 00:35:59.557
Do you think that
I'd be doing this

475
00:35:59.558 --> 00:36:01.858
if I had that kind of
cash lying around?

476
00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:05.895
You get paid when I get paid.

477
00:36:11.537 --> 00:36:13.271
And ladies?

478
00:36:13.272 --> 00:36:15.606
I see a lot of empty
space here. right?

479
00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:19.644
A successful business
needs inventory. right?

480
00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:22.946
Now is not the time
to rest on our laurels.

481
00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:26.551
Now. help me cover this up.

482
00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:30.820
That right there.
Get these. in good shape.

483
00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:39.175
What?

484
00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:41.144
Something came for you.

485
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.051
Parts for your dad's car?

486
00:39:47.052 --> 00:39:48.052
Yeah.

487
00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:53.391
Express delivery from Canada.
That can't have been cheap.

488
00:39:53.392 --> 00:39:54.558
Couldn't find it anywhere else.

489
00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.927
You can afford that on what
they pay you at the mall?

490
00:39:58.663 --> 00:40:00.930
- I asked for a raise.
- Really?

491
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.568
'Cause you said they could
barely afford to keep you on.

492
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:06.437
I'm doing some extra work

493
00:40:06.438 --> 00:40:09.272
for Mr. Curnow.
my industrial arts teacher.

494
00:40:10.175 --> 00:40:13.544
- What kind of extra work?
- Farming.

495
00:40:13.545 --> 00:40:15.178
- Farming?
- Yep.

496
00:40:16.148 --> 00:40:17.614
He has a farm.

497
00:40:18.116 --> 00:40:19.917
Out on Gibson Road.

498
00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:22.119
I mean. it hasn't been used
in. like. ever.

499
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.588
So. me and some other kids
are clearing out some junk

500
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:26.524
and cleaning it up.
There's an old racer. too.

501
00:40:26.525 --> 00:40:28.257
so I've been helping him
with that.

502
00:40:29.194 --> 00:40:31.260
And. yeah. He's giving
me extra credit.

503
00:40:34.115 --> 00:40:34.732
So. he's giving you extra credit

504
00:40:34.733 --> 00:40:37.902
and enough money
to buy rare parts

505
00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:40.704
for a vintage Dodge Charger?

506
00:40:40.705 --> 00:40:43.808
Okay. Mom. Look. I should
have told you earlier.

507
00:40:43.809 --> 00:40:46.075
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

508
00:40:48.647 --> 00:40:51.414
Listen. Can I go? I have a
trig test to study for.

509
00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:54.050
Yeah.

510
00:40:58.523 --> 00:41:00.089
God.

511
00:41:07.899 --> 00:41:10.201
- Hey.
- Hey.

512
00:41:10.202 --> 00:41:11.836
How you doing?
Door was open.

513
00:41:11.837 --> 00:41:13.471
Thought I'd
drop by. Hope you don't mind.

514
00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:15.071
No. Of course not.

515
00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:18.209
So. this is your baby?

516
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.011
Yep. That's her.

517
00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:22.813
And you're gonna
restore her all by yourself?

518
00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:25.950
Well. my dad always said
we'd do it together.

519
00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:27.750
He's gone. so...

520
00:41:28.787 --> 00:41:30.888
Yeah. Mine wasn't
around much. either.

521
00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:33.557
But hey. at least you had him in
your life as long as you did.

522
00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:37.794
- Yeah. I guess.
- What's the package?

523
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.296
Parts.

524
00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.533
Cool.

525
00:41:42.534 --> 00:41:44.235
You want help installing them?

526
00:41:44.236 --> 00:41:46.737
Um. you know. you really
don't have to do that.

527
00:41:46.738 --> 00:41:48.337
Well. I want to.

528
00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:51.709
I appreciate the offer. but...

529
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.780
Look. I thought things
were going well with us.

530
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:57.980
They are.

531
00:41:59.084 --> 00:42:00.918
All right. well. I know
my way around an engine.

532
00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:02.351
so what's the problem?

533
00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:06.155
It's just something
I have to do myself.

534
00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:09.593
Does that make sense?

535
00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:11.161
Yeah.

536
00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:12.730
Totally.

537
00:42:12.731 --> 00:42:14.932
Um. well. how about
I take you out tonight?

538
00:42:14.933 --> 00:42:16.834
I told my mom I have to study.

539
00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:18.269
Okay. After that?

540
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.870
It's a school night.
I'm beat.

541
00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.071
Okay.
The weekend. then?

542
00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:22.773
I promise I won't
help you with the car.

543
00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:24.041
Well. me and Max have a thing.

544
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:25.676
A thing? What thing?

545
00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:27.711
A girl thing.

546
00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:30.281
Yeah. You guys are really
attached at the hip?

547
00:42:30.282 --> 00:42:32.950
I know. and I'm sorry.

548
00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:35.518
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

549
00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.760
Okay. Well.
I will see you later. then.

550
00:42:42.761 --> 00:42:43.961
I'll call you.

551
00:42:43.962 --> 00:42:45.528
Okay.

552
00:43:00.845 --> 00:43:02.279
That he. embraced.

553
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.114
And every single line
that he wrote...

554
00:43:07.052 --> 00:43:10.920
Is to know the AABBAA...

555
00:43:15.727 --> 00:43:17.861
Where the hell are you two?

556
00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:21.332
I been hearing rumours.
and not the good kind.

557
00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:23.299
Hit me back when you get this.

558
00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:28.204
Mr. Baines?

559
00:43:30.008 --> 00:43:32.542
Detective Torres.
auto theft division.

560
00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:35.578
Can I have a moment
of your time?

561
00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.085
All right.
Catch you guys later.

562
00:43:56.334 --> 00:43:59.136
Dylan? Nice to
see you again.

563
00:43:59.137 --> 00:44:01.672
Detective. what...
What are you doing here?

564
00:44:01.673 --> 00:44:04.308
I just wanted a moment
of your time.

565
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:06.276
Can we chat?

566
00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:08.345
Sure.

567
00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:10.012
Yeah.

568
00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.659
Principal Moss tells me
you've been adjusting well.

569
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.993
That's good to hear.

570
00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:25.796
Hey. No one is happier
to be out than me.

571
00:44:25.797 --> 00:44:27.063
I believe it.

572
00:44:28.967 --> 00:44:31.868
So. why are we having
this conversation?

573
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.220
I've got a problem.

574
00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:36.371
I thought you might be able
to shed some light on it.

575
00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:40.343
What kind of problem?

576
00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.745
Someone is boosting luxury cars.

577
00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:42.980
the kind with
rich and powerful owners

578
00:44:42.981 --> 00:44:44.248
who have pull down at city hall.

579
00:44:44.249 --> 00:44:45.349
You think I'm involved?

580
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.152
Maybe. Not directly.

581
00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:50.120
We have witnesses who put
the same teenage girl

582
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:52.156
at three of the scenes.

583
00:44:52.157 --> 00:44:54.058
I believe she has
at least one accomplice.

584
00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:56.760
also female.
probably the same age.

585
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:58.796
I don't know anything
about that.

586
00:44:58.797 --> 00:45:01.297
Like I said. I really
don't want to go back in.

587
00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:03.033
I bet you don't.

588
00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:06.003
Because the next time
I catch you

589
00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:07.971
in the same zip code
as a stolen car.

590
00:45:07.972 --> 00:45:10.573
it won't be pretend prison.
It'll be the real thing.

591
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:15.478
I don't know who stole
those cars. detective.

592
00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:17.647
I swear to God.

593
00:45:18.817 --> 00:45:21.417
Well. then. I guess we're done.

594
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.054
If you hear anything.

595
00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:26.188
don't hesitate
to give me a call.

596
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.969
Emily?

597
00:45:40.839 --> 00:45:43.140
Emily?
Hey.

598
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:44.941
Look.
I need to talk to you.

599
00:45:52.884 --> 00:45:54.218
So. that car the other day.

600
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:56.220
that wasn't a one-time
thing. was it?

601
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:58.255
- Look. Dylan...
- Don't try and deny it.

602
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.791
The cops just finished
grilling me.

603
00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:03.192
They are on to you. Em.
You and Max.

604
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:06.663
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

605
00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.499
But they have witnesses. What if
they put you in a line-up?

606
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.334
I mean. we're just guesses.

607
00:46:10.335 --> 00:46:11.968
You think that that matters?

608
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:14.872
Man. you're so naive.

609
00:46:14.873 --> 00:46:16.540
Okay. look.
It's not that simple.

610
00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:18.242
There's someone else involved.

611
00:46:18.243 --> 00:46:21.011
- Who?
- Curnow.

612
00:46:21.012 --> 00:46:23.514
Industrial arts teacher Curnow?

613
00:46:23.515 --> 00:46:25.549
He found out what we're doing.
I don't know how.

614
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.785
and he's blackmailing us
to steal for him.

615
00:46:27.786 --> 00:46:31.121
You got to get out now.
before it ends badly.

616
00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.388
Trust me.

617
00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:35.324
I have to talk to Max.

618
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.570
Mr. Curnow?

619
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:05.022
- That's right.
- Hi. I'm Gail Wheeler.

620
00:47:05.023 --> 00:47:06.455
I'm Emily's mom.

621
00:47:08.026 --> 00:47:09.326
I'm sorry to just pop
by like this.

622
00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:11.562
Your secretary said
you might be in.

623
00:47:11.563 --> 00:47:13.195
Come on in.

624
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:18.869
What can I do for you.
Miss Wheeler?

625
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.172
Um. this might seem like
an odd question.

626
00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:25.775
but do you own a farm
out on Gibson Road?

627
00:47:27.045 --> 00:47:29.211
I have a few acres.
Why do you ask?

628
00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:33.150
My daughter said that she
was working for you.

629
00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:36.052
I just wanted to make sure
she wasn't full of it.

630
00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:38.889
Well. she's not exactly
tilling the fields.

631
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.523
if that's what she told you.

632
00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.528
Well. she mentioned she
was working on an old car.

633
00:47:44.529 --> 00:47:48.532
That's right.
I'm a. collector.

634
00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:51.435
Um. just more of a hobby
than anything else.

635
00:47:51.436 --> 00:47:54.437
I don't expect to be making
any... any money from it.

636
00:47:55.273 --> 00:47:56.539
I see.

637
00:47:57.108 --> 00:48:00.510
Well. speaking of money.

638
00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:02.579
can I ask how much
you're paying her?

639
00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.115
What did she tell you
I was paying her?

640
00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:09.251
Well. enough to buy expensive
car parts. apparently.

641
00:48:10.255 --> 00:48:12.189
I'm sure you're aware of
her obsession with cars?

642
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.124
I am well aware.

643
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:15.791
Your daughter
is quite the mechanic.

644
00:48:16.895 --> 00:48:18.362
Truth be told.
she's my best student.

645
00:48:18.363 --> 00:48:21.431
I'm only here temporarily until
they find someone permanent.

646
00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:23.033
but she's my favourite.

647
00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:24.101
That's good to hear.

648
00:48:24.102 --> 00:48:25.502
It just doesn't answer
my question.

649
00:48:25.503 --> 00:48:27.004
I'm sorry that your daughter

650
00:48:27.005 --> 00:48:28.538
is having trouble
managing her money.

651
00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:31.841
I'm just not quite sure
what it has to do with me.

652
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:35.512
Well. I guess my concern is that

653
00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:37.613
she's spending a lot
of time out there.

654
00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:40.484
and she might be
neglecting her schoolwork.

655
00:48:40.485 --> 00:48:43.219
I would never let this
interfere with her education.

656
00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:45.972
Miss Wheeler.

657
00:48:45.973 --> 00:48:47.523
In fact. she's earning
extra credits.

658
00:48:48.426 --> 00:48:49.625
I see.

659
00:48:50.128 --> 00:48:51.929
I'm sorry. I've got to run.

660
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.363
I've got a conference call
in a few minutes.

661
00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:54.797
Can I walk you out?

662
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.501
No. it's okay. I'm good.

663
00:48:57.502 --> 00:48:59.802
I insist.
Just to the door.

664
00:49:00.605 --> 00:49:02.306
Okay.

665
00:49:02.307 --> 00:49:04.141
I appreciate you coming by
and talking to me.

666
00:49:04.142 --> 00:49:06.610
Well. it's nice
to finally meet you.

667
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:09.212
Absolutely. absolutely.
Enjoy the rest of your day.

668
00:49:09.213 --> 00:49:11.480
- Okay?
- And you as well.

669
00:49:11.504 --> 00:49:20.104
<b>watch movies and series
w w w . p i t k i n i . c o m</b>

670
00:49:45.249 --> 00:49:46.249
No.

671
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.317
No?

672
00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:48.768
If they were onto us.

673
00:49:48.769 --> 00:49:50.220
they would've brought us in for
questioning already.

674
00:49:50.221 --> 00:49:52.254
Well. you really want to
take that chance?

675
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.492
Look. Max.
I know this detective.

676
00:49:55.493 --> 00:49:57.060
She's a hard-ass
with half the judges

677
00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:58.328
in the state
on her speed-dial.

678
00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.163
You guys will be tried
as adults.

679
00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:03.300
This isn't just about a few
months in juvie anymore. Max.

680
00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:05.268
We need to talk to Curnow.
Maybe he can do something.

681
00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:08.737
- Like what. Em?
- I don't know.

682
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.341
Damn it.

683
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:13.243
If we had just stuck to
the original plan...

684
00:50:13.244 --> 00:50:15.078
Low-profile cars.
selling them for parts...

685
00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:17.147
We wouldn't be
in this stupid mess.

686
00:50:17.148 --> 00:50:19.748
Look. We just need to tell
him that we're out.

687
00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:24.420
Just there.

688
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:26.956
Thank you.

689
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.627
You two are hard to track down.

690
00:50:34.465 --> 00:50:36.799
- Who's this?
- The original plan.

691
00:50:37.702 --> 00:50:40.404
- I don't know you.
- It's okay. He's cool.

692
00:50:40.405 --> 00:50:42.371
It's not okay.
Get lost.

693
00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:53.916
You tell him about me?

694
00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:55.485
No.

695
00:50:56.354 --> 00:50:58.555
And what about this mystery man
that you been

696
00:50:58.556 --> 00:51:00.856
boosting cars for you?
You tell him?

697
00:51:02.493 --> 00:51:04.127
We don't know what
you're talking about.

698
00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:05.394
Shut up.

699
00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:08.430
Now. I thought you were smart.

700
00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:11.600
I guess I was wrong.

701
00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:16.505
You getting way too ambitious.

702
00:51:17.308 --> 00:51:19.775
Bringing heat down
on my business.

703
00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:22.011
I can't have that.

704
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:24.614
Okay. We didn't
know. so...

705
00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:26.415
What did I just say?

706
00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:34.957
Here's the deal.
Now. listen carefully.

707
00:51:36.127 --> 00:51:37.559
It's a one-time offer.

708
00:51:39.163 --> 00:51:40.596
Stop what you're doing.

709
00:51:41.432 --> 00:51:44.300
Go back to your sock hops
and sleepovers.

710
00:51:46.571 --> 00:51:48.438
And if I hear that
you've been dipping

711
00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:51.640
your pretty little toes
back in the pool.

712
00:51:53.244 --> 00:51:54.843
I'm going to chop them off.

713
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.680
You understand?

714
00:52:03.888 --> 00:52:05.489
My God. Damn it. Em.

715
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.158
we really need to
talk to Curnow now.

716
00:52:08.159 --> 00:52:09.758
Okay. Let's go.

717
00:53:15.193 --> 00:53:17.126
Em.

718
00:53:18.196 --> 00:53:20.462
What have you
gotten yourself into?

719
00:53:23.935 --> 00:53:25.401
Miss Wheeler.

720
00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:30.307
If you're looking for
Emily. she's...

721
00:53:30.308 --> 00:53:31.875
She's not here.

722
00:53:31.876 --> 00:53:34.211
Yeah. She. um...
She didn't come home.

723
00:53:34.212 --> 00:53:38.080
I just... figured
she was with you.

724
00:53:41.586 --> 00:53:42.185
I got it.

725
00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:42.786
You know. folks around this way

726
00:53:42.787 --> 00:53:43.954
don't take kindly to people

727
00:53:43.955 --> 00:53:45.989
traipsing around
their property uninvited.

728
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:47.290
I'm sorry.

729
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:49.226
Or peeking where they shouldn't.

730
00:53:49.227 --> 00:53:51.660
No. I didn't
really see anything.

731
00:53:53.231 --> 00:53:54.698
Not even my collection?

732
00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:56.766
Yeah. Well...

733
00:53:56.767 --> 00:53:58.969
Must be expensive.

734
00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.936
Not if you
know the right people.

735
00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:05.641
Like your daughter.
for instance.

736
00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:11.880
So. what is she. your...
on-call mechanic?

737
00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:16.519
More of a partner in crime.

738
00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.622
I'm just going
to see myself out.

739
00:54:18.623 --> 00:54:21.391
- Get...
- Don't move. Relax.

740
00:54:21.392 --> 00:54:23.725
We're just going to have a
conversation inside. okay?

741
00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:25.994
Okay.

742
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:48.685
Anything?

743
00:54:48.686 --> 00:54:49.786
Curnow's still not answering.

744
00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:50.854
Seriously?

745
00:54:50.855 --> 00:54:52.689
We've got to
figure this out. Em.

746
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:54.858
I know. I'll just keep trying.
I'll call you later. okay?

747
00:54:54.859 --> 00:54:56.124
Okay.

I love your taste in cars.

750
00:55:16.347 --> 00:55:19.114
Dukes of Hazzard
changed my life.

751
00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:25.722
What are you doing here?

752
00:55:25.723 --> 00:55:27.457
You are not the only
one who knows

753
00:55:27.458 --> 00:55:30.025
how to bypass a security system.

754
00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:33.996
I've been trying to call you.

755
00:55:34.632 --> 00:55:36.798
I know.
I got your messages.

756
00:55:38.636 --> 00:55:41.104
So. you know about the police?

757
00:55:41.105 --> 00:55:42.706
When you steal
this many luxury cars.

758
00:55:42.707 --> 00:55:44.773
you're bound to
attract attention.

759
00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:47.276
And you're okay with that?

760
00:55:48.746 --> 00:55:50.947
Well. by tonight.
my lot will be empty

761
00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:55.352
and we will both have an extra
zero in our bank accounts.

762
00:55:55.353 --> 00:55:57.954
There's just one more thing
I need you to do.

763
00:55:57.955 --> 00:56:00.123
and then we can go on
our separate ways.

764
00:56:00.124 --> 00:56:01.723
I can't.

765
00:56:02.593 --> 00:56:04.094
Our silent partner found out
what we're doing

766
00:56:04.095 --> 00:56:05.995
and he's not letting us
work for you anymore.

767
00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:07.897
Well. that's not my problem.

768
00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:10.899
You don't understand.
This guy is serious.

769
00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:15.604
What makes you think
that I am not?

770
00:56:17.408 --> 00:56:18.607
He'll kill you.

771
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:20.909
He'll have to find me first.

772
00:56:21.645 --> 00:56:23.680
- I'll tell him where you are.
- No. No. you won't.

773
00:56:23.681 --> 00:56:26.114
Not if you want to see
your mother alive again.

774
00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:29.386
What are you talking about?

775
00:56:29.387 --> 00:56:31.554
I caught her sniffing
around my home.

776
00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:34.524
What the hell are you
thinking. telling her

777
00:56:34.525 --> 00:56:36.426
that you were working for me?

778
00:56:36.427 --> 00:56:38.395
I had to tell her something.
She was getting suspicious.

779
00:56:38.396 --> 00:56:39.996
Well. congratulations.

780
00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:42.130
You just put her life in danger.

781
00:56:42.967 --> 00:56:45.001
- What is this?
- That is your last job.

782
00:56:45.002 --> 00:56:48.138
Bring me that car by
tomorrow night. midnight.

783
00:56:48.139 --> 00:56:50.138
and you will see
your mother again.

784
00:56:50.875 --> 00:56:53.410
And what makes you think I'm not
just going to call the police?

785
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:55.678
You mean besides the fact
that she will die

786
00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:58.246
and you'll go to jail?

787
00:56:59.517 --> 00:57:01.216
Nothing. Nothing at all.

788
00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:17.033
That's the Hummer.

789
00:57:17.034 --> 00:57:19.903
What's the big deal?
We can totally steal that.

790
00:57:19.904 --> 00:57:21.805
No. no. no. The big deal
is whose car it is.

791
00:57:21.806 --> 00:57:23.740
That's Staxx's.
and he loves that car.

792
00:57:23.741 --> 00:57:24.808
Who's Staxx?

793
00:57:24.809 --> 00:57:26.543
He's the owner of
Live nightclub.

794
00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:29.078
and no one messes with
Staxx. He's connected.

795
00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:31.848
Okay. How bad can he be?
His name has two "x's" in it.

796
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:33.783
No. Max. You're
not listening. okay?

797
00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:35.084
No one steals
from a guy like that

798
00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:36.486
unless it's
some sort of vendetta.

799
00:57:36.487 --> 00:57:39.155
It's suicide. okay?
You have to walk away.

800
00:57:39.156 --> 00:57:41.657
- I don't have a choice.
- We could call the police.

801
00:57:43.227 --> 00:57:46.196
She's my mom. I'll do
it myself if I have to.

802
00:57:46.197 --> 00:57:48.731
Em. you're my best friend. I'm
not just going to abandon you.

803
00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:50.567
But it's my fault you're even
involved in the first place.

804
00:57:50.568 --> 00:57:52.084
Are you kidding me?

805
00:57:52.085 --> 00:57:53.603
I basically had to drag you
back to that chop shop.

806
00:57:53.604 --> 00:57:54.871
Yeah. but if I hadn't
been so good at...

807
00:57:54.872 --> 00:57:56.488
All right. all right.
I get it.

808
00:57:56.489 --> 00:57:58.107
You're both amazing
and you're both to blame.

809
00:57:58.108 --> 00:58:00.076
Let's start working on a plan.

810
00:58:00.077 --> 00:58:02.111
Okay.
How do we find him?

811
00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:03.912
Easy.
His nightclub.

812
00:58:04.615 --> 00:58:06.716
Dylan. you can't be
a part of this.

813
00:58:06.717 --> 00:58:08.251
What? Look.

814
00:58:08.252 --> 00:58:10.820
Em. I know I'm just
the idiot that got caught

815
00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:12.856
and went to juvie.
but I'm your boyfriend.

816
00:58:12.857 --> 00:58:14.724
- I'm going to help you.
- It's not that.

817
00:58:14.725 --> 00:58:15.992
The police
could be following you.

818
00:58:15.993 --> 00:58:18.094
and we can't afford to
tip them off.

819
00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:19.696
If you really want to help.

820
00:58:19.697 --> 00:58:21.865
you'll stay as far away
from me as you can.

821
00:58:21.866 --> 00:58:25.801
So. basically.
I get the hardest job.

822
00:58:26.704 --> 00:58:27.969
You'll manage.

823
00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:31.040
All right. but I'm backup. okay?

824
00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:32.942
If something happens.
you call me.

825
00:58:32.943 --> 00:58:34.409
I will.

826
00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:38.714
You be careful.

827
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:40.716
I will.

828
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:55.698
Just heard back
from the surveillance team.

829
00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:58.635
Our boy's got company.
Two females. High school age.

830
00:58:58.636 --> 00:58:59.636
Where?

831
00:58:59.637 --> 00:59:03.239
6861 Mervis. The house
is owned by a Gail Wheeler.

832
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.775
Has one daughter. Emily. 17.

833
00:59:05.776 --> 00:59:07.209
It's her class photo.

834
00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:09.979
It gets better.
Her father was Jason Wheeler.

835
00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.681
Won a couple of mechanics' jobs.

836
00:59:11.682 --> 00:59:13.950
Died in a street race
six years ago.

837
00:59:13.951 --> 00:59:15.318
That's our girl.

838
00:59:15.319 --> 00:59:17.587
Tell the team to sit on all
three until I get there.

839
00:59:17.588 --> 00:59:18.854
Got it.

840
00:59:20.958 --> 00:59:22.258
I'll handle this one.

841
00:59:22.259 --> 00:59:23.726
What happened to
rock. paper. scissors?

842
00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:25.327
She's my mom.
I'll take the risks.

843
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.963
Fine with me.

844
00:59:56.293 --> 00:59:58.193
What do you mean
we lost the girls?

845
00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.096
What part of "sit on all three"
did you not understand?

846
01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.764
We took separate cars.

847
01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:02.999
we couldn't follow both of them.

848
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.950
Put out a BOLO.

849
01:00:04.951 --> 01:00:06.903
I want those two in an interview
room by the end of the night.

850
01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.503
What about Felt?

851
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:10.939
Let's take him down.

852
01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.859
No.

853
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.595
Damn it.

854
01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.069
We need to map out
multiple escape routes

855
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.904
and we need to buy a new look.

856
01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:43.740
Em. we're fine. We just plan it
out like we always do. okay?

857
01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:44.907
Don't worry.

858
01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:46.074
Hey.

859
01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.243
We must have been
under surveillance.

860
01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:48.711
Which means they
know who you are.

861
01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:50.246
- Who is it?
- It's Dylan.

862
01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:51.847
Put it on speakerphone.

863
01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:54.417
Hey. Dylan. what's going on?

864
01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:56.786
Give me this.

865
01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:58.386
Is this Emily Wheeler?

866
01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.089
This is Detective Torres.

is over. Emily.

You and your friend

need to turn yourselves
in right now

- before someone gets hurt.
- My God.

871
01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.370
I know you're listening.

872
01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:17.973
You're a smart girl.

873
01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:20.575

- Wake up!
- No.

880
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.904
What else are we supposed to do?

881
01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.106
- They know where we are!
- The only thing to do!

882
01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:53.943
We stick to the plan
and we finish this.

883
01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:55.610
Are you with me?

884
01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:16.999
How do I look? 21?

885
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.267
You look hot. that's enough.

886
01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.403
Okay. good. because
I am all out of fake IDs.

887
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.138
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

888
01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:23.939
You've got this.

889
01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:25.341
- Good?
- Yeah. Good.

890
01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:26.608
Okay.

891
01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:45.460
It's my phone charger.

892
01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:54.703
Go ahead.

893
01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:37.145
Now would be a great time
for this to work.

894
01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.654
I can do this.

895
01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.134
Excuse me.
does anybody have the time?

896
01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:00.002
The time?

897
01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.038
Nobody has a phone
or a watch or anything?

898
01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:05.608
Honey. for you.

899
01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:08.576
I've got all the time
in the world.

900
01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:12.213
Why don't you sit down?

901
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:14.749
Thanks anyway.

902
01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:17.719
Now. now. don't be rude.

903
01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:20.088
Sit with us.

904
01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.090
Have a drink.

905
01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:36.704
What's your name?

906
01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.042
Um. what's yours?

907
01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.879
Friends call me "Staxx."

908
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.814
First name "Big."

909
01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.383
I get it.

910
01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.587
You look nervous
about something.

911
01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.388
Doesn't she look nervous?

912
01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:05.201
Come on. Em. Come on.

913
01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:06.369
Don't worry. honey.

914
01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.136
You don't have to be scared.

915
01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:12.608
Play your cards right.
I might even show you my car.

916
01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:14.742
Sounds rad.

917
01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:23.185
Women and their purses...

918
01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:25.454
What you got in there.
anyway? Crown jewels?

919
01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:29.124
Nothing. Just girl stuff.

920
01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:33.728
Ask your friends. they know
what I'm talking about.

921
01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:43.638
Hey! Give it back!

922
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.246
What the hell?

923
01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.884
Hey! Stop her!

924
01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:04.692
Stop her!

925
01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.234
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

926
01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.575
Follow that Hummer.

927
01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:23.745
Go.

928
01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.057
What happened in there?

929
01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:36.759
He got a little
friendlier than I planned.

930
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.595
You actually talked
to the owner? Jesus. Em!

931
01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:41.229
Like I had a choice!

932
01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.299
Okay. pull over.
I want to drive.

933
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.833
No way.
You always get to drive.

934
01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:50.006
Em?

935
01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.272
Cops?

936
01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:53.942
Worse. I think that's Nestor.

937
01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:06.888
I warned them
not to mess with me.

938
01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:10.692
Come on. let's go. let's go.
Push the whip.

939
01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.370
Get me closer. Come on.

940
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.637
Pull over!

941
01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.308
Pull over!

942
01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:29.612
Pull! Over!

943
01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.513
My God. Em! He's got
a gun! What do I do?!

944
01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:38.253
- Lose him!
- Okay.

945
01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.402
Great. Cops now. too?

946
01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.104
Seriously. Max.
you really need to let me drive.

947
01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:56.288
Well. what do you want me to do?

948
01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:57.672
It's not like
I can just pull over.

949
01:07:58.575 --> 01:07:59.841
Hold it steady!

950
01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:05.947
God.

951
01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:10.752
My God.

952
01:08:26.503 --> 01:08:28.970
Damn.
Yo. move out.

953
01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:38.980
We lost Nestor.

954
01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:46.155
Just checked the Wheeler
house. No one's home.

955
01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:47.823
All units be advised.

956
01:08:47.824 --> 01:08:49.458
Female suspects wanted
on multiple counts

957
01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:52.528
of grand theft auto heading
west at high speed

958
01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:54.729
on Charleston Avenue
in a grey Hummer.

959
01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:02.403
So. what's the plan?

960
01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.973
The plan? The endgame?

961
01:09:07.677 --> 01:09:09.712
Don't worry. Your daughter
will be here soon enough

962
01:09:09.713 --> 01:09:12.347
and you'll never have
to see me again.

963
01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.185
That's a relief.

964
01:09:16.186 --> 01:09:18.686
The feeling is mutual.
believe me.

965
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.628
How much are you making
on this deal. anyway?

966
01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:27.663
A lot.

967
01:09:27.664 --> 01:09:30.366
My buyer is very committed
to owning this vehicle

968
01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:34.535
and he is not the kind of man
you want to make unhappy.

969
01:09:35.572 --> 01:09:38.774
Why? Is your buyer
a crime boss?

970
01:09:38.775 --> 01:09:40.975
Actually. yes.

971
01:09:41.912 --> 01:09:43.879
And it just so happens
that your daughter

972
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.148
is stealing from a local
thug who pissed him off.

973
01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.554
Relax. Gail.

974
01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.821
Emily can take care of herself.

975
01:09:56.459 --> 01:10:00.828
Assuming my daughter comes
through for you. then what?

976
01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:07.236
You don't seem like the
strippers and coke type.

977
01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:09.438
If you must know.
it's seed money.

978
01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:10.638
For what?

979
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.840
My future business.

980
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:14.709
Which is?

981
01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:19.848
Exotic car rentals.

982
01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:22.150
I'm thinking somewhere warm.

983
01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:25.487
Maybe Florida.

984
01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:27.755
Costa Rica.

985
01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:35.696
You think it's...

986
01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:38.599
such a good idea
to be telling me this

987
01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:41.436
if the plan is to let me go?

988
01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:47.775
You're not planning
to let me go.

989
01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:50.878
Are you?

990
01:10:50.902 --> 01:11:01.902
<b>watch movies and series
w w w . p i t k i n i . c o m</b>

991
01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:14.802
I could use some ideas here!

992
01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.945
- Run!
- Run?!

993
01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:26.782
Hey. stop right now!

994
01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:30.452
Emily Wheeler!
Maxine Bing!

995
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:31.953
Stop!

996
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.623
Come back here!

997
01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:40.127
Money in the bank.

998
01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.865
I think you're getting
a little ahead of yourself.

999
01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:45.833
It's nearly midnight.
She's still not here.

1000
01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.704
If I were you. I'd be
thinking about plan B.

1001
01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:50.773
Do me a favour...
Stop talking. Yeah?

1002
01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:52.441
Or what?

1003
01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.709
You'll kill me twice?

1004
01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:03.618
I didn't say that
I have to make this quick.

1005
01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:08.090
Is something funny?

1006
01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:11.927
You. high school
teachers breaking bad...

1007
01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.329
It's such a clichÃ©.

1008
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.730
You won't think it's funny

1009
01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:16.965
when your daughter is the one
with a gun to her head.

1010
01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.232
Yeah?

1011
01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.269
Okay.

1012
01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.903
Yeah.
This was a great idea.

1013
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.741
It's almost midnight.
We have to move.

1014
01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:07.109
I hate to break it to you. Em.

1015
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.911
but we just lost our
only bargaining chip.

1016
01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:11.212
Curnow doesn't know that.

1017
01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:18.754
I got no eyes.

1018
01:14:18.755 --> 01:14:20.756
I'm gonna check over here.

1019
01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:23.024
Okay. So. what do we do?

1020
01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:25.677
Nothing here.

1021
01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:27.129
Flashpoint down. man.

1022
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.197
Hey. we know you're there!

1023
01:14:28.198 --> 01:14:30.699
No. There's no way.

1024
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:31.900
Beggars can't be choosers.
Come on.

1025
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.068
Okay.

1026
01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:34.835
How about this way?

1027
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.157
A stolen
Hummer has been abandoned

1028
01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.693
near the neighbourhood
of Ferndale.

1029
01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.962
and two female suspects
wanted on multiple counts

1030
01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.497
of grand theft auto
are still at large.

1031
01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:39.134
SIU executive director

1032
01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:41.103
Heather Douglas has confirmed
the suspects

1033
01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:42.987
are known to police.

1034
01:15:42.988 --> 01:15:44.873
but their identities will not be
released to the public

1035
01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:46.841
at this time.

1036
01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:50.779
A third suspect in the case.
Nestor Barnes.

1037
01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.615
has been arrested in connection
to a major local chop shop

1038
01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:56.517
and may face hundreds
of felony charges.

1039
01:15:58.221 --> 01:16:01.056
In breaking international news.
heavy rains and flooding

1040
01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:03.091
have killed at least
12 people in Jordan

1041
01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:05.426
and forced authorities
to evacuate.

1042
01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.676
Lights over there.

1043
01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:22.443
Get those lights
to the back. please.

1044
01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:26.615
Em?
There's someone coming.

1045
01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:28.048
How much time do I have?

1046
01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:32.153
Um... I don't know.
Like. 20 seconds maybe.

1047
01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:41.355
Em. he's gonna catch us.

1048
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:42.857
Hang on.

1049
01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.232
Come back here!

1050
01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:56.503
We are so going to jail.

1051
01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.639
Who is it?

1052
01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:03.178
I don't know. Hello?

1053
01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:04.279
Hey. Em. it's me.

1054
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.014
Mom! Where are you?

1055
01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:08.316
I'm at Curnow's farm.
Okay. listen to me.

1056
01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:11.153
Don't come here. okay?
Whatever you do.

1057
01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:13.121
- What? Why?
- Because he's gonna kill you.

1058
01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.556
Listen. just go to the police
and tell them everything.

1059
01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:17.275
But...

1060
01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.276
Just do it. okay?

1061
01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:25.165
- Mom?
- She hung up.

1062
01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:29.036
- I can't just leave her.
- I know.

1063
01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:38.545
What? How the hell
did they steal your car?

1064
01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:43.935
Everyone. mount up!

1065
01:18:43.936 --> 01:18:45.920
Right. copy that.
Let's go! Move out! Move out!

1066
01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:48.323
Okay. let's just calm down

1067
01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:50.257
and think about this
for a second.

1068
01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:53.260
You don't really
want to do this.

1069
01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:58.165
Your daughter just
cost me a lot of money.

1070
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:01.969
Maybe my life.

1071
01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.575
Believe me. it makes it easier.

1072
01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:14.982
I-I promise I'm not going
to tell anyone about this.

1073
01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.722
Nope.
No. you will not.

1074
01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:29.229
He's not picking up.

1075
01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.134
She said he
was going to kill her.

1076
01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:33.835
Do you think he already...

1077
01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:37.773
No! He still wants
the Hummer. right?

1078
01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:41.209
If he kills her.
he gets nothing.

1079
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.477
Yeah. right.

1080
01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:44.980
But we don't have
the Hummer anymore.

1081
01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:47.082
Damn it.

1082
01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:49.249
How are we gonna
get him to let her go?

1083
01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:02.197
Come on. Come on.
You don't need me. okay?

1084
01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:03.865
Can you just please let me go?

1085
01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:05.200
You're already ahead
of the game. right?

1086
01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:06.935
You've got money.
You can leave the country.

1087
01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:08.535
Do I need to gag you?

1088
01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:12.106
- No.
- Good.

1089
01:20:24.387 --> 01:20:26.220
Get in the car now.

1090
01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:41.368
There's a house.

1091
01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:44.306
What do we do?

1092
01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:47.274
He's a convicted felon
and we're the police.

1093
01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.343
We can arrest him.

1094
01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:12.332
Do it.

1095
01:21:12.902 --> 01:21:14.435
Get out of the car!

1096
01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:20.374
You better do as she says.

1097
01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:23.277
This isn't right.

1098
01:21:23.301 --> 01:21:27.401
<b>watch movies and series
w w w . p i t k i n i . c o m</b>

1099
01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:29.249
Let me try.

1100
01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:32.187
Okay. Um...

1101
01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:34.923
You heard her.
Get out of the car

1102
01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:36.423
and put your hands
above your head.

1103
01:21:37.627 --> 01:21:39.226
Do it now.

1104
01:21:42.198 --> 01:21:44.131
Max. you son of a bitch.

1105
01:21:57.613 --> 01:22:00.382
Mom?! Mom!

1106
01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:01.917
That's far enough.

1107
01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.251
Em. I told you not to come!

1108
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.653
You should've
listened to her. kid.

1109
01:22:04.654 --> 01:22:06.120
Leave her!

1110
01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:09.189
Freeze!

1111
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.693
Drop the gun!

1112
01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.705
You okay?

1113
01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:27.207
Up.

1114
01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.465
Never thought I'd
hear that sound again.

1115
01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:25.265
Nice paint job. Em.

1116
01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:27.301
Dad would be proud.

1117
01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:30.405
Even though I dragged
the family name through the mud

1118
01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:32.774
and had to do
community service for a year?

1119
01:23:32.775 --> 01:23:35.510
Helped put some bad
people in jail.

1120
01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.713
If he's happy with it. so am I.

1121
01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:40.648
Your mom is so cool.

1122
01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:42.083
My mom has me
grounded for. like.

1123
01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:43.750
the next ten years of my life.

1124
01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:47.455
Aren't they expecting you
down at the scrapyard?

1125
01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:49.057
You're gonna be late for work.

1126
01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:50.991
It's okay.
I'm dating the owner's son.

1127
01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:54.228
- Hey.
- Hey.

1128
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.698
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

1129
01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:59.967
- Let's take my car instead.
- What? You mean...?

1130
01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:02.504
No way.

1131
01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:04.105
Passed with flying colors.

1132
01:24:04.106 --> 01:24:05.706
Well. I'd expect no less.

1133
01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:10.545
Hey. um. can I get a ride with
you guys. perhaps?

1134
01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:11.945
Thanks.

1135
01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:16.233

01:24:16.234 --> 01:24:18.353
One speeding ticket.

1137
01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:19.920
