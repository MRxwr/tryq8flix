00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.601

Until death do us part.

69
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:23.462
By the power vested in me
by the state of Montana.

70
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.215
I now pronounce you man and wife.

71
00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.258
You may kiss the bride.

Thank you. sir.

73
00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:32.513
Think I will.

74
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.566
- Congratulations. Donald.
- Thank you. sir.

75
00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:48.111

76
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.113

So. uh. kitchen.

We've. uh... We got more stuff coming.

79
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.796
I put some chairs on layaway.

80
00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:51.258
Here you go.

81
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:54.761
Do you like it?

82
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.180
- Do you like your bed?
- Yeah.

83
00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:57.639
- Do you like your bed?
- Yeah.

84
00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.976
I'll sew you some curtains.

85
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.686
Okay.

86
00:10:13.989 --> 00:10:15.782
You'll come visit real soon.

87
00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:10.587
He isn't far.

88
00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:12.756
Just in town.

89
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.303
He isn't here.

90
00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.477
Oh!

91
00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:10.230
You dropped it all. buddy.

92
00:12:10.314 --> 00:12:11.899
Come on. let's go.

93
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:13.901
Hey. Come on. let's go.

94
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.850
Let's go!

95
00:13:15.921 --> 00:13:17.965
It's not for you.

96
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.676
<i>Lorna?</i>

97
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.429
Lorna?

98
00:13:25.848 --> 00:13:26.974
Hello?

99
00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.184
Who you looking for?

100
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.564
You're the girl's mother?

101
00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:35.399
No. I'm...

102
00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.027
Lorna was married to my son.

103
00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.446
The little boy is my grandson.

104
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.031
Well. you missed 'em.

105
00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:44.658
Gone now.

106
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.286
Gone?

107
00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.079
Gone to his family.

108
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.248
Took off last night.

109
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.084
Wait. wait. wait. Wait.

110
00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:56.670
His family? Donnie's?

111
00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.091
They mention when they'd be back?

112
00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.343
Not no time soon be my guess.

113
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.846
Took all they had.

114
00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.852
Headed any place in particular?

115
00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:19.730
Sit down. George.

116
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.109
That my last meal?

117
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.779
I'm going to get Jimmy.

118
00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:30.407
Bring him home to live with us.

119
00:16:31.867 --> 00:16:34.328
Well. you sure packed
for a trip into town.

120
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.041
Sit down. George.

121
00:16:55.349 --> 00:16:59.269
You didn't see fit to share this with me?

122
00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.359
Sharing it now.

123
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.617
Anyone else see it happen?

124
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.329
You mean other than me?

125
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.041
I'm asking if you're sure what you saw.

126
00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:27.422
I saw exactly what I've always felt
about Donnie Weboy.

127
00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:29.466
What you felt too.

128
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.593
whether anyone'll ever
get you to admit it or not.

129
00:17:31.677 --> 00:17:34.137
And I saw that girl
can't protect her child.

130
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.973
And on that account.
you expect she's. what.

131
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.808
just gonna hand him over to you?

132
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.977
That what you see happening?

133
00:17:44.982 --> 00:17:46.775
And when Lorna says no?

134
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.736
Margaret. Jimmy's her boy.

135
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.532
He's your grandson. George Blackledge.

136
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.757
And your plan for finding 'em?

137
00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:14.803
Donnie's from somewhere
in North Dakota. I'll find 'em.

138
00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.639
You ought to know me
well enough by now.

139
00:18:17.723 --> 00:18:19.391
Oh. yeah.

140
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.185
I do.

141
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.771
I won't be coming back here
without him.

142
00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:26.315
Nope.

143
00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:30.277
And you're going with me or without me?

144
00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.991
That's your choice.

145
00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.343
You're not coming?

146
00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:58.096
I'm turning off the water.
Don't want to come home to busted pipes.

147
00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:58.115
- You don't know when you'll be back.
- I don't need reminding.

148
00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.075
I know what I've lost.

149
00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:04.538
Sometimes that's all life is. Margaret.

150
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:07.666
The list of what we've lost.

151
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.293
Oh. so I do get a piece.

152
00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.132
Sheriff Hayden's been out of office. oh...

153
00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.467
seven years now.

154
00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:25.721
Good man. Beat me to it.

155
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:30.350
He helped me track down a couple of men
I was looking for back in...

156
00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:33.270
'52.

157
00:22:34.021 --> 00:22:35.147
Pettus brothers.

158
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.774
I remember that. That was you?

159
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:40.152
Well. you sure got 'em.

160
00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:42.029
Yeah. I had some help.

161
00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:43.655
Well. how can I help?

162
00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:46.450
We're trying to locate a Donnie Weboy.

163
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:52.289
- He's got family over in North Dakota.
- I know the name.

164
00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:55.459
Not Donnie. but Weboy. sure.

165
00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.547
Well. he married our son's widow.

166
00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:03.759
Got our grandson with them.

167
00:23:03.842 --> 00:23:05.677
Boy's only three.

168
00:23:07.763 --> 00:23:10.474
We just want to know
where they are. make sure...

169
00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.267
make sure they're safe.

170
00:23:16.897 --> 00:23:18.774
Let me call around some.

171
00:23:26.615 --> 00:23:28.158
How's that pot roast?

172
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.623
Yours is better.

173
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.378
Hmm.

174
00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:42.464
You're just used to mine.

175

<i>♪ So stop the world and let me off... ♪</i>

176
00:24:00.232 --> 00:24:02.776
You got a half pint behind there?
Whiskey.

177
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:28.510
Happy?

178
00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:31.096
Happy not to hear a lecture.

179
00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:37.769
Gonna hide the evidence.

180
00:24:55.621 --> 00:24:57.080
Margaret!

181
00:25:06.048 --> 00:25:07.508
What the hell. Margaret?

182
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.553
- That was before...
- What the hell?

183
00:25:12.721 --> 00:25:14.723
That was before I knew you were coming.

184
00:25:16.683 --> 00:25:18.227
You thought you'd need it?

185
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.354
I didn't want to find out I did
and not have it.

186
00:25:22.898 --> 00:25:25.567
Christ. Margaret. Was this
gonna be part of your argument?

187
00:25:25.651 --> 00:25:28.654
- George. I would never...
- It's got bullets in it.

188
00:25:44.002 --> 00:25:47.631
There's a branch of the Weboy clan
over in Forsyth. Townsfolk.

189
00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:51.426
Trailhead Saddlery there
is a Weboy operation.

190
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.929
Or it was started by the family.

191
00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:56.598
Ain't North Dakota. but I'd start there.

192
00:25:56.682 --> 00:25:59.268
That's what we'll do then.
Appreciate your help.

193
00:26:00.352 --> 00:26:02.938
We're also hoping you might recommend
a hotel in town for the night.

194
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:04.398
Anyplace clean.

195
00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:07.985
Well. if clean's the priority.
my Sally keeps the jail here.

196
00:26:08.068 --> 00:26:09.736
Cells are empty.

197
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.864
And we got fresh sheets.

198
00:26:11.947 --> 00:26:14.032
Not sure what feelings
you got on it.

199
00:26:14.116 --> 00:26:16.159
We'd be right at home.

200
00:26:16.243 --> 00:26:17.953
- Thank you. Sheriff Nevelson.
- My pleasure.

201
00:26:23.709 --> 00:26:25.252
You think they're trying to run?

202
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.383
No. not that I know.

203
00:26:32.843 --> 00:26:34.761
But they did take off in a hurry.

204
00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:36.972
Forgot to say goodbye.

205
00:26:38.473 --> 00:26:40.350
I'm just looking to give her that.

206
00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:46.064
Let her say goodbye.

207
00:29:11.335 --> 00:29:13.086
Go home.

208
00:29:15.464 --> 00:29:17.132
Go home.

209
00:29:18.258 --> 00:29:19.760
Go home.

210
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.395
<i>♪ As I face an empty dawn ♪</i>

211
00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:37.069
<i>♪ With no end to it all can I see ♪</i>

212
00:29:38.195 --> 00:29:41.907
<i>♪ For I've surely reached the end ♪</i>

213
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.452
<i>♪ Lost your love to a friend ♪</i>

214
00:29:47.746 --> 00:29:51.625
<i>...when that judgment comes down.
you'll cry.</i>

215
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:53.752
<i>"I was saved."</i>

216
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.215
<i>But you'll be drowning in a lake of fire.</i>

217
00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.759
<i>because that's the decision you made...</i>

218
00:30:05.722 --> 00:30:08.767
- Turn it back on if you want.
- Sounds like your daddy.

219
00:30:08.851 --> 00:30:10.060
Thumping his Bible.

220
00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:14.481
Wasn't just Bibles he thumped.

221
00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:30.122
Good morning.

222
00:30:38.839 --> 00:30:40.382
Beautiful saddles.

223
00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:42.759
Wouldn't you say. George?

224
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.764
Fella in Miles City makes 'em.
the fancy ones.

225
00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:48.932
Oh.

226
00:30:49.725 --> 00:30:51.602
Well. very impressive.

227
00:30:52.644 --> 00:30:55.647
But we're not shopping for saddles today.

228
00:30:57.065 --> 00:30:59.318
Or bridles and bits.

229
00:30:59.985 --> 00:31:03.322
Now. uh... would you be a Weboy?

230
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:06.700
No. ma'am.
I'm a cousin to. I'm a Tucker.

231
00:31:06.783 --> 00:31:09.912
Oh. Well. then we're related too.

232
00:31:10.746 --> 00:31:12.748
Donnie Weboy's married
to our daughter-in-law.

233
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:16.168
Former daughter-in-law.
Which makes him stepdaddy to our grandson.

234
00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:23.800
My husband and I found ourselves
in this part of the state. so I said.

235
00:31:23.884 --> 00:31:26.303
"Let's look in on Lorna and Donnie
while we're here."

236
00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:28.347
So here we are.

237
00:31:29.014 --> 00:31:31.225
I don't know no Donnie or a Laura.

238
00:31:31.308 --> 00:31:35.646
Hmm. Well. I understood
it was why they relocated here.

239
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:37.856
Donnie was going to hire on
at his uncle's saddlery.

240
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.069
- Who?
- George. didn't Lorna say?

241
00:31:42.152 --> 00:31:44.571
You sure you don't want Gladstone?

242
00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:46.240
Gladstone?

243
00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:47.616
North Dakota.

244
00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:49.868
Just the other side of the line.

245
00:31:49.952 --> 00:31:52.704
It's not like they got work there either.
no good work anyway.

246
00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:55.082
but they got a Weboy or two.

247
00:31:55.165 --> 00:31:58.794
Well. maybe we should give there a try.

248
00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:01.463
Though I don't know why
Lorna and Donnie were

249
00:32:01.547 --> 00:32:03.674
talking up Forsyth like they did.

250
00:32:03.757 --> 00:32:05.884
What was your names again?

251
00:32:06.468 --> 00:32:11.098
Any idea who we might ask to find Donnie.
if we went to Gladstone?

252
00:32:15.853 --> 00:32:20.190
You let it be known
you're looking for a Weboy.

253
00:32:20.274 --> 00:32:21.692
they'll find you.

254
00:32:59.438 --> 00:33:01.148
You're with me on this. right?

255
00:33:02.065 --> 00:33:04.151
Who's been doing the driving?

256
00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:09.865
You could say you want him back.

257
00:33:09.948 --> 00:33:11.450
I haven't heard that yet.

258
00:33:15.704 --> 00:33:17.831
We're not young. Margaret.

259
00:33:21.376 --> 00:33:23.086
Well. we're not old.

260
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.714
We're not young.

261
00:33:26.423 --> 00:33:28.175
You saying you don't miss him?

262
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:30.469
I'm saying that
he's not even in school yet.

263
00:33:30.552 --> 00:33:33.472
Hasn't had measles or rode a bike.

264
00:33:35.849 --> 00:33:37.100
He's young.

265
00:33:39.102 --> 00:33:40.854
And we're not.

266
00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:44.566
Well...

267
00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:48.570
you can drive me into town
then drop me off.

268
00:33:48.654 --> 00:33:50.906
turn around and take yourself back home.

269
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:53.951
I'll do what I need to do.

270
00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:58.121
I'll take a bus back to Dalton with Jimmy.

271
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.417
Yeah. Once Lorna's handed him to you?

272
00:34:03.877 --> 00:34:06.380
A smile on her face. happy as a clam?

273
00:34:07.714 --> 00:34:09.757
And if they're not down there. what?

274
00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:19.059
You just gonna chase them
around the country on a bus? Hmm?

275
00:34:19.141 --> 00:34:22.437
- What if they go where Greyhound doesn't?
- Then I'll walk.

276
00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:25.274
You would. too. wouldn't you?

277
00:34:30.862 --> 00:34:32.447
And when you finally learn

278
00:34:32.531 --> 00:34:34.992
that what you want to make happen
isn't gonna happen.

279
00:34:35.074 --> 00:34:37.077
what then. Margaret Meloy?

280
00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:41.706
Well. then I suppose I'll learn
what I've never been able to.

281
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:45.043
Isn't that what you've always told me?

282
00:34:45.127 --> 00:34:46.503
Over and over.

283
00:34:46.587 --> 00:34:49.547
That I don't know
when it's time to call it quits.

284
00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:58.640
And I'll be the one gets the job of
picking up those pieces. huh?

285
00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:11.820
Hey.

286
00:35:16.116 --> 00:35:18.118
No. no. no. You just hold it.

287
00:35:18.202 --> 00:35:19.578
Hold it right there.

288
00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:21.246
I didn't take nothing. all right?
I just...

289
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.581
You were just what?

290
00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:25.501
Well. I was fishing.

291
00:35:25.584 --> 00:35:26.752
Fishing?

292
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.964
Fishing around this car?

293
00:35:31.048 --> 00:35:32.424
Well. no. No. sir.

294
00:35:32.508 --> 00:35:34.259
No. I'm just coming from fishing.

295
00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:37.554
I just seen your car.
and I was just wondering

296
00:35:37.638 --> 00:35:39.932
who's setting up camp out here.
that's all.

297
00:35:40.015 --> 00:35:43.227
- Who are you?
- Peter Dragswolf. sir.

298
00:35:44.061 --> 00:35:45.646
I live over there.

299
00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:47.397
Have my own place.

300
00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:51.068
I've got my own money too.
I don't need none of your goods.

301
00:35:51.151 --> 00:35:53.654
I'm Margaret Blackledge. Mr. Dragswolf.

302
00:35:54.738 --> 00:35:56.365
That's my husband George.

303
00:35:56.448 --> 00:35:59.034
I apologize if we're trespassing.

304
00:35:59.117 --> 00:36:00.953
And what's this fella's name?

305
00:36:01.036 --> 00:36:03.914
I can't say.
He don't belong to me.

306
00:36:04.623 --> 00:36:07.042
Just showed up
outside my shack one morning.

307
00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:10.420
I thought he was wild at first.
but he come from somewhere.

308
00:36:10.504 --> 00:36:11.964
I don't know.

309
00:36:13.048 --> 00:36:14.591
But he found me.

310
00:36:17.553 --> 00:36:19.346
Same as us.

311
00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:33.569
Maybe the horse belongs to her.

312
00:36:36.029 --> 00:36:37.990
Near about every horse does.

313
00:36:54.131 --> 00:36:56.008
I used to ride.

314
00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:57.801
She's being modest with you.

315
00:36:58.552 --> 00:37:00.470
I used to break horses.

316
00:37:02.681 --> 00:37:05.642
With our son. James.

317
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.353
Then he died.

318
00:37:10.772 --> 00:37:14.193
And I guess I lost my appetite for it.

319
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.613
Haven't kept animals in quite a while.

320
00:37:18.697 --> 00:37:21.366
It's nice to spend some time
with a sweet one like yours.

321
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.703
What about you?
How long you been out here?

322
00:37:26.413 --> 00:37:28.081
Three years.

323
00:37:28.165 --> 00:37:30.542
All on your own? No family?

324
00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:34.546
Where were you before?

325
00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:41.512
Indian school. sir.

326
00:37:42.221 --> 00:37:43.847
You don't have to call me "sir."

327
00:37:44.681 --> 00:37:46.350
"George" will do the job.

328
00:37:49.728 --> 00:37:52.981
You finished that school?
How old are you?

329
00:37:59.863 --> 00:38:01.281
I don't bother anybody.

330
00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:06.036
You know. if somebody comes for the horse.
they can have him back.

331
00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:08.747
The skins I sell. those animals I catch.

332
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.291
The fish are free. and I don't steal.

333
00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:15.254
- I mind my own business.
- Peter. come. Have some cake.

334
00:38:15.337 --> 00:38:17.422
Why don't you sit back
at the fire with us?

335
00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:34.147
You're familiar with the area. though?
Gladstone?

336
00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.235
I can tell you where the folks are buried
that ain't buried in the cemeteries.

337
00:38:39.444 --> 00:38:40.445
Weboys?

338
00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:43.740
You had any dealings with them?

339
00:38:46.869 --> 00:38:48.871
We're looking for our grandson.

340
00:38:48.954 --> 00:38:50.414
Our boy's boy.

341
00:38:52.416 --> 00:38:53.959
He's with a man named Donnie Weboy.

342
00:38:54.042 --> 00:38:56.128
- You ever heard of him?
- No.

343
00:38:56.962 --> 00:38:59.298
No. but if you're looking in Gladstone.

344
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:00.883
look for Bill Weboy.

345
00:39:00.966 --> 00:39:02.301
You think he'd help us?

346
00:39:03.051 --> 00:39:04.720
Help. maybe.

347
00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:08.640
But go careful.

348
00:39:20.319 --> 00:39:23.030
There it is. Yellow house.

349
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:49.973
- Mr. Weboy?
- Who's asking?

350
00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:51.725
Margaret Blackledge.

351
00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:54.061
And my husband George.

352
00:39:54.645 --> 00:39:58.982
If you're a Weboy.
we're family. after a fashion.

353
00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:00.692
How you figure that?

354
00:40:00.776 --> 00:40:03.278
Bill Weboy. A cousin. are you?

355
00:40:03.362 --> 00:40:07.032
Oh.
Could be. but probably not exactly.

356
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.870
Our former daughter-in-law
married a Donnie Weboy.

357
00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:14.122
He's stepdad to our grandson now.

358
00:40:14.957 --> 00:40:16.500
That's pretty tangled up. isn't it?

359
00:40:16.583 --> 00:40:18.919
Family usually is.

360
00:40:21.547 --> 00:40:24.132
We heard they might have come
to settle here in Gladstone.

361
00:40:24.216 --> 00:40:27.386
We thought we'd pay a visit.
see our grandson Jimmy.

362
00:40:27.469 --> 00:40:28.887
since we're in the neighborhood.

363
00:40:29.888 --> 00:40:31.640
Since you're in the neighborhood.

364
00:40:31.723 --> 00:40:34.560
And since you didn't find them
up in Forsyth.

365
00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:40.858
- You heard we were coming. did you?
- I did. I did.

366
00:40:40.941 --> 00:40:42.776
A little birdie flew over here
ahead of you.

367
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.279
- Cheep. ch-cheep. cheep...
- Are they here or not?

368
00:40:47.364 --> 00:40:49.366
Is he always like that.
in a big old hurry?

369
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:51.368
My husband likes to get down to business.

370
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:54.037
Hell of a lot of men are like that.
Can't wait to get where they're going.

371
00:40:56.248 --> 00:40:59.960
Women. in my experience.
would as soon take their time.

372
00:41:00.043 --> 00:41:01.962
Enjoy the ride. so to speak.

373
00:41:02.045 --> 00:41:05.757
- Mr. Weboy. I'm gonna tell you one time...
- I'm just funnin' you. George.

374
00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:07.885
They're here. Donnie's my nephew.

375
00:41:07.968 --> 00:41:11.013
They're safe and sound
over at his mom's place.

376
00:41:13.056 --> 00:41:15.559
Why don't we head on inside
and give the old homestead a call.

377
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.729
Hell. you might be able
to drive over this morning.

378
00:41:18.812 --> 00:41:20.981
see that little precious
grandson of yours.

379
00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:33.452
Hey. Mabel.

380
00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:36.121
Can you put me through to the ranch?

381
00:41:39.583 --> 00:41:41.543
Blanche. it's Bill.

382
00:41:41.627 --> 00:41:43.545
What? What is it?

383
00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:47.090
Uh-huh. Got 'em right here.

384
00:41:48.425 --> 00:41:50.928
- What?
- You don't want this man's help.

385
00:41:52.054 --> 00:41:54.556
- See you soon.
- We can't do this on our own.

386
00:41:58.477 --> 00:41:59.937
You two have plans for supper?

387
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.980
We surely don't.

388
00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:05.275
How'd you like to be guests
of the Weboy clan out at the ranch?

389
00:42:06.902 --> 00:42:09.238
- We don't want to be any trouble.
- No trouble at all.

390
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.240
My sister-in-law wants to meet you.

391
00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:16.078
She wants to swap some old
grandpa and grandma stories.

392
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:18.288
And between you and me.
she's a hell of a cook.

393
00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:20.791
Well. you'd have to give us directions.

394
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:22.709
Nope. Not a chance.

395
00:42:22.793 --> 00:42:26.004
I could be the best damn direction giver
in the world. and you'd never find her.

396
00:42:26.088 --> 00:42:28.257
You'd be out there wandering
around Four Bridges Road

397
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.050
and never see a one. No.

398
00:42:30.133 --> 00:42:34.096
You make your way back here at 4:00.
and you can follow me.

399
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.808
Thank you. We'll come back then.

400
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.918
About time.

401
00:43:05.002 --> 00:43:08.755
One of you should ride with me
and the other follow.

402
00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:10.799
I could tell you
where we're going and why.

403
00:43:10.883 --> 00:43:14.511
and that way. maybe you can
find your way back on your own.

404
00:43:22.352 --> 00:43:23.604
Well...

405
00:43:24.605 --> 00:43:26.315
Where do you think you're going?

406
00:43:26.398 --> 00:43:28.400
You think he wants you
in the passenger seat?

407
00:43:28.483 --> 00:43:30.235
No.

408
00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.862
I know he doesn't.

409
00:43:35.699 --> 00:43:38.410
I don't care what he wants.
I'm going. You drive.

410
00:43:38.493 --> 00:43:39.786
- It's fine. George.
- Margaret.

411
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.455
Margaret. Margaret. get back in...

412
00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:43.373
Follow close.

413
00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:07.147
Pretty bird. that old jalopy
won't have trouble keeping up. will it?

414
00:44:07.231 --> 00:44:09.900
You're looking in the mirror often enough.
You can see where he is.

415
00:44:09.983 --> 00:44:12.945
I guess he just don't want you
to get too far out of his sight.

416
00:44:13.529 --> 00:44:15.113
Which I understand.

417
00:44:16.323 --> 00:44:17.658
You mind?

418
00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.620
It's your car.
You don't need my permission.

419
00:44:22.454 --> 00:44:26.208
You strike me as the kind of woman
men are always asking permission of.

420
00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:28.168
An expert. are you?

421
00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:36.009
I've been around more than a few women

422
00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:39.221
who want men to ask
before drawing a breath.

423
00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:43.851
We turn here.

424
00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:46.019
Why don't you signal
so George knows what's coming?

425
00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:51.859
Aye. aye. captain.

426
00:45:13.547 --> 00:45:15.549
How much further is it?

427
00:45:15.632 --> 00:45:18.135
Uh. "farther." "How much farther is it?"

428
00:45:18.218 --> 00:45:20.971
Or do you mean how much more of me
do you have to put up with?

429
00:45:21.054 --> 00:45:23.182
We just want to see Jimmy.

430
00:45:23.265 --> 00:45:24.516
Yeah.

431
00:45:25.767 --> 00:45:27.644
He's a good-looking boy there.

432
00:45:27.728 --> 00:45:30.314
And his mother's a fine-looking woman.

433
00:45:32.149 --> 00:45:36.945
You know. Donnie never asked me
for a word of advice in his life.

434
00:45:37.029 --> 00:45:39.156
You don't say.

435
00:45:39.239 --> 00:45:40.574
And if he had.

436
00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:42.910
I would've told him to do
exactly what he's done.

437
00:45:42.993 --> 00:45:45.120
"Marry yourself a widow. Donnie.

438
00:45:45.204 --> 00:45:46.747
You'll be getting a grateful woman."

439
00:46:40.843 --> 00:46:43.554
Never would've found this place
on your own. am I right?

440
00:46:44.888 --> 00:46:46.223
Was I right?

441
00:46:46.306 --> 00:46:48.016
Through here.

442
00:46:51.562 --> 00:46:52.688
Blanche!

443
00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:55.607
We're here.

444
00:46:57.276 --> 00:46:58.777
Blanche?

445
00:47:19.506 --> 00:47:21.508
I hope you like pork chops.

446
00:47:25.888 --> 00:47:27.806
- You're the grandma.
- I am.

447
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:29.183
Margaret Blackledge.

448
00:47:29.266 --> 00:47:31.018
Blanche Weboy.

449
00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:32.686
Thanks for having us.

450
00:47:32.769 --> 00:47:34.146
And you're the lawman.

451
00:47:34.229 --> 00:47:36.773
Retired. ma'am. George Blackledge.

452
00:47:36.857 --> 00:47:41.570
Well. why don't we all retire
to a seat at the table. huh?

453
00:47:42.321 --> 00:47:43.780
Shall we?

454
00:47:48.702 --> 00:47:52.247
Now. who can I interest in a glass? Hmm?

455
00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:53.832
Oh. no. thank you.

456
00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:56.502
- Hmm?
- No.

457
00:47:57.586 --> 00:47:59.296
Ah. Well...

458
00:48:00.297 --> 00:48:02.132
I don't mind drinking alone.

459
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.269
My people originally came from Illinois.

460
00:48:14.353 --> 00:48:19.608
Filed a homestead claim north of Gladstone
before there was a Gladstone.

461
00:48:20.317 --> 00:48:22.110
I'm one of eight.

462
00:48:23.946 --> 00:48:26.740
Lost an older sister to pneumonia.

463
00:48:26.823 --> 00:48:30.619
My brother Carl drowned
in a neighbor's cistern.

464
00:48:30.702 --> 00:48:34.873
Another fell off a truck. lived in
a wheelchair for the rest of his days.

465
00:48:34.957 --> 00:48:37.543
My aunt Ruth got caught in a whiteout.

466
00:48:37.626 --> 00:48:39.711
froze and died right where she stood.

467
00:48:39.795 --> 00:48:42.631
not 30 feet from that back door.

468
00:48:43.465 --> 00:48:45.259
Hard life.

469
00:48:45.342 --> 00:48:47.344
Not for everyone.

470
00:48:48.804 --> 00:48:54.977
My other brothers and sister
lit out. soon as they could.

471
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.145
Never looked back.

472
00:49:00.607 --> 00:49:01.733
I stayed.

473
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.488
When I first met Henry Weboy.

474
00:49:06.572 --> 00:49:10.367
he couldn't stop talking about
heading for Florida.

475
00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:16.707
I figure I had more than a little to do
with his decision to stay.

476
00:49:20.752 --> 00:49:26.216
Now he's buried in the same cemetery
as my folks and his.

477
00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:28.886
Yeah.

478
00:49:28.969 --> 00:49:32.931
And my boys are fourth-generation Weboys.

479
00:49:33.015 --> 00:49:36.393
born and living on North Dakota soil.

480
00:49:42.524 --> 00:49:46.403
But you didn't come here to hear me yak.

481
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:49.406
You came to eat! Ha!

482
00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:54.328
Why don't you call the boys in
for supper. huh?

483
00:49:54.912 --> 00:49:56.538
I'll be back in a jiffy.

484
00:49:59.791 --> 00:50:01.793
I suppose you could tell a story

485
00:50:01.877 --> 00:50:05.255
not a hell of a lot different. am I right?

486
00:50:05.339 --> 00:50:07.508
About family.

487
00:50:07.591 --> 00:50:10.844
hardships. sacrifice. blood.

488
00:50:12.137 --> 00:50:14.014
Ah. meet the boys.

489
00:50:14.097 --> 00:50:15.265
Tall one's Elton.

490
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:16.934
The other's Marvin.

491
00:50:17.601 --> 00:50:19.561
Say hello to our guests.

492
00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:22.606
That your wagon out there?

493
00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:26.068
We tried to get inside. take a look.

494
00:50:26.985 --> 00:50:29.863
Tighten a couple bolts. we could probably
get you a few more horses.

495
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:35.285
Where's Jimmy? Where's the boy?

496
00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:37.538
Why. he's not here.

497
00:50:37.621 --> 00:50:39.414
- He's with his father.
- His father...

498
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.252
We came to see our grandson.

499
00:50:43.335 --> 00:50:46.046
You mean you didn't come here
to eat my pork chops?

500
00:50:48.507 --> 00:50:51.218
If you brought us all the way out here
for the sake of a joke...

501
00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:54.221
Lorna said you were rough bark.

502
00:50:54.304 --> 00:50:56.974
And I can see already
you're no day at the races.

503
00:50:57.057 --> 00:50:58.767
No. ma'am.

504
00:51:00.018 --> 00:51:01.979
Come on. everybody. Sit down.

505
00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:04.815
It's not gonna get any better cold.

506
00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:18.161
Your grandson's with my Donnie.

507
00:51:19.496 --> 00:51:22.416
He took Jimmy along to pick up
the boy's mother from work.

508
00:51:22.499 --> 00:51:23.792
Lorna?

509
00:51:24.334 --> 00:51:26.170
She's working at Monkey Ward.

510
00:51:27.004 --> 00:51:30.215
We could've seen Jimmy and Lorna
in Gladstone?

511
00:51:30.299 --> 00:51:32.301
Oh. now I am feeling insulted by you.

512
00:51:32.384 --> 00:51:34.636
You really don't give a damn
about sharing a meal.

513
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.763
- I just meant...
- Or maybe you're a Jew.

514
00:51:38.223 --> 00:51:40.267
Maybe you can't eat pork chops.

515
00:51:45.439 --> 00:51:47.357
Breathe easy.

516
00:51:47.441 --> 00:51:50.152
Anyone who knows me
knows I can't be insulted.

517
00:51:50.235 --> 00:51:52.529
Eat my chops or don't.

518
00:51:52.613 --> 00:51:56.033
Well. we'd certainly hoped to
meet Donnie's family someday.

519
00:51:56.116 --> 00:51:57.576
Oh. had you?

520
00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:01.496
Well. I'm glad to learn that.

521
00:52:02.998 --> 00:52:05.250
Yeah. I thought we should meet too.

522
00:52:06.793 --> 00:52:08.545
Have ourselves a chat.

523
00:52:10.088 --> 00:52:12.841
Would've been nice if it had
been at the wedding. but...

524
00:52:13.467 --> 00:52:16.512
maybe it was too much to ask
for his mother to be invited

525
00:52:16.595 --> 00:52:17.596
or his brothers.

526
00:52:17.679 --> 00:52:19.056
- Or poor Uncle Bill.
- Yeah.

527
00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:21.642
- You weren't invited?
- You recollect seeing us there?

528
00:52:22.935 --> 00:52:24.144
And that's our fault?

529
00:52:24.228 --> 00:52:28.357
You didn't stop to think to yourselves.
"He must've come from somewhere.

530
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.317
Must have family."

531
00:52:34.238 --> 00:52:37.282
Frankly. we thought only that
Donnie was a grown man.

532
00:52:42.788 --> 00:52:44.373
Your son's dead.

533
00:52:46.959 --> 00:52:49.002
It's understandable you forget.

534
00:52:50.128 --> 00:52:52.714
We're never really done raising them.

535
00:52:52.798 --> 00:52:54.716
Teaching them the right way.

536
00:52:57.302 --> 00:52:59.221
It's why I had to bring my boy home.

537
00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:03.058
To keep an eye on him.

538
00:53:04.726 --> 00:53:06.603
Your boy's perfect now.

539
00:53:06.687 --> 00:53:09.273
It's not really fair
to compare him and Donnie.

540
00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:12.067
I wouldn't ever compare Donnie to our son.

541
00:53:13.235 --> 00:53:14.820
Yeah.

542
00:53:15.988 --> 00:53:19.783
Yeah. he said that you two don't approve.

543
00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:22.870
I'm surprised to hear
he gives a damn what we think.

544
00:53:25.372 --> 00:53:27.875
He couldn't be bothered
to tell us they were leaving.

545
00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:30.627
My boy doesn't have to answer to you.

546
00:53:31.461 --> 00:53:33.255
No. he...

547
00:53:33.964 --> 00:53:35.340
he does not.

548
00:53:36.008 --> 00:53:38.594
And we don't have to answer to you.

549
00:53:42.097 --> 00:53:44.224
Whoa.

550
00:53:44.308 --> 00:53:46.310
Whew!

551
00:53:46.894 --> 00:53:48.520
We better get some food in our bellies

552
00:53:48.604 --> 00:53:52.107
before this get-together
turns into a real blood feud.

553
00:53:52.191 --> 00:53:53.901
- And we got numbers on you.
- Yeah.

554
00:53:56.862 --> 00:54:01.033
Oh. why. here come the newlyweds now.

555
00:54:11.877 --> 00:54:12.878
Lorna.

556
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.757
H-Hi. George.

557
00:54:18.926 --> 00:54:20.177
Hi. Jimmy.

558
00:54:24.556 --> 00:54:26.266
- May I?
- Oh.

559
00:54:31.396 --> 00:54:33.065
Oh...

560
00:54:33.732 --> 00:54:36.151
He's turning into quite a load.

561
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:39.446
I told you. you carry him too much.

562
00:54:40.697 --> 00:54:42.115
How's he supposed to learn?

563
00:54:42.199 --> 00:54:44.451
Learn what? How to walk?
He knows how to walk.

564
00:54:44.535 --> 00:54:46.328
Well. hell. I'd probably
unlearn how to myself

565
00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:49.206
if someone carried me
everywhere I wanted to go.

566
00:54:50.123 --> 00:54:52.209
It's flat-out spoiling him.

567
00:54:52.292 --> 00:54:55.045
- He weighs nothing.
- Has he eaten?

568
00:54:55.128 --> 00:54:57.172
Got him a burger at Ressler's
while we were waiting.

569
00:54:57.256 --> 00:54:58.882
Did he eat it?

570
00:54:58.966 --> 00:55:00.717
Half.

571
00:55:00.801 --> 00:55:02.594
Do you want a pork chop. huh?

572
00:55:02.678 --> 00:55:04.346
- Some potatoes?
- No.

573
00:55:04.429 --> 00:55:05.556
Huh?

574
00:55:05.639 --> 00:55:08.183
- Should I cut up a little meat for you?
- No.

575
00:55:08.767 --> 00:55:10.727
What was that?
What are you supposed to say?

576
00:55:10.811 --> 00:55:12.563
No. thank you.

577
00:55:14.314 --> 00:55:16.233
Take him up to bed then.

578
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.403
What? He just got here.

579
00:55:19.486 --> 00:55:22.030
We believe in early to bed in this house.

580
00:55:22.865 --> 00:55:26.827
And we believe in walking
upstairs on our own two feet.

581
00:55:31.748 --> 00:55:34.585
Easy now. Grandma.

582
00:55:36.461 --> 00:55:39.131
You know who makes the rules around here.

583
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:32.100
There was mustard.

584
00:56:32.643 --> 00:56:34.394
There was mustard?

585
00:56:35.062 --> 00:56:36.647
On your hamburger?

586
00:56:38.815 --> 00:56:40.817
You don't like mustard. do you?

587
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:43.987
Off you go!

588
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:45.322
Up the stairs!

589
00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:54.373
Come on. Jimmy.

590
00:56:58.502 --> 00:57:00.045
Jimmy.

591
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:13.892
That's enough.

592
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.855
Well. now you know where to find us.
you'll have to visit more often.

593
00:57:18.897 --> 00:57:20.482
We thank you. but we'll...

594
00:57:21.024 --> 00:57:22.526
be on our way.

595
00:57:25.988 --> 00:57:27.781
Hey. Blackledges!

596
00:57:27.865 --> 00:57:29.533
Hold up there!

597
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:33.537
You need me to show you the way?

598
00:57:35.873 --> 00:57:38.125
You know. if you left
a trail of bread crumbs.

599
00:57:38.208 --> 00:57:41.879
the coyotes would've got 'em by now.
or they're washed away.

600
00:57:45.257 --> 00:57:47.551
You know. she won't say so.

601
00:57:47.634 --> 00:57:51.180
but I can tell. you running off like this.
you hurt Blanche's feelings.

602
00:57:51.263 --> 00:57:52.890
Her feelings?

603
00:57:52.973 --> 00:57:55.475
We've come all this way to see Jimmy.

604
00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:58.270
and she gives us two minutes'
time to visit with him...

605
00:58:00.022 --> 00:58:02.399
Go back inside. Mr. Weboy.

606
00:58:02.482 --> 00:58:04.193
Why was your car locked?

607
00:58:17.456 --> 00:58:19.791
What are you doing out here?

608
00:58:22.085 --> 00:58:23.837
Damned if I know.

609
00:59:09.716 --> 00:59:11.426
Today's Friday. right?

610
00:59:12.928 --> 00:59:14.346
It is.

611
00:59:16.431 --> 00:59:18.892
Do you think Lorna will be
working tomorrow?

612
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:23.897
It's not quite as slimming
as this would be.

613
00:59:23.981 --> 00:59:26.149
You know. beautiful white shirt like this.

614
00:59:26.984 --> 00:59:28.819
- I'll take it.
- Oh.

615
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:38.245
So just these two things for you then?

616
00:59:38.328 --> 00:59:39.538
Yes. thank you.

617
00:59:50.048 --> 00:59:51.592
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

618
00:59:51.675 --> 00:59:53.385
7.50. ma'am.

619
01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:04.396
I didn't think you'd just go home.

620
01:00:05.272 --> 01:00:06.690
I'm like a bad penny.

621
01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:10.444
Who watches Jimmy while you're here?

622
01:00:10.527 --> 01:00:11.778
Who do you think?

623
01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:13.906
Donnie. His mom.

624
01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:19.578
Or maybe you think I just tie him
to a tree until I get home.

625
01:00:23.498 --> 01:00:26.585
- You're a good mother. Lorna. I know that.
- Right.

626
01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:31.882
I was merely wondering how things
are going for you with this new job.

627
01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.510
Well. I just started. so...

628
01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:38.639
We don't want to get you
in trouble. sweetheart.

629
01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:40.224
Can we buy you lunch?

630
01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:42.809
- My break isn't until noon.
- Noon?

631
01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:45.562
- Straight up?
- We'll meet you outside.

632
01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:48.607
No. I'll meet you at Ressler's.

633
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:50.067
It's across the street.

634
01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:02.371
<i>I was going to write.
Once we got settled.</i>

635
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.084
It was kind of a last-minute decision.
coming here.

636
01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:12.172
- That Donnie's decision?
- You met Blanche.

637
01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:16.593
Well. we found you.
That's what's important.

638
01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:18.637
Jimmy looks bigger.

639
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.430
- He's growing so fast.
- There you are.

640
01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:22.266
He's counting to ten now.

641
01:01:22.891 --> 01:01:26.395
He used to just say the words. you know.
but now he understands they go in order.

642
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.982
And I'm working with him on his alphabet.

643
01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:31.525
He can spell his name.

644
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.611
Smart right from the start.

645
01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:41.869
He misses you. both of you.

646
01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:45.497
We miss him too.

647
01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:48.417
Both of you.

648
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.544
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about. Lorna.

649
01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:53.589
And I won't... beat around the bush.

650
01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:00.053
I remember when James first introduced us.

651
01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:03.765
This wonderful girl
he told us so much about.

652
01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:05.976
so beautiful and funny and...

653
01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.603
No family of her own. but...

654
01:02:07.686 --> 01:02:10.230
Thought you weren't gonna
beat around the bush.

655
01:02:10.314 --> 01:02:13.442
I have to be back at the store by 1:00.
Just get to it.

656
01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:16.695
All right. Well. here it is.

657
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:21.116
Let Jimmy come back with us.

658
01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:25.579
Not just to visit. I mean for good.

659
01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:30.375
You...

660
01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:35.047
You want me to give Jimmy to you?

661
01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:37.799
- Want me to give up my son?
- You know he'd have

662
01:02:37.883 --> 01:02:39.760
a good home. one he knows.
one he remembers...

663
01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.178
Stop.

664
01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:43.263
You know the schools he'd go to.
the teachers he'd have...

665
01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:45.641
No. God. stop! I can't hear this!

666
01:02:51.897 --> 01:02:56.193
I saw Donnie hit Jimmy.

667
01:02:58.737 --> 01:03:00.531
On the street.

668
01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:04.535
I saw him hit you.

669
01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:07.079
And it didn't look like a first time.

670
01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:12.501
A little or a lot. no amount's good.

671
01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:15.420
- That's why we're here...
- You came to take him.

672
01:03:15.504 --> 01:03:17.005
Lorna.

673
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:18.757
We came to help.

674
01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:21.301
Whatever the situation is.

675
01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:23.887
Jimmy can't stay there.

676
01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:26.890
Can't stay here.

677
01:03:28.725 --> 01:03:32.020
- He needs his mother.
- Then come with us.

678
01:03:32.104 --> 01:03:34.273
You and Jimmy.
We'll take care of you.

679
01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.191
Live with us. like before.

680
01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:37.401
Tuna.

681
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.697
- You come and stay with us.
- Pardon me.

682
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.075
There you go.

683
01:03:50.455 --> 01:03:51.874
He'd kill me.

684
01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:54.459
Him and his mother.

685
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.672
She couldn't care less if I fell off
the face of the earth. really.

686
01:03:58.755 --> 01:04:00.883
but she'd never let me go.

687
01:04:00.966 --> 01:04:02.634
Or Jimmy.

688
01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:07.472
Donnie got away from her once.

689
01:04:07.556 --> 01:04:10.142
She's never going to
let that happen again.

690
01:04:12.394 --> 01:04:15.647
I don't want Jimmy to grow up like them.

691
01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:19.359
Don't want him to be like them.

692
01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.323
Then you know what's right.

693
01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:28.035
Honey.

694
01:04:30.454 --> 01:04:32.497
You want us to drive you out there?

695
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:34.041
We can do that.

696
01:04:34.124 --> 01:04:35.542
Right now.

697
01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:37.586
Right. George?

698
01:04:37.669 --> 01:04:39.004
The three of us. we can get Jimmy.

699
01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:41.423
- pack you up. take you back...
- No. No.

700
01:04:46.011 --> 01:04:47.095
I'll meet you.

701
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:52.184
Everybody's usually asleep by midnight.

702
01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:57.147
I'll have to wait to be sure.

703
01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:00.359
We should come get you. sweetheart.

704
01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:03.028
No. This is the way.

705
01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:05.489
The safest way. trust me.

706
01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:09.368
That's... That's what everyone
wants most. isn't it?

707
01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:13.455
For you and Jimmy to be safe. Hmm?

708
01:05:14.873 --> 01:05:15.916
And happy.

709
01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:19.670
We're out at the Moon Wink.

710
01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:23.257
- 'Kay.
- Cabin seven at the Moon Wink Motor...

711
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.259
I heard you. I know where it is.

712
01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:28.595
I should be there by 2:00.

713
01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:32.641
But we have to leave
right when I get there.

714
01:05:32.724 --> 01:05:33.892
No waiting.

715
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.356
Okay.

716
01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:41.233
Lorna. wait.

717
01:05:42.943 --> 01:05:44.403
Wait. Lorna.

718
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:47.823
I...

719
01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:51.994
I know we haven't always
seen eye to eye. but...

720
01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:54.830
I don't think we've ever seen eye to eye.

721
01:05:56.748 --> 01:05:58.792
Well... we will.

722
01:05:59.793 --> 01:06:01.879
You're just saying that
to make sure that I go with you.

723
01:06:05.174 --> 01:06:06.592
Jimmy needs his mother.

724
01:06:09.928 --> 01:06:11.805
You could've used one too.

725
01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:17.603
I could've been that to you.

726
01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:20.355
I should've been.

727
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.233
But I wasn't.

728
01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:26.653
It's okay.

729
01:06:28.405 --> 01:06:29.698
I'm sorry. Lorna.

730
01:06:33.493 --> 01:06:36.371
I should've been... much more to you.

731
01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:17.014
Don't start what you can't finish.

732
01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:50.796
Can you...
answer something for me?

733
01:08:51.965 --> 01:08:53.008
Okay.

734
01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:57.220
That horse of yours. Strawberry.

735
01:08:57.304 --> 01:08:58.971
Strawberry?

736
01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:01.892
I loved that horse.

737
01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:04.144
What brought that up?

738
01:09:05.312 --> 01:09:06.939
Seeing you ride again.

739
01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:08.106
Hmm.

740
01:09:11.318 --> 01:09:15.781
Something I always wondered about.
when we had to put her down.

741
01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:20.035
You whispered to her. Do you remember?

742
01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.953
Yeah.

743
01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:25.249
Like you were telling secrets.

744
01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.712
What was it you told her?

745
01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:39.054
I reminded her of things.

746
01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:45.102
How she liked to gallop through
the first snow every year.

747
01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:47.395
About the time we raced Ernie Dahlberg

748
01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:50.189
and his big chocolate mare
and left them choking in our dust.

749
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:54.653
I reminded her of this one time.

750
01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:57.072
I was in high school...
it was some October.

751
01:09:57.155 --> 01:09:59.116
and we were heading home.

752
01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:02.578
And the full moon was just
coming up over Dollar Butte.

753
01:10:03.412 --> 01:10:04.872
And she stopped.

754
01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:07.416
Stopped and stared.

755
01:10:07.499 --> 01:10:09.751
Like she cared about
the moonrise as much as me.

756
01:10:13.046 --> 01:10:16.675
And when we put James on her back
for the very first time...

757
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.762
she stood so still.

758
01:10:22.681 --> 01:10:25.100
Like she knew she had to take care of him.

759
01:10:34.902 --> 01:10:37.988
I wanted to send her on her way
with happy memories.

760
01:10:43.952 --> 01:10:45.579
I'm sorry.

761
01:10:46.788 --> 01:10:49.249
Sorry? Why?

762
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.251
I made you sad. That's...

763
01:10:52.753 --> 01:10:54.338
That's not what I wanted.

764
01:10:56.465 --> 01:10:59.092
You didn't make me sad. George.

765
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.311
What I wanted is to tell you...

766
01:11:11.855 --> 01:11:13.941
tell you what sticks with me.

767
01:11:17.486 --> 01:11:18.987
Strawberry and you.

768
01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:24.451
This woman I married but can't figure.

769
01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:29.831
Who doesn't believe
there's any world but this one.

770
01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:33.001
but still believes
a horse has got a soul somehow.

771
01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:39.800
That's the gal for me.

772
01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:10.455
She did seem quick to come around.

773
01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:11.790
Please.

774
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.501
Don't say anything.

775
01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:43.966
Get out.

776
01:13:46.134 --> 01:13:47.719
No. you get the hell out now.

777
01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:50.305
George!

778
01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:54.643
He let us in.

779
01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:58.689
See. you think you can gang up on Lorna.

780
01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:02.734
But when it's done to you.
it's a different story.

781
01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:03.986
What are you talking about?

782
01:14:04.069 --> 01:14:05.612
Oh. is that what you're gonna do?

783
01:14:05.696 --> 01:14:08.907
Pretend like you two
didn't jump Lorna at work?

784
01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:10.033
Shame on you.

785
01:14:10.117 --> 01:14:11.410
Shame on both of you.

786
01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:14.246
badgering and bullying her
to give up her boy.

787
01:14:14.329 --> 01:14:17.666
You're lucky Lorna doesn't have
a little mama grizzly in her.

788
01:14:17.749 --> 01:14:19.585
Come between that kind of mama
and her baby.

789
01:14:19.668 --> 01:14:23.005
you're fixin' to get your hand bit.
or worse than.

790
01:14:23.839 --> 01:14:26.842
Somebody tried to come between
me and one of my boys...

791
01:14:27.759 --> 01:14:31.180
- tried to talk me out of my child...
- That's not what happened.

792
01:14:31.263 --> 01:14:33.557
It's no wonder Lorna don't
want to go with you.

793
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.268
Big bull-hen.

794
01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:38.979
Thinking you know
what's best for everybody.

795
01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:40.606
Pecking you to death. no doubt.

796
01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.691
I never said she shouldn't marry Donnie.

797
01:14:42.774 --> 01:14:44.026
I never said you did.

798
01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:52.075
He hit the boy.

799
01:14:54.453 --> 01:14:57.664
I saw you. across the street
from the grocery.

800
01:14:57.748 --> 01:14:59.625
Is that what all this fuss is about?

801
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:02.461
Grandma. are you gonna tell me
you didn't paddle your own. huh?

802
01:15:02.544 --> 01:15:04.046
Not ever?

803
01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:06.423
He hit Lorna too.

804
01:15:12.221 --> 01:15:13.847
Come here.

805
01:15:21.897 --> 01:15:23.106
You hit your wife?

806
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:26.985
I saw him.

807
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:30.697
- How'd he do it?
- With his hand.

808
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:32.074
With...

809
01:15:33.242 --> 01:15:36.203
Alberta Einstein.
Yeah. I know with his hand.

810
01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:37.746
I'm asking how.

811
01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:40.040
Like...

812
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:42.876
Hmm?

813
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.586
Was it like that?

814
01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:50.050
Donnie. how'd you do it? How was it?

815
01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:53.846
It was harder.

816
01:15:53.929 --> 01:15:55.514
Harder?

817
01:15:58.976 --> 01:16:00.185
Like...

818
01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:03.105
Goddamn it.

819
01:16:06.024 --> 01:16:07.609
Like that?

820
01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:10.737
Like that but harder.

821
01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:14.074
Donnie...

822
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.370
think you're gonna have to
show us how you done it.

823
01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:39.766
Son of...

824
01:16:41.143 --> 01:16:42.895
No!

825
01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:44.396
George!

826
01:16:46.356 --> 01:16:48.734
Oh. no. he's all right. Margaret.
He's fine.

827
01:16:50.319 --> 01:16:51.737
Yeah?

828
01:16:52.487 --> 01:16:55.991
Maybe you want to try talking
this over again now. huh?

829
01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:58.368
Like reasonable folks.

830
01:16:58.452 --> 01:17:00.871
Or maybe you'd prefer getting some sleep.

831
01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:04.291
so you can get an early start
back home tomorrow.

832
01:17:04.374 --> 01:17:07.294
Or maybe...
maybe you'd like to send him home

833
01:17:07.377 --> 01:17:09.755
while you stay on here for a spell.

834
01:17:09.838 --> 01:17:12.716
I could take you back when you're ready.

835
01:17:13.926 --> 01:17:18.972
Of course. by then.
you might decide you want to stay.

836
01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:24.394
It's okay.

837
01:17:24.478 --> 01:17:27.648
It's okay. Easy. girl. Easy. girl.

838
01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:33.570
You stop right there.

839
01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:39.201
You...

840
01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:41.578
you stay away from us.

841
01:17:47.876 --> 01:17:49.628
- Get him! Get the gun!
- Get him! Get him!

842
01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:50.754
Get him up!

843
01:17:50.838 --> 01:17:53.048
No.

844
01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:01.974
Please.

845
01:18:20.409 --> 01:18:21.952
Donnie.

846
01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:27.499
What do you want me to do?

847
01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.460
You make sure he can't
pull a gun on us again.

848
01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:33.046
No!

849
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.092
- Right here.
- No!

850
01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:39.887
No.

851
01:18:41.305 --> 01:18:43.265
- No.
- No!

852
01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:47.853
No!

853
01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:50.731
Go on. Donnie.

854
01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:52.191
Come on.

855
01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:02.451
- Stop.
- I'm teaching you to teach him. see?

856
01:19:02.534 --> 01:19:04.328
Donnie.

857
01:19:05.746 --> 01:19:07.581
- Donnie. don't! Donnie. Donnie.
- Donnie.

858
01:19:08.373 --> 01:19:10.042
You don't have to do this.

859
01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:13.420
Please. Donnie! Please. Donnie.
Please. Donnie.

860
01:19:13.504 --> 01:19:15.088
- Donnie. don't do it. Don't do it.
- Do it. boy.

861
01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:17.216
- Do it. boy.
- Donnie! Don't do it!

862
01:19:17.799 --> 01:19:19.551
- Donnie.
- Don't do it!

863
01:19:25.474 --> 01:19:27.100
Oh. my God!

864
01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:29.937
George. Oh. my God.

865
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.314
George. George.

866
01:19:32.397 --> 01:19:35.108
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

867
01:19:35.192 --> 01:19:36.985
Well. he won't be shooting for a while.

868
01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:53.418
Maybe you understand my family now.

869
01:19:56.255 --> 01:19:58.090
Safe driving. you two.

870
01:20:02.052 --> 01:20:04.221
George.

871
01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:06.223
George. George. George.

872
01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:07.808
Oh. my God.

873
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:10.519
What have I done to you? Oh. my God.

874
01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:22.155
He's gonna need morphine.

875
01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.575
It's okay.

876
01:20:25.617 --> 01:20:29.830
- This was an ax. you said?
- Was a... Was a hatchet.

877
01:20:29.913 --> 01:20:31.498
Police are on their way.

878
01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:35.878
Look. I can put you under
or I can numb it up and you stay...

879
01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:37.337
Awake. right.

880
01:20:37.421 --> 01:20:38.797
- Awake.
- I'll stay awake.

881
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.632
Yeah. you're okay.

882
01:20:40.716 --> 01:20:41.925
Awake.

883
01:20:42.009 --> 01:20:43.969
Ma'am. you're welcome
to wait outside.

884
01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:46.555
What?

885
01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:30.307
Well...

886
01:21:30.974 --> 01:21:33.936
Now. I already been over to the Weboys'.
had a chance to hear their side.

887
01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:35.729
Their side?

888
01:21:35.812 --> 01:21:37.022
Side of what?

889
01:21:37.898 --> 01:21:41.151
Their account is that it's Mr. Blackledge
here who pulled a gun.

890
01:21:41.235 --> 01:21:42.986
In self-defense.

891
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:45.322
That your service revolver
Blanche showed me?

892
01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:48.534
I'm sure it is.

893
01:21:48.617 --> 01:21:51.828
- You wore the badge once.
- He wore it over 30 years.

894
01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:53.288
Well...

895
01:21:54.289 --> 01:21:56.250
then you know how the law works.

896
01:21:56.834 --> 01:21:58.710
I have...

897
01:21:58.794 --> 01:22:01.171
I have a fair idea
I know how it works here.

898
01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:05.634
Blanche explained
that things got a tad rough

899
01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:07.803
persuading you to set your weapon down.

900
01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:09.179
They chopped his hand off.

901
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.807
Yeah. well. the way they tell it. you two.

902
01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:15.185
you came here looking to take
a child away from his mother.

903
01:22:15.269 --> 01:22:17.396
First with talk... well. threats...

904
01:22:17.479 --> 01:22:19.439
and then a gun.

905
01:22:19.523 --> 01:22:21.859
Lorna. the boy's mother. did you see her?

906
01:22:21.942 --> 01:22:23.235
Oh. sure. she was there.

907
01:22:23.318 --> 01:22:25.612
Did you speak with her?
She's terrified of them.

908
01:22:25.696 --> 01:22:28.198
She was married to your son. right?

909
01:22:29.116 --> 01:22:30.659
Yes.

910
01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:31.827
Hmm.

911
01:22:32.661 --> 01:22:34.413
And he died. right? He's dead.

912
01:22:35.247 --> 01:22:36.915
How exactly did that happen?

913
01:22:39.459 --> 01:22:40.836
Why don't you tell us?

914
01:22:42.671 --> 01:22:45.841
Well. um... an accident. she said.

915
01:22:46.758 --> 01:22:50.679
You know. was thrown from his horse.
broke his neck. snapped in two.

916
01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:55.350
An accident.

917
01:22:55.934 --> 01:22:58.478
And it's an accident.

918
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.483
You know. and Blanche...

919
01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:07.654
she expressed real concern about
how accidents follow your family.

920
01:23:10.199 --> 01:23:12.951
She fears for that little one
she's looking after now.

921
01:23:14.369 --> 01:23:17.748
How the longer you two stick around.
the chances of something happening to him.

922
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:20.542
well. those chances.
they just keep creeping up.

923
01:23:21.877 --> 01:23:25.672
I don't even want to contemplate
what a tragedy that would be.

924
01:23:26.882 --> 01:23:30.844
There's nothing smaller in this world
than a kid's casket.

925
01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:35.724
Get out.

926
01:23:36.558 --> 01:23:38.435
Well. the consensus over there
is that you two won't be

927
01:23:38.519 --> 01:23:39.811
causing any more trouble around here.

928
01:23:39.895 --> 01:23:43.398
And because you're family. by a way.
the Weboys won't be pressing any charges.

929
01:23:43.482 --> 01:23:46.068
So you're free to go.

930
01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:48.946
But. you know.
if I were giving out advice...

931
01:23:49.029 --> 01:23:50.113
You can save that.

932
01:23:50.197 --> 01:23:52.658
Well. see. I'm thinking of
your grandson here.

933
01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:56.119
He's a Weboy now.

934
01:23:59.748 --> 01:24:02.251
It's best you put Gladstone behind you.

935
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:05.671
Just as quick as you can.

936
01:24:19.059 --> 01:24:21.061
Hey. pull over.

937
01:24:22.187 --> 01:24:25.399
- What's wrong?
- Goddamn it.

938
01:24:25.482 --> 01:24:26.525
Pull over.

939
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:46.962
George.

940
01:24:47.045 --> 01:24:49.214
Are you all right? Talk to me.

941
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.467
I'm fine.

942
01:24:57.347 --> 01:24:59.183
I needed to pull over is all.

943
01:26:01.036 --> 01:26:03.080
Where in the hell are we?

944
01:26:42.661 --> 01:26:43.996
So what will you do?

945
01:26:45.372 --> 01:26:46.748
I don't know.

946
01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:50.169
Well. I heard what them Weboys
done to you.

947
01:26:52.212 --> 01:26:54.381
Except I didn't know it was you.

948
01:26:55.799 --> 01:26:56.884
What did you hear?

949
01:26:56.967 --> 01:26:59.678
Well. that they chopped
somebody's arm off.

950
01:27:00.554 --> 01:27:02.347
Who told you that?

951
01:27:03.223 --> 01:27:05.475
My uncle. In Gladstone.

952
01:27:06.643 --> 01:27:08.770
So you have family in town then.

953
01:27:08.854 --> 01:27:13.233
An uncle and an aunt.
They sell skins for me.

954
01:27:13.317 --> 01:27:15.068
And other stuff.

955
01:27:15.152 --> 01:27:17.571
Why do you live
all the way out here then?

956
01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:19.448
All alone.

957
01:27:19.531 --> 01:27:21.742
It's not where you're from.

958
01:27:25.078 --> 01:27:27.664
'Cause I ran away from
that school in Bismarck.

959
01:27:40.886 --> 01:27:44.890
The government agents
came into the house when I was eight.

960
01:27:47.351 --> 01:27:50.437
They took me and put me in their truck.

961
01:27:53.774 --> 01:27:57.778
You know. I thought I did something wrong
and that my mother didn't want me anymore.

962
01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:03.909
But then I could see she was crying.

963
01:28:06.537 --> 01:28:07.996
All the mothers were.

964
01:28:09.456 --> 01:28:11.083
You were eight?

965
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:14.920
They cut my hair off.

966
01:28:16.505 --> 01:28:18.382
And washed me in kerosene.

967
01:28:19.132 --> 01:28:20.634
And beat me.

968
01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:24.137
To kill the Indian inside.

969
01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:29.017
I guess they did.

970
01:28:30.811 --> 01:28:32.563
So when I came home.

971
01:28:32.646 --> 01:28:35.691
I couldn't understand
my grandmother's words anymore.

972
01:28:36.733 --> 01:28:38.235
"I'm Peter now."

973
01:28:39.278 --> 01:28:40.863
Tried to tell her.

974
01:28:43.448 --> 01:28:45.200
She couldn't understand me. either.

975
01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:52.875
If I don't belong anyplace...

976
01:28:56.795 --> 01:28:58.338
here is fine.

977
01:29:02.134 --> 01:29:03.844
You picked a good spot.

978
01:29:06.555 --> 01:29:08.432
But it's not good to be alone.

979
01:29:09.224 --> 01:29:10.976
I'm not alone.

980
01:29:16.356 --> 01:29:17.858
I'm talking to you.

981
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.376
I have an idea.

982
01:29:38.337 --> 01:29:40.005
Yeah.

983
01:29:40.088 --> 01:29:41.632
That's not a first.

984
01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:43.967
Let me finish
before you make fun of me.

985
01:29:44.051 --> 01:29:46.803
And if you don't know what to say.
don't say anything.

986
01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.392
- Let's hear it.
- What if we stayed?

987
01:29:53.477 --> 01:29:55.103
Here.

988
01:29:55.187 --> 01:29:58.148
I'm sure Peter would be
glad of the company.

989
01:29:58.232 --> 01:29:59.816
We could build onto this place.

990
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:03.654
We could put another room on the kitchen.
Or we could build a place of our own.

991
01:30:05.197 --> 01:30:08.659
You hold the boards while
I hammer in the nails. That it?

992
01:30:08.742 --> 01:30:11.203
You said you'd let me finish.

993
01:30:12.496 --> 01:30:14.790
You're finished now.
You just don't know it.

994
01:30:15.707 --> 01:30:18.919
You really want us to live out here
in the middle of nowhere with a...

995
01:30:19.753 --> 01:30:21.922
Indian boy and a lost horse?

996
01:30:22.923 --> 01:30:26.343
Just so you can. what.
drive into town every now and again.

997
01:30:26.426 --> 01:30:28.262
try and catch a peek at Jimmy?

998
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:35.394
You'll follow him to school
and hope time untwists a sour mind

999
01:30:35.477 --> 01:30:39.314
and Blanche Weboy lets you hold him again
for longer than 30 seconds' time?

1000
01:30:41.024 --> 01:30:43.026
When they come again...

1001
01:30:43.944 --> 01:30:46.154
hack off another couple pieces...

1002
01:30:46.238 --> 01:30:50.033
or they start taking pieces of you.
if there's anything left

1003
01:30:50.117 --> 01:30:51.952
once you're done tearing yourself apart?

1004
01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:53.453
What then?

1005
01:30:54.454 --> 01:30:57.499
And when they hurt Jimmy?
And they will. just for spite.

1006
01:30:59.042 --> 01:31:00.878
How you gonna feel then?

1007
01:31:04.464 --> 01:31:06.008
First time I held him.

1008
01:31:06.967 --> 01:31:10.470
he arranged himself
just right in my arms

1009
01:31:10.554 --> 01:31:12.598
and snug to me.

1010
01:31:12.681 --> 01:31:14.349
And light as can be. like feathers...

1011
01:31:14.433 --> 01:31:16.518
Jesus Christ. Margaret!

1012
01:31:18.562 --> 01:31:21.106
When are you gonna stop
torturing yourself?

1013
01:31:30.657 --> 01:31:31.950
I tried.

1014
01:31:33.744 --> 01:31:35.120
I'm sorry.

1015
01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:40.167
I tried. George.

1016
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:42.252
I know.

1017
01:31:46.924 --> 01:31:49.426
But I couldn't save him.

1018
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:51.303
God help me.

1019
01:31:56.141 --> 01:31:57.184
Shh.

1020
01:32:00.896 --> 01:32:02.189
Hey. Shh.

1021
01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:05.609
We lost them both.

1022
01:32:33.136 --> 01:32:36.265
George! George!

1023
01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:47.484
Even as fast as you are.
I don't think you're gonna catch him.

1024
01:32:47.568 --> 01:32:50.153
If he's going where I think.
he'll have to take the road.

1025
01:32:50.237 --> 01:32:52.948
- You're gonna show me a quicker way.
- I'm gonna...

1026
01:32:53.991 --> 01:32:56.577
- I'm not going.
- You are.

1027
01:36:15.984 --> 01:36:18.403
Settle.

1028
01:36:19.488 --> 01:36:21.031
Be still.

1029
01:36:22.115 --> 01:36:24.326
Wake her up. Wake her.

1030
01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.496
- Lorna.
- What?

1031
01:36:30.123 --> 01:36:32.835
You want to go back to Dalton?
You and Jimmy?

1032
01:36:33.877 --> 01:36:36.129
You have to decide.
Go or stay.

1033
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.800
- Lorna. ple...
- Not you.

1034
01:36:40.717 --> 01:36:43.053
You don't get to say a goddamn word.

1035
01:36:44.429 --> 01:36:46.640
This is up to her.

1036
01:36:47.599 --> 01:36:49.434
You know what life will be.

1037
01:36:49.518 --> 01:36:50.936
Here or there. you know.

1038
01:36:51.854 --> 01:36:53.647
This isn't something you need to think on.

1039
01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:55.190
I'll go.

1040
01:36:58.235 --> 01:37:01.196
You know the car.
It's at the bottom of the drive.

1041
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.447
The keys are in it.

1042
01:37:03.073 --> 01:37:05.659
Drive straight to the sheriff's office
in Bentrock. Ask for Nevelson.

1043
01:37:05.742 --> 01:37:07.703
- Bentrock.
- Sheriff Nevelson.

1044
01:37:08.704 --> 01:37:11.039
- He'll sort this out.
- Jimmy's things.

1045
01:37:11.123 --> 01:37:13.333
- I need to get...
- No. Out now.

1046
01:37:25.095 --> 01:37:26.555
But what about you?

1047
01:37:28.348 --> 01:37:29.683
Just go.

1048
01:37:30.434 --> 01:37:31.560
- No...
- Just go.

1049
01:37:31.643 --> 01:37:33.812
Quiet as you can. Take the front door.

1050
01:37:34.813 --> 01:37:36.648
Then you run like hell.

1051
01:37:50.412 --> 01:37:51.413
Grandpa.

1052
01:38:09.806 --> 01:38:12.392
Something's burning.
Hey. something's burning! Come on!

1053
01:38:13.852 --> 01:38:15.812
- You leave that stove on?
- Mm-mmm.

1054
01:38:28.367 --> 01:38:29.701
What the hell is going on?

1055
01:38:29.785 --> 01:38:32.746
Bill. the... the house is on fire.

1056
01:38:32.829 --> 01:38:35.582
Uh... w-we smelled smoke.

1057
01:38:37.793 --> 01:38:40.128
- Hold on. Hold on.
- No!

1058
01:38:48.428 --> 01:38:49.680
Help!

1059
01:38:50.305 --> 01:38:52.224
- No. No.
- Hold on. Hold on.

1060
01:38:52.307 --> 01:38:54.476
- No! Get your hands off of him!
- Don't! Don't!

1061
01:39:19.084 --> 01:39:20.085
Jimmy.

1062
01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.299
