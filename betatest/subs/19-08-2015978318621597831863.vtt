00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:16.766
It's been 4 weeks since
I asked for a nanny.

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:21.307
If you tell me you're still looking.
how should I respond?

00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:26.557
I told you many times.
I don't care about paying more.

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.641
I said it's urgent for work.

00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:36.140
Please look for a nanny properly.

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.308
Ina. our new home is

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.723
really quiet and has clean air too.

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:58.807
The doctor said it'd be good for you.

00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:03.057
Once you live there.
you'll grow to love it.

00:04:09.142 --> 00:04:10.266
Sweetie.

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:12.474
That doll there.

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:13.807
it's a limited edition.

00:04:13.932 --> 00:04:16.099
It was really hard getting it.

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:18.892
You should be thanking me.

WRITTEN AND DIRECTED
BY KIM KWANG-BIN

00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:05.598
Ina!

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.890
Yeon Ina!

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.184
Ina!

00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:47.141
Sweetie!

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:50.349
You can't run off like that.
I looked everywhere for you.

00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:04.516
Ina. that's our new home.

00:06:05.308 --> 00:06:06.432
Do you like it?

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:30.849
"You should've come early."

00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:33.306
"You missed Ina getting the award."

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.058
You know about my new project.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:40.016
It's a state of emergency.

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:42.431
Do you even know
what your birthday gift to her was?

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:44.682
It's this necklace.

00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:48.474
She wears it everyday since
I told her it's from you.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.349
Honey!

00:08:12.683 --> 00:08:15.307
"Panic attack isn't something
that gets better with some rest."

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:17.390
"It needs constant care."

00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:19.850
Or you'll have seizures again.

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:24.642
Set an alarm and medicate regularly.

00:08:24.683 --> 00:08:29.390
I can take care of myself.
but Ina's not getting better.

00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:31.182
"Is she in bad shape?"

00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:33.141
She won't even lock eyes with me.

00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:36.348
- "She'll get better in clean air environment."
- (Architect of the Year)

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.057
"You moved there for that reason."

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:43.017
It's just frustrating.
I'm doing everything possible.

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:48.015
"The last resort would be
the art camp I mentioned."

00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:51.391
"but you two will be apart.
so I don't recommend it."

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:55.350
"You're in treatment too.
that's what worries me."

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.307
I'm more concerned with her.

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:06.932
"Dad. watch me run!"

00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:09.517
"Okay. my little star. do your best!"

00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:15.973
Yeah. listen to me.

00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:20.057
Wasn't I supposed to handle everything
from concept to finish?

00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:22.140
"But you're never here."

00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:24.057
I'm not saying I won't go!

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:25.515
It's because of the kid!

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:29.391
Listen. this is a unilateral
contract termination.

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:30.642
Am I wrong?

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.849
Let's talk face-to-face.
I'll come to the site.

00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:38.599
"Happy birthday to you!"

00:09:38.642 --> 00:09:42.100
"My lovely Ina."

00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:44.974
"happy birthday to you!"

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.181
"Blow out the candles."

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.766
"or I will."

00:09:49.808 --> 00:09:51.015
"No way!"

00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:57.516
- "What was your wish?"
- "Secret!"

00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:00.308
- "You won't tell me?"
- "Nope!"

00:11:54.558 --> 00:11:55.517
Ina!

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:03.349
What happened. sweetie?

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.974
Did you scream just now?

00:12:06.724 --> 00:12:08.307
I didn't scream.

00:12:10.224 --> 00:12:11.556
Is everything okay?

00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:12.516
Yup.

00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:18.974
Can I come in for a bit?

00:12:19.724 --> 00:12:20.641
Yup.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.181
That's weird.

00:12:27.933 --> 00:12:29.641
You really didn't scream?

00:12:29.684 --> 00:12:30.808
Nope.

00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:43.641
Where did you get that doll?

00:12:44.642 --> 00:12:45.808
It was in here.

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:47.725
- In there?
- Yup.

00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:49.890
Hold on.

00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:02.433
You know that doll I bought you recently?

00:13:02.475 --> 00:13:04.392
I think it'd be more fun to play with that.

00:13:05.182 --> 00:13:07.432
Dad. can I keep this?

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:09.683
Someone else played with it. it's dirty.

00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:11.098
Give it to me. I'll throw it out.

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:15.723
I want to play with both dolls.

00:13:21.558 --> 00:13:22.682
Are you really okay?

00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:24.183
Yup.

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:26.850
All right.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:29.557
Sleep early.

00:13:30.932 --> 00:13:32.014
Okay.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.224
Thank you for the meal.

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:15.057
Dad. can I play in my room?

00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:17.057
You want to?

00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:33.890
I like this house.

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:36.723
I got a friend too.

00:14:39.266 --> 00:14:41.182
That's great. Ina. thank you.

00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:55.682
"Why is Hyun-sang in the conversation?"

00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:59.722
If we share the design.
the concept will get tangled up.

00:15:00.391 --> 00:15:02.932
What does he know about galleries?

00:15:02.974 --> 00:15:04.681
He hasn't even done a 2-floor cabin.

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:09.141
While you were on leave.
he did a gallery in Jeju.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.849
He's doing well. like you in your prime.

00:15:13.932 --> 00:15:15.474
Honestly.

00:15:16.058 --> 00:15:19.015
they just wanted him. but I championed you.

00:15:19.308 --> 00:15:20.475
What a load of crap...

00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:22.682
The boss is asking.

00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:26.806
how an architect designs
when he's not even on site.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.766
It's all been agreed to!

00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:31.267
I'd come down as soon as I find a nanny!

00:15:32.058 --> 00:15:34.682
It's been over a month now.

00:15:34.724 --> 00:15:36.349
We're out of time.

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:40.515
Why is he here?

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.933
Yeah. that's odd.

00:15:43.683 --> 00:15:46.099
Why is Hyun-sang here? Out on a stroll?

00:15:48.308 --> 00:15:50.307
So it's already been decided.

00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:53.308
No way. dude.

00:15:56.142 --> 00:15:59.182
I'll come down. so get rid of him.

00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:01.559
What?

00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:03.349
I'll report to the site!

00:16:42.933 --> 00:16:45.016
"Stop moving!"

00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:46.682
"Don't fool around!"

00:16:46.724 --> 00:16:49.764
"Hold on!"

00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:57.098
Ina. what were you doing?

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.598
I was making a song for you.

00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:02.099
Wanna hear it?

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:06.433
Ina.

00:17:08.267 --> 00:17:10.224
I have to tell you something.

00:17:11.517 --> 00:17:15.017
Remember how I said I was designing
a museum in Tongyeong?

00:17:15.808 --> 00:17:18.099
That job is starting.

00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.889
so I need to work at the
site for a little while.

00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:25.806
A nanny will stay here with you.

00:17:27.183 --> 00:17:28.308
How long?

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.849
About 2 months?

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.265
But I'll come home every
weekend to see you.

00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:35.223
Can I come with you?

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:39.140
I really want you to come with me.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.557
but it's a construction
site. so it's bad for you.

00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:46.724
If you're understanding and help me out.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.932
I'll buy you a present.

00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:52.640
You were gonna do whatever you want.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:54.933
Why bother asking?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.808
Honey.

00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:05.515
I'm not doing whatever I want.

00:18:06.516 --> 00:18:09.224
I want to find a way together.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.516
But if you always give me
an attitude like this.

00:18:13.557 --> 00:18:15.848
I don't know what to do.

00:18:18.016 --> 00:18:22.056
Could you try to understand
and think in my shoes?

00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:26.558
I'll think about what you want.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.725
Ina. let's talk again.

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.432
Ina. it's late. get to bed!

00:23:01.265 --> 00:23:04.222
(Decide if you'll come or not by tomorrow.)

00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:13.515
"How is the art camp treatment done?"

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.100
"They'll start with isolation treatment."

00:23:16.849 --> 00:23:18.432
"Will she be okay?"

00:23:18.474 --> 00:23:20.599
"Being away from me. since
her mom's gone too."

00:23:21.516 --> 00:23:23.975
"It won't be easy. but what can you do?"

00:23:24.016 --> 00:23:25.389
"It's too much for you."

00:23:26.307 --> 00:23:29.640
"They take only a few kids.
so you'll need to donate."

00:23:30.223 --> 00:23:31.598
"Think about it."

00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:36.307
Where are you going?

00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:41.723
Ina. I'm going to the site for a bit.

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:42.849
I'll be right back.

00:23:42.891 --> 00:23:44.264
You said we'll talk again.

00:23:45.017 --> 00:23:47.432
Can't think of what to buy me?

00:23:49.099 --> 00:23:50.181
Ina.

00:23:51.433 --> 00:23:52.891
Let's talk tonight.

00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:56.891
And that doll in New York. I ordered it.

00:23:56.933 --> 00:23:58.306
It'll arrive soon.

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:05.307
Do you know how old I am?
I don't need those dumb dolls.

00:24:06.058 --> 00:24:07.098
Ina.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.849
You said you liked that doll.

00:24:11.017 --> 00:24:13.099
And why are you talking
like that to your dad?

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.181
Why do you decide what I like?

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.265
Then tell me what you really like!

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.432
I don't need anything.

00:24:23.933 --> 00:24:25.973
- Calls himself 'dad'...
- What?

00:24:26.558 --> 00:24:28.599
- Ina.
- Let go.

00:24:30.183 --> 00:24:32.599
Let go! Let go!

00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:33.973
Let go!

00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:36.140
Let go! Let go!

00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:37.474
Let go! Let go!

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.599
D'you ask for a nanny?

00:24:58.183 --> 00:25:00.933
Yes. hello. I was just heading out.

00:25:00.974 --> 00:25:02.973
$150 for a day.

00:25:04.891 --> 00:25:06.098
Okay.

00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:18.682
Do-hyun. that donation to the art camp.

00:25:19.098 --> 00:25:20.515
how much would be enough?

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:31.849
They're pretty well off.

00:25:32.849 --> 00:25:35.432
The kid's in her room. doing whatever.

00:25:37.933 --> 00:25:39.182
No wife.

00:25:39.557 --> 00:25:43.724
Who knows. maybe she ran off.

00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:47.473
He stashed all the expensive stuff.

00:25:47.517 --> 00:25:49.683
It's so my style.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:09.934
Hey.

00:26:10.683 --> 00:26:11.432
This is Mr. Park.

00:26:11.474 --> 00:26:13.139
- Good work.
- It's so nice to meet you.

00:26:13.182 --> 00:26:15.515
- This is Mr. Kim.
- Great to meet you.

00:26:15.558 --> 00:26:16.599
Good to meet you. sir.

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.932
- Shall we go inside and talk?
- Sure.

00:26:19.517 --> 00:26:23.350
She's screaming and
smashing shit in her room.

00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:26.307
She doesn't eat no matter what I make.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.516
She'll wise up when she starves.

00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:48.681
Crazy little bitch!

00:26:49.849 --> 00:26:53.431
She started today. how
could she just leave?

00:26:55.391 --> 00:26:58.014
Stop giving me a load of shit.

00:26:58.057 --> 00:27:01.682
I'll head home tonight. so
keep her there till then.

00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:05.391
If she took the money.
she must be responsible!

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.223
I can't go right now!

00:27:11.724 --> 00:27:12.848
Okay.

00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:18.266
(Talked to art camp director.
send her next week.)

00:27:49.641 --> 00:27:51.224
I want to go too.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.350
take me with you.

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:08.766
"Come with us..."

00:28:08.808 --> 00:28:13.015
"We'll take you with us..."

00:28:53.975 --> 00:28:58.557
"Missing Child: Yeon Ina (female. 11)"

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:03.766
Thank you all.

00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:20.724
She's not my daughter.

00:29:22.225 --> 00:29:26.350
She's been missing for a month.
and you got nothing?

00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:28.933
It's killing us too.

00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.517
Nothing comes up at all.

00:29:31.308 --> 00:29:32.766
That nanny I hired.

00:29:32.807 --> 00:29:35.557
Ina disappeared shortly after she left.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.517
Let's investigate her once more.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.724
We checked the dash cam
from the car she drove that day.

00:29:40.767 --> 00:29:43.391
and we even did a lie detector test.

00:29:43.432 --> 00:29:44.932
She's clean.

00:29:44.975 --> 00:29:46.683
Please go home and wait.

00:29:46.724 --> 00:29:49.098
You've been telling me to go home
and wait for a month!

00:29:49.141 --> 00:29:50.684
Are you investigating properly?!

00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:53.473
Why the hell are you lashing out at me?!

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.307
- All done.
- Okay.

00:30:05.475 --> 00:30:06.474
All right. Mr. Yeon.

00:30:06.517 --> 00:30:08.016
please look at the camera.

00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:13.057
You can speak freely about Ina.

00:30:20.558 --> 00:30:22.683
Hello. I'm Yeon Sang-won.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.057
This is my daughter. Ina.

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:29.557
She's 11 years old.

00:30:30.307 --> 00:30:35.182
and she disappeared about a month ago.

00:30:37.474 --> 00:30:41.599
I really want to find her. please help.

00:30:45.808 --> 00:30:49.723
"We scoured all security cams."

00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:52.641
"and dash cams in 3km vicinity."

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.933
"but we did not see any traces of her."

00:30:55.974 --> 00:30:59.849
"Her mother died in a car
accident last year."

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.391
"and she lived with her dad."

00:31:01.975 --> 00:31:06.015
"According to people around them.
they weren't in good terms."

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:12.684
"While filming.
we stumbled upon a dozen pill containers."

00:31:13.849 --> 00:31:15.889
"They're all used to
treat mental illnesses."

00:31:16.765 --> 00:31:19.974
"The medication shows
his illnesses must be serious."

00:31:20.015 --> 00:31:22.640
"and he may be experiencing
overlapping symptoms."

00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:26.889
"He was so fixated on work.
to the point that I felt bad."

00:31:27.641 --> 00:31:31.141
"Maybe because he took some time off."

00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:32.931
"he looked nervous and anxious."

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:36.391
"Unfortunately. many of
the missing child cases"

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:39.807
"are linked to family members."

00:31:40.641 --> 00:31:44.723
"Remember the Mi-jin case
we introduced 3 years ago?"

00:31:45.683 --> 00:31:51.392
"There are many similarities
between these two cases."

00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:55.015
"Perhaps this is the point"

00:31:55.058 --> 00:31:59.349
"where we need to look at the case
from another angle."

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:03.058
"A girl who disappeared
from inside her home."

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.474
"where could she be now?"

00:32:06.516 --> 00:32:09.015
"We're waiting for your tips."

00:32:12.724 --> 00:32:14.266
Is this "Behind the Story"?

00:32:20.307 --> 00:32:23.390
(Her dad is suspicious.)

00:32:24.224 --> 00:32:25.557
Man...

00:32:33.558 --> 00:32:35.099
(There is no Internet connection.)

00:32:43.391 --> 00:32:44.432
"Tada!"

00:32:44.766 --> 00:32:46.807
"This is a gift from dad."

00:32:46.849 --> 00:32:48.349
"A butterfly necklace!"

00:32:50.224 --> 00:32:51.348
"It's so pretty!"

00:32:52.141 --> 00:32:53.724
"You love it that much?"

00:32:54.433 --> 00:32:55.889
"Do you want to thank dad?"

00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:58.058
"Thank you. dad!"

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:29.266
Who are you?

00:34:29.308 --> 00:34:31.849
Hello. you called for
an internet technician?

00:34:32.058 --> 00:34:33.474
The door was open.

00:34:34.434 --> 00:34:36.225
This house is so big.

00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:38.599
I'll need to look around
to find the problem.

00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:43.058
This house is humungous.

00:34:44.725 --> 00:34:46.225
Are you an artist?

00:34:47.017 --> 00:34:49.099
Or are you making a house?

00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:52.724
I've always wanted
to live in a big house like this.

00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:55.681
But my family was poor.

00:34:56.558 --> 00:34:57.599
It's not here.

00:34:58.308 --> 00:35:00.141
How do you clean a house like this?

00:35:00.182 --> 00:35:01.765
You'll tire yourself out doing it alone.

00:35:01.807 --> 00:35:03.472
Do you get a maid?

00:35:05.017 --> 00:35:06.892
Really high ceiling too.

00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:09.142
Do you get really high heating bills?

00:35:09.558 --> 00:35:12.683
I'm sure you get government subsidies
for solar panels.

00:35:12.725 --> 00:35:15.765
but you can't tell how efficient
those panels are. right?

00:35:17.433 --> 00:35:19.182
How much is it per square foot?

00:35:19.225 --> 00:35:20.557
Higher than Gangnam?

00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:23.932
You can ask the real estate agency.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.432
Could you just get to fixing the internet?

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:30.639
There are cable problems
out here in the country.

00:35:30.683 --> 00:35:33.516
So the EMF...

00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:47.557
So I'm using an EMF detector
to check the condition.

00:35:49.308 --> 00:35:51.639
Is this how you fix the internet?

00:35:53.683 --> 00:35:54.765
May I?

00:35:55.807 --> 00:35:56.765
Sure.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.932
Excuse me?

00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:14.475
Could I get your business card?

00:36:14.516 --> 00:36:16.599
Wait a minute. that's not important.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.931
I'm about to solve the problem.

00:36:37.641 --> 00:36:40.808
I checked the terminal box just in case.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.891
and someone had cut the cable.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.557
What did you say?

00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:47.600
Didn't you call for an internet technician?

00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:53.142
Sir. could we be civil and talk about this?

00:36:53.184 --> 00:36:54.557
Listen to me. will you?

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.100
Wait a minute!

00:36:55.142 --> 00:36:56.349
Who the hell are you?

00:36:59.142 --> 00:37:00.391
Don't take it the wrong way.

00:37:00.975 --> 00:37:03.475
I needed to check something.
I'm here to help you.

00:37:03.515 --> 00:37:06.140
Are you from the TV show?
I'm not getting fooled twice.

00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.391
I'm calling the cops.

00:37:10.433 --> 00:37:13.225
Didn't Ina's personality change before
she disappeared?

00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:16.390
Acting weird. talking to herself
or screaming in front of the closet.

00:37:19.975 --> 00:37:21.099
How did you know that?

00:37:21.142 --> 00:37:23.349
Ina isn't the first child
to disappear in her house.

00:37:24.059 --> 00:37:26.474
32 kids have disappeared since 1998.

00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:28.016
and I've been at it for 10 years.

00:37:29.849 --> 00:37:33.390
If you Google 'Exorcist
Heo'. you'll find me.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.683
I've been blogged many times
and went on TV shows too.

00:37:37.725 --> 00:37:39.099
(Exorcism at your
service)(Exorcist Heo Kyung-hoon)

00:37:39.142 --> 00:37:42.183
When it comes to exorcism.
I'm pretty much No.1 in Korea.

00:37:42.224 --> 00:37:45.432
Top class fame and skills
but with reasonable rates.

00:37:45.933 --> 00:37:47.475
like this.

00:37:53.725 --> 00:37:55.390
Take a look at this first.

00:37:58.558 --> 00:38:00.808
They all disappeared from their homes.

00:38:01.892 --> 00:38:04.974
Playing. doing homework. sleeping.

00:38:06.142 --> 00:38:08.432
they all vanished without a trace.

00:38:10.975 --> 00:38:12.475
They drew those drawings.

00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:15.807
They all point to a child.

00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:24.141
A girl named Hyun-soo disappeared
like Ina 20 years ago.

00:38:25.766 --> 00:38:29.389
Her parents set up this ritual
to find out if she was dead.

00:39:04.558 --> 00:39:07.641
You saw her. right? That's my mom.

00:39:09.475 --> 00:39:12.183
A few parents of the missing kids said so.

00:39:12.223 --> 00:39:13.890
that they saw her.

00:39:16.642 --> 00:39:18.974
I think she was trying to warn them.

00:39:19.016 --> 00:39:20.891
trying to stop it from taking the kids.

00:39:24.475 --> 00:39:25.642
Shall I continue?

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.348
She killed my mom. took the children.

00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:38.892
and now Ina too.

00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:41.558
It's her.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.974
The source of everything. a demonic child.

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:02.015
How am I supposed to take this in?

00:40:02.891 --> 00:40:04.515
Does this make sense to you?

00:40:05.017 --> 00:40:06.558
A ghost took my child?

00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:09.308
You're just trying to
get paid for a ritual!

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.682
Are you out of your mind?!

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.140
Get out. leave.

00:40:24.225 --> 00:40:27.224
Don't believe me? Okay.

00:40:29.767 --> 00:40:32.099
I'm the only one who believe you.

00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:34.642
Everyone thinks you killed her.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.765
If it's delayed any longer.
she'll be lost forever.

00:40:47.557 --> 00:40:48.598
Wait.

00:40:54.892 --> 00:40:56.557
Can you really find her?

00:41:01.642 --> 00:41:02.390
Yes.

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:11.308
Spirit of the living remains
in the underworld for 49 days.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.850
so-called '49-day memorial rite'.

00:41:13.725 --> 00:41:17.724
It's easily explained in the movie
"Along with the Gods".

00:41:20.682 --> 00:41:22.182
You didn't see that movie?

00:41:22.225 --> 00:41:23.391
Never got to.

00:41:23.433 --> 00:41:25.140
I thought you were cultured.

00:41:25.933 --> 00:41:29.223
In any case. Ina has only 3 days left.

00:41:29.892 --> 00:41:30.850
3 days.

00:41:35.183 --> 00:41:37.725
This is a detector that finds

00:41:38.307 --> 00:41:41.432
objects with wavelengths
beyond quantum mechanics.

00:41:45.432 --> 00:41:47.473
When ghosts appear. this reacts to them.

00:41:53.474 --> 00:41:55.974
So where exactly is Ina right now?

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.183
Realm of the dead.

00:42:01.724 --> 00:42:03.224
We call it the dark realm.

00:42:05.725 --> 00:42:07.182
It means...

00:42:09.182 --> 00:42:11.057
- Let me take a page...
- Don't tear that.

00:42:11.766 --> 00:42:13.057
Jeez...

00:42:24.558 --> 00:42:25.641
Take a look.

00:42:26.475 --> 00:42:30.934
Realm of the living is separated
from realm of the dead.

00:42:30.974 --> 00:42:32.306
They share the side.

00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:35.057
They're stepping on the same space.

00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:37.974
but they can't see each other
because of the border.

00:42:38.015 --> 00:42:42.389
But if the resonance frequency is in sync.

00:42:43.767 --> 00:42:45.391
they can see each other.

00:42:46.391 --> 00:42:47.683
They can cross realms.

00:42:48.391 --> 00:42:49.892
Like the movie "Interstellar".

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.809
The shaman exorcism is like scrubbing
the radio frequency.

00:42:55.517 --> 00:42:57.265
It's often called 'possession'.

00:42:58.307 --> 00:43:01.557
This happens frequently.
so I need protection.

00:43:09.517 --> 00:43:11.725
There is a breed of ghosts
that are especially malicious.

00:43:12.308 --> 00:43:13.973
Like the demon we're after.

00:43:15.016 --> 00:43:18.225
They find people who sync up
and drag them to their realm.

00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:23.265
The victims lose their memories over time.
and are left with only malice.

00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:26.515
They become the Blinded.

00:43:26.557 --> 00:43:29.349
Once they lock eyes.
they'll swallow everything.

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:31.517
they're horrifying beings.

00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:44.557
What can I do to find her?

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.891
We have to capture the
demon to get her back.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:50.641
Beat it up or negotiate. whatever it takes.

00:43:56.849 --> 00:43:59.349
"The child demons are
subconsciously drawn to dolls."

00:44:00.141 --> 00:44:02.725
"When they hold the straw dolls
with my blood on them."

00:44:02.767 --> 00:44:05.432
"it'll generate a tingly sensation."

00:44:05.474 --> 00:44:07.307
"It's like a trap."

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.432
This creates a boundary.

00:44:25.015 --> 00:44:26.765
these are all money.

00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:28.642
Value of these talismans shot up lately!

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:34.140
So yeah. these are expensive.

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:48.889
Watch carefully. it'll come out soon.

00:45:24.058 --> 00:45:25.600
Have you tried this cup noodle?

00:45:26.266 --> 00:45:27.598
It feels so genuine.

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:29.517
It has real fried tofu.

00:45:31.015 --> 00:45:34.182
Who cares about fried tofu.
does this really work?

00:45:34.767 --> 00:45:36.891
Yes. of course.

00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:38.931
Be patient.

00:45:43.016 --> 00:45:45.559
Did it figure us out? Why isn't it coming?

00:45:57.559 --> 00:45:59.100
I hear something.

00:46:22.182 --> 00:46:24.931
Huh? It's Ina's violin.

00:46:48.724 --> 00:46:50.516
My ears...

00:47:06.808 --> 00:47:08.516
She's a bold one.

00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:12.308
Was Ina here?

00:47:14.474 --> 00:47:16.223
Not sure about that.

00:47:17.308 --> 00:47:18.349
We'll try once more.

00:47:18.683 --> 00:47:20.807
with a big doll drenched in blood.

00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:26.181
She's really something.

00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:47.640
Sir.

00:47:48.683 --> 00:47:50.014
Which singers does Ina like?

00:47:50.475 --> 00:47:52.350
BTS? BLACKPINK?

00:47:52.392 --> 00:47:54.099
Bands that kids nowadays like.

00:47:59.808 --> 00:48:04.016
You don't know? Who's her best friend?

00:48:08.516 --> 00:48:12.432
You really don't know much about her.

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:15.641
You two don't talk?

00:48:18.308 --> 00:48:19.559
That's not right.

00:48:20.474 --> 00:48:22.848
I absolutely hate silence.

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.181
I actually hate being talkative.

00:48:26.434 --> 00:48:28.225
but I talk a lot because
I hate silence more.

00:48:29.224 --> 00:48:31.807
So. how should I address you?

00:48:32.807 --> 00:48:34.140
Whatever you feel like.

00:48:34.975 --> 00:48:36.267
Then...

00:48:37.474 --> 00:48:39.057
Mr. Yeon?

00:48:40.142 --> 00:48:43.559
No. since you retained me how's 'boss'?

00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:47.265
I'd rather you call me Mr. Yeon.

00:48:47.308 --> 00:48:48.974
What should I call you?

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.640
General Manager Heo. GMs work the hardest.

00:48:55.392 --> 00:48:57.724
I'm thirsty. let me raid your fridge.

00:48:58.434 --> 00:48:59.641
I could use a beer.

00:49:28.141 --> 00:49:29.099
GM Heo.

00:49:29.765 --> 00:49:30.889
GM Heo!

00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:44.681
"Dad..."

00:49:52.141 --> 00:49:53.682
"Dad!"

00:51:09.974 --> 00:51:11.224
"Mr. Yeon. close your eyes."

00:51:11.266 --> 00:51:12.390
"Close them now!"

00:51:25.392 --> 00:51:28.600
"We didn't set the trap. she did."

00:51:29.558 --> 00:51:33.182
The Blinded can only see
those with opened eyes.

00:51:33.225 --> 00:51:38.058
So don't open them and get
out of there quietly.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.515
Stay still for now.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.682
Completely still.

00:51:46.434 --> 00:51:49.975
Now. do exactly what I tell you.

00:51:52.515 --> 00:51:58.224
"Keep your body low. and
turn right slowly."

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:27.390
No. left from there!

00:52:45.515 --> 00:52:46.598
"Mr. Yeon. stop!"

00:52:49.682 --> 00:52:50.891
Don't' move.

00:52:53.057 --> 00:52:56.266
"Don't move and stay right there."

00:53:01.432 --> 00:53:04.140
You're almost there. just hang on.

00:53:12.224 --> 00:53:16.974
You're so close. don't move a muscle.

00:53:17.016 --> 00:53:19.723
I'll be right there. don't move.

00:53:25.975 --> 00:53:27.558
Goddammit...

00:53:33.891 --> 00:53:35.057
"Mr. Yeon. get out of there."

00:53:36.142 --> 00:53:37.515
"Just come out!"

00:54:25.058 --> 00:54:26.640
"All the beings in heaven."

00:54:26.682 --> 00:54:28.474
"and sprouted on earth."

00:54:30.308 --> 00:54:34.016
"slay the treacherous and cunning ghouls."

00:54:34.432 --> 00:54:37.224
"repel a 10 million ghosts.
push away all evil."

00:54:37.267 --> 00:54:40.391
"strike down with all your might."

00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:43.557
"and dissipate energy of the vile..."

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:47.349
You're...

00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:50.515
"Missing Child Cho Myung-jin (11)"

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.973
Heo!

00:55:23.017 --> 00:55:24.225
Heo!

00:55:34.059 --> 00:55:36.850
What happened?

00:55:39.642 --> 00:55:41.892
That was embarrassing...

00:55:54.058 --> 00:55:56.723
- It was Myung-jin...
- Myung-jin?

00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:03.266
(In Surgery)

00:56:15.017 --> 00:56:19.100
"Missing Child Cho Myung-jin (11)"

00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:38.181
(Chungcheong Province.
Jujin District. near Gyunbaek...)

00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:42.183
(Gyunbaek Real Estate)

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.350
I'm not sure. got another photo?

00:56:49.058 --> 00:56:50.140
That's all.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.807
He looks like an ex-con.

00:56:57.017 --> 00:56:59.516
Did he steal money from you?

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.016
His child went missing.

00:57:02.808 --> 00:57:04.683
Is that so?

00:57:04.724 --> 00:57:06.515
Sorry for what I said...

00:57:07.599 --> 00:57:08.807
Wait. a missing child?

00:57:09.683 --> 00:57:12.934
Could it be that Sangdong man?

00:57:13.892 --> 00:57:17.557
There's a man who lives alone in Mt.
Sangdon.

00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:21.599
he's famous
for all the weird stuff around his house.

00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:24.849
"From what I hear. his kid went missing."

00:57:49.891 --> 00:57:51.058
"Kyung-hoon..."

00:57:51.891 --> 00:57:53.556
"It's mom... mom..."

00:57:54.432 --> 00:57:56.349
"Find mom..."

00:58:01.516 --> 00:58:03.223
- Defibrillator!
- Yes. doctor!

00:58:31.017 --> 00:58:32.140
Hello?

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:36.723
Excuse me!

00:58:37.724 --> 00:58:39.224
Is anyone home?

00:58:45.808 --> 00:58:47.139
Who are you?

00:58:53.099 --> 00:58:54.934
Are you Myung-jin's father?

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.432
Please leave.

00:58:58.017 --> 00:58:59.974
I have some questions about her.

00:59:04.599 --> 00:59:06.014
Are you a cop?

00:59:06.058 --> 00:59:07.140
No. sir.

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.974
My daughter also disappeared.

00:59:27.724 --> 00:59:30.224
I think it's related to Myung-jin somehow.

00:59:33.641 --> 00:59:38.932
She disappeared while
sleeping in the next room.

00:59:40.391 --> 00:59:44.224
My wife went out to look for her.
and never returned.

00:59:46.392 --> 00:59:49.600
I searched her for 10
years before giving up.

00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:55.723
And spent another 10 years
trying to forget her.

00:59:57.391 --> 01:00:02.306
I don't want to dig up the
past. please leave me.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:07.015
Did anything happen
before her disappearance?

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.433
This might sound weird.
but did her personality change.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:15.308
or maybe she talked
to herself in front of the closet?

01:00:17.016 --> 01:00:19.558
Why do you think I live up here?

01:00:23.225 --> 01:00:26.307
It suffocates me to see kids.

01:00:28.767 --> 01:00:32.057
why do you think I live
in complete isolation?

01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:34.723
My apologies.

01:00:38.973 --> 01:00:44.848
Do you know anything about this doll?

01:00:59.057 --> 01:01:01.014
Why is this... But how?!

01:01:04.517 --> 01:01:05.684
Why are you here?

01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:08.931
Why did you come?!

01:01:12.516 --> 01:01:13.848
I'm not gonna die!

01:01:13.891 --> 01:01:16.224
You won't get me!

01:01:23.432 --> 01:01:25.224
This can't be here.

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:27.767
I have to burn it...

01:01:36.642 --> 01:01:37.850
"Dad..."

01:01:48.557 --> 01:01:50.724
Myung-jin...

01:03:03.724 --> 01:03:04.848
Sir?

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.349
Hello?

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:30.766
Honey...

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:33.600
It's okay...

01:03:33.725 --> 01:03:35.140
What are you doing?!

01:03:35.516 --> 01:03:36.640
Just hold on...

01:03:37.807 --> 01:03:41.057
You go on ahead and wait for us.

01:03:41.808 --> 01:03:43.140
Sir. please...

01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:45.849
I'll be...

01:03:48.516 --> 01:03:50.349
right there...

01:03:56.433 --> 01:04:01.141
Dad! Dad! Please let me out!

01:04:01.182 --> 01:04:05.266
Dad! I'm really scared!

01:04:05.807 --> 01:04:09.722
Mom! Dad!

01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:16.517
"Over 1.000 shops have closed down
or are on sale."

01:04:16.558 --> 01:04:18.057
"In Seoul alone..."

01:04:18.099 --> 01:04:20.307
Please let me out. dad!

01:04:20.683 --> 01:04:23.516
Let me out. dad!

01:04:27.392 --> 01:04:30.349
Mom! Mom!

01:04:31.182 --> 01:04:33.931
Please let me out!

01:04:35.183 --> 01:04:39.016
I'm sorry!

01:04:40.641 --> 01:04:42.722
Dad!

01:04:48.307 --> 01:04:49.558
Myung-jin.

01:04:51.517 --> 01:04:55.433
Breathing doesn't prove that we're alive.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.183
Dad. please help me...

01:05:00.517 --> 01:05:02.849
When we are reborn.

01:05:04.932 --> 01:05:08.223
we'll be happy. with no debts.

01:05:08.933 --> 01:05:13.224
Dad. I'm really sorry...

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:20.182
Please let me out. I'm sorry...

01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:23.807
Rather than living like this...

01:05:30.682 --> 01:05:33.182
we'll be happier dead.

01:05:34.975 --> 01:05:37.475
I'm scared. dad...

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:39.598
Please!

01:05:40.974 --> 01:05:45.057
Please. I'm sorry!

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.683
Dad!

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.350
Dad!

01:05:48.933 --> 01:05:50.559
Dad!

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:34.640
Help me...

01:07:04.932 --> 01:07:06.224
I saw Myung-jin's memory.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.931
You and Myung-jin's
frequencies must be in sync.

01:07:09.933 --> 01:07:11.517
Then you can see each other's memories.

01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:16.015
Her resentment turned her into a demon.

01:07:16.057 --> 01:07:18.932
and she's been gathering
other kids in pain.

01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:22.724
It all makes sense now.

01:07:27.765 --> 01:07:29.266
You resented Ina. no?

01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.266
Be honest for a moment.

01:07:32.683 --> 01:07:35.057
Work always meant more than her.

01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:36.890
and you wanted her to go away.

01:07:37.807 --> 01:07:39.099
Get to your point.

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:42.848
Kids know everything instinctively.

01:07:43.725 --> 01:07:46.183
whether someone truly loves them or not.

01:07:46.766 --> 01:07:49.558
Buying her some dolls
can't hide your feelings.

01:07:51.017 --> 01:07:52.933
All missing kids have something in common.

01:07:54.183 --> 01:07:58.433
They're scarred by their parents:

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:01.017
assault. verbal abuse. and abandonment.

01:08:02.017 --> 01:08:03.641
Same thing with Ina.

01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:07.016
How painful would it have
been to live with a dad

01:08:08.016 --> 01:08:09.681
who wanted her gone.

01:08:11.308 --> 01:08:12.891
Imagine her loneliness.

01:08:17.017 --> 01:08:21.225
Her sorrow called for Myung-jin.

01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:27.808
So it was me who sent her away.

01:08:58.975 --> 01:09:00.850
- Mr. Heo.
- Holy craps...

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.017
What is it?

01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:05.807
About that frequency.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:10.724
so you're saying if we're in sync.

01:09:11.432 --> 01:09:12.724
I can see and enter their realm?

01:09:13.099 --> 01:09:14.806
Right. if you're in sync.

01:09:15.724 --> 01:09:20.224
When I had that panic attack.
you said I was in sync with Myung-jin.

01:09:20.807 --> 01:09:23.182
Does that mean I can meet Ina?

01:09:24.724 --> 01:09:26.016
What do you want to do?

01:09:26.558 --> 01:09:29.391
We're running out of time.
let me enter their realm.

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:35.766
No way. it's too dangerous.
you'll get hurt.

01:09:39.057 --> 01:09:41.348
I don't care if it's too dangerous.

01:09:42.266 --> 01:09:45.057
there's no other way.
unless you got a plan.

01:09:48.224 --> 01:09:49.348
Help me get there.

01:09:50.515 --> 01:09:52.099
You have no idea what you're saying.

01:09:52.641 --> 01:09:55.266
Once you're there. you
could get stuck and die.

01:09:55.308 --> 01:09:57.432
Plus. you'll ruin my exorcism career.

01:09:57.475 --> 01:09:59.683
You're asking the impossible.
it's just not doable.

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:10.142
Sorry for bringing up money.
but I'll pay you whatever you want.

01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:15.766
So help me get there.

01:10:15.807 --> 01:10:19.182
I want to see her. please help me.

01:10:23.224 --> 01:10:24.931
Jesus...

01:10:26.349 --> 01:10:28.558
I'll protect you with a ritual.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.892
but you'll have no longer than 30 minutes.

01:10:30.933 --> 01:10:33.725
If you don't come out before then.
remember the Blinded?

01:10:35.308 --> 01:10:37.432
You'll turn into that and
stay in the underworld.

01:10:37.475 --> 01:10:39.309
It's okay. let's try it.

01:10:40.599 --> 01:10:42.224
All right. let's try it.

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:45.681
"How to worsen your panic attack?"

01:10:46.184 --> 01:10:47.391
"That's a weird question."

01:10:47.432 --> 01:10:50.806
Could you just trust me? Please.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.557
"Cho Myung-jin (11)"

01:11:24.516 --> 01:11:26.725
"If there's a high intake
of caffeine pills."

01:11:26.766 --> 01:11:29.765
"you'll get a panic attack.
and at worse. death."

01:11:30.475 --> 01:11:32.224
"so be absolutely careful."

01:11:33.224 --> 01:11:34.973
"Remember that I've warned you."

01:11:58.974 --> 01:12:00.141
Are you ready?

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:03.058
My symptom will start soon.

01:12:03.432 --> 01:12:06.765
Myung-jin created that realm.
so anything can happen.

01:12:06.808 --> 01:12:09.515
she'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

01:12:09.557 --> 01:12:10.973
so be prepared.

01:12:11.017 --> 01:12:14.558
I'm bringing my daughter back.

01:12:17.642 --> 01:12:19.099
Stay alive...

01:12:21.641 --> 01:12:23.306
and pay me for my service. got it?

01:12:25.557 --> 01:12:26.724
Depends on your performance.

01:12:57.266 --> 01:12:59.016
This fire is linked to you.

01:12:59.974 --> 01:13:02.057
If the time runs out. or if you die.

01:13:02.641 --> 01:13:04.265
this fire will go out.

01:16:39.016 --> 01:16:40.140
Seung-hee...

01:16:47.349 --> 01:16:48.891
Wait. honey!

01:16:54.432 --> 01:16:55.641
Seung-hee...

01:17:05.474 --> 01:17:07.431
Look what you've done to Ina.

01:17:08.099 --> 01:17:10.431
Ina is dying.

01:17:10.474 --> 01:17:11.641
Die!

01:19:21.099 --> 01:19:22.139
Ina!

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:09.849
Ina!

01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.640
Ina!

01:20:41.474 --> 01:20:42.598
Seung-hee...

01:20:43.432 --> 01:20:44.515
Honey. are you okay?

01:20:45.099 --> 01:20:46.140
Baby...

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.224
Ina...

01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:49.931
Ina?

01:20:49.974 --> 01:20:53.765
Protect her no matter what. okay?

01:20:56.975 --> 01:20:58.974
Seung-hee! Honey!

01:21:00.225 --> 01:21:01.392
Sweetheart...

01:21:02.182 --> 01:21:04.515
No! Seung-hee!

01:21:13.599 --> 01:21:14.598
Ina...

01:21:16.558 --> 01:21:17.807
Ina!

01:21:18.724 --> 01:21:20.350
Why are you here?

01:21:29.475 --> 01:21:33.391
Myung-jin. I came to get Ina.

01:21:33.891 --> 01:21:36.724
Why? This is what you wanted.

01:21:37.765 --> 01:21:39.764
You wanted to throw her away.

01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:47.099
That donation to the art camp.
how much would be enough?

01:21:48.099 --> 01:21:51.890
Back then. I...

01:21:51.933 --> 01:21:54.392
Ina will soon live with us here.

01:22:00.933 --> 01:22:01.974
Myung-jin!

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:03.350
Please let her go...

01:22:04.015 --> 01:22:05.849
Please let me take her back.

01:22:19.682 --> 01:22:20.723
Myung-jin.

01:22:21.475 --> 01:22:23.474
what happened to you that day...

01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:26.265
I saw it all.

01:22:27.141 --> 01:22:32.806
That's why you brought
other kids here. Ina too.

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:38.807
The last thing you heard that day...

01:22:38.849 --> 01:22:40.016
I don't want to hear it!

01:22:40.683 --> 01:22:42.682
Rather than living like this...

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.932
We'll be happier dead.

01:22:47.016 --> 01:22:48.348
Do you trust me?

01:22:58.057 --> 01:22:59.181
Mom!

01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:04.350
Mom...

01:23:08.267 --> 01:23:10.142
I want to live...

01:23:13.349 --> 01:23:15.266
It's all grown-ups' fault.

01:23:16.266 --> 01:23:17.723
It's my fault.

01:23:22.891 --> 01:23:24.100
It's all my fault...

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:25.932
Don't lie to me!

01:23:34.765 --> 01:23:35.682
It's mom...

01:23:36.267 --> 01:23:38.434
"Don't forget. find mom!"

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:40.265
Mom...

01:23:55.017 --> 01:23:57.225
Ina. honey!

01:24:01.933 --> 01:24:02.932
Kill him.

01:24:10.309 --> 01:24:12.475
Ina. please snap out of it.

01:24:15.724 --> 01:24:17.432
Everything belongs somewhere.

01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:20.682
you will find out where god is.

01:24:28.057 --> 01:24:29.723
Ina. please...

01:24:41.807 --> 01:24:42.682
Ina!

01:24:43.558 --> 01:24:44.640
"Myung-jin?"

01:25:09.016 --> 01:25:10.932
Here you were. my baby.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.182
Mom?

01:25:14.766 --> 01:25:17.017
How scared must you have been?

01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:24.308
How painful...

01:25:29.142 --> 01:25:31.267
I should've protected you...

01:25:32.432 --> 01:25:34.682
I'm so sorry. sweetheart...

01:25:38.808 --> 01:25:43.350
I only waited for you.

01:25:43.392 --> 01:25:46.141
- Mom...
- Myung-jin.

01:25:51.558 --> 01:25:53.849
You can rest with me now.

01:25:59.641 --> 01:26:00.682
Ina.

01:26:02.016 --> 01:26:03.473
Ina...

01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:10.681
Myung-jin...

01:26:13.765 --> 01:26:14.890
Mom!

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.892
Mom...

01:26:20.891 --> 01:26:22.223
Mom!

01:26:32.225 --> 01:26:33.433
Mom!

01:26:39.683 --> 01:26:40.975
Mom...

01:26:42.267 --> 01:26:46.557
Mom! Mom!

01:26:49.017 --> 01:26:52.767
Mom! Mom!

01:26:52.933 --> 01:26:57.349
Mom! Mom!

01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:59.640
Mom!

01:27:03.183 --> 01:27:04.348
Myung-jin.

01:27:17.391 --> 01:27:21.308
Mr. Yeon. hurry. there's no time.

01:27:38.225 --> 01:27:39.391
Myung-jin.

01:27:45.975 --> 01:27:47.307
I'm really sorry.

01:27:54.974 --> 01:27:56.389
I'm so sorry.

01:29:22.475 --> 01:29:23.683
Ina!

01:29:35.349 --> 01:29:36.599
Ina. wake up...

01:29:38.933 --> 01:29:40.264
Ina...

01:29:57.557 --> 01:29:58.807
Dad...

01:30:00.724 --> 01:30:03.223
Dad. I want to go home.

01:30:05.307 --> 01:30:07.973
Ina. let's go home. we'll be right there.

01:30:08.933 --> 01:30:10.099
Let's go home.

01:30:58.974 --> 01:30:59.973
Mr. Yeon!

01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:27.307
She still doesn't remember the underworld?

01:32:27.349 --> 01:32:29.056
I hope she doesn't ever remember it.

01:32:31.433 --> 01:32:32.683
How's the new house?

01:32:33.974 --> 01:32:36.389
It's good enough for us. very cozy.

01:32:37.516 --> 01:32:38.474
That's great.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.765

01:33:03.432 --> 01:33:04.515
Ina!

01:33:06.474 --> 01:33:07.890
Hi. dad!

01:33:07.934 --> 01:33:09.725
Hop in. little miss!

01:33:13.016 --> 01:33:15.141
It's okay. baby. he's a good man.

01:33:17.474 --> 01:33:19.057
You'll have to revise this.

01:33:19.517 --> 01:33:20.809
I'll just ignore it.
