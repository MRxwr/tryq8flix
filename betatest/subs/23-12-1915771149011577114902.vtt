00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.827
Ah. the Heckler & Koch G36.

00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:36.246
Quite deadly in the right hands.

00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:01.563
Ah! Agent One.

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:06.109
I have been so looking forward
to this moment.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:11.031
Well. in that case. I'll try not to disappoint.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.411
You overestimate your power
over women. Mr English.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.624
I'd say that would be virtually impossible.

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:37.682
Sir? Sir?

00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:40.852
- Sir!

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:42.229
- Have you got them?
- Hmm?

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.564
The mission documents.
Agent One's flying to Biarritz tonight.

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.234
Yes. yes. the mission documents.
They're here somewhere. Don't worry.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.402
Ah! Here we are.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.242
Agent One.

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:57.661
Gentlemen.

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:04.501
I'm here for my documents.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.880
Bough. Agent One's documents. please.

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:14.469
- Thank you.

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:16.096
Your mission documents. Agent One.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.849
Including the codes for the submarine hatch.
which I've checked myself.

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:25.188
- Thank you.
- So. is it just France tonight.

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:28.817
or will you be slipping
over the Pyrenees as well?

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.071
If I told you that.
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.740
Oh!

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.871
Oh. yes. yes.
Well. I expect you would.

00:03:42.873 --> 00:03:44.791
Cheerio. Agent One.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:46.376
Bonne chance!

00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:48.128
Arrivederci.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.050
Such class. Such distinction.

00:04:03.894 --> 00:04:08.606
The greatest secret agent England's
ever had. snuffed out in an instant.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.233
Terrible.

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:15.155
Do you know what makes us envied
the world over. Bough?

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.575
That there's always another agent waiting
to step into the breach.

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.701
Absolutely. sir.

00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:22.746
And every last one
of them is gathered round that grave.

00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:27.375
It is our honour and privilege
to guard them while they grieve.

00:04:28.377 --> 00:04:30.503
Their lives are in our hands. Bough.

00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:43.725
Everything in order. English?

00:04:44.477 --> 00:04:47.103
I think you'll find it's rather more than just
in order. sir.

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:51.274
You're now entering the most secure location
in the whole of England.

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:01.951
Pegasus. we face a national crisis.

00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:05.413
Agent One was clearly onto something.
and we have to find out what.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.124
I need another agent on this immediately.
Who else is there?

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.504
No one. Prime Minister.
They all died in the explosion.

00:05:13.297 --> 00:05:14.631
All of them?

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:17.675
Well. luckily there is one who survived.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.302
Who?

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:23.807
One eye on the shadows
Protecting his fellows

00:05:24.183 --> 00:05:25.266
From sunup to the moon on his back

00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:29.687
Sendin' villains to Hades
A hit with the ladies

00:05:29.772 --> 00:05:31.147
Johnny. Hello.

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:34.526
A stallion in the sack

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.862
You can't get your life back
when right follows left. jack

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.242
The more you see. the less you know

00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:47.288
When others would leak it
His service is secret

00:05:47.373 --> 00:05:50.375
Plays God when it's your time to go

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:54.337
Hey. fellas
Don't be jealous

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.757
When they made him. they broke the mould

00:05:57.842 --> 00:06:01.970
So charismatic
With an automatic

00:06:02.054 --> 00:06:05.765
Never prematurely shooting his load

00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:11.187
Queen and country safe and sound
With villains six feet underground

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.274
And no one knows
'cause no one's found any trace

00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:19.028
Of a man for all seasons
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

00:06:19.864 --> 00:06:21.990
So alone

00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:26.786
And you and I wouldn't have a clue
Who's doin' what. why. when and who

00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:28.621
Up a creek with no canoe

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:32.041
Watch out for the man for all seasons

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:35.003
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:40.884
So alone
But safe at home

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:45.096
Yeah. yeah

00:06:46.223 --> 00:06:49.601
But safe at home
But safe at home

00:06:53.898 --> 00:06:57.817
And you and I wouldn't have a clue
Who's doin' what. why. when and who

00:06:57.902 --> 00:06:59.652
Up a creek with no canoe

00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:03.031
Watch out for the man for all seasons

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:06.075
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.915
So alone
But safe at home

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.793
Right.

00:07:16.587 --> 00:07:18.838
Johnny English. I'm here to see Pegasus.

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:22.967
Still. no sense rushing things.

00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:28.139
There are some items you need
to sign before your briefing.

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.934
This is your new retinal ID card.

00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:34.854
- and this is your level nine security clearance.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.314
Sign and date. please.

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:39.734
Ah!

00:07:41.612 --> 00:07:44.280
Oh. reminds me
of the old service-issue ballpoint.

00:07:44.907 --> 00:07:48.117
I remember every agent would carry a pen
that looked just like this.

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:51.704
Completely innocent to the untrained eye.
but click it twice...

00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:57.418
Ah. English. there you are.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:00.463
Have you seen my secretary?

00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:02.048
Um...

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:04.467
She went out.

00:08:05.636 --> 00:08:06.761
Um...

00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:09.806
Shall we?

00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:13.768
Now. Agent One believed

00:08:13.852 --> 00:08:16.854
that there was a plot
to steal the Crown Jewels.

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.607
Now. they've recently been
through a multimillion-pound restoration.

00:08:19.692 --> 00:08:21.859
largely paid for
by a corporate sponsor. of course.

00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:24.320
And they're due to be unveiled tonight
at the Tower of London.

00:08:24.947 --> 00:08:28.199
Unfortunately. the Queen is insisting
that the ceremony goes ahead.

00:08:28.284 --> 00:08:29.701
so what we want you to...

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.789
Ha!

00:08:34.873 --> 00:08:36.916
Who... Who...

00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.419
Who is the sponsor. sir?

00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:41.671
Pascal Sauvage.

00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:45.091
What. that flouncy Frenchman
who owns a couple of prisons?

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:48.469
Sauvage's £7-billion empire. English.

00:08:48.554 --> 00:08:51.347
operates over 400 prisons in 60 countries.

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:53.808
- He's built 25 of them here.
- Right. sir.

00:08:53.892 --> 00:08:56.603
The man's related to the royal family.
for goodness' sake.

00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:58.521
As far as the prime minister's concerned.

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.648
he's one
of the greatest friends England's got.

00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.070
Now. English. I want you
at the Tower tonight.

00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:08.031
monitoring this unveiling.

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:10.617
Any chink in security. any weakness.

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:13.620
however slight.
must be plugged immediately.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.414
Do we understand each other?

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:18.791
- Perfectly. sir.
- Good.

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:21.919
- Oh. yes.
- And. English.

00:09:22.004 --> 00:09:25.381
we can't afford any mistakes. Not tonight.

00:09:25.924 --> 00:09:29.677
The word "mistake." sir.
is not one that appears in my dictionary.

00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:37.810
Fantastic car. sir!

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:52.533
Mr English. Colonel Sir Anthony Chevenix.
head of royal security.

00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:54.369
Ah. Colonel. good evening.

00:09:54.453 --> 00:09:56.663
Snipers posted on the roof
as per my request?

00:09:56.747 --> 00:09:58.331
- Thirteen of them.
- Windows?

00:09:58.415 --> 00:10:01.084
Refitted with bullet- and shatter-proof glass.
as ordered.

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:07.423
I shall now mingle inconspicuously
with the guests.

00:10:07.966 --> 00:10:10.718
- Let me know when Her Majesty arrives.
- Very good.

00:10:11.637 --> 00:10:13.346
Shall I mingle with you. sir?

00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:16.974
Oh. yes. Bough.
Once you've checked the roof.

00:10:39.957 --> 00:10:42.041
Help! Help!

00:10:42.126 --> 00:10:44.043
Well. hello.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.296
Hello. yourself.

00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:50.216
Johnny English.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.844
Lorna Campbell.

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:55.179
A Bloody Mary. please. not too spicy.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.934
So. are you here
in some professional capacity?

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.145
I worked on the restoration of the Jewels.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.981
- Intriguing.
- And yourself?

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:09.444
If I told you that.
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:11.404
I'd like to see you try.

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.747
Monsieur Sauvage. on behalf of Her Majesty.

00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:22.832
may I welcome you to the Tower.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.500
Merci. monsieur.

00:11:25.335 --> 00:11:27.754
So. are you here alone. Mr English?

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.673
That's how I choose
to live my life. Miss Campbell.

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:35.845
Women want safety. security.
I can offer them nothing but danger.

00:11:36.597 --> 00:11:38.848
Some women find danger very attractive.

00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:42.018
Women like you. Miss Campbell?

00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:49.025
Women like me expect men like you
to find that out for yourself.

00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:51.402
Hmm!

00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:55.239
Madame.

00:11:55.324 --> 00:11:56.657
Oh. it's for me. actually.

00:11:56.742 --> 00:11:57.742
And could you rustle up

00:11:57.826 --> 00:12:00.036
some of those cheesy niblets
that are going around?

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:02.371
Now. where were we?

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:05.708
You obviously haven't met our host.
Monsieur Sauvage.

00:12:06.043 --> 00:12:08.127
No. thank God.

00:12:08.212 --> 00:12:12.715
You know. I think I'd rather have my bottom
impaled on a giant cactus

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.551
than exchange pleasantries
with that jumped-up Frenchman.

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:17.470
As far as I'm concerned.

00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:20.681
the only thing the French
should be allowed to host is an invasion.

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:25.436
Sorry. can I help?

00:12:25.521 --> 00:12:28.981
Pascal Sauvage. jumped-up Frenchman.

00:12:29.066 --> 00:12:32.068
Lorna Campbell.
I've been so looking forward to meeting you.

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:33.152
Enchanté.

00:12:34.863 --> 00:12:38.366
But of course! You're Johnny English.
I've heard all about you.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.161
And between you and me.
I'm not so keen on the French myself.

00:12:42.246 --> 00:12:44.080
But. please. don't tell them that.

00:12:44.623 --> 00:12:47.333
Let me go and search
for your nibbly cheese bits.

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:48.709
No. no. I don't...

00:12:48.794 --> 00:12:52.463
Please. I insist.
The French are. after all. fantastic waiters.

00:12:52.756 --> 00:12:54.215
- The best in the world.
- Well. but... But...

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:57.301
- Wait here. and I will wait on you.
- No. no. really. There's no...

00:12:57.386 --> 00:13:00.304
No. no. Please. please. please. please!

00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:05.726
Les Français.

00:13:06.603 --> 00:13:11.482
Ils sont very... N'est-ce pas?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.543
Ladies and gentlemen.
mesdames et messieurs.

00:13:30.627 --> 00:13:35.298
bienvenue. welcome tonight
to this wonderful occasion.

00:13:35.757 --> 00:13:39.218
As we stand here in the Tower of London.

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:41.512
the most famous prison in the world.

00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:46.934
where these wonderful Jewels will rest safely
under lock and key.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:53.065
I want to thank you
for giving me this wonderful experience

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:58.112
to contribute to the restoration
of these Jewels.

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:02.825
- It was. as we say in France. le top. le best of.

00:14:02.993 --> 00:14:04.452
- And what a beautiful...

00:14:26.808 --> 00:14:31.479
It's Colonel Chevenix!
He's got a nasty wound. sir. Who hit him?

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:34.815
The assailant. He ran in here.

00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:37.526
Bough. you guard the door.

00:14:38.028 --> 00:14:39.111
A-ha!

00:14:44.534 --> 00:14:47.453
Oh. for God's sake. Bough. don't come in.
The man's a maniac!

00:14:49.998 --> 00:14:51.457
You don't frighten me!

00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:52.583
- Missed!

00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:26.575
I have managed to subdue the assailant.

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:30.287
The panic's over. Everything's under control.

00:15:34.918 --> 00:15:37.169
Thank you. And now. ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:40.464
we should compose ourselves
for the arrival of Her Majesty

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:47.304
and return to the site of our great nation's
magnificently restored Crown Jewels.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.353
I know. I feel it. too.

00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:57.356
The very symbols of our island nation.

00:15:57.441 --> 00:16:01.027
so close we could almost reach out and...

00:16:03.113 --> 00:16:05.656
MAN: Pray silence for Her Majesty the Queen.

00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:09.452
Oh. where are the Jewels?

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:12.872
It's an unmitigated disaster.
English.

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:14.540
I couldn't agree more. sir.

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:18.627
Well. we need to get these Jewels back.
English. and fast.

00:16:22.632 --> 00:16:26.177
Tell me about this assailant.
because when they searched the room later.

00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:27.303
there was no sign of him.

00:16:27.512 --> 00:16:29.847
Well. the man was clearly a professional.

00:16:30.474 --> 00:16:33.642
He must have escaped
while the Queen was being sedated.

00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:36.270
But he's the only lead we've got. English.
We have to find him.

00:16:36.354 --> 00:16:40.566
Come in. This is...
This is Roger from Data Support.

00:16:41.359 --> 00:16:44.528
Please sit down. He'll produce a likeness
based on your description.

00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:47.740
So tell us. what did this man look like?

00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:49.450
Um...

00:16:49.785 --> 00:16:51.368
Well...

00:16:51.453 --> 00:16:53.913
He was big.

00:16:54.247 --> 00:16:55.247
Hair colour?

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:57.416
Um...

00:16:59.544 --> 00:17:00.544
Orange.

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:03.631
- Orange?
- Mmm. And curly.

00:17:04.174 --> 00:17:06.884
Well. frizzy. actually. Frizzy sort of thing.

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:10.513
- Frizzy.
- An eye patch.

00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:13.933
Broken nose. Very few teeth.

00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:15.976
Two. I would say. at the most.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.939
And a scar on his cheek.

00:17:20.357 --> 00:17:24.318
in the shape of a banana.

00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:27.738
Which cheek?
- Both cheeks.

00:17:28.532 --> 00:17:30.366
They sort of met in the middle.

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:40.668
Are you sure about this. English?

00:17:42.712 --> 00:17:46.298
Yes. that's him.
An uncanny resemblance.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.717
Why. it's just as if he's in the room with us.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:00.646
Wow! Look at this. sir.
Got all the bells and whistles. doesn't it?

00:18:00.772 --> 00:18:03.983
Never mind about the gadgets. Bough.
Just focus on the case.

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:13.075
Oh. uh...

00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:23.002
Good morning. gentlemen.
Thank you very much for waiting.

00:18:23.086 --> 00:18:27.089
Now. the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one.

00:18:27.424 --> 00:18:32.261
Namely. how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment

00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:35.097
and then escape with the Jewels afterwards?

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:36.807
A simple question.

00:18:36.892 --> 00:18:40.477
but one which I believe
has a complex answer.

00:18:40.854 --> 00:18:43.439
- Actually. sir...
- Please. Bough. My mind is at work.

00:18:44.107 --> 00:18:47.193
Now. what you must grasp.
gentlemen. is that the master criminal

00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:50.946
sees not a room.
but a series of opportunities.

00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:53.240
Should I go in through the window?

00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:56.035
Possibly.

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:59.872
Should I drop down from the ceiling?
Perhaps.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.707
- Actually. sir...
- There's one thing

00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:04.460
I think we can be fairly confident about.

00:19:04.544 --> 00:19:07.213
and that is that they didn't come up
through the floor...

00:19:07.672 --> 00:19:09.381
- I've got you. sir.

00:19:10.008 --> 00:19:12.426
Right. That's all right.
Just come my way. Bough.

00:19:12.594 --> 00:19:16.472
- That'd bring me right over the hole. sir.
- Bough. there's no need to panic.

00:19:20.143 --> 00:19:21.977
Can you see the bottom yet. Bough?

00:19:22.103 --> 00:19:25.231
Not yet. sir.
The shaft appears to be narrowing.

00:19:25.732 --> 00:19:27.816
I'm just a little bit worried I might get stuck.

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:31.695
Trust me. Bough.
You won't get stuck if you just keep moving.

00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:33.572
Yes. sir.

00:19:37.285 --> 00:19:38.535
Right. Okay. sir.

00:19:38.703 --> 00:19:40.496
Are you at the bottom now. Bough?

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:42.790
No. I am in fact stuck now. sir.

00:19:43.583 --> 00:19:47.336
Oh. for God's sake. Bough.
Stay there! I'm coming down.

00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:51.423
Uh. I'm not especially sure
that's a good idea. sir.

00:19:51.508 --> 00:19:52.758
Don't worry.

00:19:54.177 --> 00:19:55.594
Careful. sir!

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.475
Gently does it.

00:20:02.227 --> 00:20:04.687
- Sir?

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:10.442
You all right. sir?

00:20:10.527 --> 00:20:12.278
Yes.
I landed on something quite soft.

00:20:12.404 --> 00:20:14.655
- That was me. sir.
- Oh. good.

00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:17.992
What now?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.995
There's no way back up there.
that's for sure.

00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:23.080
But this must lead somewhere.

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:26.292
I'm ever so slightly uncomfortable
in the dark. sir.

00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:27.960
There's nothing
to worry about. Bough.

00:20:28.044 --> 00:20:31.547
It may be pitch black. but we can still see.

00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:32.756
Can we. sir? How?

00:20:32.882 --> 00:20:35.843
The Bedouin monks
of the al-Maghrib mountains

00:20:35.927 --> 00:20:38.220
developed a system of sonic chanting.

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.556
I see. sir.
- The sound of their chanting

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.850
would bounce back off any obstacles.

00:20:42.934 --> 00:20:44.310
and using their highly tuned ears.

00:20:44.394 --> 00:20:47.396
they could paint a mental picture
of the path ahead.

00:20:47.522 --> 00:20:51.066
Brilliant. sir.
- However. you must always sing in E-flat.

00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:58.574
E-flat. E-flat. E-flat

00:20:59.242 --> 00:21:03.704
Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing

00:21:03.788 --> 00:21:05.789
Is it working. sir?
- Extremely well. thank you. Bough.

00:21:05.874 --> 00:21:08.208
Thanks for all the joy they're...

00:21:08.293 --> 00:21:09.918
- Ow!

00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:13.422
You all right. sir?
I think I can see something. sir.

00:21:13.673 --> 00:21:17.134
Oh. yeah. Shh! Come on.

00:21:36.488 --> 00:21:38.322
Here's the long one.

00:21:38.948 --> 00:21:40.532
It is a long one.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.326
Careful.

00:21:47.457 --> 00:21:49.333
- I knew it.
- Shall we call for backup. sir?

00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:53.170
What? And watch some fat-bottomed bobby
make our arrest for us?

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.381
I don't think so.

00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:02.596
Good morning. gentlemen.
Ml7 at your service.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.643
Observe. Bough. the dull incompetence
of the criminal mind.

00:22:07.852 --> 00:22:11.021
It can never hope
to match our level of technical expertise.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.906
- You've got it.
- What do we do now. sir?

00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:05.033
Watch and learn. Bough.

00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:12.624
- It's no good. sir. They're too far ahead of us.
- Have faith. Bough. They're heading south.

00:23:22.719 --> 00:23:25.220
- There they are. sir!
- Just as I thought.

00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:29.766
Hang on tight. Bough.

00:23:40.904 --> 00:23:42.279
We're never gonna catch them in this.

00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:44.698
Take the wheel. Bough.
I'm getting in the Aston.

00:23:44.782 --> 00:23:45.782
Sir?

00:23:49.913 --> 00:23:52.498
Change places. Bough.
I'm getting out the other side.

00:23:52.582 --> 00:23:53.582
Sir?

00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:17.689
Set. Bough. Take me up.

00:24:26.282 --> 00:24:27.699
Swing me out. Bough!

00:24:33.122 --> 00:24:34.206
Whoa!

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.792
Down.

00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:43.590
Up! Up!

00:24:46.427 --> 00:24:47.719
Sorry!

00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:53.600
Bough. pull out!

00:24:59.148 --> 00:25:00.357
Ow! Ow!

00:25:03.319 --> 00:25:06.154
Those idiots are right behind us. Faster!

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:30.846
Uh-huh!

00:25:57.707 --> 00:25:58.874
Drop me here. Bough!

00:26:06.382 --> 00:26:08.508
No! No! No!

00:26:08.593 --> 00:26:10.218
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no.

00:26:49.092 --> 00:26:51.009
They're turning
into the Brompton Cemetery. Bough.

00:26:51.761 --> 00:26:54.596
Get here as soon as you can. I'm going in.

00:27:02.522 --> 00:27:03.980
In a wheelchair.

00:27:04.065 --> 00:27:07.067
But Geoffrey
overcame these terrible disabilities

00:27:07.485 --> 00:27:10.779
with that simple resilience
and sunny optimism

00:27:10.863 --> 00:27:13.281
that so warmed all of us who knew him.

00:27:14.283 --> 00:27:16.410
spending the rest of his life in the service

00:27:16.536 --> 00:27:18.995
of the poor and disabled of this parish.

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:23.750
It's very good. Really very good.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.920
No. no. please. No. go on.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:27:27.338 --> 00:27:29.381
- It's very entertaining.
- Who's that?

00:27:29.465 --> 00:27:31.216
That priest act of yours

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.719
should keep the other prisoners entertained
for hours.

00:27:34.178 --> 00:27:37.222
Oh. I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?
Johnny English.

00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:40.267
British Secret Service.
and you are all under arrest.

00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:43.395
I must say.
you've done this whole thing very well.

00:27:43.479 --> 00:27:46.273
The attention to detail is excellent.

00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:49.985
You. the grieving granny.
you're very convincing.

00:27:50.653 --> 00:27:54.448
Oh. look. Real tears.
Do you get paid extra for that?

00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:56.616
Ah!

00:27:57.326 --> 00:27:58.744
What we're all here for.

00:27:58.828 --> 00:28:01.621
I know! Why don't we take a look inside?

00:28:02.874 --> 00:28:03.957
Oh!

00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.500
You've nailed it down!

00:28:07.503 --> 00:28:08.879
Why would you do that?

00:28:09.589 --> 00:28:12.841
I know you're gonna come back in two weeks
and dig it up again.

00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:22.100
Now. what are you playing
in this little vignette of deceit and villainy?

00:28:22.477 --> 00:28:23.935
I'm the hearse driver.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:31.693
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes. sir.

00:28:32.236 --> 00:28:34.112
Ah! A-ha!

00:28:35.656 --> 00:28:38.825
There you are. Gunther.

00:28:39.202 --> 00:28:42.537
Uh. I do hope he hasn't made a nuisance
of himself.

00:28:43.748 --> 00:28:46.249
I'm Doctor...

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.131
Bough. of the Lunatic Response Unit.

00:28:53.716 --> 00:28:57.511
I'm afraid Gunther here wasn't supposed
to be released until 2028.

00:28:57.595 --> 00:28:59.638
- Isn't that right. Gunther?

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.851
Yes. yes. there's been
a most monumental cock-up.

00:29:05.728 --> 00:29:06.853
Um...

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:11.983
If you'll excuse me.
with the deepest respect. utmost sympathy.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.443
Uh...

00:29:13.736 --> 00:29:15.570
He hasn't urinated on anyone. has he?

00:29:15.905 --> 00:29:17.447
- No.
- No. no.

00:29:17.532 --> 00:29:21.868
That's a blessing.
Are you gonna give me the gun. Gunther?

00:29:27.917 --> 00:29:29.459
There. That wasn't too difficult. was it?

00:29:31.462 --> 00:29:33.421
Are you going to come home now?

00:29:41.222 --> 00:29:44.599
Oh! In the van!
Yes. yes. we are going in the van.

00:29:44.851 --> 00:29:46.101
Yes. yeah.

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:48.186
- Vroom. vroom!

00:29:48.271 --> 00:29:49.437
Yes. Yeah.

00:29:52.984 --> 00:29:54.943
Yes. He's waving goodbye.
Goodbye. everyone.

00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:57.320
- ALL: Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Gunther.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.448
Mind the nice dead people. There we go.

00:30:05.496 --> 00:30:09.666
Oh! We'll just go to the path here.
There. Big step.

00:30:10.293 --> 00:30:13.044
It's a graveyard. It's where they bring people
when they pass...

00:30:13.129 --> 00:30:15.088
Yes. yes. all right. Bough.
You can stop now.

00:30:15.172 --> 00:30:17.257
For appearances' sake.
I'll just hold your arm. sir.

00:30:17.341 --> 00:30:19.301
Yes. yes. Just keep walking.

00:30:19.719 --> 00:30:21.678
In fact. run. run. run!

00:30:28.644 --> 00:30:31.563
I can't believe I've done this.

00:30:32.481 --> 00:30:36.818
I mean. I really cannot believe I've done this!

00:30:41.449 --> 00:30:43.992
You see. 200 years ago.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.539
my family should have inherited the throne
of England.

00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:52.334
but they were cast aside.

00:30:53.294 --> 00:30:59.257
Well. in a few very short days.
it will be back where it belongs.

00:31:02.303 --> 00:31:03.345
With me.

00:31:04.889 --> 00:31:10.477
Shall I try it on? Yes? No? Maybe?

00:31:10.853 --> 00:31:14.230
To make you King. we need
the Archbishop of Canterbury to do that.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.150
The Archbishop of Canterbury

00:31:17.234 --> 00:31:20.862
is being taken care of even as we speak.

00:31:33.459 --> 00:31:37.045
There's only one thing. sir.
What are we going to do about English?

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:43.885
If I were you.
I wouldn't worry too much about English.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:47.806
He is no threat to us. I had his flat bugged.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.364
Ow!

00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:18.878
Clearly. the aptly named English is a fool.

00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:22.674
He might be a fool.
but he's a fool who keeps showing up.

00:32:23.134 --> 00:32:25.885
Well. the next time he shows up.

00:32:27.054 --> 00:32:28.763
eliminate him.

00:32:29.807 --> 00:32:30.807
Thank you.

00:32:30.891 --> 00:32:33.143
Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta. sir.

00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:37.272
Released from prison six months ago.
327 convictions between them.

00:32:37.773 --> 00:32:40.358
Armed robbery. grievous bodily harm

00:32:40.443 --> 00:32:42.652
and combined parking fines
of more than 400...

00:32:42.737 --> 00:32:45.572
Yes. yes. all right.
Thank you. Bough. I think we get the picture.

00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:49.075
The point is. sir. that Vendetta and Klein

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.746
are both in the employ of Monsieur Sauvage.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.498
- Pascal Sauvage?
- Precisely. sir.

00:32:56.375 --> 00:32:59.002
But you're not suggesting
Sauvage is involved?

00:32:59.128 --> 00:33:01.296
I think he's more than just involved. sir.

00:33:01.464 --> 00:33:03.715
I'm convinced he's
up to his French neck in it.

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:07.135
Don't be absurd.
Sauvage employs thousands of people.

00:33:07.219 --> 00:33:09.387
Just because two of them are villains
doesn't mean that he is.

00:33:09.764 --> 00:33:12.891
No. I want him discounted
from this investigation immediately.

00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:15.018
Yes. sir.

00:33:19.482 --> 00:33:24.069
All right. Tonight I shall be at Sauvage's
reception for the new French ambassador.

00:33:24.153 --> 00:33:26.112
Any developments. you can reach me there.

00:33:26.447 --> 00:33:30.533
Apart from that. I don't want you
within a hundred miles of the man.

00:33:31.327 --> 00:33:32.410
Absolutely. sir.

00:33:33.162 --> 00:33:36.748
Requisition order.
Ml7 quartermasters for immediate supply.

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:38.917
One military transport plane. fully fuelled.

00:33:39.001 --> 00:33:41.127
with permission
for night-time city over-flight.

00:33:41.212 --> 00:33:43.546
Two night camouflage parachutes.
plus reserves.

00:33:43.631 --> 00:33:46.382
plus neoprene bodysuits. twice. in black.

00:33:46.467 --> 00:33:47.801
I've never liked the navy blue.

00:33:48.177 --> 00:33:50.678
And a 40-inch chest for me
'cause I need the sleeve length.

00:33:51.722 --> 00:33:53.139
- Morning. Felch.
- Morning.

00:33:53.432 --> 00:33:57.769
Oh. and two special forces signet rings.
primed and colour-coded.

00:33:57.895 --> 00:34:00.271
- What's all this for. sir?
- For tonight's operation. Bough.

00:34:00.648 --> 00:34:02.690
We're going to break
into Sauvage's headquarters.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.527
- But I thought Pegasus said...
- You let me worry about Pegasus.

00:34:05.611 --> 00:34:07.112
I know that Sauvage is behind all this.

00:34:07.196 --> 00:34:09.072
and tonight we're gonna get the evidence
to prove it.

00:34:10.658 --> 00:34:14.327
- Something wrong. sir?
- Did that sound like Felch to you?

00:34:44.441 --> 00:34:45.608
Bough...

00:35:01.709 --> 00:35:03.585
You. upstairs.

00:35:18.309 --> 00:35:19.350
Ow!

00:35:53.802 --> 00:35:55.053
Can you see him. Bough?

00:35:55.971 --> 00:35:57.305
He's on the upper level. sir.

00:36:03.896 --> 00:36:04.979
Got him.

00:36:12.029 --> 00:36:16.407
And like a coiled viper. he strikes.

00:36:25.793 --> 00:36:28.169
So what you're saying. sir.
is there must have been two of them?

00:36:28.629 --> 00:36:31.005
Oh. at least. Bough. Possibly four.

00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:32.382
I wonder why I didn't see them.

00:36:32.675 --> 00:36:34.634
You mustn't dwell on your mistakes. Bough.

00:36:34.718 --> 00:36:37.553
- You must learn from them. then move on.
- Yes. sir.

00:36:40.683 --> 00:36:43.101
- So where were you. sir?
- Just drop it. Bough!

00:36:47.231 --> 00:36:48.439
Ah!

00:36:48.524 --> 00:36:51.150
- What is it. sir?
- That bike.

00:36:52.695 --> 00:36:54.404
You get things sorted out for tonight.

00:37:10.754 --> 00:37:12.505
Well. well. we meet again.

00:37:13.507 --> 00:37:16.467
Mr English. What a pleasant surprise!

00:37:16.552 --> 00:37:18.386
I wondered when you might show up again.

00:37:18.762 --> 00:37:23.182
On the contrary. Miss Campbell.
It is not I who keeps showing up. It's you.

00:37:24.685 --> 00:37:26.978
- Do you like sushi?
- Hmm?

00:37:29.106 --> 00:37:32.817
Oh. sushi! Oh! I practically live off the stuff.

00:37:33.235 --> 00:37:36.612
You might say the mysteries of the Orient
are no mystery to me.

00:37:46.582 --> 00:37:49.417
- Sake?
- Ah! Sake.

00:38:05.517 --> 00:38:08.519
Now then. perhaps you can explain how it is

00:38:08.604 --> 00:38:11.064
that I run into you at two crime scenes

00:38:11.148 --> 00:38:14.609
and then can't find any record of you
on a single government computer.

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:16.736
Shouldn't you ask the government that?

00:38:18.072 --> 00:38:20.740
I am the government and I'm asking you.

00:38:25.913 --> 00:38:26.954
Let me.

00:38:28.874 --> 00:38:29.874
Hmm!

00:38:29.958 --> 00:38:31.292
You're brave.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.170
They say that sea urchin's
the ultimate acquired taste.

00:38:34.463 --> 00:38:37.215
It's a personal favourite of mine.

00:38:42.346 --> 00:38:44.931
I think people are put off
by how it feeds through its bottom.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.851
- Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Mmm.

00:39:08.956 --> 00:39:11.666
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm from Ml7. Sorry.
I'm a secret agent. I am...

00:39:31.103 --> 00:39:33.813
- Everything set. Bough?
- Just about. sir.

00:39:34.523 --> 00:39:37.733
Actually. sir. do you mind
if I run through the plan one more time?

00:39:38.026 --> 00:39:40.695
- No. no.
- These are the two buildings here.

00:39:41.113 --> 00:39:43.823
This one is our target.
Sauvage's headquarters.

00:39:43.907 --> 00:39:45.450
right next to the City Hospital.

00:39:45.742 --> 00:39:48.744
I jump first and land on the south side
of the roof.

00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:52.039
abseil down 14 floors
and cut through this window here.

00:39:52.207 --> 00:39:56.085
I then land on the east side
of the roof and abseil down 12 floors.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.046
Where you wait for my signal
that I've disabled the alarm system.

00:39:59.131 --> 00:40:01.799
- Yes.
- You then break into this window here.

00:40:01.884 --> 00:40:05.136
work your way along the secure corridor
and penetrate Sauvage's office.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.722
- Yes. yes.
- Is that okay. sir?

00:40:07.848 --> 00:40:10.933
It's been okay
ever since I thought up the idea. Bough.

00:40:16.106 --> 00:40:18.900
Oh. I nearly forgot. sir. Your laser beacon.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.944
- My what?
- Your laser beacon!

00:40:22.029 --> 00:40:24.530
It'll guide you onto Sauvage's building.

00:40:24.865 --> 00:40:27.950
Your dependence on hardware
really does amuse me. Bough.

00:40:28.494 --> 00:40:30.912
I've been dropped into the Kalahari Desert

00:40:31.288 --> 00:40:35.082
carrying nothing more than a toothbrush
and a packet of sherbet lemons.

00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:39.504
and I still found my way
to Bulawayo before Ramadan.

00:40:41.256 --> 00:40:43.674
So thank you. Bough. but no thank you.

00:40:47.721 --> 00:40:49.388
- Bough. go!

00:40:49.473 --> 00:40:51.682
Geronimo!

00:41:20.546 --> 00:41:23.381
Fandango!

00:41:46.238 --> 00:41:47.321
Ugh!

00:41:55.914 --> 00:41:56.998
Right.

00:42:16.268 --> 00:42:17.602
Alarm's disabled. sir.

00:42:17.686 --> 00:42:18.853
Roger that. Bough.

00:42:57.184 --> 00:42:59.185
This is worse than I thought. Bough.

00:42:59.895 --> 00:43:03.522
Sauvage has got some kind
of laboratory set up here.

00:43:04.232 --> 00:43:07.151
God knows what kind
of sick operation he's running.

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:23.334
My God. what have they done to you?

00:43:24.461 --> 00:43:26.420
They've taken some of my blood.

00:43:27.756 --> 00:43:30.800
- Bastards!
- It's only for tests.

00:43:30.884 --> 00:43:32.927
Of course it is. Come on. my friend.

00:43:33.011 --> 00:43:35.096
Let's get you out of here
before they take anything else.

00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:49.193
Good evening. Dr Frankenstein.

00:43:49.903 --> 00:43:51.445
This way. please.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.155
Come on. come on. I haven't got all night.

00:43:55.117 --> 00:43:57.785
And you. you angels of death.

00:43:58.036 --> 00:44:00.371
About turn. Come on. let's go.

00:44:00.455 --> 00:44:01.789
Come on. come on. Keep moving.

00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:06.460
Come on. Over there.
I know what you're doing here. And you.

00:44:06.878 --> 00:44:10.089
Come on. Quicker. Quicker. Come on.
Over there.

00:44:11.967 --> 00:44:13.342
Now then.

00:44:13.427 --> 00:44:16.554
perhaps you could direct me
to your evil paymaster.

00:44:17.639 --> 00:44:21.726
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:25.479
Where is the office of Pascal Sauvage?

00:44:51.506 --> 00:44:53.048
Are you coming over here in a minute. sir?

00:44:56.386 --> 00:44:57.720
I'm from Ml7.

00:44:58.597 --> 00:45:01.390
This has been a test
of your emergency response systems.

00:45:01.475 --> 00:45:04.351
and I have to say.
you've all done extremely well.

00:45:04.978 --> 00:45:09.231
Right. Well. I'll leave you to it.
And. get well soon.

00:45:15.822 --> 00:45:19.742
Oh. God!

00:45:38.637 --> 00:45:40.179
Sir. Sir.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.147
Did you just land on the wrong building?

00:45:51.358 --> 00:45:54.443
I did a precautionary sweep
of the immediate environment.

00:45:55.237 --> 00:45:56.403
Right.

00:45:58.657 --> 00:46:00.074
- And everything was fine.
- Good.

00:46:01.284 --> 00:46:02.576
Okay. let's go.

00:46:07.415 --> 00:46:10.918
I'll be downstairs at the reception...

00:46:20.053 --> 00:46:23.848
- That's far enough.
- Well. good evening.

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:26.851
- Perhaps you'd like to have this as well.
- What is it?

00:46:26.935 --> 00:46:28.102
Let me show you.

00:46:30.856 --> 00:46:32.940
Well executed. Bough.
but completely redundant.

00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:36.026
- How do you mean. sir?
- Super-strength muscle relaxant.

00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:39.113
When he wakes up.
he'll be as floppy as a damp old sock.

00:46:45.954 --> 00:46:47.037
What's this?

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:06.140
That's the face
of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:47:10.687 --> 00:47:11.854
What are they doing?

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.486
What's this got to do with the Crown Jewels?

00:47:42.218 --> 00:47:43.344
Bough.

00:48:01.529 --> 00:48:02.905
English.

00:48:02.989 --> 00:48:08.869
A people whose empire once covered
one quarter of the surface of the earth.

00:48:09.454 --> 00:48:11.413
Alas. no longer.

00:48:12.207 --> 00:48:15.793
Now. my friends ask me.
"Pascal. how can you be so interested

00:48:15.877 --> 00:48:18.712
"in such a backward. grotty little country?"

00:48:19.172 --> 00:48:22.716
My answer is simple. The Queen.

00:48:23.551 --> 00:48:26.887
The Queen has more power
in her tiny white gloves

00:48:26.972 --> 00:48:30.557
than any other head of state
in the entire world.

00:48:30.767 --> 00:48:33.102
She can declare war or make peace.

00:48:33.186 --> 00:48:34.770
and most intriguingly.

00:48:35.772 --> 00:48:40.651
she can seize any piece of land
which takes her fancy.

00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:46.240
Of course. the Queen never uses
the enormous power afforded to her.

00:48:47.242 --> 00:48:50.953
But imagine someone
who would use that power.

00:48:52.122 --> 00:48:54.790
Imagine. say. me.

00:48:57.335 --> 00:48:59.586
How could he do that. sir?
How could he make himself King?

00:49:00.797 --> 00:49:02.172
The Archbishop.

00:49:12.225 --> 00:49:13.267
Ow!

00:49:15.603 --> 00:49:17.730
Hands up. There's a good fellow.

00:49:18.606 --> 00:49:21.483
Heavily armed for a late night at the office.
wouldn't you say. Bough?

00:49:21.568 --> 00:49:25.404
You fool. English.
You'll never get out of the building alive.

00:49:25.655 --> 00:49:27.948
I'd save your breath for my questioning.

00:49:28.158 --> 00:49:30.117
I'm not telling you anything.

00:49:30.368 --> 00:49:31.535
Incorrect.

00:49:33.288 --> 00:49:34.580
Sodium pentothal.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.958
I won't lie to you. It's a truth serum.

00:49:39.377 --> 00:49:43.380
Now then. why does Sauvage want
to have himself crowned?

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.300
You have no idea what's going on here.
do you?

00:49:47.677 --> 00:49:50.137
It would be funny if it wasn't so...

00:49:51.139 --> 00:49:52.139
What?

00:49:58.813 --> 00:50:01.190
- He's talking gibberish. sir.
- Yes. I can hear that. Bough.

00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:05.569
- He's collapsed onto me. sir.
- Yes. I can see that. Bough.

00:50:06.863 --> 00:50:09.073
You don't think you could've
got the syringes mixed up. do you. sir?

00:50:09.157 --> 00:50:11.158
- What do you mean?
- Given the guard outside the truth serum

00:50:11.242 --> 00:50:12.534
and given Klein the muscle relaxant?

00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:15.496
Ah!

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.248
Don't be ridiculous. Bough.
I think I know my right from my left.

00:50:19.793 --> 00:50:22.127
- Sir?
- Oh. bugger it!

00:50:24.422 --> 00:50:26.256
Bough. take "flodd."

00:50:26.341 --> 00:50:27.841
Take what. sir?

00:50:27.926 --> 00:50:30.469
Flodd. Schlage.

00:50:30.553 --> 00:50:32.054
I'm not quite getting that second word. sir.

00:50:32.138 --> 00:50:33.639
Schlage!

00:50:34.182 --> 00:50:36.016
- Write it down. sir.
- Schlage!

00:50:36.101 --> 00:50:38.727
Yes! Schlage!

00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:43.148
"C! C-A..."

00:50:43.358 --> 00:50:45.734
Car! Take the car! We didn't come by car. sir.
We came by plane.

00:50:48.238 --> 00:50:49.530
Bugger off!

00:50:50.198 --> 00:50:51.365
Hold it right there.

00:50:53.618 --> 00:50:56.245
- What's wrong with them?
- They got their... I'm not telling you.

00:50:57.038 --> 00:50:58.122
Wrong answer.

00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:01.416
What is it with you two?

00:51:01.835 --> 00:51:02.876
Ah!

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.755
Let's get out of here.

00:51:07.173 --> 00:51:08.674
Sorry. but who are you. exactly?

00:51:09.342 --> 00:51:12.052
Special Agent Campbell.
I'm attached to Interpol in Paris.

00:51:12.387 --> 00:51:13.637
We've been watching Sauvage for months.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.140
Why?

00:51:16.224 --> 00:51:17.432
Because every major convict

00:51:17.517 --> 00:51:19.726
released from a Sauvage prison
in the last six months

00:51:19.811 --> 00:51:21.687
has been employed by one of his companies.

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:24.815
We believe he's recruiting them
for a major criminal conspiracy.

00:51:24.899 --> 00:51:26.275
We just don't know what yet.

00:51:28.945 --> 00:51:31.113
- What did he say?
- Pegasus!

00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:33.323
We have to report to Pegasus!

00:51:34.242 --> 00:51:35.826
Oh. no. sir. No. no. no. no.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.495
- How do we get out of here?
- Hey. you!

00:51:38.997 --> 00:51:40.539
What you did to me really hurt.

00:51:43.001 --> 00:51:46.378
Yeah. Sorry about that. How do we get out
of here without being seen?

00:51:47.547 --> 00:51:48.630
Okay.

00:51:49.007 --> 00:51:51.633
Left by the water fountain.
right by the fire exit.

00:51:51.759 --> 00:51:52.926
then to the elevator at the end.

00:51:53.011 --> 00:51:54.761
- Thank you.
- Oh. my God.

00:51:56.097 --> 00:51:57.514
Nice job. Bough.

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.016
Left. sir. Left!

00:52:00.685 --> 00:52:03.770
Sir. you can't go to
Sauvage's reception in this state.

00:52:03.897 --> 00:52:06.148
The effect of the drug
has practically worn off. Bough.

00:52:06.774 --> 00:52:08.483
I'm fline.

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:10.360
Schline. Uh. gline.

00:52:20.872 --> 00:52:22.122
Monsieur.

00:52:22.332 --> 00:52:23.790
Ah! Thank you.

00:52:27.795 --> 00:52:29.796
- Would you like another?
- Please.

00:52:36.679 --> 00:52:37.721
Thank you.

00:52:43.645 --> 00:52:45.395
What in God's name?

00:52:45.605 --> 00:52:48.148
Ah! Foreign Sebletarary.

00:52:48.483 --> 00:52:49.650
Um...

00:52:52.028 --> 00:52:53.070
Ah!

00:52:54.489 --> 00:52:55.822
Shall we dance?

00:53:45.581 --> 00:53:47.040
- Excuse me. sir?
- Yes. Bough?

00:53:47.125 --> 00:53:49.126
I'm very sorry to interrupt. I need to...

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:51.378
Ah. Pascal. how nice to see you again.

00:53:51.546 --> 00:53:53.547
- Enjoying the party?
- Splendid affair.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.760
I was until I was informed
that your man English

00:53:58.845 --> 00:54:02.306
and his curious boyfriend here
have spent the evening

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:06.059
breaking into my office
and assaulting my staff.

00:54:06.227 --> 00:54:08.020
Is this true. Bough?

00:54:08.563 --> 00:54:09.730
Well. we... We...

00:54:19.574 --> 00:54:21.408
What in God's name do you think
you're up to?

00:54:21.743 --> 00:54:23.327
- Well...
- Sir. if I could just offer...

00:54:23.411 --> 00:54:24.411
Go home. Bough!

00:54:25.079 --> 00:54:26.246
Now!

00:54:27.248 --> 00:54:29.666
I gave you direct orders not to meddle
with Sauvage.

00:54:29.751 --> 00:54:32.711
What do you do? You break into his office
and assault two of his staff.

00:54:32.962 --> 00:54:36.256
Then you march in here.
loaded with God only knows what.

00:54:36.424 --> 00:54:37.966
and insult the foreign secretary.

00:54:38.051 --> 00:54:40.844
I haven't encountered such behaviour
in Whitehall in 30 years.

00:54:40.928 --> 00:54:42.888
- But...
- There are no "buts." English.

00:54:43.765 --> 00:54:47.309
You're off the case.
Your security clearance is hereby cancelled.

00:54:47.393 --> 00:54:50.771
After a three-month leave of absence.
you will return at your old grade.

00:54:51.064 --> 00:54:53.106
And I hope never to hear your name again.

00:55:47.578 --> 00:55:49.371
English has seen too much.

00:55:49.455 --> 00:55:51.581
We go to plan B.

00:55:51.999 --> 00:55:57.295
Get rid of the fake Archbishop
and green-light the visit to Her Majesty.

00:55:57.422 --> 00:56:01.174
And then this pathetic country
can humiliate itself

00:56:01.259 --> 00:56:03.427
by crowning me officially.

00:56:30.788 --> 00:56:33.999
That's a letter of abdication
renouncing your claims to the throne

00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:36.084
and the claims of your entire family.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.045
Sign it.

00:56:47.555 --> 00:56:48.680
Never.

00:57:04.155 --> 00:57:05.447
- Yes?
- Prime Minister.

00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:08.325
I'm sorry to call so late.
but I'm afraid the Queen has abdicated.

00:57:08.409 --> 00:57:09.618
What?

00:57:09.869 --> 00:57:14.122
Abdicated? But that's not possible.

00:57:14.499 --> 00:57:16.041
I only wish that were true.

00:57:16.626 --> 00:57:18.835
You know what. let me talk to her.
Maybe she just...

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.086
Pascal. she's gone.

00:57:21.464 --> 00:57:23.173
Now. my people have spent the last 10 hours

00:57:23.257 --> 00:57:25.717
trying to track down the rightful heir
to the throne

00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:29.930
and they've come up with a name.
which they've double-checked.

00:57:31.807 --> 00:57:33.058
Who is it?

00:57:33.267 --> 00:57:35.519
- It's you.
- No!

00:57:41.108 --> 00:57:43.443
In the wake of the return of the Crown Jewels

00:57:43.528 --> 00:57:45.570
to a police station in North London.

00:57:45.655 --> 00:57:48.406
Pascal Sauvage has requested
that his coronation

00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:50.283
take place this Thursday.

00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:54.246
In the House. the prime minister said
he was looking forward to the ceremony

00:57:54.455 --> 00:57:57.457
and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage
will make a fine king

00:57:57.792 --> 00:57:59.042
and will bring all that is best

00:57:59.126 --> 00:58:01.670
about modern Europe
to our ancient institution.

00:58:10.054 --> 00:58:12.138
Get your car keys. We've got work to do.

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:13.890
Miss Campbell.

00:58:13.975 --> 00:58:16.184
Sauvage is heading back
to his chateau in France.

00:58:16.394 --> 00:58:19.896
And he's invited 13 of the richest
criminal masterminds in the world

00:58:19.981 --> 00:58:21.147
to meet him there.

00:58:21.357 --> 00:58:24.150
I'm sorry. Miss Campbell. I'm off the case.

00:58:24.485 --> 00:58:26.069
It's been reassigned.

00:58:26.153 --> 00:58:28.822
I know. Reassigned to me.

00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:35.495
- Look. I want you with me. Johnny.
- Look. just leave me alone.

00:58:35.663 --> 00:58:36.663
What are you gonna do?

00:58:36.747 --> 00:58:38.999
Sit here in this grotty flat feeling sorry
for yourself?

00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:42.043
Or are you gonna get out there
and save your country?

00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:45.422
I'm gonna sit in the flat.

00:58:46.007 --> 00:58:49.884
- Johnny. this is ridiculous.
- I'm a spent force.

00:58:52.597 --> 00:58:54.222
Spent. my ass.

00:58:59.687 --> 00:59:01.062
Ow!

00:59:02.481 --> 00:59:04.983
Will you please stop?

00:59:18.039 --> 00:59:19.164
I'll just be a minute.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:08.755
It'll be nightfall in an hour.
Then we can strike out for the chateau.

01:00:09.298 --> 01:00:12.467
The fact is. the moment Sauvage gets
that crown on his head.

01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:15.595
he'll be able to do whatever he likes
with the country that I love.

01:00:15.763 --> 01:00:18.390
and that is why you and I have got
to stop him.

01:00:20.768 --> 01:00:24.062
- Relishing the thought?
- Something like that.

01:00:26.774 --> 01:00:29.317
I suppose you've made love
to lots of women. haven't you. Johnny?

01:00:33.239 --> 01:00:34.364
Um...

01:00:36.158 --> 01:00:38.952
You know. one does one's best.

01:00:41.122 --> 01:00:42.414
It's just...

01:00:43.457 --> 01:00:46.960
Well. it's been three years
since my fiancé left me.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:50.922
and since then. I haven't made love
to anyone.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:54.134
But then I met you.

01:00:55.636 --> 01:00:58.638
and I felt this hunger.

01:00:59.473 --> 01:01:02.976
deep down inside.
I wanted to say things to you.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.353
I wanted to do things to you

01:01:05.438 --> 01:01:09.482
that I haven't wanted to do
in a very. very. very long time.

01:01:13.988 --> 01:01:15.363
What. uh...

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:19.033
What sort of things are we talking about?

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.536
Things like punching you in the face.

01:01:22.037 --> 01:01:23.997
Things like kicking you in the backside

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:26.374
for being such a pompous.
know-nothing asshole.

01:01:27.168 --> 01:01:30.462
But then I started to see beyond the idiot
that everybody else saw.

01:01:31.172 --> 01:01:33.339
I started to see the man on the inside.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:38.052
a man who was determined to do his duty.
no matter what or who lay in his way.

01:01:38.846 --> 01:01:41.931
And I began to feel other things for him.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.519
to wanna do other things for him.

01:01:47.897 --> 01:01:49.606
Things...

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.692
Involving plastic toys and soft cheese?

01:01:54.695 --> 01:01:57.739
- What?
- What? What?

01:01:57.865 --> 01:02:00.074
You're toying with me.
aren't you?

01:02:00.159 --> 01:02:02.619
You're telling me to stop
in the gentlest way you know how.

01:02:03.412 --> 01:02:04.746
No. No...

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:07.040
You're such a special person. Johnny.

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:09.334
not to take advantage of me
while I'm vulnerable.

01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:14.464
- No. Well...
- So thank you for being such a gentleman.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.469
Not at all.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:43.326
I know what you're thinking. Miss Campbell.

01:02:43.577 --> 01:02:47.413
You're thinking. "If we don't pull this off.
God knows what might happen to England."

01:02:47.915 --> 01:02:50.583
Actually. I was thinking
there must be a better way in than that pipe.

01:02:52.419 --> 01:02:53.545
Well. there isn't.

01:02:53.629 --> 01:02:56.881
I've analysed it from every possible angle.
and this is the best option.

01:02:57.633 --> 01:03:01.302
I'll go in first. and if there's a clear way
through. I'll call down. Okay?

01:03:03.389 --> 01:03:04.597
Johnny.

01:03:05.391 --> 01:03:08.351
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.

01:03:08.936 --> 01:03:10.103
Oh!

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.946
- Gentlemen.

01:04:02.698 --> 01:04:07.952
In a few hours' time.
I will become the next king of England.

01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:28.014
No.

01:04:43.697 --> 01:04:45.490
Ha!

01:04:45.574 --> 01:04:47.825
- How did you get here?
- Up the ladder.

01:04:48.827 --> 01:04:50.954
Look. pull yourself together.
It's only a bit of poo.

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:58.336
It's cold! Oh! It's cold!

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:04.384
What is the one commodity
the world never seems to run out of?

01:05:06.053 --> 01:05:08.346
Criminals. gentlemen.

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:10.807
- Lawbreakers.

01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:12.850
Every nation in the world

01:05:12.935 --> 01:05:17.146
struggles with the issue
of overcrowded prisons.

01:05:17.439 --> 01:05:22.026
So. what do we do with all these villains?

01:05:22.403 --> 01:05:24.988
Find the solution to that problem

01:05:25.072 --> 01:05:30.159
and the governments of the world
would pay you through their nose.

01:05:30.744 --> 01:05:34.580
Fortunately. I have found a solution.

01:05:34.915 --> 01:05:39.669
We empty every prison on the entire planet.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:45.383
we take the resulting tidal wave
of human scum

01:05:45.718 --> 01:05:47.593
and we put it here.

01:05:52.766 --> 01:05:54.809
The moment I am crowned King.

01:05:54.893 --> 01:05:58.229
I will turn England into the largest prison

01:05:58.313 --> 01:06:00.606
in the history of the world.

01:06:02.443 --> 01:06:07.739
210.000 square miles of prime real estate.

01:06:08.032 --> 01:06:14.162
conveniently separated from true civilisation
by 20 miles of ocean

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:16.581
- and soon to be available...
- Come on.

01:06:16.665 --> 01:06:21.836
...for the entire world
to dump its human waste in.

01:06:22.129 --> 01:06:24.714
According to current projections.

01:06:24.798 --> 01:06:30.136
we will not run out of prison space
for the next 500 years.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:35.016
So. tonight. one. and only one. of you

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:41.939
will leave here owning 49% of this venture.

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:48.071
So that's his little game.
We must get hold of that DVD.

01:06:48.155 --> 01:06:49.614
But how. Johnny? There's only two of us.

01:06:50.824 --> 01:06:53.493
You're young. Miss Campbell.
and inexperienced.

01:06:53.869 --> 01:06:55.703
What you seem to have forgotten is that

01:06:55.788 --> 01:06:57.914
nobody knows we are here.

01:06:58.457 --> 01:07:01.667
At our disposal.
we have the vital element of surprise.

01:07:02.878 --> 01:07:05.254
Now. my plan is simple but effective.

01:07:05.672 --> 01:07:08.424
I shall drop from the gallery
at this end of the room

01:07:08.509 --> 01:07:09.884
and take Sauvage prisoner.

01:07:10.385 --> 01:07:13.054
You will then enter from the far door.

01:07:13.138 --> 01:07:14.722
cutting off any means of escape.

01:07:15.015 --> 01:07:19.352
Then. using Sauvage as a hostage.
we'll get the hell out of here. Clear?

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:30.863
Get 'em up. you French ponce.

01:07:31.698 --> 01:07:35.076
But. Mr English. I'm gobsmacked!

01:07:35.702 --> 01:07:37.995
What an unexpected surprise.

01:07:38.413 --> 01:07:41.457
Surprises are very much my speciality.
Sauvage.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.710
I think we've seen enough of this.

01:07:46.839 --> 01:07:51.676
I know exactly what you're planning.
and I'm here to put a stop to it.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:56.722
My bottom will be king of England
before you are.

01:07:57.808 --> 01:07:59.308
Wrong again.

01:08:00.144 --> 01:08:02.895
Perhaps you'd care to look behind you.

01:08:03.188 --> 01:08:05.523
Oh. please.

01:08:09.695 --> 01:08:10.736
Lorna!

01:08:13.407 --> 01:08:14.574
I'm sorry. Johnny.

01:08:16.076 --> 01:08:21.956
Well. I'm afraid that we'll have
to conclude the floor show for tonight.

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.041
Not so fast. Sauvage.

01:08:24.585 --> 01:08:28.421
You may have taken me.
but you'll never take England.

01:08:28.755 --> 01:08:31.591
Not as long as I have breath in my body

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:34.010
or a bullet in my gun.

01:08:43.437 --> 01:08:47.440
You know. Mr English.
I'm going to miss you. Really.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.026
You're very entertaining. I thank you.

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:51.861
Take them away.

01:08:56.283 --> 01:08:57.366
Good morning. everybody!

01:08:58.577 --> 01:08:59.952
And welcome to The Breakfast Show.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.459
As the crowds are gathering here
for the crowning of our first French king

01:09:06.543 --> 01:09:08.211
since the year 1066.

01:09:08.295 --> 01:09:10.504
we ask you to call us here at London FM

01:09:10.589 --> 01:09:13.716
with the top 10 things you most love
about the French.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.344
We haven't had any calls yet. at all.

01:09:16.428 --> 01:09:18.804
but the lines are still open
and I'll give you that number again.

01:09:20.224 --> 01:09:21.224
0-2-0-7...

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:28.648
This is not good. Johnny.

01:09:29.483 --> 01:09:30.900
We've got to think of something.

01:09:32.986 --> 01:09:35.488
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

01:09:36.198 --> 01:09:37.698
Hop! Hop!

01:09:38.325 --> 01:09:41.160
Hop! And hop! And stop!

01:09:41.828 --> 01:09:43.955
Now. are you familiar

01:09:44.039 --> 01:09:47.708
with the shaman throat warblers
of the Guatemalan delta?

01:09:48.126 --> 01:09:49.126
What?

01:09:49.378 --> 01:09:51.128
It has long been their belief

01:09:51.213 --> 01:09:55.591
that a whistle pitched at the precise
resonant frequency of a metal lock

01:09:55.676 --> 01:10:00.263
will vibrate the levers in such a way
that the door will simply swing open.

01:10:00.806 --> 01:10:01.931
Unbelievable.

01:10:02.182 --> 01:10:03.557
And kneel.

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:09.563
Right. Here goes.

01:10:22.202 --> 01:10:24.870
- I can't hear anything.
- I'm into ultrasonic.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:28.457
Johnny. will you just stop all this
and face facts?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:33.087
We've failed. The only thing
that can save us now is a miracle.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.554
It worked!

01:10:41.722 --> 01:10:42.805
Oh!

01:10:42.889 --> 01:10:43.931
Sir?

01:10:52.774 --> 01:10:55.651
I don't know why you hauled yourself
up that dreadful poo tube. Bough.

01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:58.195
when there's a perfectly good ladder right
beside it.

01:10:59.531 --> 01:11:02.033
Now. Sauvage may have fooled the country

01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:04.910
with his fake Archbishop
and his secret agenda.

01:11:05.162 --> 01:11:06.996
but he hasn't fooled me.

01:11:08.248 --> 01:11:10.082
So. here's the plan.

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:46.595
Sirs. you are hereby called
to witness the anointing

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.518
of your one true lord and future king. Pascal.

01:12:53.019 --> 01:12:57.064
Pascal. are you willing to take the oath?

01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:59.024
I am willing.

01:12:59.359 --> 01:13:05.865
Then be thou anointed with this holy oil.

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:14.790
And do you. the chosen bishops
of England. Scotland and Wales.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:17.460
assent to this anointing?

01:13:17.544 --> 01:13:20.004
For Scotland. I do.

01:13:20.088 --> 01:13:22.047
For Wales. I do.

01:13:22.883 --> 01:13:25.384
For England. I do not!

01:13:28.889 --> 01:13:29.889
English!

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.352
That man must not be crowned King

01:13:35.437 --> 01:13:39.523
because he is a fraudster. a charlatan
and a thief.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.902
No. please. Let him speak.

01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:48.491
It is this man. Pascal Sauvage.

01:13:48.575 --> 01:13:50.075
who stole the Crown Jewels.

01:13:51.244 --> 01:13:53.704
Who forced the Queen to abdicate

01:13:53.872 --> 01:13:56.582
and would kill anyone who got in his way.

01:13:57.125 --> 01:13:59.084
It is the end. Herr English.

01:14:01.421 --> 01:14:04.840
He has cheated.
conned and manipulated

01:14:04.925 --> 01:14:07.134
this great country for his own ends.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.470
He's fooled you all!

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:15.142
What's more. this whole ceremony is a sham

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:19.438
because that man standing in front of you

01:14:19.606 --> 01:14:22.608
is not the Archbishop of Canterbury.

01:14:25.445 --> 01:14:28.948
English. a word of advice. Don't go there.

01:14:29.574 --> 01:14:32.993
Shut it. Frenchy.
I'll go wherever I damn well please.

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:37.122
- Now. take it off.
- What?

01:14:37.415 --> 01:14:40.292
Your face is made of plastic.

01:14:42.462 --> 01:14:44.088
Remove it at once.

01:14:44.548 --> 01:14:46.757
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:14:47.384 --> 01:14:50.302
Right. Well. I'll just have to remove it myself.

01:14:50.637 --> 01:14:51.971
- Come on!

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:57.142
- Maybe it pulls up from the front.

01:14:58.478 --> 01:15:00.062
Come on. will you!

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:18.497
Thank you very much.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.668
- Must be adjoined here somewhere.

01:15:22.836 --> 01:15:26.130
Fascinating performance as always.
Mr English.

01:15:26.214 --> 01:15:28.507
but I'm afraid we must move on.

01:15:28.842 --> 01:15:33.262
Nobody's moving anywhere
until I'm finished with this piece of low-life.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.140
Do you or do you not

01:15:36.224 --> 01:15:39.476
have tattooed on your bottom the words.

01:15:39.561 --> 01:15:42.605
"Jesus is coming. Look busy"?

01:15:44.816 --> 01:15:46.609
Are you insane?

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.611
Well. let's find out. shall we?

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:51.864
Go on. over. Go on. let's have a look.

01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:03.000
- Excellent!

01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:16.680
All right. so I was wrong
about the Archbishop's bottom.

01:16:18.058 --> 01:16:21.268
- But there's more.
- But not. I'm afraid. today.

01:16:21.353 --> 01:16:23.812
Sergeant. please take this man away.

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:27.816
- But be gentle with him.
- Do you think that's it?

01:16:28.276 --> 01:16:29.902
What. do you think
I don't have more evidence?

01:16:30.236 --> 01:16:33.697
My loyal subordinate is standing by
with a DVD

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:37.284
which shows Sauvage's hideous plans
for this country.

01:16:37.369 --> 01:16:39.828
Get him out! Get him out of here!

01:16:39.913 --> 01:16:43.290
- Play it. Bough! Play the disc!
- Play it! Now!

01:16:59.766 --> 01:17:02.935
You're so hot. teasing me

01:17:03.436 --> 01:17:08.065
So you're blue
But I can't take a chance on a chick like you

01:17:09.776 --> 01:17:11.777
It's somethin' I couldn't do

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.365
Well. I could dance with you. honey
If you think it's funny

01:17:18.243 --> 01:17:20.911
Does your mother know that you're out?

01:17:21.329 --> 01:17:24.790
And I could chat with you. baby
Flirt a little. maybe

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:27.543
Does your mother
know that you're out?

01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:30.212
- Take it easy
- Take it easy

01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:33.674
Better slow down. girl
That's no way to go

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.509
Does your mother know?

01:17:55.488 --> 01:17:57.156
Well. shall we?

01:18:03.329 --> 01:18:06.915
Then. as Solomon was anointed King

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.336
by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet.

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:17.092
so be thou anointed and consecrated King

01:18:18.845 --> 01:18:21.305
over all the peoples

01:18:21.639 --> 01:18:23.682
whom the Lord thy God

01:18:24.476 --> 01:18:26.852
hath given thee to govern.

01:18:27.729 --> 01:18:32.524
And of all your possessions.
wherever they may be.

01:18:33.568 --> 01:18:37.029
And so. in the name of the Father

01:18:37.614 --> 01:18:39.114
and of the Son

01:18:39.699 --> 01:18:41.617
and of the Holy Ghost.

01:18:42.535 --> 01:18:44.828
I crown you...

01:18:50.418 --> 01:18:51.585
Damn it!

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:54.880
- Give it back!
- No!

01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:56.965
- That is my crown!
- Never!

01:18:57.050 --> 01:19:00.511
- Give it back!
- Never in a million years. Sauvage!

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.554
- Give it to me!
- Bugger off.

01:19:06.935 --> 01:19:08.560
Give it back!

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.190
- Pascal!
- Shut up!

01:19:15.068 --> 01:19:18.821
All this stupid little country have
to do is stand in line

01:19:18.905 --> 01:19:22.950
and do what it's told for one miserable day!

01:19:23.034 --> 01:19:24.910
But can it do that?

01:19:25.411 --> 01:19:28.747
My fragrant French ass. it can!

01:19:33.586 --> 01:19:34.670
Merde!

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:38.590
- Ah!

01:19:40.844 --> 01:19:43.929
Give it! The crown! The crown! Go!

01:19:44.472 --> 01:19:47.266
- Ah!

01:19:48.142 --> 01:19:50.853
And so. in the name of the Father

01:19:50.937 --> 01:19:53.939
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

01:19:54.607 --> 01:19:56.316
I crown you...

01:20:00.113 --> 01:20:01.280
King.

01:20:03.324 --> 01:20:04.366
What?

01:20:30.727 --> 01:20:32.477
Arrest that man

01:20:33.813 --> 01:20:35.522
and lock him away.

01:20:40.987 --> 01:20:44.907
God save the king!
Long live the king!

01:20:45.325 --> 01:20:47.326
God save the king!

01:21:23.321 --> 01:21:24.988
Words can hardly express

01:21:25.073 --> 01:21:27.783
just how much we appreciate
everything you've done.

01:21:28.242 --> 01:21:30.202
Nothing more than my duty. ma'am.

01:21:30.745 --> 01:21:35.582
And in return. is there anything
that your Queen and country can do for you?

01:21:36.876 --> 01:21:38.460
Well.

01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:41.213
since one is asking. ma'am...

01:21:42.507 --> 01:21:45.592
The headlines again.
In celebration of her return to the throne.

01:21:45.677 --> 01:21:48.720
the Queen has declared August 5
a national holiday

01:21:48.888 --> 01:21:49.930
and in a private ceremony.

01:21:50.014 --> 01:21:53.475
has conferred a knighthood
on the unnamed Ml7 agent

01:21:53.559 --> 01:21:57.270
responsible for foiling the plot
of the French businessman Pascal Sauvage.

01:21:57.814 --> 01:22:00.315
Mr Sauvage is now awaiting trial
for high treason.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.693
a crime which still carries the death penalty.

01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:06.738
If found guilty. he's asked
that his brain be donated to medical science

01:22:06.823 --> 01:22:10.075
to further research into the causes
of hypermanic schizophrenia.

01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:13.453
Meanwhile. the unnamed English agent
has left the country

01:22:13.746 --> 01:22:16.915
and has already embarked
on his next challenging mission.

01:22:23.089 --> 01:22:25.424
Sir Johnny English.

01:22:26.426 --> 01:22:28.593
Her Majesty did seem very grateful.

01:22:30.263 --> 01:22:31.596
She's not the only one.

01:22:40.273 --> 01:22:41.606
Mmm!

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:43.859
You are full of surprises.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:55.454
- Johnny!
- Oh...

01:22:56.289 --> 01:23:00.125
One eye on the shadows
Protecting his fellows

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.045
From sunup to the moon on his back

01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:07.799
Sendin' villains to Hades
A hit with the ladies

01:23:08.009 --> 01:23:10.844
A stallion in the sack

01:23:11.971 --> 01:23:15.891
You can't get your life back
when right follows left. jack

01:23:15.975 --> 01:23:18.477
The more you see. the less you know

01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:23.565
When others would leak it
His service is secret

01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:26.568
Plays God when it's your time to go

01:23:26.652 --> 01:23:30.489
Hey. fellas
Don't be jealous

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:34.076
When they made him. they broke the mould

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.163
So charismatic
With an automatic

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:41.833
Never prematurely shooting his load

01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:47.464
Queen and country safe and sound
With villains six feet underground

01:23:47.548 --> 01:23:50.383
And no one knows
'cause no one's found any trace

01:23:50.468 --> 01:23:55.347
Of a man for all seasons
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

01:23:55.973 --> 01:23:58.058
So alone

01:23:59.018 --> 01:24:03.063
And you and I wouldn't have a clue
Who's doin' what. why. when and who

01:24:03.147 --> 01:24:04.940
Up a creek with no canoe

01:24:05.024 --> 01:24:08.235
Watch out for the man for all seasons

01:24:08.402 --> 01:24:11.113
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:14.658
So alone
But safe at home

01:24:14.784 --> 01:24:18.161
But safe at home
But safe at home

01:24:22.542 --> 01:24:26.211
Queen and country safe and sound
With villains six feet underground

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:29.172
And no one knows
'cause no one's found any trace

01:24:29.257 --> 01:24:34.177
Of a man for all seasons
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

01:24:34.846 --> 01:24:36.930
So alone

01:24:37.849 --> 01:24:41.810
And you and I wouldn't have a clue
Who's doin' what. why. when and who

01:24:41.894 --> 01:24:43.645
Up a creek with no canoe

01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:46.982
Watch out for the man for all seasons

01:24:47.066 --> 01:24:50.110
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

01:24:50.194 --> 01:24:53.405
So alone
But safe at home

01:24:53.573 --> 01:24:57.242
Queen and country safe and sound
With villains six feet underground

01:24:57.326 --> 01:25:00.328
And no one knows
'cause no one's found any trace

01:25:00.413 --> 01:25:05.083
Of a man for all seasons
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

01:25:05.835 --> 01:25:07.919
So alone

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.841
And you and I wouldn't have a clue
Who's doin' what. why. when and who

01:25:12.925 --> 01:25:14.676
Up a creek with no canoe

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.054
Watch out for the man for all seasons

01:25:18.139 --> 01:25:21.016
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:27.147
So alone
But safe at home

01:25:27.231 --> 01:25:30.233
Oh. yeah
