00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.915
Hey. Theo. It's so dark in here.

2
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.338
- You doin' some magic?
- No.

3
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.673
Yeah. I haven't seen you
do any tricks in a while.

4
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.926
Well. guess I'll forget about
what came in the mail for you.

5
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.595
What came in the mail for me?

6
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.390
You've been invited to attend this place...
The Institute of Magic.

7
00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.894
It's up in the mountains.
It's a five-week intensive study where...

8
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.355
I know what the Institute of Magic is.

9
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.857
Dad and I used to talk about it
all the time.

10
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.870
There's a voice inside of you.
and it's the voice that says.

11
00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.790
"I want to be a magician."

12
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.375
Hello. Theo.

13
00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.876
How did he know my name?

14
00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.004
How did I know your name?
It was on your application.

15
00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:38.510
Theo. I'm national treasure Roy Preston.
and I hear voices too.

16
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:42.722
Shribbity-three-ish years ago.
I founded the Institute of Magic.

17
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.642
a conservatory
for promising young magicians.

18
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:50.313
Here. world-famous magicians
will teach you the seven types of magic.

19
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.940
Sleight of hand.

20
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.361
Prediction.

21
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.032
Restoration.

22
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:04.994
Vanish... and appearance.

23
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.497
Solid... through solid.

24
00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.709
Escape.

25
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.545
Levitation.

26
00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.588
And you will get to perform

27
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.259
in the world-famous
Roy Preston Prememorial Theater.

28
00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.221
And you'll build lasting relationships
with other young magicians.

29
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:27.267
Even the weird ones.
Because here. we're all the weird ones.

30
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.521
Wow. Cool bird. Randall.

31
00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.858
But don't take my word for it.
Come see for yourself this summer.

32
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.364
Magic camp sounds pretty cool?

33
00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.492
It's not "magic camp."
It's the Institute of Magic.

34
00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.286
It's totally famous.

35
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.621
But I don't know.

36
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.875
I should stay home this summer.

37
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.297
You need me to mow the lawn
and to entertain Cameron.

38
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.008
I'm fine.
And you're not that entertaining.

39
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:05.388
I thought you might be interested in this.
but if you're not. that's okay.

40
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.599
Wait.

41
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.144
Dad always said he wanted me to go there.

42
00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:15.732
He must have applied for me
before... you know.

43
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.612
If Dad took the time to apply for me.
I should probably...

44
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.114
You could spend the summer
mowing the lawn.

45
00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:27.327
or you can study magic
with the world's greatest magicians.

46
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.378
- Do you have the tickets?
- Honey.

47
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.713
- No. I don't have the tickets.
- You have the tickets!

48
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:43.885
"This generation's greatest magician."
Yeah. right.

49
00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.929
We're seeing Penn and Teller at the Rio.

50
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.097
Great.

51
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.393
- Last night we saw Kris Darkwood.
- Minds blown.

52
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.521
And then Darkwood made the David statue
at Caesars totally disappear.

53
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.980
My head is still exploding.

54
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.027
Kristina Darkwood
has the most mind-blowing show in Vegas.

55
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.822
It's not mind-blowing.
Your head will not explode. I promise you.

56
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.745
Geez. What do you got in this thing?

57
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.872
Soup!

58
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:16.960
I'm so sorry.
I swear I had a 20-dollar bill in here.

59
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.382
Where did it go? Maybe it's in here.
I'll look for it.

60
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.010
My. No. it's not here.

61
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.721
Here it is.

62
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.807
- Found it.
! Thank heavens.

63
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.269
Can I have $12 back?

64
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.276
Last time I try to be a nice guy.

65
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.319
"Nice" may be an overstatement.

66
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.199
Roy. Hey. What are you doing here?

67
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:49.909
Vegas. baby.

68
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.872
Also. can you take me
to 123 Hope Street. please?

69
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.084
So. Andy. how's business?

70
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.337
Living the dream.

71
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.631
I just learned this awesome new trick
called "Uber cuts my paychecks in half."

72
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:09.095
Well. you are in luck because I have
a counselor opening this summer.

73
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.265
David Blaine dropped out.
and you were the first name I thought of.

74
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.350
- Really?
- Yeah.

75
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.353
David Blaine drops out.
and I'm the second name on the list.

76
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.646
I never said you were
the second name on the list.

77
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.857
I said you were the first person
I thought of.

78
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.525
You were...

79
00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.694
You were
pretty far down there on the list.

80
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:28.365
Well. I appreciate your blunt honesty.
but I don't do magic anymore.

81
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.784
I haven't for a long time.
Ever since Darkwood...

82
00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.496
Yes.
I'm so sorry and I-I don't blame you.

83
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.664
- Really?
- No.

84
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.876
You cannot love magic
with your whole heart

85
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.961
until your heart is whole again.

86
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:45.924
And there it is... the magic-related
clichés which sound profound

87
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.425
but are actually meaningless.

88
00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.512
You know. I'm gonna miss those.
but I'm still not coming back.

89
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.224
Kris is coming back this summer.

90
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.768
- Darkwood?
- Kris Darkwood. yeah.

91
00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.730
So she would have her own cabin
and I would have my own cabin?

92
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:04.776
Both of you will be working very closely
with the. young magicians.

93
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:08.822
And the Top Hat? You still do that. right?
It's cabin versus cabin. winner takes all?

94
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.866
Yes. I mean. you know
how the Top Hat competition works.

95
00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:19.833
Ooh. World Of Weiners. Nice.
Hope you got a reservation.

96
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.128
Anyway. think about it.

97
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.922
Because I know
you can still make 'em go...

98
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.845
"Wow."

99
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.643
That guy is good.

100
00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.729
Forgot my phone. Can you hand me my phone?

101
00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:43.273
Ooh. That would have been
a really cool exit.

102
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:47.485
You know how many hot dogs I had to buy
so they would let me do that to the sign?

103
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:51.990
A hundred. And I'm not proud to say
I ate 14 of them.

104
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.001
- Here it is.
- Have fun. Paul.

105
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.006
- Have fun.
- Bye-bye girls. Bye!

106
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.090
Bye!

107
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.719
These are all world-famous magicians?

108
00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.723
- They look like a bunch of ner...
- New friends to make.

109
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.266
Tell me one more time.

110
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.519
Poison ivy has three almond-shaped
leaflets. light green to red in color.

111
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.104
often found near a water source.

112
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:26.316
Often but not always. Nathan.
Come on. get your head in the game!

113
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.110
Mother. Father.
I've got my EpiPen. my Phenergan.

114
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.780
my bracelet that says "peanut allergy"
in ten languages.

115
00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.699
Plus I have my uropathy filter
in case I get stranded somewhere

116
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.493
and have to drink my own pee.

117
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.952
We've done all we can.

118
00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.455
Remember. don't be afraid of anything.

119
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.874
Be afraid of everything.

120
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:47.128
Where are the bunnies?
And what time is the first cuddle?

121
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.173
I love bunnies too.

122
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.466
They're delicious.

123
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.261
Come on. son.

124
00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.808
Dad. do I really
have to wear this bow tie?

125
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.018
It's like wearing a "kick me" sign
on my neck.

126
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.271
Without that bow tie.
you are just another magician.

127
00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:09.484
But you're Kornelius Kessler's son...
Magic royalty.

128
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.695
Now remember.
nothing but the Golden Wand will do.

129
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.372
If you need me.
I'll be in Branson. Missouri.

130
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.243
Your father instructed me
to tell you to have a good time.

131
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.994
He also asked that I give you this.

132
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.290
And your mother asked
that I give you this.

133
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:25.875
One. two.

134
00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.795
And. Janelle. as always. I must request.

135
00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.023
since I would be the one
who would have to come find you.

136
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.300
please don't run away
like you have at so many other camps.

137
00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:36.011
Maybe you could even try to participate.

138
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.096
I make no promises. Hamilton.

139
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.266
Maybe we can try
and make that attitude disappear.

140
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.817
Andy Duckerman is back. baby!

141
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.051
- Hey. where you going? I'm right here.
- It's Darkwood!

142
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.619
Hi! How are you? Hi. Thank you.

143
00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:05.206
Hi. Hi. Do you guys like magic?

144
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.833
Yeah!

145
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:21.848
I still have to sign in.

146
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.602
I don't know if I belong here.
I just play with cards in my room.

147
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.937
I know you're scared.

148
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.898
but remember why you came
in the first place.

149
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.651
Honey. I miss him too.

150
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.321
But let me ask you one thing.

151
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.032
Do you love magic?

152
00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.372
Can we get outta here
before I get any geek on me?

153
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.874
Don't worry about your room.

154
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.293
I'll never have more than ten friends
in there at one time.

155
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.879
Legend holds that many years ago.

156
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.383
Roy Preston. the world's foremost...
No. check that. five-most

157
00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.761
tap dancing magician disappeared
in this very building

158
00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:04.808
and that if you scream very loud.
he might reappear.

159
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.235
Welcome to Roy Preston's
Prememorial Theater.

160
00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.989
Can you clap twice for me?

161
00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.909
Can you stomp your feet?

162
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.329
Now break it down. Yeah.

163
00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.581
How does everyone else know this?

164
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:32.210
Bravo. Bravo. Very good.

165
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:35.213
Welcome to the last summer session
of the institute.

166
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.340
This summer you're gonna do your best.

167
00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:40.135
then you're gonna do better
than your best.

168
00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:44.514
And the cabin that does better
than the best of the best of the best

169
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.307
at our final performance

170
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:50.395
will win the coveted Top Hat award.

171
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.946
And for the young magician who is deemed
to be the most exceptional...

172
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.284
Whoa.

173
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:05.577
The Golden Wand.

174
00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.829
- Whoa.
- Whoo.

175
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.539
I've won three.

176
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:14.044
Now guiding you on this journey
of self-discovery and magical mastery

177
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.630
are some of the finest magicians
working today.

178
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.925
Leading the Spades cabin. Xerxes!

179
00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.766
Welcome to a summer of snow.

180
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.397
Whoa.

181
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:41.237
And now. leader of the Clubs.
Lena Lambert!

182
00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:48.536
Who dares drink from the goblet of magic?

183
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.622
Spooky.

184
00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.422
Whoa.

185
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.178
Whoa!

186
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.689
Whoa.

187
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.192
Our next magician needs no introduction

188
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:23.863
except she's the leader of the Diamonds.
Kristina Darkwood!

189
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:27.617
Abracadabra. tiny humans.

190
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.327
Whoa.

191
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:33.498
It's wires. obviously. Please.

192
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.794
I see you. I know your hopes.

193
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.839
Who do you dream of being?
Tell your neighbor.

194
00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.259
Whisper it in his ear.

195
00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.344
Was it...

196
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:48.722
Nick Jonas?

197
00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.642
Um. that's wrong.

198
00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:56.021
I dreamed of being Jonas Salk.
not a Jonas brother.

199
00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.480
- Who?
- Are you sure?

200
00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:01.401
Nick Jonas is super cute.
You could get lost in those eyes.

201
00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:07.323
Um. yes. he is very handsome.
But I'm sorry. I said Jonas Salk.

202
00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.577
Inventor of the polio vaccine.

203
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.164
Godfather of antibiotics.

204
00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.874
My Jedi Master.

205
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.960
I'm sorry. This is awkward.

206
00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.629
Maybe someone else took your dream.

207
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:25.175
You! Sir. excuse me!

208
00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:29.262
I think you may have accidentally
taken this young boy's dream.

209
00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.432
No. I didn't take a child's dream.

210
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:35.018
Think we all know there's only
one dream stealer in this room.

211
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.520
Check your pocket.

212
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.529
No way.

213
00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:47.655
Jonas Salk.

214
00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.369
Jonas Salk.

215
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.288
Magic.

216
00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:59.000
No. it's not magic.
It's just statistics. Really.

217
00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.086
Eighty-two percent of people
say "Jonas Salk."

218
00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.254
It's so cool she's a counselor here.

219
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.633
For our last counselor.
leader of the Hearts...

220
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.176
David Blaine?

221
00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.137
- David Blaine? No way. really?
- Hey. hey.

222
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.309
- It's. not David Blaine.
- Aw.

223
00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:21.189
But in his place
is one of the great institute legends.

224
00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:24.984
an incredible talent
whose work can be found

225
00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:29.781
all over the Vegas Strip and
the convention center and local airports.

226
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:33.034
Mr. Andy Duckerman.

227
00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:38.540
Hey. What's up? I'm Andy.

228
00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.793
Would you like to come up on the stage?
Would you like to do some tricks?

229
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:46.089
I didn't even bring any tricks... to do.

230
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.841
You know what?

231
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:51.970
I'm not gonna do a trick.
because it's your stage. guys.

232
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.055
It's not mine.

233
00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:58.601
And I don't steal children's dreams.
'cause I don't have to.

234
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:04.691
I've won the Golden Wand three times.
Boom!

235
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.746
You know what?
I'm gonna grab these real quick.

236
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.285
Carry on. Great stuff.

237
00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.328
- Thank you. Andy.
- Three times!

238
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.622
Okay. so it's time for you
to find your way

239
00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.751
out back to your designated cabins.

240
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.961
Um. how do we know where to go?

241
00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:28.381
Ruth. only you hold that answer.

242
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.594
Yes! Diamonds are the best!

243
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:43.229
Good news. We're in the same bunk.
Wanna share my humidifier?

244
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:47.108
It was either this
or basketball camp with Steph Curry.

245
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:50.445
but Mother said I had to have fun
this summer. so of course I chose this.

246
00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:53.239
- Hey. noobs.
- "Noobs"?

247
00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:58.244
Yeah. like "newbie." Like "new to camp."
like "doesn't know the ropes."

248
00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.914
Doesn't have the "moves."

249
00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:06.628
The name's Vic. As in "victory."

250
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.213
Last year's Golden Wand winner.

251
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.007
Hey. Theo.

252
00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:14.177
Let me see you do a trick.
Time to trick the Vic.

253
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.638
Um. okay. Sure.

254
00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.098
Um...

255
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.059
- Pick a card. Any card.
- Think I've seen this one before.

256
00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.268
I haven't even started.

257
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.522
I'm just messing with ya.

258
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.899
Keep going. you're doing great.

259
00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.527
I just... Um...

260
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:41.287
Okay. I'm gonna take
your queen of spades and...

261
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.378
Don't worry. Just noob nerves.
Let me show you how it's done.

262
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.424
So I have an empty cup
and a bottle of water.

263
00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:55.468
I'm gonna pour it in here
just so you see everything's legit.

264
00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:57.554
Ooh.

265
00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.100
Check this out.

266
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.772
Empty. Ta-da!

267
00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.566
That was cool. Vic.

268
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.193
Wait. but there's one more part
to this trick.

269
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.741
That was uncalled for.

270
00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:21.286
Go run away with Jonas Salk.

271
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.830
Good luck creating a dweeb vaccine!

272
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.916
Magic camp. Even the bullies are nerds.

273
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.461
It's good to be the king.

274
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.507
- You're the best ever!
- Thank you so much.

275
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:37.552
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

276
00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.263
I know you see me. I'm right here.

277
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.351
Kristina. I didn't see you there.

278
00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:47.145
- Hi. Andy. It's been too long.
- I love you. Kristina!

279
00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.731
I was actually gonna say
it hasn't been long enough.

280
00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.608
- Thank you!
- . Well...

281
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.694
I was actually surprised to see you here.
I thought you'd given up magic.

282
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.154
I love you.

283
00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.199
Honestly I'm just doing Preston a favor.
Filling in for David Blaine.

284
00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.492
Kristina. you're the greatest.

285
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.912
That's funny. 'cause Preston asked me
to step in for David this summer.

286
00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.748
Do you think maybe
he's just stroking your ego a little bit?

287
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.092
I'm glad you're here.
It's good to give back.

288
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.169
Mentor kids. train the next generation...

289
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.797
To stab you in the back
when you least expect it.

290
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.050
I really hoped that we were.
you know. past all this.

291
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:21.346
I am. I'm cool.
I'm doing... I'm doing great. honestly.

292
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.140
Doing private shows around the world
for super-important people.

293
00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:27.024
It's why you haven't seen me around.
why you haven't heard of my shows.

294
00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:30.105
But I assure you. it pays quite well.

295
00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:34.275
And that's why you're using
garbage bags as luggage.

296
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.779
- It's a eco-friendly thing.
- It's actually not.

297
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:40.031
Whatever. All I know is
that my bunk is gonna beat you

298
00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.325
just like I did every summer
when we were kids.

299
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.744
- Fine. You're on.
- Fine. You're on.

300
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.205
No. you're... What am I doing?

301
00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:50.000
We're here for the kids.
This is ridiculous.

302
00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:53.753
You know what's ridiculous?
How bad you're gonna lose.

303
00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.012
Nice.

304
00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.180
- Yes.
- Hi. guys!

305
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.183
Welcome. Diamonds! Come on in.

306
00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.978
I'm the Vic.
last year's Golden Wand winner.

307
00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:14.607
Nice.

308
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.610
It's like a cabin
from a horror movie.

309
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.904
- Ew. Gross.
- It's like one giant splinter.

310
00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.157
Aw. man. I forgot my tetanus booster.

311
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.659
Hey. where's the kid that got all wet?

312
00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:30.457
It's okay. Theo. Here's a dry shirt.

313
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.667
Thanks.

314
00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.754
I can't believe Kristina Darkwood
is a counselor this summer.

315
00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.173
I heard when she was our age
she was a total dork.

316
00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.842
but then she got really good at magic
and became super famous.

317
00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.553
Yeah. I think we're all crossing
our fingers for that narrative.

318
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.221
You guys talking about Dorkwood?

319
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.017
Yeah. that's what we used to call her
when she was a camper here.

320
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.935
Kristina Dorkwood.

321
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.899
She never won the Golden Wand three years
in a row. but you know who did?

322
00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.690
- David Blaine?
- No.

323
00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.651
Actually. yes. he did. But so did I.

324
00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:02.113
I won. and Kristina lost every time to me.

325
00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:06.034
So. you should consider yourselves lucky
that you ended up with me and not her.

326
00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.452
Do you still perform?

327
00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.788
Yep. In private shows all over the world.

328
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.748
I've never heard of your solo career.

329
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.168
and I have an encyclopedic knowledge
of magicians both past and present.

330
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.230
And I googled you. Your name only
comes up connected to Kristina Darkwood...

331
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:19.756
Really? Let me see that.

332
00:22:21.383 --> 00:22:23.176
Whoa.

333
00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:25.512
Cool. How does it reappear?

334
00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:28.223
It doesn't.
Not until the last day of summer.

335
00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:31.226
- Camp rules.
- "No phones."

336
00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:35.855
And we're not here to talk about
my amazing and super-secret career.

337
00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:39.859
We're here to win the Top Hat
and the Golden Wand.

338
00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:43.405
So let me meet the young talent
Preston has gifted me with.

339
00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:47.450
You. What is your name?
What is your specialty?

340
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:50.495
My name is Ruth Brusselbach.
and my specialty is bunnies.

341
00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:53.248
I don't know what that means.

342
00:22:53.331 --> 00:22:54.958
Technically. I've never worked with one.

343
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:58.044
but ever since I saw a magician
pull a rabbit out of a hat.

344
00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:00.171
I knew it was my destiny.

345
00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:02.424
- So when does that happen?
- First thing tomorrow.

346
00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:04.676
- Yes.
- What about you? What's your deal?

347
00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:06.302
I'm Judd Kessler.

348
00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.305
Any relation to Kornelius Kessler?

349
00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:10.724
My dad.

350
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:13.852
That's why you're wearing the bow tie!
It's just like your dad's.

351
00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:15.979
Yeah.
it's not my first choice of accessory.

352
00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:19.024
This guy's dad? Living legend.

353
00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:20.984
That must make you a magic thoroughbred.

354
00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:23.236
I'm not sure that's how magic works.

355
00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.780
It's more of a recessive gene
like eye color or blood type.

356
00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:27.049
Don't be shy. Show me somethin'.

357
00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:30.118
Look. I'm just trying to tell you
that I don't know how to do mag...

358
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:32.388
I don't have to worry about you.
You can show me in the morning.

359
00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:33.413
'Kay.

360
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.792
Zyrtec. you got a trick you wanna show me?

361
00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:41.713
That's actually my Zyrtec shirt. Big fan.

362
00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:45.216
Um. I'm Theo.

363
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.385
And. um. not really.

364
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:50.349
It doesn't need to be a new trick.
Just anything you learned last summer.

365
00:23:50.388 --> 00:23:53.266
This is actually my first year here.

366
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.809
- Yep. Me too.
- Me too.

367
00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:56.811
You're all newbies?

368
00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:58.188
Yeah.

369
00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:03.276
Preston.

370
00:24:07.197 --> 00:24:10.533
Tina. Zozo. Alex.

371
00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:13.328
Wow. Really committed to this bunny thing.

372
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.248
Bunny love is not a "thing."
It's a way of life.

373
00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:22.253
Like being a samurai...
only with more bunnies.

374
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:24.339
Okay.

375
00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:31.680
Hey. I forgot to ask.
What's your specialty?

376
00:24:31.763 --> 00:24:33.306
I'm not sure. Cards. I guess.

377
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.392
What did you put on your application?

378
00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:38.353
I don't know. My dad filled it out.

379
00:24:38.436 --> 00:24:41.523
Gotcha. And thanks again
for letting me take the bottom bunk.

380
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.277
As I mentioned before. I'm a bit
of a night pee-er. And sleepwalker.

381
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.155
Unfortunately. not always in that order.

382
00:24:49.614 --> 00:24:53.368
And sometimes. for no reason. I wake up
in the middle of the night screaming.

383
00:24:53.702 --> 00:24:55.286
Welp. see you at 4:00 a.m.

384
00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:58.915
Okay. guys. Lights out. Big day tomorrow.

385
00:24:58.998 --> 00:25:01.501
You get to prove to me
that I'm not wasting my time here.

386
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:03.211
Alaka-zip-it.

387
00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:05.380
Cool!

388
00:25:07.507 --> 00:25:09.134
I don't think he likes us very much.

389
00:25:09.217 --> 00:25:13.138
He uses trash bags as luggage.
He clearly doesn't even like himself.

390
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:16.641
Guys? I can hear you. I'm right here.

391
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.733
Pick a card. Memorize it.

392
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:26.401
Put it back.

393
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:33.033
Okay. Now. you put your card
in the middle. right?

394
00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:34.117
Yeah.

395
00:25:34.784 --> 00:25:38.204
Then how come it reappeared at the top?

396
00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:40.415
Whoa. How did you do that?

397
00:25:40.498 --> 00:25:42.959
A magician never reveals his secrets.

398
00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:46.546
But if I give these cards to you.
then I can teach you.

399
00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.552
Good morning. campers.

400
00:25:52.635 --> 00:25:55.055
Thirty-four days
until the Top Hat competition.

401
00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:57.557
Time to focus on some hocus-pocus.

402
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.143
Lunch will be spaghetti in red sauce.

403
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:04.898
Escape is a fundamental element
in every true magician's arsenal.

404
00:26:04.981 --> 00:26:09.319
So we're gonna be doing
the most basic of escapes.

405
00:26:09.402 --> 00:26:12.030
Hands tied in front. Very easy.

406
00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:15.325
Look. I just did it. Okay. let's try it.

407
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:18.203
Okay. rub your hands
on the back of the knot. On the back.

408
00:26:18.286 --> 00:26:21.164
Do not bite it. Do not bite it.

409
00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:23.458
That is not the back.
That is not right at all.

410
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.461
- Back of the ha...
- Somebody help me!

411
00:26:26.544 --> 00:26:28.963
What? Wow. how did you do...

412
00:26:29.047 --> 00:26:30.847
That is very wrong.
but I'm impressed by that.

413
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.425
Can't feel my thigh.

414
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:35.512
Okay. let's try something simpler.

415
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:36.721
Close-up magic.

416
00:26:36.805 --> 00:26:39.474
This is called a false transfer.

417
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:42.060
You think I put it in my left hand.

418
00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:44.104
It's in my right.

419
00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:45.814
Okay? Let's try it.

420
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.483
Bad. Very bad.

421
00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:49.567
Bad.

422
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.362
Nate. that's pretty good.

423
00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:54.197
It's stuck in my throat.

424
00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:58.451
Wait. are you serious?
Does anyone know the Heimlich?

425
00:26:58.535 --> 00:27:00.203
No? Nurse!

426
00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:07.794
Okay. welcome to manipulation manor.

427
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:11.381
Obviously. fluffy red balls
are too complicated.

428
00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:14.217
so let's work on
some basic animal handling.

429
00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:18.263
Not even magic-related. just simple
petting-zoo-level interactions.

430
00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:21.933
Ha! That skunk's name is Fred.

431
00:27:22.017 --> 00:27:23.226
That's crazy funny.

432
00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:27.105
Does one person
care for all 56 animals here?

433
00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:29.149
- Is that how many animals there are?
- Yeah.

434
00:27:29.232 --> 00:27:31.109
- Yes.
- How'd you know that?

435
00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:32.569
- It's obvious.
- Guys!

436
00:27:32.652 --> 00:27:34.279
Who cares how many animals there are?

437
00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:40.285
Why are these adorable bunnies next
to those horrifying birds and snakes?

438
00:27:40.368 --> 00:27:42.037
And more importantly.

439
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.456
why aren't the bunnies
in my hands right now?

440
00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:46.750
Yes. Ruth. All right.

441
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:48.936
All you've talked about
since you got here are bunnies.

442
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.172
so for your first
impossible-to-mess-up exercise.

443
00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:56.760
I want you to simply...
hold the bunny.

444
00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:10.940
Why are you crying?

445
00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:14.944
It's just so... cute.

446
00:28:15.028 --> 00:28:16.321
It actually hurts.

447
00:28:16.404 --> 00:28:19.407
I can't stand it. The cuteness hurts.

448
00:28:19.491 --> 00:28:23.119
Put it back. Put it back!
Don't you dare put it back.

449
00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:25.622
Good morning. campers.

450
00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:28.249
Twenty-eight days
until the Top Hat competition.

451
00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:29.417
Keep at your training.

452
00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:31.461
And today's lunch is a special treat...

453
00:28:31.544 --> 00:28:35.382
Leftover hot dogs.
courtesy of World Of Weiners. Las Vegas.

454
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:37.842
Great job. guys. Amazing.

455
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.470
Why doesn't Andy teach us like that?

456
00:28:40.553 --> 00:28:42.753
And why does everyone else
get their own cabin T-shirts?

457
00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:45.058
Man. we were this close
to having David Blaine.

458
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:47.102
Guys. again. right here.

459
00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:50.146
Great.
Your first magic trick of the whole camp.

460
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.440
Right?

461
00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.442
You wanna snap it.

462
00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:56.194
All right. I wanna see you guys.

463
00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.490
Make sure you have follow-through
with your wrist. Okay. that's better.

464
00:29:02.242 --> 00:29:03.618
Preston. can...

465
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.873
Can we not do this right now?

466
00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:10.917
I know you're in here. Preston.

467
00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:14.129
Hiding in some trapdoor or hidden corner.

468
00:29:14.212 --> 00:29:17.507
waiting for me to turn around
so you can magically appear and say.

469
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.910
- "I've been right here the whole time."
- the whole time.

470
00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.012
Exactly. You're so predictable.

471
00:29:22.095 --> 00:29:25.223
- What's the problem?
- The bunk that you gave me is the problem.

472
00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:28.560
These kids. Preston. they're all newbies.
They have zero skills.

473
00:29:28.643 --> 00:29:32.355
Now. you understand that this is a camp
for children who wanna learn magic.

474
00:29:32.439 --> 00:29:33.648
and you're here to teach them.

475
00:29:33.732 --> 00:29:35.692
Preston. these kids. they're hopeless.

476
00:29:35.775 --> 00:29:37.736
Nathan choked on a sponge ball.

477
00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:41.197
Ruth can't even touch a bunny.
And she loves bunnies.

478
00:29:41.281 --> 00:29:43.366
They can't even pull off
the most basic card trick.

479
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.286
But you see.
a trick that you don't believe is a trick.

480
00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:47.579
that's the best trick of all.

481
00:29:47.662 --> 00:29:49.222
That's the advice you're gonna give me?

482
00:29:49.247 --> 00:29:51.082
Just more generic magical proverbs

483
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:54.294
that sound meaningful
but are total nonsense?

484
00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:57.672
Andy. the only way
to create more magic in the world

485
00:29:57.756 --> 00:30:00.091
is not by creating more magic.

486
00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:02.594
- Yep. Just like that.
- Andy. let me finish.

487
00:30:02.677 --> 00:30:03.845
- No. I'm done.
- It's...

488
00:30:03.928 --> 00:30:07.474
I'm sorry. Preston. but I'm done.
I'm outta here. Okay?

489
00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:11.436
Stupid.

490
00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:14.314
I was doing perfectly fine.

491
00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:19.069
Well. not great. I was doing good.
Was doing good-ish. Sort of.

492
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.126
I could be mistaken.

493
00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:40.340
but I think I saw a 12-year-old execute
a perfect faro shuffle with one hand.

494
00:30:40.423 --> 00:30:41.591
I was just fooling around.

495
00:30:41.675 --> 00:30:45.804
A faro shuffle is one of the single
most difficult card skills with two hands.

496
00:30:45.887 --> 00:30:47.972
and you just did it with one. I think.

497
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:50.517
- Do it again.
- I don't want to.

498
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.311
- Why not? You just did it.
- I get scared.

499
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.358
- Scared of what?
- I don't know. People looking at me.

500
00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:01.820
Anyway. it's stupid. Just...

501
00:31:01.903 --> 00:31:03.613
You know what that is?

502
00:31:03.697 --> 00:31:05.323
That is stage fright.

503
00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:08.785
Gets in your head. And that is
a freaky place for a magician to be.

504
00:31:09.244 --> 00:31:12.747
- It's happened to you before?
- No. Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:15.250
Although. I am an acclaimed professional.

506
00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:19.796
You. on the other hand. are a rank amateur
who can somehow do a perfect faro shuffle.

507
00:31:19.879 --> 00:31:21.464
So let me see it.

508
00:31:22.298 --> 00:31:24.443
- Like I said...
- Pretend I'm not here. Don't look at me.

509
00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:26.761
Keep shuffling.
Keep the cards moving. Okay?

510
00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:29.681
So where you from?

511
00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:32.517
Lancaster. California.

512
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.810
That sounds...

513
00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:37.564
That sounds boring. actually.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

514
00:31:37.647 --> 00:31:39.983
It's okay. Maybe a little boring.

515
00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:43.903
We live near Edwards Air Force Base.
Lot of military families.

516
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.905
Is your dad in the service?

517
00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:47.365
He was.

518
00:31:48.074 --> 00:31:50.952
Um. these were his cards.

519
00:31:52.454 --> 00:31:55.957
Hey! Do you have any brothers or sisters?

520
00:31:56.332 --> 00:31:59.669
I have a little brother named Cameron.
He's the worst.

521
00:31:59.753 --> 00:32:02.130
- Super annoying?
- Yeah. totally.

522
00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:05.842
Dude. you're great. Show me your routine.

523
00:32:06.593 --> 00:32:09.387
Okay. Um. just take a card.

524
00:32:10.055 --> 00:32:12.724
All right.

525
00:32:12.807 --> 00:32:14.309
Now put it on top for me.

526
00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:16.144
Okay.

527
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.021
And. um...

528
00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:23.943
Hey. relax.

529
00:32:24.027 --> 00:32:26.112
It's just you and me.

530
00:32:26.196 --> 00:32:27.822
Okay. try again.

531
00:32:30.617 --> 00:32:31.951
Relax.

532
00:32:32.452 --> 00:32:34.162
It's just you and me.

533
00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:41.920
Okay. three of diamonds.

534
00:32:43.004 --> 00:32:45.799
'Kay? Just gonna put that in there.

535
00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:48.426
- Now can you just tuck it in for me?
- Sure.

536
00:32:51.888 --> 00:32:53.056
Is this your card?

537
00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:55.934
My God. Theo!

538
00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:57.644
You are amazing.

539
00:32:58.269 --> 00:33:00.021
Nah. I just know some tricks.

540
00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:02.065
No. you are a magician.

541
00:33:02.899 --> 00:33:05.402
- Thanks.
- I can work with this.

542
00:33:05.485 --> 00:33:07.529
Too bad your bunkmates are so useless.

543
00:33:07.612 --> 00:33:11.991
Nathan is a genius with numbers.
and Judd knows a lot about...

544
00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:15.203
We need to have a little talk with
your bunk right now. Let's go. Come on.

545
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.788
Guys. hey.

546
00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:20.166
What if I told you we have
at least some semblance of a shot

547
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.668
to win the Top Hat competition?

548
00:33:21.751 --> 00:33:24.045
I'd say my blood sugar is really low.

549
00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:28.091
No. I'm serious.
Theo is apparently a secret Cardini.

550
00:33:28.174 --> 00:33:31.803
and he tells me that you guys
don't suck half as bad as I thought.

551
00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:35.598
Which I find hard to believe.
but let's not make a liar out of him.

552
00:33:35.682 --> 00:33:38.518
Are you messing with us
as a punishment for being awful at magic?

553
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:41.771
I'm serious.
As a three-time Golden Wand winner and...

554
00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:44.065
Wait. You won the Golden Wand?

555
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:45.817
We've heard. Now can we eat?

556
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.029
- In a second. I'm addressing you.
- Can you address us while we eat?

557
00:33:49.112 --> 00:33:52.991
No. no. I had envisioned
this whole rousing speech thing first.

558
00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:56.703
You don't get to do the whole rousing
speech thing until you teach us stuff.

559
00:33:56.786 --> 00:33:58.705
Okay. fair point. But hear me out.

560
00:33:58.788 --> 00:34:01.875
If we can find the areas
where you don't totally stink.

561
00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:05.086
I can train you
to be sort of decent magicians.

562
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:09.841
And with Theo's skills. we might
actually be able to beat Darkwood.

563
00:34:10.592 --> 00:34:13.720
I mean. win the Top Hat competition!

564
00:34:13.803 --> 00:34:15.096
Who's with me?

565
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.892
Okay. this is where you guys start going.
"Andy! Andy!"

566
00:34:18.975 --> 00:34:20.518
If we say yes. can we eat?

567
00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:22.896
- Yes!
- Okay.

568
00:34:22.979 --> 00:34:26.608
- Finally.
- Let's fuel up. We got work to do.

569
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:28.109
Walk towards me.

570
00:34:28.777 --> 00:34:31.488
Not so stiff. okay? Walk naturally.

571
00:34:31.571 --> 00:34:33.782
Hold your hands
as if they're actually empty.

572
00:34:35.992 --> 00:34:39.579
Now they are actually empty.
Come on. guys. This is Palming 101.

573
00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:42.999
Nathan. don't tell me you're allergic
to Tsum Tsums.

574
00:34:43.083 --> 00:34:45.126
No. But I'm allergic to dirt.

575
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.631
Okay. guys. we are taking it
to the next level with straitjackets.

576
00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:52.342
You know. this is nice. actually.
It's kind of like a hug.

577
00:34:52.884 --> 00:34:55.345
- It is. isn't it?
- Hey. Andy. could you reapply for me?

578
00:34:55.428 --> 00:34:57.472
Yeah. Yeah. I got you. bud.

579
00:34:58.181 --> 00:34:59.241
- Thank you.
- Tell me when.

580
00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:00.266
That's good.

581
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.351
- You good?
- Yes.

582
00:35:01.434 --> 00:35:03.436
- This is impossible.
- No. it isn't.

583
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.358
Houdini once said.
"My brain is the key that sets me free."

584
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:09.693
Was Houdini Irish?

585
00:35:09.776 --> 00:35:11.629
No. he was Hungarian.
That was a bad impression.

586
00:35:11.653 --> 00:35:16.658
Okay. exhale fully. then use that slack
to reach your arm all the way back.

587
00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:19.119
Whoo.

588
00:35:19.202 --> 00:35:21.454
All right! Now you're getting it.
High five.

589
00:35:22.205 --> 00:35:23.415
Of course.

590
00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:25.667
- Ooh.
- That is my bad.

591
00:35:26.209 --> 00:35:27.585
Yes!

592
00:35:27.669 --> 00:35:29.629
Now do I get to work with the bunnies?

593
00:35:29.713 --> 00:35:32.507
Ruth.
you are nowhere near bunny-ready.

594
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.884
Why are you messing
with my emotions like this?

595
00:35:35.552 --> 00:35:38.430
Well. before you run.
you gotta learn how to crawl.

596
00:35:38.513 --> 00:35:42.100
Which leads me to... the turtles.

597
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:45.395
Tiny and slow. just like you guys.
Go ahead. grab one.

598
00:35:45.478 --> 00:35:48.481
Bunny pile! I'm ready for my cuddles!

599
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:50.316
Come to me. my friends!

600
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.526
Get 'em! Quickly!

601
00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:53.111
Ruth! No!

602
00:35:53.194 --> 00:35:54.529
- Drop the turtles.
- Come back!

603
00:35:54.612 --> 00:35:57.032
- No! They're getting out!
- Where are you going?

604
00:35:57.115 --> 00:35:59.868
In the box. Grab a bunny!
Everybody. everybody. just get 'em.

605
00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:01.661
- Where are you going?
- Get the bunnies!

606
00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:05.540
Exhale to create some slack.
Get your arm up over your shoulder.

607
00:36:05.623 --> 00:36:06.958
Keep 'em away from the water!

608
00:36:07.042 --> 00:36:10.003
Over there!

609
00:36:10.086 --> 00:36:11.087
Man down!

610
00:36:11.796 --> 00:36:14.674
Well. that's one cabin we don't have
to worry about for Top Hat.

611
00:36:15.842 --> 00:36:18.011
Vic. what did I tell you?
Be nice.

612
00:36:19.971 --> 00:36:21.222
Stop those bunnies!

613
00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:23.641
- Ew. Gross.
- Get 'em!

614
00:36:23.725 --> 00:36:25.602
- Over there!
- Yeah. I just screamed that.

615
00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:28.688
- Concentrate on your straitjackets.
- They're getting away!

616
00:36:28.772 --> 00:36:31.066
- Where's Janelle?
- Pathetic. Grab the bunny.

617
00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:33.610
Why are you running from me?

618
00:36:34.027 --> 00:36:35.111
I got one!

619
00:36:35.612 --> 00:36:37.614
- Wait. No. I didn't...
- Under the bush!

620
00:36:38.698 --> 00:36:39.866
Gotcha!

621
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.868
No. don't go!

622
00:36:41.951 --> 00:36:44.371
I'm just looking for the bunnies
that got away.

623
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:47.207
- Do I look like a bunny?
- What? No.

624
00:36:47.749 --> 00:36:51.419
Well. maybe a little.
I mean. like. cute like a bunny.

625
00:36:51.503 --> 00:36:54.839
Well. not cute-cute.
Not that you're not cute.

626
00:36:54.923 --> 00:36:58.927
He wouldn't trick the Vic.
so I palmed his phone into a Big Gulp.

627
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.889
How'd you get with the Diamonds anyway?
You seem nice.

628
00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:05.767
My parents probably paid extra
for me to be with Darkwood.

629
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.227
That's pretty cool of them.

630
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.187
They're not trying to be cool.

631
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.524
They just don't want me getting in the way
of their busy work schedule.

632
00:37:14.484 --> 00:37:16.194
- Hey. is that Janelle?
- Yeah.

633
00:37:16.277 --> 00:37:19.280
- She's so weird.
- Um. I gotta bounce.

634
00:37:19.364 --> 00:37:22.742
I saw you get out of that straitjacket.
How did you do that?

635
00:37:22.826 --> 00:37:25.328
I don't know. It's just fun.

636
00:37:25.412 --> 00:37:27.831
Like a puzzle you do with your body.
I guess.

637
00:37:29.332 --> 00:37:31.751
Okay. now I really gotta go.

638
00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:33.878
I'm Janelle. by the way.

639
00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:35.714
Theo.

640
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.302
Seventeen days until Top Hat.

641
00:37:41.386 --> 00:37:43.013
Lunch will be casserole.

642
00:37:43.096 --> 00:37:44.806
It is unclear what kind.

643
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:48.560
This is what we call the French drop.
You see?

644
00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:51.563
You got to protect the angle
from the audience.

645
00:37:51.646 --> 00:37:53.126
- Ooh. ooh.
- All right. you guys try.

646
00:37:55.859 --> 00:37:58.153
That was surprisingly not terrible. Ruth.

647
00:37:58.236 --> 00:37:59.446
Thanks. Andy.

648
00:38:05.577 --> 00:38:06.870
Attaboy. Andy.

649
00:38:06.953 --> 00:38:11.082
Seems like you guys have been listening
to my amazing teaching after all.

650
00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:13.710
Magic isn't exactly a cardio workout.

651
00:38:13.793 --> 00:38:17.714
Your parents are insisting we try to get
you some physical activity this summer.

652
00:38:17.797 --> 00:38:18.965
so... look alive.

653
00:38:24.012 --> 00:38:26.514
Okay. workout over! Back to magic!

654
00:38:26.598 --> 00:38:30.810
Vanish... and appearance!

655
00:38:31.811 --> 00:38:33.730
Wow. Good job.

656
00:38:34.814 --> 00:38:38.526
Okay. I think it's time
we take things to the next level.

657
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:39.652
Whoa!

658
00:38:39.736 --> 00:38:42.989
What?
I said I wanted to work with bunnies.

659
00:38:43.073 --> 00:38:45.992
not those terrifying.
flying poop-machines.

660
00:38:46.076 --> 00:38:48.536
Well. Ruth.
you liberated all of the bunnies.

661
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.373
so this is what we have to work with.

662
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:52.874
Raise out your finger.

663
00:38:54.125 --> 00:38:56.461
Doves are like flying bunnies.

664
00:38:56.544 --> 00:38:59.172
They're an extension
of a magician's emotions.

665
00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:02.050
If you're confident. it's confident.
If you're nervous...

666
00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:03.593
Whoa!

667
00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:06.596
Then that happens.

668
00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:13.019
And apparently so does that.

669
00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:14.270
Okay. Hearts.

670
00:39:14.354 --> 00:39:20.151
I think you're ready to hear one
of the biggest secrets in all of magic.

671
00:39:20.235 --> 00:39:23.655
Behind every great magician. there is...

672
00:39:23.738 --> 00:39:25.907
An even better tailor.

673
00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:30.412
- Nice.
- That sports coat is amazing.

674
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:35.000
Judd. am I sensing
an enthusiasm for costumes?

675
00:39:38.128 --> 00:39:42.716
Welcome to the fabulous world
of costume design.

676
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.304
Think I'm gonna spend the rest
of the day here. if that's cool with you.

677
00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:50.974
Ruth. maybe you just need
something bigger.

678
00:39:53.518 --> 00:39:55.395
Now. Ethan. she's not food. okay?

679
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.447
Whoa.

680
00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:08.700
Hawks are my thing now.

681
00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:12.078
Birds love the color green.
It's like... It's like you're a tree.

682
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.418
All right. come with me.

683
00:40:21.755 --> 00:40:23.715
Hey. Dad. I got a new trick.

684
00:40:23.798 --> 00:40:26.176
I-I can't right now. Theo.
I'm late for my flight.

685
00:40:26.259 --> 00:40:29.512
- Do it for your mom.
- Mom's not into magic. Please?

686
00:40:30.263 --> 00:40:32.974
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.
- All right.

687
00:40:33.058 --> 00:40:34.476
Pick a card.

688
00:40:34.934 --> 00:40:35.935
There we go.

689
00:40:36.019 --> 00:40:38.730
All right. Now don't let me see
it's the jack of hearts.

690
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.067
Okay.

691
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.777
That's pretty good. How'd you know?

692
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.862
'Cause that's me. I'm the jack of hearts.

693
00:40:45.945 --> 00:40:49.407
And... that's you.

694
00:40:50.575 --> 00:40:53.161
- You're the king of hearts.
- How did you do...

695
00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:55.163
That's incredible.
You're incredible. Theo.

696
00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:57.499
Theo. Theo.

697
00:40:57.582 --> 00:41:01.169
Look. everyone's acts are shaping up.
but neither of us have one yet.

698
00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:04.839
So I was thinking we could form
a magical comedy duo

699
00:41:04.923 --> 00:41:09.135
with me doing plucky banter while you
wow everyone with your card magic.

700
00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:12.472
I've read that fart sounds
are quite the crowd-pleaser.

701
00:41:12.555 --> 00:41:16.643
You sneak me even a bit of cheese.
and I will blow the roof off this place.

702
00:41:16.726 --> 00:41:19.562
- Nate. definitely don't fart on the crowd.
- Okay.

703
00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:22.023
Why aren't you guys working?
The show's next week.

704
00:41:22.107 --> 00:41:24.109
I'm still trying to figure out
my specialty.

705
00:41:24.192 --> 00:41:26.736
Yeah. that is a tricky one.

706
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.322
Hey. Nate.
how many seats are in this theater?

707
00:41:30.365 --> 00:41:31.991
273. Why?

708
00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:34.869
Why? Because it's freakish
how quickly you could do that.

709
00:41:34.953 --> 00:41:37.038
You've got something special
that no one else has.

710
00:41:37.622 --> 00:41:41.543
A protruding tailbone is actually
more common than you'd expect.

711
00:41:41.626 --> 00:41:43.688
He's talking about the way
you do your counting stuff.

712
00:41:43.712 --> 00:41:48.133
Yeah. I just count.
I count and group and multiply and...

713
00:41:48.216 --> 00:41:49.718
That's magic.

714
00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:53.722
Your brain is like a big.
weird magic calculator.

715
00:41:53.805 --> 00:41:56.057
You could be a mentalist.

716
00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:57.392
Like Kris Darkwood?

717
00:41:57.475 --> 00:41:59.644
Better than Kris Dorkwood.

718
00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:02.355
- I need to sit down.
- You are.

719
00:42:13.324 --> 00:42:14.659
Very nice.

720
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.871
Looking good. guys. Whoo!

721
00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:19.956
- Andy. come here.
- Okay.

722
00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:22.959
Whoa.

723
00:42:24.294 --> 00:42:25.295
Yep.

724
00:42:26.379 --> 00:42:28.673
- Good. Yes!
- That looked so good.

725
00:42:29.591 --> 00:42:31.676
Okay. Theo. show us what you got.

726
00:42:38.308 --> 00:42:41.644
- Unbelievable.
- Okay. let's take ten.

727
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.481
You guys.
keep working on your pinky break.

728
00:42:44.564 --> 00:42:46.358
Nathan. give your pinky a break.

729
00:42:46.983 --> 00:42:50.320
- It was an itch. not a pick. I swear.
- Okay. yeah. cool. all right.

730
00:42:50.403 --> 00:42:52.739
Dude. what's going on?
You're still in your head.

731
00:42:53.198 --> 00:42:55.468
You know what? Follow me.
There's something you need to see.

732
00:42:55.492 --> 00:42:56.743
Come on.

733
00:43:01.873 --> 00:43:03.667
Preston's secret library.

734
00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:06.628
He took me here when I was about your age.

735
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:09.964
He said it was for
only truly exceptional magicians.

736
00:43:10.799 --> 00:43:12.425
Go ahead. check it out.

737
00:43:28.024 --> 00:43:29.526
It's an owl.

738
00:43:33.905 --> 00:43:35.448
Is that you and Darkwood?

739
00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:38.201
Wow.

740
00:43:38.827 --> 00:43:39.828
Yep.

741
00:43:40.662 --> 00:43:43.623
- Yeah. that's us.
- The "Abraca-Duo"?

742
00:43:43.707 --> 00:43:47.210
Hey. don't judge.
It was a very catchy name at the time.

743
00:43:48.086 --> 00:43:50.088
So. why do you hate each other now?

744
00:43:52.966 --> 00:43:54.217
Wow. Um...

745
00:43:55.093 --> 00:43:57.053
When we were campers. we were close.

746
00:43:57.137 --> 00:43:58.763
♪ I put a spell on you ♪

747
00:43:58.847 --> 00:44:00.098
I was like the cool...

748
00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:01.683
older superstar of the camp

749
00:44:01.766 --> 00:44:04.060
and she was kinda my protégée.

750
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:07.480
♪ Because you're mine ♪

751
00:44:09.607 --> 00:44:11.526
After school. we became partners.

752
00:44:11.609 --> 00:44:13.737
At first.
we just did a lot of street magic.

753
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.321
♪ Stop the things you do ♪

754
00:44:15.405 --> 00:44:18.950
But word got around and pretty soon
we were booking real gigs.

755
00:44:19.951 --> 00:44:22.871
Not to brag.
but we were pretty amazing together.

756
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:29.586
I know it's kinda hard to believe.
but we actually used to be a couple.

757
00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:31.713
It's obvious.

758
00:44:33.423 --> 00:44:36.926
I mean. you can tell
she still has feelings for you.

759
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.470
- I know. right?
- Yeah.

760
00:44:38.553 --> 00:44:40.680
It's like. get over it. you know?

761
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.061
Anyway. we started doing
bigger and bigger theaters.

762
00:44:46.144 --> 00:44:47.937
trying to get our own show in Vegas.

763
00:44:48.813 --> 00:44:52.275
Then she went behind my back.

764
00:44:52.359 --> 00:44:54.736
Took a meeting with a big TV booker
without me.

765
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.282
When I found out.
we got in this huge fight and we broke up.

766
00:44:59.657 --> 00:45:03.370
She did the solo TV gig
and skyrocketed to fame.

767
00:45:04.287 --> 00:45:07.374
I also started to perform solo. but...

768
00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:13.755
It was rough.

769
00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:18.051
One night I did a show
for just one person... Tony.

770
00:45:18.677 --> 00:45:20.261
He worked on my car earlier that day.

771
00:45:20.345 --> 00:45:22.889
Can you imagine just doing magic
for one person?

772
00:45:22.972 --> 00:45:27.185
I can. That's why I did magic.
For my dad.

773
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:31.189
I'd only perform for him.

774
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.025
But now. he's. um...

775
00:45:36.986 --> 00:45:38.697
- He...
- Hey. it's okay.

776
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:42.200
We don't have to talk about that now.

777
00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:44.494
Come on. let's get out of here.

778
00:45:54.963 --> 00:45:56.881
- Going somewhere?
- Let me out.

779
00:45:57.382 --> 00:46:01.261
You've been pulling this all summer.
sneaking away before practice.

780
00:46:01.344 --> 00:46:03.471
You know you chose to come here?

781
00:46:03.555 --> 00:46:05.974
Not really.
I've never even done magic before.

782
00:46:06.057 --> 00:46:08.727
- My parents just sent me away.
- I'm sorry.

783
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.270
That's really not fair.

784
00:46:10.353 --> 00:46:12.230
Okay. you get it. So let me out.

785
00:46:12.313 --> 00:46:13.732
Could do that.

786
00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:17.152
But what if you chose to look at
this whole summer as a kind of challenge?

787
00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:19.738
Like that constrictor knot
holding this net.

788
00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:20.822
What do you mean?

789
00:46:20.905 --> 00:46:24.159
Well. you're stuck here at camp.
just like you're stuck in this net.

790
00:46:24.242 --> 00:46:27.120
You didn't choose either situation.
but they happened.

791
00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:28.788
So. you have two options.

792
00:46:28.872 --> 00:46:33.543
You can continue being unhappy and stuck.
or you can do something about it.

793
00:46:34.044 --> 00:46:35.462
Change your situation.

794
00:46:35.545 --> 00:46:38.089
I've seen what you can do
with that straitjacket.

795
00:46:48.183 --> 00:46:50.060
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

796
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:53.646
Ha!

797
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.315
Good day. campers.

798
00:46:55.398 --> 00:46:58.443
Just five days
until the Top Hat competition.

799
00:46:58.526 --> 00:47:01.613
But remember. you are not competing
with each other. but yourselves.

800
00:47:01.696 --> 00:47:02.906
And also each other.

801
00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:06.409
Please report any loose bunny sightings
to the maintenance staff.

802
00:47:07.077 --> 00:47:08.370
Lunch will be rabbit.

803
00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:11.206
Kidding. Ham salad.

804
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:16.670
- Um. what are you guys doing?
- We're waiting here for you.

805
00:47:16.753 --> 00:47:21.174
I've got some great news
and some less-than-great news.

806
00:47:21.257 --> 00:47:23.259
I think I know
how to cure your stage fright.

807
00:47:23.343 --> 00:47:26.054
That's amazing.
What's the less-great news?

808
00:47:26.137 --> 00:47:28.682
It's called the gauntlet.
And it may get messy.

809
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.684
Just show us some cardistry.

810
00:47:30.934 --> 00:47:33.103
You did it for me before.
You can do it again.

811
00:47:33.186 --> 00:47:34.437
I don't think I can.

812
00:47:34.521 --> 00:47:36.523
Don't think. just do it.

813
00:47:36.606 --> 00:47:38.191
And be prepared for anything.

814
00:47:38.566 --> 00:47:39.693
Let's go. Show us.

815
00:47:39.776 --> 00:47:42.445
That's it. Yeah. good job. Theo.

816
00:47:42.529 --> 00:47:44.239
Ruth. Nathan. now.

817
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:46.991
The distance between two points...

818
00:47:47.075 --> 00:47:49.244
is the square root of X of 200.

819
00:47:49.327 --> 00:47:51.413
Hey. focus up. okay?

820
00:47:51.496 --> 00:47:53.415
Block everything else out.
It's just you and me.

821
00:47:57.544 --> 00:48:01.297
Yes. great job. Now. friffle into cascade.
Right into it.

822
00:48:02.382 --> 00:48:04.009
Judd. Vera. now!

823
00:48:07.053 --> 00:48:09.264
Okay. now charlier into L cuts.

824
00:48:14.853 --> 00:48:16.104
Yes!

825
00:48:16.187 --> 00:48:18.064
I knew you could do it.

826
00:48:21.234 --> 00:48:22.235
Seriously?

827
00:48:23.737 --> 00:48:26.489
It's on.

828
00:48:26.573 --> 00:48:28.700
Magic fight!

829
00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:38.585
We got him!

830
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:44.758
- My...
- Wait. where'd he go?

831
00:48:44.841 --> 00:48:46.801
He's like a magic ninja.

832
00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:48.511
Ha ha!

833
00:49:00.398 --> 00:49:02.359
You think you got me
where you want me.

834
00:49:02.442 --> 00:49:05.737
But maybe I got you
right where I want you.

835
00:49:06.446 --> 00:49:07.697
Alaka-zip-it.

836
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:16.456
Lucky Charms?

837
00:49:16.831 --> 00:49:19.250
"They're magically delicious." Get it?

838
00:49:19.334 --> 00:49:20.335
We get it.

839
00:49:20.418 --> 00:49:22.003
How'd you even know?

840
00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:23.672
Because I am a magic ninja.

841
00:49:23.755 --> 00:49:24.923
Our clothes are ruined.

842
00:49:26.091 --> 00:49:27.717
I think I got us covered.

843
00:50:00.583 --> 00:50:04.671
Yeah. but at least think about it.

844
00:50:05.422 --> 00:50:08.883
It's only a short flight away. right?
Okay. bye.

845
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:13.972
Hey. they finally added
a nondairy option to the ice cream bar.

846
00:50:14.055 --> 00:50:17.308
Look. it's one of the broken Hearts.

847
00:50:17.392 --> 00:50:18.727
Where do you think you're going?

848
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:21.438
I was just gonna get
some No Cream Ice Dream.

849
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:23.148
You really can't taste the difference.

850
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:26.401
I don't know. It looks like
you're trying to trick the Vic.

851
00:50:26.484 --> 00:50:29.320
- Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.
- No. I'm not.

852
00:50:29.404 --> 00:50:33.241
And it's a bit awkward
that you refer to yourself as "the Vic."

853
00:50:33.908 --> 00:50:35.118
Pick a card.

854
00:50:35.702 --> 00:50:37.120
Um. I'd rather not.

855
00:50:37.203 --> 00:50:39.873
Pick... a... card.

856
00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:41.249
'Kay.

857
00:50:42.334 --> 00:50:43.501
Okay. memorize it.

858
00:50:45.545 --> 00:50:50.008
Now. I'm going to deal out the four aces
in order from best to worst.

859
00:50:50.759 --> 00:50:54.054
Diamonds. spades. clubs.

860
00:50:54.137 --> 00:50:58.308
and. last but also least. hearts.

861
00:50:59.517 --> 00:51:00.977
Don't forget your card. okay?

862
00:51:01.061 --> 00:51:04.272
I'll do this slow 'cause I know
you Hearts are. a bit slow.

863
00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.321
And... boom!

864
00:51:11.404 --> 00:51:15.116
Your card is gone.
But. wait. where'd it go?

865
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.911
Is that a rhetorical question.
or am I supposed to answer it?

866
00:51:17.994 --> 00:51:19.913
Check the box. dummy.

867
00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:26.044
Whoa!

868
00:51:26.795 --> 00:51:28.588
So. how'd I do it?

869
00:51:29.297 --> 00:51:31.591
I don't know. I-I got nothing.

870
00:51:31.675 --> 00:51:33.551
Nothing.

871
00:51:33.635 --> 00:51:36.554
That's all you and the rest
of the Hearts are... nothing.

872
00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.766
Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.

873
00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:42.102
- Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.
- Hey. Vic.

874
00:51:42.185 --> 00:51:43.436
I know how you do it.

875
00:51:44.646 --> 00:51:46.356
- I got you. buddy.
- Okay.

876
00:51:46.439 --> 00:51:49.651
If you know how I do it. then you do it.

877
00:51:49.734 --> 00:51:52.862
First off. nice card force
to your duplicate.

878
00:51:52.946 --> 00:51:56.032
But I can't do the trick
exactly how you did it

879
00:51:56.116 --> 00:52:00.203
'cause... I don't have double-stick tape.

880
00:52:00.286 --> 00:52:02.539
Nice.

881
00:52:02.622 --> 00:52:04.040
Spoiler alert!

882
00:52:06.209 --> 00:52:07.627
Carry on.

883
00:52:07.711 --> 00:52:09.087
Now. if I was gonna do it.

884
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:13.008
I would've taken one of the aces.
the ace of hearts.

885
00:52:13.091 --> 00:52:16.094
and I would've turned it into your card.

886
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:21.224
Or I would've done a visual vanish.

887
00:52:21.975 --> 00:52:23.351
Something like this.

888
00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:30.176
- You teach him that?
- I may have helped out a little bit.

889
00:52:30.233 --> 00:52:31.234
Nice. Theo.

890
00:52:31.317 --> 00:52:33.570
And if I was gonna use a duplicate.

891
00:52:33.653 --> 00:52:37.490
I wouldn't make it appear
somewhere obvious like a card box.

892
00:52:37.574 --> 00:52:40.201
I would make it appear
somewhere really impossible

893
00:52:40.285 --> 00:52:41.828
like your left pants pocket.

894
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.122
What? No way.

895
00:52:45.915 --> 00:52:48.501
Whoa!

896
00:52:48.585 --> 00:52:51.463
But that would've required
something you don't have...

897
00:52:52.172 --> 00:52:53.173
A friend.

898
00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:55.300
Sick burn.

899
00:52:55.383 --> 00:52:58.887
Theo! Theo! Theo!

900
00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:02.557
Hey. what are you doing? Give those back.

901
00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.434
Chill out. bud.

902
00:53:04.517 --> 00:53:05.894
That was impressive.

903
00:53:05.977 --> 00:53:08.104
So. let me show you one more trick.

904
00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:12.150
Maybe you can tell me how I do this one.

905
00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:17.572
Whoa!

906
00:53:21.034 --> 00:53:23.244
- Aw.
- No.

907
00:53:23.328 --> 00:53:26.247
No. my cards!
How could you do this to my cards!

908
00:53:26.331 --> 00:53:28.208
- Come on!
- Why would you do that?

909
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:30.460
- Bring 'em back! No! No!
- Not cool. Vic.

910
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:33.713
You're all in trouble.
Everybody. back to the bunk.

911
00:53:46.768 --> 00:53:49.854
I've got an extra deck of cards
in the bunk.

912
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.149
You know. they have photos
of my Minecraft avatars on them.

913
00:53:53.233 --> 00:53:56.361
but they're yours if you want 'em.

914
00:53:57.487 --> 00:53:59.614
Thanks. but...

915
00:54:01.241 --> 00:54:02.784
those cards were special.

916
00:54:03.326 --> 00:54:04.828
Why?

917
00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:07.247
My dad gave 'em to me.

918
00:54:14.129 --> 00:54:17.048
He was the first person
to ever show me magic.

919
00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:21.886
My dad. he... He was...

920
00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:28.059
He... He was... He was great.

921
00:54:30.228 --> 00:54:32.939
He... He died.

922
00:54:33.023 --> 00:54:35.900
And I-I-I just...

923
00:54:35.984 --> 00:54:38.278
I really. really miss him.

924
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:48.621
You know. everyone expects me
to be this great magician.

925
00:54:49.581 --> 00:54:51.416
But I'm not.

926
00:54:51.958 --> 00:54:53.793
And I don't think I really wanna be.

927
00:54:55.545 --> 00:54:57.297
But I'm afraid to tell my dad that.

928
00:54:59.007 --> 00:55:01.760
I say I have 109 known allergies.

929
00:55:01.843 --> 00:55:06.264
but... it's really only 108.

930
00:55:06.765 --> 00:55:09.100
I'm not actually allergic to gluten.

931
00:55:09.809 --> 00:55:13.188
I just can't stand
my mom's beef stroganoff.

932
00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:19.152
Ruth. is there anything you wanna share?

933
00:55:21.321 --> 00:55:24.449
I used to think I was adorable.
like a bunny.

934
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:28.870
But now I have this thirst for blood.
like a hawk.

935
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:32.624
You're making your way up the food chain.

936
00:55:32.707 --> 00:55:33.708
Proud of you.

937
00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:37.504
Whoa.
Vera. was that a compliment I just heard?

938
00:55:38.838 --> 00:55:43.009
What I meant was.
every day. I dislike you a little less.

939
00:55:45.762 --> 00:55:48.932
I don't perform private shows
all over the world.

940
00:55:49.683 --> 00:55:51.976
Or anywhere. actually.

941
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.978
Yeah. we kinda figured that.

942
00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:00.694
When I was your age. I performed
because it was the most fun in the world.

943
00:56:01.194 --> 00:56:05.824
I mean. that's all I wanted.
to have my own show and be the guy.

944
00:56:07.575 --> 00:56:10.453
And then something happened...

945
00:56:10.537 --> 00:56:12.080
Darkwood ended your partnership.

946
00:56:12.163 --> 00:56:14.374
- Broke your heart.
- Made you lose your mojo.

947
00:56:14.833 --> 00:56:18.169
What? No. I wouldn't... I wouldn't... Um...

948
00:56:18.253 --> 00:56:20.046
No. That's not...

949
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.340
Well. the point is. guys.
is that after that.

950
00:56:22.424 --> 00:56:25.260
I stopped having fun on stage.

951
00:56:26.428 --> 00:56:29.097
And the audience
stopped having fun watching me.

952
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:31.433
And now I drive a taxi.

953
00:56:31.516 --> 00:56:33.518
Man. Not even an Uber?

954
00:56:33.601 --> 00:56:35.895
My car's not nice enough.
It didn't qualify.

955
00:56:35.979 --> 00:56:39.232
What about that sweet Challenger
you came in?

956
00:56:39.315 --> 00:56:41.317
That is a rental.

957
00:56:41.401 --> 00:56:42.652
Okay.

958
00:56:42.736 --> 00:56:43.737
- Yeah.
- Okay.

959
00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.823
I had to borrow money from my dad
in order to rent it. Yeah.

960
00:56:47.699 --> 00:56:48.700
Um...

961
00:56:49.743 --> 00:56:54.247
It's not a Golden Wand. but it's a start.

962
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.041
Thanks. Theo.

963
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:59.919
And for my next trick.

964
00:57:00.003 --> 00:57:03.798
I put a spell on all of us
to quit being sad

965
00:57:03.882 --> 00:57:06.593
and have the best night ever.

966
00:57:09.054 --> 00:57:11.890
- Thank you. thank you.
- Hey. Theo. Janelle's looking at you.

967
00:57:11.973 --> 00:57:12.974
Really?

968
00:57:13.058 --> 00:57:16.019
What do you think it's about?
You think she ran out of marshmallows?

969
00:57:16.102 --> 00:57:19.939
She probably ran out of marshmallows.
Hey. Janelle. we have marshmallows!

970
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:21.358
- Chill out. chill out!
- Why?

971
00:57:21.441 --> 00:57:24.611
Ooh. lady's gonna like you.

972
00:57:24.694 --> 00:57:27.447
- K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
- Theo!

973
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:31.659
Theo likes Janelle. Theo likes Janelle.

974
00:57:40.585 --> 00:57:43.814
When were you gonna come clean about the
fact that you're a professional magician?

975
00:57:43.838 --> 00:57:44.839
I'm not.

976
00:57:45.757 --> 00:57:48.927
- I saw you with Vic. That was crazy.
- Thanks.

977
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:51.680
Yeah. you might be onto something
with this whole magic thing.

978
00:57:51.763 --> 00:57:53.181
It's fun. right?

979
00:57:54.849 --> 00:57:56.267
This is fun.

980
00:58:03.149 --> 00:58:04.401
Everyone freeze.

981
00:58:07.862 --> 00:58:09.739
Ruth. what are you doing?

982
00:58:09.823 --> 00:58:10.990
Stay back.

983
00:58:11.074 --> 00:58:13.326
I've been training for this moment
all summer.

984
00:58:14.786 --> 00:58:17.997
Guys. I think that's Fred.
He must've gotten out of his cage.

985
00:58:18.081 --> 00:58:21.167
Thank God.
Fred had his stink glands removed.

986
00:58:21.584 --> 00:58:23.461
But we still need to guide him back.

987
00:58:24.629 --> 00:58:26.506
Don't listen to them.

988
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:27.966
Don't look at them.

989
00:58:28.925 --> 00:58:31.928
It's just you and me.

990
00:58:36.266 --> 00:58:38.143
Those don't look like Fred's stripes.

991
00:58:38.226 --> 00:58:40.228
No. My mustelid allergy.

992
00:58:40.311 --> 00:58:42.731
Nathan. hold it.
It's not Fred. It's not Fred!

993
00:58:56.828 --> 00:58:59.706
I'm doing this out of love.

994
00:59:03.877 --> 00:59:07.088
Don't worry. I got one for you!

995
00:59:08.923 --> 00:59:10.300
Sker-ploosh!

996
00:59:28.234 --> 00:59:29.361
No! Don't touch me.

997
00:59:39.746 --> 00:59:40.747
Clear.

998
00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:44.958
Shh.

999
00:59:50.173 --> 00:59:52.050
Good morning. campers.

1000
00:59:52.133 --> 00:59:53.885
Two days until Top Hat.

1001
00:59:53.968 --> 00:59:56.971
and I am so excited
I may actually eat our lunch today.

1002
00:59:57.055 --> 00:59:59.224
which will be meat loaf.
as will be dinner.

1003
00:59:59.307 --> 01:00:02.268
In fact. we're just gonna roll
with meat loaf for the rest of the summer.

1004
01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:07.190
Andy. help!

1005
01:00:08.983 --> 01:00:10.568
They got me too.

1006
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:15.073
Help!

1007
01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:20.620
Hey. what's going on? Bring those back.

1008
01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:21.705
Coming through.

1009
01:00:21.788 --> 01:00:24.028
They've checked everything out
for the final performance.

1010
01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:28.169
What are you doing with Ethan the hawk?
Ethan Hawk is my whole act.

1011
01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.880
You snooze. you lose. little one.

1012
01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.718
Where's everything?
They're messing with my things.

1013
01:00:35.802 --> 01:00:37.262
So. what is... My table.

1014
01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:39.639
There's nothing.
There's no balls. no cards.

1015
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.309
- The Diamonds checked out all the props.
- What?

1016
01:00:44.269 --> 01:00:45.645
- I don't believe this.
- What?

1017
01:00:47.647 --> 01:00:50.442
- They shrunk our hearts.
- How'd that happen?

1018
01:00:50.525 --> 01:00:52.861
They switched the dryer setting
to "heavy duty."

1019
01:00:52.944 --> 01:00:54.904
Polyblend athletic wear
is not "heavy duty."

1020
01:00:54.988 --> 01:00:57.049
Do you think maybe
you just put it on the wrong setting?

1021
01:00:57.073 --> 01:00:59.176
Are you... Are you accusing me
of making a laundry mistake?

1022
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.455
I do not make laundry mistakes. sir.
I make laundry miracles.

1023
01:01:03.538 --> 01:01:05.081
The Diamonds have ruined our act.

1024
01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.875
We still have the counting wheel.

1025
01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:11.129
They ruined everything!

1026
01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:14.174
You were right about Darkwood.
She is cold-blooded.

1027
01:01:14.257 --> 01:01:17.052
We'll never get new stuff together
in time for the final performance.

1028
01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:20.555
Face it. guys. it's over. They beat us.

1029
01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:22.533
It's not like
we ever really had a chance anyway.

1030
01:01:22.557 --> 01:01:26.728
That's not true. Remember how horrible
you guys were when you first got here?

1031
01:01:26.811 --> 01:01:28.688
You guys suck way less now.

1032
01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:31.399
- Thanks a lot.
- Was that supposed to be a compliment?

1033
01:01:31.483 --> 01:01:33.151
Seriously. we can't quit.

1034
01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:36.112
'Cause when the going gets hard.
the Hearts get going.

1035
01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:38.365
That was pretty good.
You just came up with that?

1036
01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:40.950
- That was good. wasn't it?
- Yeah. That was awesome.

1037
01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:44.204
You know what?
I think I know what we need.

1038
01:01:44.287 --> 01:01:45.705
Follow me.

1039
01:01:53.129 --> 01:01:54.839
Okay. gang.

1040
01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:58.426
And here we are.

1041
01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:00.428
Okay.

1042
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.018
Whoa!

1043
01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:09.437
How'd you do that? Magnets or wires?

1044
01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.981
Neither. Just modern technology.

1045
01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:13.692
So. what are we doing here?

1046
01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:15.902
One night.
I was playing a show in Kansas City.

1047
01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:18.154
and the airline put my prop case
on the wrong plane.

1048
01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:19.364
Ooh. not good.

1049
01:02:19.447 --> 01:02:23.702
I had to improvise with whatever I could
find at the airport convenience store.

1050
01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:26.538
And that is exactly what I'm challenging
you guys to do right now.

1051
01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:28.248
Who says we need props?

1052
01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:30.750
Magicians create the trick.
not the other way around.

1053
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.294
Think of it as like
a magical treasure hunt.

1054
01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:35.922
Um. typically in a treasure hunt.
the participants are provided

1055
01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:37.424
with clues. a map. or a legend...

1056
01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:39.944
- Let's go. See you in 30 minutes.
- Are we gonna get clues or a map?

1057
01:02:39.968 --> 01:02:43.054
Have fun. Figure it out. all right?
Improvise.

1058
01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:02.615
Maybe this one.

1059
01:03:04.325 --> 01:03:06.661
This is garbage.
This is just not the shape.

1060
01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.998
That.

1061
01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.174
Nathan. Nathan.

1062
01:03:21.926 --> 01:03:24.596
Excuse me. everybody.
Can I get your attention?

1063
01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:26.890
Today. we're gonna show you some magic.

1064
01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:29.017
Take it away. Vera.

1065
01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:37.484
So cool.

1066
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:43.531
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1067
01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:44.616
Cool.

1068
01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:48.995
Excuse me. how accurate is that scale?

1069
01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.790
Measures weight
down to a thousandth of a pound.

1070
01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:55.418
If he can guess the exact weight.
can we have this candy for free?

1071
01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:57.796
Sure. That's impossible.

1072
01:03:57.879 --> 01:04:02.092
Is it impossible. or is it 2.173 pounds?

1073
01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:05.720
2.173 pounds.

1074
01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:07.555
- Yeah!
- That's incredible.

1075
01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:12.185
Cool. dude.
We just saved $11.54. tax included.

1076
01:04:12.268 --> 01:04:13.645
Whoo!

1077
01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:15.480
I'm trying to learn
to hold the ball right.

1078
01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:17.774
What's up with
all these weird magic kids?

1079
01:04:17.857 --> 01:04:19.526
Bunch of lame-os.

1080
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:23.113
Hey! Those are my friends
you're talking about.

1081
01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:26.032
And weird is what makes us awesome.

1082
01:04:26.116 --> 01:04:28.743
Attack! Go for their eyes.

1083
01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:31.621
Go. go!

1084
01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:37.335
Am I ever going to touch a bunny?

1085
01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:39.879
One day. I promise you will.

1086
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.758
Didn't only a dozen escape?
Now they're everywhere.

1087
01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:45.552
How are they multiplying?

1088
01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:50.098
You know. I'm gonna let your parents
explain that one.

1089
01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:57.022
Okay. way past your curfew.
Get in there and get to bed.

1090
01:04:57.105 --> 01:04:59.232
Where are you going?

1091
01:04:59.315 --> 01:05:01.252
- I've got a score to settle.
- I promise you he'll show.

1092
01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.069
Hey. Darkwood!

1093
01:05:03.153 --> 01:05:05.131
There he is right now.
All right. I'll talk to you later.

1094
01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.823
Get off the phone. you monster.

1095
01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:09.701
Did you just call me a monster?

1096
01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:13.455
It's one thing to sabotage me
and my career. but children?

1097
01:05:13.538 --> 01:05:15.790
Were you really cool
with this whole sign-out thing?

1098
01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:20.337
Seriously? I already punished my bunk
and made them return all the props.

1099
01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.504
But what's up with you?

1100
01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:24.382
You know. when I first heard
you were coming this summer.

1101
01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:26.176
I was excited to see you.

1102
01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:28.511
I thought we'd be past
whatever beef we had

1103
01:05:28.595 --> 01:05:32.223
and we could just be... friends again.

1104
01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:35.226
That is so easy for you to say.

1105
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:38.813
I got nothing and you got everything
when you dropped me.

1106
01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:39.939
I dropped you?

1107
01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:42.817
- You cheated on me.
- I never cheated on you.

1108
01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:44.444
You cheated on our act.

1109
01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:49.949
'Kay. Yes. fine. I'll admit it.
I took that TV meeting behind your back.

1110
01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.744
You were always calling me your protégée.

1111
01:05:52.827 --> 01:05:54.621
I wanted to see
if I could do it on my own.

1112
01:05:54.704 --> 01:05:57.540
Your treachery is finally revealed.

1113
01:05:57.624 --> 01:06:01.169
Yes. They thought I would be
a better solo act on TV.

1114
01:06:01.252 --> 01:06:03.296
And they hated the name Abraca-Duo.

1115
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.547
It was catchy at the time!

1116
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:06.341
- But I told them no.
- Exactly!

1117
01:06:06.424 --> 01:06:07.842
What?

1118
01:06:08.426 --> 01:06:10.970
I told them I wasn't a solo act.

1119
01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.431
I was trying to negotiate a deal
for the both of us.

1120
01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:15.767
but you quit before I could explain.

1121
01:06:18.186 --> 01:06:20.814
- Why... Why didn't you stop me?
- 'Cause you were flipping out.

1122
01:06:20.897 --> 01:06:23.066
You wouldn't return
any of my phone calls or texts.

1123
01:06:23.149 --> 01:06:26.027
You were too busy bad-mouthing me
to any magician that would listen.

1124
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.904
So I did the act alone.

1125
01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:30.740
I was terrified to do it without you.

1126
01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:34.202
- That is crazy.
- Why?

1127
01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:37.205
You know why that TV booker
picked you in the first place?

1128
01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:39.374
Because. I mean. look at you.

1129
01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.043
You were destined to be a star.

1130
01:06:42.127 --> 01:06:45.130
I knew it. he knew it. everyone knew it.

1131
01:06:45.213 --> 01:06:49.884
And... evidently
I was destined to drive a cab.

1132
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:52.012
Man. Not even an Uber?

1133
01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.180
I am pouring my heart out here.

1134
01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:55.807
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1135
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.769
Andy. you are one of the best magicians
I have ever seen.

1136
01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:01.021
Yes. that is true.

1137
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:04.107
I learned almost everything I know
from you and Preston.

1138
01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:07.318
And watching you work
with your bunk this summer

1139
01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:09.446
reminded me how awesome you are.

1140
01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:10.905
You're welcome.

1141
01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:14.242
Stop being a jerk. or I am not going
to tell you who I was on the phone with.

1142
01:07:14.325 --> 01:07:15.765
Why? Who were you on the phone with?

1143
01:07:15.827 --> 01:07:18.788
Well. my friend runs Treasure Island.

1144
01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:22.500
and he just had a last-minute cancellation
for a matinee performance tomorrow

1145
01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:25.587
and asked me if I knew anybody
who was ready to work that stage.

1146
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.964
And I recommended you.

1147
01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:34.054
I don't know what to... A matinee?
Really? Not even an evening show?

1148
01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:36.264
Seriously? Do you want the gig or not?

1149
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:38.600
- Hey.
- Don't speak.

1150
01:07:39.684 --> 01:07:41.186
Don't say a word.

1151
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:42.896
Hold on.

1152
01:07:42.979 --> 01:07:45.607
They've offered you a show
at Treasure Island.

1153
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.193
- Darkwood texted you already?
- About an hour ago.

1154
01:07:48.276 --> 01:07:52.155
Congratulations. That is... It's huge.

1155
01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:53.948
I know. right?

1156
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.035
You don't seem very happy.

1157
01:07:57.535 --> 01:08:01.081
Well. if I take the gig.
I'll be back in time for the show.

1158
01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:04.959
but I won't be here tomorrow
to help the bunk put their acts together.

1159
01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:07.921
and... I mean. trust me.
those screw-ups. they need me.

1160
01:08:08.004 --> 01:08:09.089
What do you need?

1161
01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:12.509
You've been dreaming about this moment
your whole life. haven't you?

1162
01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:15.553
I think so.

1163
01:08:15.637 --> 01:08:18.932
I can't tell you what to do.
but I know that deep down.

1164
01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:21.184
you already have the answer.

1165
01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:23.412
What about the bunk?
I can't leave without saying goodbye.

1166
01:08:23.436 --> 01:08:27.232
Let 'em sleep. all right? Go.
I'll explain to them in the morning.

1167
01:08:27.315 --> 01:08:29.150
- Go.
- Okay.

1168
01:08:49.462 --> 01:08:51.089
Good morning. campers.

1169
01:08:51.172 --> 01:08:53.508
Today is the day
we've all been waiting for.

1170
01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:56.344
Today your parents will see
all that you've worked on this summer.

1171
01:08:56.428 --> 01:09:00.598
Lunch will be lobster thermidor
with a porcini and crème fraîche risotto.

1172
01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:03.852
Feel free to mention today's meal
to your parents.

1173
01:09:04.894 --> 01:09:07.355
It doesn't look like
he even slept here last night.

1174
01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.650
- Yeah. and his trash bags are gone.
- It's like he vanished.

1175
01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:12.235
And I have appeared.

1176
01:09:12.318 --> 01:09:14.988
All right. bunk meeting. five minutes.
Come on.

1177
01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:17.365
Get dressed. Let's go.

1178
01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:19.159
- What? Seriously?
- Excuse me?

1179
01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.745
- He went to Vegas?
- Yes. he went to Vegas.

1180
01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:25.665
He's been given the chance to perform.
That's what magicians do.

1181
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:28.043
That's what you're gonna be doing tonight.

1182
01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:31.254
And he will be back in time
to watch you compete.

1183
01:09:31.338 --> 01:09:34.382
How are we supposed to compete?
I mean. we can't do it without him.

1184
01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.343
He was gonna help us
put our acts together.

1185
01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:38.345
- Right.
- But now I'm here.

1186
01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:41.097
And I will help you put your act together.
All right?

1187
01:09:41.181 --> 01:09:43.350
So. let's just roll up our sleeves

1188
01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:45.101
and get to work.

1189
01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:47.979
Don't touch Sammy.
He was a little bitey this morning.

1190
01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:52.567
Here we go.
This is the card that she will choose.

1191
01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:55.070
She's gonna pick this card.
It's a guarantee.

1192
01:09:55.153 --> 01:09:57.447
You see that? 'Kay.

1193
01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.658
Now. I'm gonna tuck it away
for safekeeping.

1194
01:10:00.742 --> 01:10:01.993
Put it right there.

1195
01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:08.249
Now I'm gonna take a completely
different deck of cards. right here.

1196
01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:10.877
And she can choose any one of these cards.

1197
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.961
Absolutely.

1198
01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:15.465
Go ahead and just touch
the back of one. okay?

1199
01:10:15.548 --> 01:10:17.634
Are we laughing
because she has so many choices?

1200
01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.761
Is that what we're laughing about?

1201
01:10:19.844 --> 01:10:22.555
- This one.
- That card. Are you sure?

1202
01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.766
So. this is the card. 'Kay?

1203
01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:28.103
And I have a sneaking suspicion
we're not gonna forget this one. okay?

1204
01:10:28.186 --> 01:10:31.314
Here's your card. Now. go ahead
and place it towards your chest.

1205
01:10:31.398 --> 01:10:33.692
Right there. right on your heart.
Don't look.

1206
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.236
All right. now take a little peeksy.

1207
01:10:36.945 --> 01:10:39.906
Tell the audience.
is it a red card or a black card?

1208
01:10:39.989 --> 01:10:41.282
It's red.

1209
01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:45.078
Yeah. not the back of the card.

1210
01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:48.581
We're talking about the face of the card.
The actual card.

1211
01:10:48.665 --> 01:10:51.251
What color's that?

1212
01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:53.670
It's red.

1213
01:10:53.753 --> 01:10:55.213
Can I see that?

1214
01:10:58.049 --> 01:10:59.551
Ooh!

1215
01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:02.637
Yes. that is a red five of diamonds.

1216
01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:05.557
And... this is really awkward

1217
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.810
for anyone in here
who thought I messed up.

1218
01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:18.028
Give it up for Haley. everybody. Haley!

1219
01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:20.363
Thank you.

1220
01:11:25.702 --> 01:11:29.080
Darkwood was right about you.
She said you'd be a good matinee magician.

1221
01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:32.208
She said that?
That is actually a little insulting.

1222
01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.169
But that you'd be even better
in prime time.

1223
01:11:34.252 --> 01:11:36.254
How'd you like a showcase tonight?

1224
01:11:37.922 --> 01:11:39.758
Tonight? Tonight-tonight?

1225
01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:44.387
Actually.
tonight is a little complicated.

1226
01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:46.348
Let me make this simple for you.

1227
01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:49.809
There's a million magicians who would kill
for an eight o'clock show on the strip.

1228
01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:51.186
and I'm offering you one.

1229
01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:55.398
You do well tonight. this theater
could be your home for a very long time.

1230
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:56.816
What do you say?

1231
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:59.611
Let's do it. Yes.

1232
01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:02.238
Excellent. Unpack your things.
make yourself at home.

1233
01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:03.323
Great.

1234
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:32.227
I have a silkworm that not only
makes silk. she also makes wood!

1235
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:33.895
Whoa!

1236
01:12:33.978 --> 01:12:36.439
The name is Kornelius Kessler.
Here's my card.

1237
01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:38.858
If you liked what you saw.
review me on Yelp.

1238
01:12:38.942 --> 01:12:40.318
My son is performing today.

1239
01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:43.405
When you see the velvet bow tie.
you know you're getting a quality act.

1240
01:12:44.906 --> 01:12:47.367
- What about the bow tie?
- I've got it right here.

1241
01:12:50.954 --> 01:12:52.372
It's so nice to meet you.

1242
01:12:57.293 --> 01:13:00.463
Excuse me. Hi. Is this one taken? Thanks.

1243
01:13:00.547 --> 01:13:03.216
Okay. Hearts. gather up.
Hey. guys. come here.

1244
01:13:03.299 --> 01:13:07.095
All right. um. we have to have
a little heart-to-Hearts.

1245
01:13:07.178 --> 01:13:09.264
- What's going on?
- Well. Andy called

1246
01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:10.724
and. unfortunately.

1247
01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:15.562
he is not going to be able to make it back
in time for the Top Hat after all.

1248
01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:18.023
But he wanted me to tell you
how very. very proud he is

1249
01:13:18.106 --> 01:13:19.983
of each and every one of you.

1250
01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.110
And. of course. so am I.

1251
01:13:22.193 --> 01:13:23.653
What are we supposed to do?

1252
01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:30.410
When the going gets hard.
the Hearts get going.

1253
01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:31.911
Let's do this thing.

1254
01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:34.748
Let's do this thing. That's the spirit.

1255
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:37.292
Theo. Andy specifically...

1256
01:13:38.293 --> 01:13:40.628
Well. where'd... he go?

1257
01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:42.881
Preston. you're on.

1258
01:13:42.964 --> 01:13:45.175
Okay. Places. all right? Good luck.

1259
01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.511
Since the dawn of time.
we have marveled at the feats

1260
01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:51.890
performed by the select few
who dare peer into the beyond.

1261
01:13:52.974 --> 01:13:53.975
Magicians.

1262
01:13:57.604 --> 01:13:59.356
Welcome. welcome.

1263
01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.608
Now. this summer.
every single one of your children

1264
01:14:01.691 --> 01:14:04.361
have earned their place
in this mystical order.

1265
01:14:04.444 --> 01:14:06.279
But who among them has learned the most?

1266
01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:12.202
And which ones are destined
to hold the Top Hat and the Golden Wand?

1267
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:17.916
All right.
Be prepared to be shocked and astounded.

1268
01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:21.378
because this year's competition
begins now.

1269
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:26.383
First up. representing
the Hearts cabin. Ruth Brusselbach.

1270
01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:09.968
- Touch the bunny!
- You can do it. Ruth!

1271
01:15:10.051 --> 01:15:13.805
You can do it. Come on.
Bunny love is real! You're a samurai.

1272
01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:29.112
Next up. representing
the Diamond cabin. Vic d'Antonio.

1273
01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:39.873
Hey. I'm the Vic. and I apologize
to all you parents in advance

1274
01:15:39.956 --> 01:15:42.959
'cause I'm about to win
the Golden Wand. again.

1275
01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:47.672
Now pick a card. any card. Just touch it.

1276
01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:49.132
Okay.

1277
01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:52.635
Memorize it. Don't forget it.

1278
01:15:54.095 --> 01:15:56.097
I'll hand the deck to my assistant.

1279
01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:05.732
Her job's easy. Now watch this.

1280
01:16:14.324 --> 01:16:15.700
Was this your card?

1281
01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:27.879
How'd you know I was in here?

1282
01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.382
You know there's a magic show
going on right now?

1283
01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.592
I'm not performing if Andy's not here.

1284
01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:35.053
Your family's out there. And your mom.

1285
01:16:35.136 --> 01:16:38.306
Don't you want your mom to see
all the magic you've learned this summer?

1286
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:42.060
She doesn't care about magic.
She didn't even know about this place.

1287
01:16:42.143 --> 01:16:45.105
She thought it was called Magic Camp.
Can you believe that?

1288
01:16:45.188 --> 01:16:46.188
Um. sort of.

1289
01:16:46.231 --> 01:16:48.817
Magic was my thing with my dad.

1290
01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.111
I'm here because he applied for me.

1291
01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:56.116
And... now he's gone.
So. what's the point?

1292
01:16:56.199 --> 01:16:57.826
Interesting you should say that.

1293
01:16:57.909 --> 01:17:00.662
Next up from the Hearts. Vera Costa.

1294
01:17:29.482 --> 01:17:32.027
I keep all my applications on file.

1295
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:35.030
And... I remember yours. of course.

1296
01:17:40.368 --> 01:17:41.369
Hold on.

1297
01:17:41.953 --> 01:17:44.664
'Cause that's me. I'm the jack of hearts.

1298
01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:48.960
And that's you. You're the king of hearts.

1299
01:17:49.044 --> 01:17:50.128
Wait. who shot this?

1300
01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:52.047
That's incredible.
You're incredible. Theo.

1301
01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:56.301
Wow. Did you just see that trick?

1302
01:17:56.384 --> 01:17:59.095
My son is an amazing magician.

1303
01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:00.805
I don't know how he does any of it.

1304
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:05.727
But what you might not see
is how much he has overcome.

1305
01:18:06.686 --> 01:18:07.687
How much...

1306
01:18:10.982 --> 01:18:13.610
I wish Theo could see everything
that I see in him.

1307
01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:16.529
But he keeps it all locked inside.

1308
01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:19.991
and magic is the first thing
that's unlocked him.

1309
01:18:20.408 --> 01:18:22.118
I guess that's sort of a trick. right?

1310
01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:26.498
That's why you'd be crazy
not to take him for your magic camp.

1311
01:18:26.581 --> 01:18:29.000
or institute. or whatever.

1312
01:18:32.837 --> 01:18:35.882
Well. I may be eccentric.

1313
01:18:35.965 --> 01:18:41.179
but. I don't think I've ever been
more persuaded by an application.

1314
01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:46.518
Theo. I cannot tell you what to do.

1315
01:18:46.601 --> 01:18:50.397
but I know deep down
you already have the answer.

1316
01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:53.692
But I can't go up there alone.

1317
01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:55.568
Andy said you would say that.

1318
01:18:55.652 --> 01:19:00.448
But he told me to tell you
that if you lose your way on stage.

1319
01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:02.492
just look to the wings

1320
01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:06.079
and you'll find a true magician
to help you.

1321
01:19:06.162 --> 01:19:07.664
What does that mean?

1322
01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:09.457
Only one way to find out.

1323
01:19:11.459 --> 01:19:13.378
Okay. I'll need a little help here.

1324
01:19:13.878 --> 01:19:16.506
Young gent.
what is your locker combination at school?

1325
01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:20.468
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
steal your homework. or do it for you.

1326
01:19:20.552 --> 01:19:23.805
Sixteen. 98. 17.

1327
01:19:23.888 --> 01:19:25.140
Great. okay.

1328
01:19:25.223 --> 01:19:28.309
Ma'am. type in 1-6-9-8-1-7.

1329
01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:30.061
And then hit times.

1330
01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.273
Okay. um. you. sir. what is your birthday?
You.

1331
01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:34.816
October 9.

1332
01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:36.693
October 9? 10-9. great.

1333
01:19:36.776 --> 01:19:40.071
Ma'am. type in 1-0-9. Then hit times.

1334
01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:44.367
Don't say this out loud. but type in the
age you were when you had your first kiss.

1335
01:19:47.912 --> 01:19:51.958
Now. hit equals and read the number
aloud to me one digit at a time.

1336
01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:54.044
- Seven.
- Seven.

1337
01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:55.670
- Four.
- Four.

1338
01:19:55.754 --> 01:19:57.589
- Zero.
- Zero.

1339
01:19:57.672 --> 01:19:59.341
- Four.
- Four.

1340
01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:02.010
- Zero. two.
- Two.

1341
01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:03.553
One. two.

1342
01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:04.804
One. two.

1343
01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:06.681
Sorry for my messy handwriting.

1344
01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:09.851
So. 74.040.212.

1345
01:20:09.934 --> 01:20:13.938
Okay. so there's no possible way
I could've known any of the information

1346
01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:15.462
that you were gonna give me tonight.

1347
01:20:15.523 --> 01:20:18.735
Yet. we used your numbers
to create this huge number.

1348
01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:23.490
Now. I would like to call your attention
to this envelope of mystery.

1349
01:20:23.573 --> 01:20:26.534
Earlier today.
I put my prediction inside this envelope.

1350
01:20:26.618 --> 01:20:29.537
And now I am going to reveal it to you.

1351
01:20:32.582 --> 01:20:35.418
Elephant. Amazing. right?

1352
01:20:38.505 --> 01:20:40.965
I see you're confused. It's upside down.

1353
01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:45.220
- Ho!
- "Elephant."

1354
01:20:46.137 --> 01:20:47.138
My...

1355
01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.103
I'm a mathemagician.

1356
01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:58.858
And finally. performing for the Diamonds.
Janelle Santos.

1357
01:21:13.331 --> 01:21:14.332
Janelle.

1358
01:21:47.032 --> 01:21:48.033
Ready?

1359
01:21:48.783 --> 01:21:50.827
One. two...

1360
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:52.078
Three.

1361
01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:06.551
- My... Wow.
- Whoo!

1362
01:22:16.728 --> 01:22:18.480
This is the best year yet.

1363
01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:24.611
All right. while the judges
are tabulating the results.

1364
01:22:24.694 --> 01:22:27.864
I would like to say thank you
by singing a song.

1365
01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.575
Um...

1366
01:22:30.658 --> 01:22:31.659
Excuse me.

1367
01:22:34.704 --> 01:22:41.169
Okay. For our final. final performance.
may I present Theo Moses.

1368
01:22:44.339 --> 01:22:45.590
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1369
01:22:51.638 --> 01:22:54.265
There are a lot more of you
than I expected.

1370
01:23:16.788 --> 01:23:19.582
You know what? Let me just...

1371
01:23:23.503 --> 01:23:25.505
Magic is all about perception...

1372
01:23:26.297 --> 01:23:29.634
What you're seeing
versus what's really happening.

1373
01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:31.469
Like right now.

1374
01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:33.680
You don't see a deck of cards in my hands.

1375
01:23:33.763 --> 01:23:37.475
but... now you do.

1376
01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:41.688
I'm going to need an assistant
for this trick.

1377
01:23:42.272 --> 01:23:44.983
Mom. can you please come up here
and help me out?

1378
01:23:47.318 --> 01:23:49.654
Wow. He's really owning it out there.

1379
01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:51.740
As you knew he would.

1380
01:23:51.823 --> 01:23:54.510
Can you just look through these
just to make sure they're all different?

1381
01:23:54.534 --> 01:23:55.994
Have the others seen me?

1382
01:23:56.077 --> 01:23:58.788
- Looks good to me.
- No. no. they have no idea you're here.

1383
01:23:58.872 --> 01:24:01.166
Fifty-two cards in the deck.

1384
01:24:01.249 --> 01:24:03.668
but each one
has a different story to tell.

1385
01:24:04.544 --> 01:24:07.672
I knew they could do it on their own.
Now they know it too.

1386
01:24:07.756 --> 01:24:09.341
You planned everything perfectly.

1387
01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:11.801
No. I think you did.

1388
01:24:13.219 --> 01:24:15.305
Me?

1389
01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:20.101
The joker is a bit of a wild card.
just like my little brother. Cameron.

1390
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:23.855
He annoys me sometimes.
but I'd be lost without him.

1391
01:24:24.522 --> 01:24:26.362
In fact. Cameron.
why don't you come over here.

1392
01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:28.568
On the drive back from Vegas.
I put it together.

1393
01:24:28.651 --> 01:24:32.280
This whole summer.
the newbie bunk. Darkwood. Theo.

1394
01:24:32.364 --> 01:24:34.991
Feel free to come closer
if you want a better look.

1395
01:24:35.658 --> 01:24:38.286
It's one long trick
to help me get my life together.

1396
01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:40.163
Well. you know what they say.

1397
01:24:40.246 --> 01:24:42.957
The trick you don't believe is a trick
is the best trick of all.

1398
01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:46.461
The way to create more magic in the world

1399
01:24:46.544 --> 01:24:48.797
is not by creating more magic.

1400
01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.650
- Exactly.
- Yeah. I still don't get that one.

1401
01:24:50.674 --> 01:24:52.133
You didn't let me finish.

1402
01:24:52.217 --> 01:24:55.095
It's by creating magicians.

1403
01:24:55.762 --> 01:25:00.141
This card is me. the jack of hearts.

1404
01:25:01.476 --> 01:25:03.687
You are good. old man.

1405
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:06.147
And this card is my dad...

1406
01:25:08.066 --> 01:25:09.067
the king of hearts.

1407
01:25:10.026 --> 01:25:12.821
I think about this card every day.

1408
01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:17.909
Now. my mom's card is the queen of hearts.

1409
01:25:18.493 --> 01:25:20.954
But where is she?

1410
01:25:21.746 --> 01:25:23.581
I'll tell you a secret.

1411
01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:26.793
Sometimes I forgot
that this card believed in me.

1412
01:25:27.627 --> 01:25:30.839
But even when I didn't realize it.

1413
01:25:30.922 --> 01:25:33.299
the queen of hearts
was always there for me.

1414
01:25:37.804 --> 01:25:40.598
The queen of hearts. So happy I found it.

1415
01:25:42.434 --> 01:25:46.938
Out of all the cards in the deck.
these four are closest to my heart.

1416
01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:50.525
But there's something extra special
about my mom.

1417
01:25:51.067 --> 01:25:53.528
She changes everything she touches.

1418
01:25:54.529 --> 01:25:58.199
Mom. can you just touch a card for me?

1419
01:26:03.329 --> 01:26:05.040
What?

1420
01:26:05.123 --> 01:26:08.418
That's weird.
Um. Mom. can you just touch another?

1421
01:26:14.507 --> 01:26:15.633
This is strange.

1422
01:26:15.717 --> 01:26:18.678
There's only supposed to be
one queen of hearts in the deck.

1423
01:26:19.095 --> 01:26:21.473
Okay. Mom. just hold your hand out for me.

1424
01:26:35.779 --> 01:26:40.325
I don't know how she does it.
or why it took me this long to realize it.

1425
01:26:40.408 --> 01:26:46.039
but... my mother is magic.

1426
01:26:46.122 --> 01:26:49.918
Aw.

1427
01:27:03.682 --> 01:27:06.518
Yes. yes! What a competition.

1428
01:27:06.601 --> 01:27:08.687
Beautiful. All right.

1429
01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:15.402
And now. the winner of this year's
Top Hat competition is...

1430
01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:19.072
Thank you so much for coming.

1431
01:27:19.155 --> 01:27:21.825
Come on. get a sense of humor.
Here we go.

1432
01:27:21.908 --> 01:27:24.369
All right.

1433
01:27:24.452 --> 01:27:29.082
And the winner
for the Top Hat this year...

1434
01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:32.794
the Hearts.

1435
01:27:32.877 --> 01:27:34.796
We won! We won!

1436
01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:37.340
- Andy?
- It's Andy.

1437
01:27:38.091 --> 01:27:41.469
I'm so proud of you guys.
I saw the whole thing. buddy.

1438
01:27:41.553 --> 01:27:43.054
- Yes!
- Okay. Very good.

1439
01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:45.348
And now for the...

1440
01:27:46.182 --> 01:27:47.976
Now for the...

1441
01:27:48.518 --> 01:27:51.187
The winner of the Golden Wand.

1442
01:27:51.271 --> 01:27:54.190
from the Diamonds. Janelle Santos.

1443
01:27:54.774 --> 01:27:56.192
Get up here.

1444
01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.654
Go. Take a bow.

1445
01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:09.372
- What?
- Kristina. I did it! I did it!

1446
01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:11.624
I am so proud of you.

1447
01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:14.544
What are you doing here?
What happened to your big show?

1448
01:28:14.627 --> 01:28:15.837
I skipped it.

1449
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.256
And. dude. I saw your whole set.

1450
01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:23.178
What? I hate to say this phrase
because I hate this phrase.

1451
01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:25.847
but my mind was literally blown.

1452
01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:28.099
Wait. You put that mirror there.

1453
01:28:28.183 --> 01:28:31.227
You know. sometimes it takes somebody else
to help you see yourself.

1454
01:28:31.978 --> 01:28:35.732
Wow.
You just sounded exactly like Preston.

1455
01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:37.650
- I did. didn't I?
- Yeah.

1456
01:28:37.734 --> 01:28:38.735
Okay. we'll work on that.

1457
01:28:38.818 --> 01:28:40.153
Can you clap twice for me?

1458
01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:43.198
Can you stomp your feet?

1459
01:28:43.281 --> 01:28:44.657
Break it down.

1460
01:28:49.204 --> 01:28:50.705
Whoo!

1461
01:28:57.796 --> 01:28:59.631
Thank you. Your bunk killed it.

1462
01:28:59.714 --> 01:29:01.234
- Thanks so much for everything.
- Bye.

1463
01:29:01.299 --> 01:29:05.929
Hey. I am so sorry about ditching
the Treasure Island show.

1464
01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:08.282
I didn't get you in too much trouble.
did I?

1465
01:29:08.306 --> 01:29:09.766
No. it's fine.

1466
01:29:09.849 --> 01:29:11.726
They actually invited you back
next weekend.

1467
01:29:12.352 --> 01:29:13.853
- Really?
- No.

1468
01:29:13.937 --> 01:29:15.689
They banned you for life.

1469
01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:18.566
Andy. that was a really big gig.

1470
01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:21.861
Well. luckily.
I landed an even bigger one.

1471
01:29:22.404 --> 01:29:24.447
- You did? Where?
- Right here.

1472
01:29:25.073 --> 01:29:28.702
You are looking at the new director
of youth talent development.

1473
01:29:29.828 --> 01:29:32.163
Preston offered me a year-round gig
scouting for kids.

1474
01:29:32.664 --> 01:29:34.666
- That's great.
- This is where I wanna be.

1475
01:29:34.749 --> 01:29:40.505
And the craziest part is. is I realized
that when I was on stage in Vegas.

1476
01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:43.258
But my friend said that you did great.
The audience loved you.

1477
01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:45.343
Yeah. I killed.

1478
01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:47.721
I got to live the dream.

1479
01:29:47.804 --> 01:29:49.389
It was amazing.

1480
01:29:49.472 --> 01:29:53.018
But weird part is.
is it didn't feel as amazing

1481
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:55.437
as helping the kids this summer.

1482
01:29:56.438 --> 01:29:57.439
Andy.

1483
01:29:57.897 --> 01:30:01.484
You know. you could stick around
and work here with me.

1484
01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:05.572
You do know I headline at Caesars. right?

1485
01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:08.867
Yeah. I think I heard about that.
That's cool. That's cool.

1486
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:10.952
But you could come feature
for me sometime.

1487
01:30:11.036 --> 01:30:13.705
The world could use a little Abraca-Duo.

1488
01:30:14.456 --> 01:30:15.457
Deal.

1489
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.126
- And. wow. that is a really terrible name.
- Yeah.

1490
01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.047
Hey. Dad.

1491
01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:23.131
Judd.

1492
01:30:24.424 --> 01:30:26.968
I don't understand.
Why didn't you perform?

1493
01:30:27.052 --> 01:30:28.720
No. I did perform.

1494
01:30:28.803 --> 01:30:31.848
All the Hearts' costumes. those are me.

1495
01:30:33.016 --> 01:30:36.186
You designed those costumes?
Even the quick-change routine?

1496
01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:38.146
All of them.

1497
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:40.440
Look. I know you want me to be a magician.

1498
01:30:40.523 --> 01:30:43.693
but... this summer I realized I'm not one.

1499
01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:45.653
I just love designing costumes.

1500
01:30:45.737 --> 01:30:49.616
I love using fashion
to bring my friends' magic to life.

1501
01:30:50.992 --> 01:30:52.410
Then you're mistaken...

1502
01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:57.374
because that. son. is magic.

1503
01:30:59.084 --> 01:31:01.795
I think I got fur in my nose.
I'm gonna go irrigate.

1504
01:31:10.136 --> 01:31:12.764
- Hey! My gosh. Wow.
- Xerxes. hey! I'm gonna miss you.

1505
01:31:13.473 --> 01:31:14.474
Look out!

1506
01:31:16.267 --> 01:31:18.829
- How'd you do that? You have to tell me.
- You really wanna know?

1507
01:31:18.853 --> 01:31:20.814
- Yeah.
- Come to camp with me next year.

1508
01:31:20.897 --> 01:31:22.315
- Can I. Mom?
- Nope.

1509
01:31:22.399 --> 01:31:25.485
'Cause next summer you're going
to camp with me. Yoga camp.

1510
01:31:25.568 --> 01:31:26.569
Say what?

1511
01:31:27.487 --> 01:31:30.699
All right. I'll think about it.

1512
01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.326
- Can you believe it?
- I know.

1513
01:31:35.203 --> 01:31:36.746
- Hey.
- Let's go get a snack.

1514
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:37.831
Okay.

1515
01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:42.794
You were. pretty okay out there.

1516
01:31:42.877 --> 01:31:44.337
Thanks. Vic.

1517
01:31:46.673 --> 01:31:48.550
You should have these back.

1518
01:31:49.718 --> 01:31:53.054
I didn't burn them. I just pocketed them.

1519
01:31:53.722 --> 01:31:55.306
I know. not cool.

1520
01:31:55.765 --> 01:31:57.600
I won't be such a jerk next year.
all right?

1521
01:31:57.684 --> 01:32:03.732
But I will battle you for the Golden Wand
and regain my magic camp supremacy.

1522
01:32:05.025 --> 01:32:06.192
Till next summer then.

1523
01:32:14.993 --> 01:32:16.161
Theo.

1524
01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.413
Hey.

1525
01:32:18.496 --> 01:32:19.497
Hey.

1526
01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.375
I have to go now.

1527
01:32:25.628 --> 01:32:26.921
That's too bad.

1528
01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:30.133
- You gonna call me?
- The second I get home.

1529
01:32:30.216 --> 01:32:31.843
Just so you don't forget.

1530
01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:35.930
Whoa!

1531
01:32:36.014 --> 01:32:39.267
She went for it. just... Too aggressive.

1532
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:47.525
You did encourage me
to encourage her to participate...

1533
01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:50.320
so this is you guys.

1534
01:32:55.533 --> 01:32:57.160
There's a voice in your head.

1535
01:32:57.243 --> 01:33:00.955
And that voice is crying out.
"Clean up your room!"

1536
01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:06.044
Nope. sorry.
That was the voice of your dad.

1537
01:33:06.127 --> 01:33:10.674
The voice in your head is saying.
"I want to be a magician."

1538
01:33:10.757 --> 01:33:14.260
Scribbity-four-ish years ago
this guy. Roy Preston.

1539
01:33:14.344 --> 01:33:20.308
founded the institute and the world-famous
Roy Preston Prememorial Theater.

1540
01:33:20.767 --> 01:33:24.437
Which is sadly now
the Roy Preston Memorial Theater.

1541
01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:26.481
Kidding. I'm still here.

1542
01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:29.025
I brought in Andy to help me out.

1543
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:32.070
You'll build lasting relationships
with other young magicians.

1544
01:33:32.153 --> 01:33:34.280
Even the weird ones.

1545
01:33:34.364 --> 01:33:37.075
'Cause here. we're all the weird ones.

1546
01:33:37.158 --> 01:33:39.160
- Cool bird. Ruth.
- Thanks. Andy.

1547
01:33:39.244 --> 01:33:41.663
And the lunch service
has nondairy options.

1548
01:33:41.746 --> 01:33:43.498
But don't take my word for it.

1549
01:33:43.915 --> 01:33:45.750
Just ask any of our former campers.

1550
01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:50.171
many of whom are now some of the most
successful magicians working today.

1551
01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:52.424
Like me. Kristina Darkwood.

1552
01:33:52.882 --> 01:33:55.510
Or better yet. come see for yourself at...

1553
01:33:55.593 --> 01:33:58.096
Magic camp!

1554
01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:00.515
It's the Institute of Magic.

1555
01:34:01.349 --> 01:34:03.977
The Institute of Magic!
