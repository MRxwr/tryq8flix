00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.979
(soft music)

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:17.351
- It's a free market economy

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.853
but it's also a
national security issue.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.955
- Okay well I tend to think--
- You're going to be an independant

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.691
country. you need to be
independant of food.

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.093
- I tend to think of
climate change

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:26.427
as a national security issue.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:27.661
- I do too.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.097
- They're not gonna
be able to do it

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:30.364
in time the way
they're doing it.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.600
And every time. well.
- Recognize and adapt

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.202
and change policies--
- Okay. let's...

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:37.037
Let's look at ourselves
right now. okay?

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.773
Let's say this road we're on

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.543
is the American
political system.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.679
And you see past
that bridge up there.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.282
we have to get past that
bridge in the next minute.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.120
except this is
what we're stuck on

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.987
because we can't get there.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.889
And you know this
as well as I do.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.461
(rain pouring)

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:02.163
I know people in
their 20s and 30s

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:04.665
that will not have kids.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.066
because they're like.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.469
"I'm not gonna subject a
human being to what's coming."

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.839
Do you think my children
who are 15 years younger

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.507
than that are somehow gonna go.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:16.176
"God I always wanted
my kids to grow up

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.979
in Mad Max eating
lizards off the road

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.049
and murdering their neighbors
to get a glass of water."

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.353
I mean. things are
gonna break down.

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:29.089
- [Wesley] Wesley
the passion that you

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.758
and so many others
have on us this

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.993
is what gives me
hope in democracy

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.762
and hope in the
future of the country.

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:37.531
That's what it's gonna
take to make change happen.

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.933
(soft music)

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:44.172
- [Wesley Jr.] I think we're
living in a rigged system.

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.241
And I think it's very hard

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.878
to break out of that rigged
system because money talks.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.281
(soft music)

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.690
- I drove down from
San Francisco yesterday
on Highway Five

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.258
and it's bumper to bumper

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:07.060
for 300 miles on
(laughs) Highway Five.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.231
And you can think. God. that's
just a small part of it.

00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:13.601
So we know in these
big urban areas

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:17.971
like the Los Angeles Basin.
metropolitan New York.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.808
we know that. we live
here for convenience.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.476
We live here because
civilization works.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.546
but we also know it
is relatively fragile.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:27.781
It depends on power.
it depends on water.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:30.818
It depends on food. it
depends on warehousing.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:34.422
It depends on security and
people following the rules

00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:35.923
and obeying the laws.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:38.959
And it only takes small
disruptions to that.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.129
Whether through natural
disaster. through climate change

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.433
through organized
crime or through war.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.336
through exogenous forces.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.906
And you'd see catastrophe.

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:58.746
- [Narrator] It's easy to
see how things can fall apart.

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:00.948
Long tunnels are now pitch dark.

00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:02.983
(cars passing)

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.454
Communications and telephone
systems have collapsed.

00:03:06.454 --> 00:03:08.188
On motorways cars
simply pull over.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.957
if they find a
place with a signal.

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.360
(man speaking foreign language)

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.827
People now stand in line

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:16.464
outside supermarkets.
not to go in.

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:18.699
they're just hoping that
it will eventually open.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.801
(people chattering)

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.703
(wind blows vehemently)

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:26.774
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.387
- Combination of the weight
of scientific evidence.

00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:42.723
And the dynamics of the
financial system suggest

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.658
that in the fullness of time.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:48.396
climate change will threaten
financial resilience

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:51.031
and longer term prosperity.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:54.402
- All the money in the
world will not save us

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.370
once it starts to fail.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.638
And then people will discover

00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:00.240
that you can't eat
a flat screen TV

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.410
and you can't eat a
German luxury car.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.412
(pressing salt shaker)

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:05.746
(tries to open door)

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.381
- What are we gonna do?

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:11.385
(engine revving silently)

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:13.086
- It's war.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.356
And it's a much more serious
war than World War II

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.560
because if we lose.
we're all dead.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.827
I mean. you'll already be dead.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.762
So maybe it doesn't
concern you as much

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.499
but I don't want my
children to starve to death

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.201
- You're writing me
off really early.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.603
Please don't write me off
so early.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.539
- All right. 20 more years

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:34.375
(children screaming)

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.543
- Looks good doesn't it?

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:36.544
- It does.

00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:39.212
- It's a great part of America.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.681
It's like an American icon.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.686
My generation was
the Beach Boys.

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:47.020
- Yeah.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.622
- Surfing USA.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.290
- Yeah.
(water splashes)

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.296
- So. you know. tourist heaven.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.230
- Yeah.

00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.032
- But if I were a tourist
from another planet

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.935
and I was like. "Hey.
let's go visit earth."

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:03.604
And then my travel guy was like.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:06.874
"well it's populated

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:11.879
by about 10 billion carnivorous
apes and they're armed."

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.815
- My goal is to see...
- Let's give you 20 more year

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.718
Is to see your children

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:20.320
grown. educated. married

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.624
and I wanna have
great-grandchildren.
that's my goal.

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.059
- Okay. if you wanna
have great grandchildren.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.662
what you have to do is
you have to help build

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:32.299
that environment that
they're gonna survive in.

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:36.604
- I want you to see the
facts as they appear to me.

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:38.506
I'm a national security guy.

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.641
That's what I've spent
my life working on

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:43.811
trying to protect
America. the constitution.

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.980
the way we live and our futures

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.282
for our children
and grandchildren.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.420
- I love my dad we're both
concerned about security.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.522
We're both concerned
about the future

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.256
but there's definitely
a difference

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.358
in the generational
perspective of this.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.863
Now I understand his generation
because they grew up.

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.198
right after World War
II. the baby boomers.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:10.804
They grew up in a world that
was constantly improving.

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.506
(car hooting)

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.875
More rights. more money.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.210
The economy constantly expanded.

00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:25.519
They saw us go from fairly
primitive industrial society

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:28.656
to what we have today.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.726
- There've been empires
that formed and collapsed.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:39.500
And about 200 years ago.
mankind suddenly discovered

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.170
how to take energy more
effectively from the earth.

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:46.740
In the start of
the industrial age.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.645
And it was coal
and it was England.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:55.315
And it was a steam engine
that could use that coal

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:58.085
and it spread throughout
the whole world.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.987
We have taken that energy

00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:02.055
and built this
civilization from it

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:06.093
and the price that's being paid

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.996
is the carbonization
of the atmosphere

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:10.397
and climate change.

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:18.271
(car engine roaring)

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.578
- Yeah. that's the finale.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.049
(upbeat music)

00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:34.622
- You know. when you
say in World War II.

00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:36.524
everybody chipped in
and did their part.

00:07:36.524 --> 00:07:38.626
And that was
seventy-five years ago.

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:44.297
Now we've been involved
in so far. a 19 year war.

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.134
And in that 19 year war.

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.469
we were told to go shopping

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.238
and to buy more stuff.

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.040
We were never told
to save anything.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.408
We were never told to
contribute to a war effort.

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.244
They even cut taxes

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:59.312
when we went to war
- That's right. twice.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.814
- Twice.

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:05.318
(upbeat music)

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:10.824
With gambling. the house always
wins and it's a rigged game.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.325
It just is.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.994
Not unlike the banking system

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.263
in our political
system nowadays.

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:17.565
It's all rigged. People don't

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:19.499
have an actual
choice in a lot of stuff.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.635
Yeah. people have a
choice to go to Vegas.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.005
- When you ran for president.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.508
I drove all over New
Mexico and other places.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.078
All I could think
in 2003 was that.

00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:34.815
we can't actually
build an economy

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:38.150
off stripping. gambling
and crystal meth.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.520
And we've made a concerted
effort to do that

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.123
in this country for
the last 20 years.

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:45.859
- You know. our business
caters to what people want.

00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:52.633
American societies produced
enormous amounts of leisure.

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:59.039
- They've tried to recreate
the feel of the Roman Empire

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.708
in the heart of Vegas.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:04.878
And interestingly it's
like late Roman Empire.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.280
So it's right. as
everything collapsed.

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:14.855
- We have the smarts
and the know-how

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:16.624
and the conscience to know

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:19.392
we have to sustain
and protect this earth

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.561
because this is where we live.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.731
So we love civilization.

00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:26.033
but we've got to change

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.703
the way we're approaching
our economic endeavors.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.005
- The world is suffering

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:34.241
through the worst financial
crisis since 1930s.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:36.309
- There's been a
lot of damage done.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:39.479
- They hear $700
billion package.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.248
and they immediately
think the next day

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.650
everything is gonna be better.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.086
- You're witnessing
so much wealth loss.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.855
- If you connect
the financial system

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:50.758
to the other possible
shocks that are out there.

00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:55.763
you realize it's.
we're walking on ice.

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:57.698
- Panic coming
through the phones.

00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:00.000
on the floor. traders
just trying to rush

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.935
to get to the point of sale.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.270
to get rid of their stock.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.706
- [Man] You know.
what people built up

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.742
over years and years and
years. has been erased.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.378
(bell ringing)
(people applauding)

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:16.516
- At some point. you run a
risk that something goes afoul.

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:18.786
We're worried about Greek debt.

00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:20.420
We're worried
about Italian debt.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.922
- Spanish debt.

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.925
- I mean and so far. you
know. it's been finessed.

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.761
but. and you know.

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.230
you can't see what the U.S
Treasury is doing behind.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.465
We're doing a lot with
the U.S Government

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.634
to keep the system working.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:38.471
And you just don't know
what the limits are.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.973
- So if you think.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:43.276
how can we lead the world
in fixing the economy

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.644
and fixing the climate?

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.280
You have to make
the investments now.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.883
Because you can't wait
till you're like Somalia.

00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:51.451
I mean. you may notice

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.821
Somalia doesn't have a lot
of infrastructure programs

00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.388
that they fund.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:58.325
They're not pushing the
boundaries in technology.

00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:00.794
and that's not because
people in Somalia are stupid.

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:03.430
it's not just because they've
lived under civil war.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.466
it's because they
don't have capital.

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.501
They don't have resources.

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:16.509
- Capitalism is an
economic organization.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.979
It's a way of
organizing the economy

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:23.984
that is focused on trying
to create future returns

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:26.586
over and above of the
investments I make today.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.189
So it's all about expansion.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.690
It's all about making
more in the future

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.159
than we currently have.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.695
- When you borrow money.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.364
well. what happens is.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.699
the banks would like
to charge you interest

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.368
not only for the risk.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.938
but because they want
the capital to come
back with babies.

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:47.975
not just to go and that's it.

00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:51.278
Because they want to make sure
that capital is increasing

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.380
and that's how you build wealth

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.615
and that's how you
increase your assets.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:00.788
- And it's that debt
that has enabled

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:03.190
all of this to be here.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.859
It's the accelerant
to economic growth.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.332
- Now. as long as the company

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.301
can service that
debt. it's okay.

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:15.402
But consumer debt.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.636
if it can't be
serviced. is a problem.

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:17.871
Mortgage debt if it
can't be serviced.

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.372
as we've seen is a problem.

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:20.707
and national debt. if
it can't be serviced.

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:22.542
can be a national
security threat.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:26.313
- Alexa. how do we avert
a financial crisis?

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.750
- [Alexa] Here's something
I found on Wikipedia.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.054
A financial crisis is any of
a broad variety of situations

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:35.555
in which some financial assets

00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:37.991
suddenly lose a large part
of their nominal value.

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:45.098
- Preparing for the future.
when the future is unknown.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.868
is obviously difficult.

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:53.006
but we are today taking steps

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:56.944
that are clearly going
to make things worse.

00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:58.778
- Finance is really
making big bets

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.780
on an uncertain future.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.051
And you wanna be careful
about making too many bets.

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:05.886
especially when there
is some indication

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.421
that the future might be very
different from the present.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.893
(insects flying)

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:17.297
(upbeat music)

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:20.733
- [Wesley Jr.] So much
of our energy's caught up

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.235
in the financial system

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:26.039
that we've neglected the
investment in real things

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:28.408
that are required to
take the country forward.

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:32.112
- We do. we haven't really
come to grip with this yet.

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:33.580
because the economic system.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.782
the political system just
doesn't wanna face it.

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.155
(upbeat music)

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:52.432
- The economy has grown.

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:54.667
but debts. indebtedness
of households.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.336
firms. banks. governments.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.006
the debts of all these
actors in economic system

00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:01.608
have increased
much more than GDP.

00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:02.442
- Really?

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:05.078
- Yeah. So let's say.

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:07.680
I think maybe in
the 1970s or so the.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:12.419
total debt of all these actors.
households. firms. banks.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:17.257
government. the total debt
to GDP ratio was maybe of.

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:19.859
of the order 120%.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.095
And now that has
increased very steadily

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:25.498
over time to about 290%. So--

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:29.369
- So if no one got
paid for three years

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.337
and continued working
the whole time.

00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:31.771
- Exactly. Yup. yup.

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:34.040
- And didn't eat or
drive cars or anything.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.175
we could pay that debt?

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.176
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:37.544
- But does the debt matter?

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:40.380
- Well. I mean. the
debt matters to some.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.816
to the extent that
we have a system.

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.618
it is called capitalism.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.387
And in that system.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.722
laws are telling us that
debts have to be repaid.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.192
(soft music)

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:58.065
How much debt do we need
to generate $1 of GDP?

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.702
For the economy to create
one extra dollar of income.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:09.176
we need. we are relying
on $3.30 of extra debt.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.545
(soft music)

00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:14.747
An income is basically
wages plus profits.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:18.085
That is what GDP is. you can
also call it differently.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:23.090
You can say it is value added.
created by producing stuff.

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:27.194
- And as a result of
emphasizing on the GDP.

00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:31.598
we've ended up in a situation
where the market is going on.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:34.367
There is some selling.
there is some buying.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:38.038
but we really don't know
how well people are doing.

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:40.773
(soft music)

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.077
- [Wesley Jr.] You know. when
we were kids. $1 of debt.

00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:46.846
pretty much created $1 of GDP.

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:48.281
- Oh wow.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.616
- So. you know. it's
like Keynesian economics.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.618
you put the money
into social projects

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.853
and it recycles back
into the economy.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.458
But today it takes
more than $3 of debt

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.227
to produce $1 of GDP.

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.863
And that's all occurred
in the last like 30 years.

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:05.065
- Wow.

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:07.934
So in order to
create more money.

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:11.138
you've gotta create more debt.

00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:12.639
- Three times as much debt.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.640
- That's insane.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.042
- More than three
times as much debt.

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:17.144
- It's that access to
credit and the kind of ability

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:20.547
to take on lots and lots of
debt that hasn't been able

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:25.485
to sustain this kind of
trend in consumption.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:28.955
- So there is a very.
very strong relationship

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:31.891
between increases in income

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:34.327
and increases in
carbon emissions.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.963
(soft music)

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:39.766
- In the U.S. which is
already kind of the most

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:42.435
disproportionately
high energy producing.

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:46.939
high consuming country per
capita spending grew 42%

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:50.077
overall from 1990 to 2008.

00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:53.080
With a 300% increase in
spending on furniture.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.683
an 80% increase on clothing
and a 15 to 20% increase

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.185
on vehicles. housing and food.

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.120
Despite the fact that
wages were pretty stagnant

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.354
over that time period.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.756
(soft music)

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:10.963
- So this is the
Wall Street Bull.

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:13.333
which is a symbol of
a positive market.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.136
which means more people
are spending money.

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.936
than spent it the day before.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.373
- Our democracies basically
have become dependent

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:24.277
on the idea that there will
always be more to go around

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.146
that we can expand.
expand. expand.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.715
We know that there's
fundamental uncertainty.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.118
We just don't know what
the future will hold.

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:34.554
(soft music)

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.061
- Over the course of my career.

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:45.198
I've worked in
mathematical modeling.

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:48.067
I was a space physicist for NASA

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.670
and I was on pretty
big projects.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.507
I was on the Hubble Space
Telescope team as a scientist.

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:57.377
(soft music)

00:17:57.377 --> 00:18:01.414
I was on mission to Mars
as a space physicist.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.217
And so I'd worked on in
some pretty big areas.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.554
When people say. well.

00:18:07.554 --> 00:18:09.922
how do you know that the
climate models that we have now

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:12.725
will be accurate
in 30 years time?

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:15.562
What I can tell you is that
the models that we were working

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:19.666
on 30 years ago are actually
unbelievably accurate.

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:22.101
(soft music)

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.737
What's happened
with the atmosphere.

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:28.375
is we're seeing this type of
instability. kind of like.

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:33.246
you know. if you had a
top just standing there.

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.747
it'll just fall over.

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.449
And so you're
seeing that type of.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:39.219
that type of wobbling
and instability.

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:43.456
I don't exactly know how
unstable things are going to be.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:46.226
but to me. it's the
volatility and the instability

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:48.295
that's even more
concerning than just

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:52.632
the pure temperature
rise over time.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.869
Let's say that inflation
were to go over the top.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.638
stock market crashes.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.107
Let's say there are all kinds
of sanctions on exports.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.809
You can't even export your tech.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.143
You know. all you're left with.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.314
to survive is you
and your environment.

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:10.417
(grasshopper buzzing)

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:12.151
- You know. one of my goals
this year was actually

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.154
to get more educated
on climate change.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.426
And I took the path

00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:22.829
that I was gonna see both
sides of the argument.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.164
And what was interesting
to me was I could find

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:29.436
very little in the
climate denial space.

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:32.772
The more I read. the
more I see around me.

00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:34.674
the more I get concerned.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.945
- [Katie] The officials
came out and said.

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:41.180
we're gonna have to
release the dams.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.283
And I remember
looking at my husband

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:48.187
and looking at my daughter
and the dog and the house

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:52.359
and thinking. am I in
the middle of some movie?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.762
- So I'm 5.8.

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:58.998
And the water reached
to about right there.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.035
Until it happens
to you. you don't.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.871
you don't believe
that this can happen

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.706
in the United States of America.

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:10.777
And all of your financial
stability is gone.

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:13.045
So if we have. God forbid.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.047
any other emergency that
comes up and believe me.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:18.551
that is a source of a
traumatic kind of panic

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.520
that sets in when we go. Oh.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.654
you know. what if
something happens.

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:22.889
what if there's
another emergency that.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.224
that arises. then
we have no funds.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.331
- Never did I ever
imagine that everything

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:35.868
that I would work so
hard for would be taken

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:38.705
from me in a matter of hours.

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:42.509
And so I do believe
that climate change

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:45.011
is going to have a
huge economic impact.

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:51.518
And what wealth you
have can be eradicated

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:53.986
in a matter of hours.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.356
(soft music)

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:02.595
(helicopter blades slapping)

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.830
(helicopter engine revving)

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.065
- We had a house
up here on the hill

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:07.534
that my wife wanted
to get out of

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:10.102
because it was dangerous
for the fires. you know.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.604
- Yeah.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:12.772
And the climate change.
everything's getting crispy.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.073
so we'd better get.

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:16.676
to somewhere where we're
not gonna get burned up.

00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:17.877
- Yeah.

00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:20.212
- So we moved to
this beautiful place

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.682
and the fire didn't get us.

00:21:22.682 --> 00:21:24.183
(laughs)

00:21:24.183 --> 00:21:26.686
But the debris flow after
the fire wiped us out. man.

00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:31.123
We had like mud four
feet here. huge rocks.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.258
- You were here. right?

00:21:32.258 --> 00:21:33.693
- Oh we were.
- How did you get out?

00:21:33.693 --> 00:21:35.395
- Rescued by helicopter man.

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:36.896
- Jesus.

00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:39.732
- I said. you know. I said.
my wife. we. you got a sheet?

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.200
And she said. yeah.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.302
I said. what are you
gonna do with the sheets?

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.271
I said. I'm gonna write.
help out there. you know.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.807
She said maybe make it SOS.
I say that's a good idea.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.075
(laughs)

00:21:49.075 --> 00:21:52.144
Went out there and
drew SOS. in the mud.

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.913
And pretty soon. (smacks)

00:21:53.913 --> 00:21:56.483
they come. they let a
guy down. and they said.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:22:00.086
we weren't sure if it was
a SOS or an area code.

00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:01.654
it looked like it
could have been 805.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.556
And I said. well I gotta
work on my esses man.

00:22:03.556 --> 00:22:04.991
(laughs)

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.760
But we were lucky. you
know. we could afford to...

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.996
- Well people died. people
died in this. right?

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:14.501
- Oh! Terrible. people were
washed right through our place.

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:18.170
And we were the lucky ones.
You know. we had the money.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.439
to refurbish this place.

00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:20.272
- I know. yeah.

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:21.808
- But you know. imagine.

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:23.843
people. you know. struggling
all over the world

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:25.144
with this climate change.

00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:27.980
- That's the way It starts
it's. you read about it

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.916
and It seems far away.

00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:32.919
But then something happens
and bang it's right on you

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:34.286
and it gets very personal.
- That's right.

00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:45.865
- Hey. I hope you went
quick. that's all I can say.

00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:48.200
I hope you went quick.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:50.970
Oh my gosh.

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:58.878
Words can't describe it.

00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:03.550
Words can't describe it.

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.788
- Global systems of finance
are deeply connected

00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:10.723
and based on housing finance

00:23:10.723 --> 00:23:12.559
in places like
the United States.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:16.162
So if you get in a
situation where a homeowner.

00:23:16.162 --> 00:23:18.731
can't. can't pay an
insurance premium.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:21.968
can't hold on to their
mortgage. for that reason.

00:23:21.968 --> 00:23:23.903
Defaults on a mortgage.
goes into foreclosure.

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:26.072
You have kind of. your
setting in motion.

00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:27.507
the sort of early
parts of the story

00:23:27.507 --> 00:23:30.910
that we know is a very familiar
one from 2007 and 2008.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.245
- And we're not
particularly good.

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:37.316
at preparing for difficult
times way in the future.

00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:40.086
when in fact we've got
difficult choices right now.

00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.254
- When you survey
people in the U.S

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:46.258
and in the UK about sources of
stress. it's work and money.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:49.095
(slow jazz music)

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:54.266
- Alexa. how do I solve
our economic problems?

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.404
- [Alexa] Sorry.
I don't know that.

00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:03.743
- We're heading off the cliff.
in terms of climate change.

00:24:03.743 --> 00:24:07.614
There's a real urgency on this
now that cannot be denied.

00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:11.350
- I grew up in the heart of the
military industrial complex.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.954
My father became a general.
after I went off to college.

00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.923
I went to the foreign
service school at Georgetown.

00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:20.860
Madeleine Albright was one
of my advisors in college

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.762
and I thought. I know
how the world works.

00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:24.864
There are people in charge.
There's some with a plan.

00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:26.365
There's someone running stuff.

00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:28.968
When my father was head of
NATO and I got to go over there

00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:31.203
and visit and hear the kind
of questions that senators

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:33.439
and congressmen
were coming up with.

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:36.876
I realized. whoa. no
one's running anything.

00:24:37.877 --> 00:24:41.914
And the mistake that the
great majority of us make.

00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:46.152
is that. there are groups
of people running things.

00:24:46.152 --> 00:24:49.121
Someone has a master
plan. there's a cabal

00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:53.459
or a conspiracy behind
it all that's running it.

00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:54.627
And it's just not the case.

00:24:54.627 --> 00:24:57.163
(fire roaring)

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:07.006
(water burbles)

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.610
- Hey Wes.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.844
- How was the conference?

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:12.679
- Good.

00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:13.846
- Good.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:16.182
- No. I think.
well I think they.

00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:18.618
I think they really wanted
to hear what's going on

00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:20.486
and what the challenges are.

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:21.420
- Yeah.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.355
- And that's what I gave them.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.658
- Kind of reading this thing
about Venezuela you see.

00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:28.260
What happens when an
economy collapses.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.762
- Total collapse.

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:33.265
- I mean. is it. was it just
initially the oil prices or...

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:36.603
- They've tried to make
it a populist democracy.

00:25:36.603 --> 00:25:39.505
You know. where now
Maduro is. is a dictator.

00:25:39.505 --> 00:25:41.373
but you know. supposedly
people like him.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.376
but in an actual
fact Cuba's in there.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:49.381
And I was down about six
months ago in Colombia.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.352
And they were telling
me that actually.

00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:56.723
the Cubans are going up
to the Venezuelan army

00:25:56.723 --> 00:25:58.725
and they're disarming them.

00:25:58.725 --> 00:25:59.992
because they don't
trust the Venezuelan.

00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:01.728
This is the way you
take over a country.

00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:02.995
You're getting rid of.

00:26:02.995 --> 00:26:04.697
you know. you put your
security forces in.

00:26:04.697 --> 00:26:08.134
and then you build up
your extra military force.

00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:09.301
And then you go to the military

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:11.337
that might be loyal
to the country

00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:13.973
and say. give us your weapons.

00:26:13.973 --> 00:26:17.376
So a lot of Venezuelan
militaries become refugees.

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:18.310
- Oh wow.

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.412
- They were disarmed and sent
out of the country. yeah.

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:23.082
And there's millions of
people that are just there.

00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:24.416
They lived there.
they were born there

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.218
and they're
struggling to survive.

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.522
- It's a. I mean. we're heading
in that direction already.

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:33.092
before we've even had
the economic breakdown.

00:26:33.826 --> 00:26:35.762
With armed groups
in the streets.

00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:38.931
You had 20.000 armed people
in the streets yesterday.

00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:40.900
- Well that was just
a demonstration.

00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:45.437
- Brought guns. you don't
bring guns to a demonstration.

00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:48.607
unless you're demonstrating
you'd like to kill people

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.209
that don't agree with you.

00:26:50.209 --> 00:26:52.745
- Venezuela can be an
example of what happens

00:26:52.745 --> 00:26:54.080
when civil society breaks down

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.782
because you don't have stable.

00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:57.616
transparent rule
of law government.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:27:00.019
and you don't invest in your
infrastructure the right way.

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:01.754
In many ways. Venezuela
is a leading indicator

00:27:01.754 --> 00:27:04.223
of the challenges that
will face the whole world.

00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:08.227
- [Narrator] Many like Erin
Burgos feel they have no choice.

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:12.431
(speaks in foreign language)

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:15.968
What was once one of Latin
America's wealthiest countries.

00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:19.271
is now its most
chaotic and dangerous.

00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:20.973
(car honking)

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.875
- But that's what happens
in these countries.

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:25.211
- But by these countries.
you mean countries

00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:27.313
that have incompetent
leadership.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.785
- Countries that are failing

00:27:32.785 --> 00:27:34.386
to take care of their people.

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:37.824
But they compensate for that by.

00:27:37.824 --> 00:27:40.159
setting up repressive
mechanisms.

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:42.261
to ensure that they
stay in power. (laughs)

00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:45.064
- I just worry about it
happening in the United States.

00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:47.333
We have a country like
Venezuela where the first thing

00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:50.102
that collapsed is their
energy infrastructure.

00:27:50.102 --> 00:27:52.071
- Yeah.
- And then now we're finding out

00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:54.440
that it's not just electrical

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.010
and oil pumping now their water
infrastructure is collapsing

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.779
and this is a country
that's tropical.

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:01.447
that's filled with water.

00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:03.515
- The energy sector has
not received the training

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.251
or investment it needs. and
the experts were kicked out.

00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:06.753
They said the energy sector

00:28:06.753 --> 00:28:08.587
in particular the oil
sector is collapsing.

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:11.523
And that was a major source
of revenue for the country.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:14.360
At the same time. you have
significant drought in a country

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.527
that has a lot of water.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.763
which means the
dams cannot produce

00:28:16.763 --> 00:28:17.997
the same electricity
as they used to.

00:28:17.997 --> 00:28:19.698
So you have collapse of
the electrical sector.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:21.968
along with the oil sector.
along with civil society.

00:28:21.968 --> 00:28:23.202
And this means you also have

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:24.370
collapsing water infrastructure.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.005
because even if
you have the pipes.

00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:28.540
if you don't have electricity.
you can't operate everything.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.943
So severe strain. which
means food shortages.

00:28:30.943 --> 00:28:34.146
riots. lack of money.
this is a major problem.

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:37.049
United States and
Europe is rich.

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.852
but if we choose to under
invest in our infrastructure

00:28:39.852 --> 00:28:42.688
and if we choose to not
prepare for the future.

00:28:42.688 --> 00:28:44.957
we could suffer these
kinda consequences as well.

00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:47.493
- The impact of climate change

00:28:47.493 --> 00:28:49.896
is not a straight line function.

00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:51.730
It's clearly

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:56.235
a progression that
is accelerating

00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:59.405
in magnitude very dramatically.

00:28:59.405 --> 00:29:04.043
And so any lapse at
this point in responding

00:29:04.043 --> 00:29:08.214
is going to have. I
think. a critical impact

00:29:08.214 --> 00:29:10.917
down the road. much sooner
than we would anticipate.

00:29:10.917 --> 00:29:12.418
- This is a crisis
waiting to happen.

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:14.753
It's a slow moving crisis
in front of our eyes.

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.324
- So when you see in a movie.

00:29:18.324 --> 00:29:20.259
an asteroid's gonna
hit us in six months.

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:22.594
but Mr. President
we've been working

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:25.031
on this potential
problem for six years.

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:30.169
In real life the asteroid
takes everybody out.

00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:31.904
The same goes for
climate change.

00:29:31.904 --> 00:29:34.540
The same goes for a whole
host of issues we have

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.844
because when people
see something on TV

00:29:37.844 --> 00:29:41.547
and look. politics
is a confidence game.

00:29:41.547 --> 00:29:42.949
When people look at the
politician and they go.

00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.583
he must know what
he's talking about

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:46.452
or she must know what
she's talking about.

00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:49.688
That doesn't mean there's
an actual plan with any kind

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:54.026
of systemic machinery behind
it to produce results.

00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:55.727
(upbeat music)

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.463
- As the water start to recede

00:29:57.463 --> 00:30:00.099
the financial costs will add up.

00:30:00.099 --> 00:30:02.401
- Are you tired of living
in a home like this

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:05.071
when you really wanna be
living in a home like this?

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:07.473
Let's check it out.

00:30:09.575 --> 00:30:12.278
We've got tons of
waterfront property.

00:30:12.278 --> 00:30:14.313
and more coming every day.

00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:17.249
Century 22 now serving
parts of California.

00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:21.320
* Best sparkling
drinks are just dandy *

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.922
* The cho--

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.324
- For those of you that
went to the mountain

00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:29.095
and enjoyed that 16 feet
of brand new. fresh powder.

00:30:29.095 --> 00:30:30.396
nice job.

00:30:30.396 --> 00:30:32.999
But as you can see. we've
got a hot front coming in.

00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:37.003
so tomorrow there's gonna
be 155 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:30:37.003 --> 00:30:39.906
So you might wanna
break out those Speedos.

00:30:39.906 --> 00:30:43.075
- You read the big
article about Peter Teal.

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:46.345
who's the guy who's made
the big fortune off tech.

00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:49.848
has bought and built bunkers
in New Zealand. right?

00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:53.685
Because their plan is
we're all gonna die.

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.355
and then they're gonna
ride it out somehow

00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:57.924
even though they won't.

00:30:57.924 --> 00:31:00.759
But there's the belief that
their money will insulate

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:02.361
and shelter them
from what's coming

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:03.996
and for all these people--
- For climate change

00:31:03.996 --> 00:31:07.533
- Who predicted doomsday.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.536
- Yeah I mean. I've
heard. you know.

00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:13.472
I've heard climate change
likened to a world war.

00:31:15.474 --> 00:31:19.378
You know. the difference
is that we know a lot more

00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:20.779
about what's coming.

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:23.649
- Come on down to our
luxury survival condo

00:31:23.649 --> 00:31:26.018
and don't let the
Armageddon get you down.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.457
- So unless you can
produce thousands of years

00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:36.328
worth of water and air and food
in your underground bunker.

00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:37.696
you're not gonna make it.

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:39.665
And the most likely
outcome will be that

00:31:39.665 --> 00:31:42.868
the construction workers
probably non-union

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:44.870
that you paid to build
this bunker for you

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.638
know exactly where it is.

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:49.641
And they have access to all
the tools to dig you out of it

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.977
like a truffle.

00:31:52.144 --> 00:31:56.582
The sooner people start
using their money as a tool.

00:31:56.582 --> 00:31:58.250
instead of a goal in life.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.352
the faster we're gonna
be able to dig ourselves

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:01.153
out of this hole.

00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:02.921
- Okay. so dad. we've.

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.256
I know you don't
wanna pay attention

00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:05.757
and you don't wanna be...
- I do.

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:10.362
- Filmed with miniatures.
because it could. you know.

00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:12.531
you don't wanna look like
the guy in Dr. Strange Love

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:13.732
or any other--
- Exactly.

00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:14.933
- Retired General
playing with things--

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.202
- That's exactly
what it looks like.

00:32:16.202 --> 00:32:18.704
- But. look. we need
to set up something

00:32:18.704 --> 00:32:20.672
that people can
understand how it works.

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:25.377
We have like a grocery
farmer. another store here

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:29.115
a bank. a homeowner. and
then emergency services

00:32:29.115 --> 00:32:31.117
and over here's like nature.

00:32:31.117 --> 00:32:33.719
or we'll even say
foreign country

00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:35.087
or Africa. or somewhere else.

00:32:35.087 --> 00:32:39.058
So. but the first thing
I gotta do is change

00:32:39.058 --> 00:32:40.126
how everything's set up.

00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:42.894
because we need the bank

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.131
in between

00:32:46.398 --> 00:32:49.635
the country club
and everybody else.

00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:53.972
- We have a huge financial
system compared to what the.

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.474
what I can call the real economy

00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:59.445
that is where people work
and produce. and live.

00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:04.316
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:26.472
- What we were talking
about was trying to explain

00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:29.308
capital. structures
and insurance

00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:32.944
and financing and mortgages
using children's toys.

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:34.780
So we have money--
- Is it gonna work?

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.183
- I don't know if it's
gonna work. (laughs)

00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:43.255
- First thing is. the
grocery store is a business

00:33:43.255 --> 00:33:44.690
and it makes money.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.693
and they deposit the
money in the bank.

00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:49.095
- Okay. Boom.

00:33:49.095 --> 00:33:50.096
- Okay?

00:33:50.096 --> 00:33:52.331
John works at the grocery store

00:33:52.331 --> 00:33:56.468
and he gets paid by
the grocery store

00:33:56.468 --> 00:33:59.838
and he decides he
wants to buy a house.

00:33:59.838 --> 00:34:01.107
- Okay.

00:34:01.107 --> 00:34:03.275
- He doesn't have enough
money from his earnings

00:34:03.275 --> 00:34:06.112
to buy a house. but he goes
to the bank and the bank said.

00:34:06.112 --> 00:34:09.348
"Oh we'll give you the
money. to buy the house.

00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:14.985
and in return. you'll
give us an IOU."

00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:17.556
(upbeat music)

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:20.458
- We have to look at the house

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.860
is it. does it pass inspection?

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.295
- Yeah. pass inspection.

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:27.166
- And can you afford it
based on your monthly income?

00:34:27.166 --> 00:34:27.998
- Well.

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:30.402
- The answer. say yes.

00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:31.503
- Yes.
- Okay. good.

00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:33.038
So here's a mortgage.

00:34:33.038 --> 00:34:35.907
Okay. so here's the money and--
- And by the way. this is just

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.509
like a real bank.
because in the real bank.

00:34:37.509 --> 00:34:39.145
they're not sure can
this guy pay for it?

00:34:39.145 --> 00:34:40.911
Just tell him yes. tell
him yes. come on.

00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:42.681
lets get the money.
- So it depends on paying.

00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:45.417
- We typically think that
bank takes deposits from us

00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:46.918
and then lends it out.

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.755
The balance sheet equates
one entry on this side.

00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:52.257
another entry on that side. has
sort of claims to come back.

00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:55.060
and if it's really
comes back as expected.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.527
they make a return on that.

00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.697
And it's basically making
money out of thin air.

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:00.931
- In the old days.

00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:02.833
I would put this
mortgage. and I would say.

00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:04.034
"This is an asset for me.

00:35:04.034 --> 00:35:05.603
"because you're gonna
pay me every month

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:07.239
"to pay this
mortgage off." right?

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:08.873
- So you're telling all
your buddies you had that.

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:10.442
- Well. I found a better
way to make money. okay?

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:15.214
So the bank takes the IOU.
and the bank sells the IOU

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:18.884
into the what's called
the secondary market.

00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:22.020
- Okay.
And it gets a fee for that.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.290
- Then once I have this
mortgage and maybe the mortgage

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.292
for many other houses
in the neighborhood.

00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:28.627
and ideally from other
neighborhoods as well.

00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:31.697
I throw this into what we call
a special purpose vehicle.

00:35:31.697 --> 00:35:34.132
which really. in legal
terms. is typically a trust

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:37.303
or a corporation. these
assets-shielding devices.

00:35:37.303 --> 00:35:39.205
and then you issue claims

00:35:39.205 --> 00:35:42.474
against these new legal
shells to investors.

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.210
(retro jazz music)

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:50.216
- They package these IOUs
up so there's many of them.

00:35:50.816 --> 00:35:54.653
and they sell them to people
like insurance companies

00:35:55.554 --> 00:36:00.592
or foreign banks. and
they can be leveraged.

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:03.629
- Which means I can make
loans off these things.

00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:04.830
which are loans.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.898
- Yes. because you
have leverage here.

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:08.967
So you can make more loans.

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:11.737
So the system always
generates cash.

00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:14.573
(water splashing)

00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:17.276
They can reduce their risk

00:36:17.276 --> 00:36:19.611
because they're not
just buying a mortgage.

00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:21.179
they're buying a
package of mortgages.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.449
In some cases. they're
just buying a slice

00:36:23.449 --> 00:36:27.152
of the interest rate off
a package of mortgages.

00:36:27.152 --> 00:36:30.522
And so. all of these
are called derivatives.

00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:34.493
And everything works. as long
as there's an expectation

00:36:34.493 --> 00:36:36.362
that the loan will be repaid.

00:36:36.362 --> 00:36:40.799
that John will. at the
right time each month.

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:45.371
give the bank money to pay
down his share of the IOU.

00:36:45.371 --> 00:36:48.206
(old timey piano music)

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.276
So the old way the
banking system worked.

00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:53.044
it used to work that the banker
would look you in the eye

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.646
and say. "Are you credit worthy?

00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:55.881
"Can I trust you?"

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:01.387
- The banks really
aren't keeping

00:37:01.387 --> 00:37:03.054
the mortgages on
their books anymore.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.123
They're selling those mortgages

00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:06.358
so that they can be repackaged

00:37:06.358 --> 00:37:08.827
as other kinds of
financial instruments.

00:37:08.827 --> 00:37:11.530
So. they're able to
sort of pass the buck.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.565
pass the risk off
to the next person.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.036
- Depending on how they're
rated by the rating agencies.

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:21.407
these are reputable
investment opportunities

00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:22.841
for retirement funds. sure.

00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:25.076
Yeah. pension funds.
sure. put 'em in here.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.912
- So the investors
are buying an interest

00:37:26.912 --> 00:37:29.247
in the cashflow that
comes from the homeowners

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:31.550
into the pool that
we've created.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.652
but have sort of a claim
against this house as well

00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:35.421
because this cashflow is backed

00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:37.356
by the mortgage
against the home.

00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:40.191
So something as
illiquid. as formidable

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:41.760
as this building and
the land it stands on

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.930
can become a globally
tradable financial asset

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.598
through appropriate
legal coding.

00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:50.869
- This is your loan.

00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:53.271
It travels through this system.

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:55.173
The bank has the loan.

00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:56.107
(stamp smashing)

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.176
sells it. it becomes a security.

00:37:58.176 --> 00:38:00.078
It becomes part of
the balance sheet

00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:01.547
of money market mutual funds.

00:38:01.547 --> 00:38:05.083
These money market mutual
funds then basically exchange

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:07.786
your loan. your
collateral. your house

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:11.056
in a collateralized cash
deal. and the whole purpose

00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:13.525
of both the cash and the
collateralized cash deal

00:38:13.525 --> 00:38:16.462
is that it allows
the various actors

00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:18.730
to operate in derivative markets

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.567
and make very high rates
of short-term return.

00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:26.271
(wheels creaking)
(bell dining)

00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:28.139
- Today. debt is
treated like an asset.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.442
It can be traded
globally. right?

00:38:30.442 --> 00:38:34.045
So we made a huge jump from
let's say the 12th century

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:37.148
when the first assignable
notes came about.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.585
to treating debt as an asset

00:38:39.585 --> 00:38:42.888
that we can just trade
on a global market.

00:38:47.225 --> 00:38:48.159
(slurping beverage)

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.095
(jazzy piano music)

00:38:50.095 --> 00:38:53.131
- At the bottom.
there's tangible value.

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:57.603
The same value is used. not
just one time. but two or three

00:38:57.603 --> 00:39:01.507
or four times in the
financial sector trading.

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:06.478
It is not going for productive
investment in firms.

00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:09.615
It is also not going
to finance and fund

00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:12.684
climate change mitigation
and de-carbonization.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:15.020
Money creates more money.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.788
Wealth creates more wealth.

00:39:16.788 --> 00:39:18.990
And this is a circle.
and it just rolls on.

00:39:19.758 --> 00:39:22.127
At the end of the
day. it's our houses.

00:39:22.127 --> 00:39:25.330
the value of our houses.
which are backing this up.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.866
The IMF has called it "the
shadow banking system."

00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:31.369
"Shadow" here doesn't
mean that it is illegal.

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:34.506
It also doesn't mean that it
is necessarily shady and so on.

00:39:34.506 --> 00:39:38.677
It is just that it is shadow
because there are no rules.

00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:40.479
It's hardly any rules.

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:44.716
It's sort of almost the Wild
West of the financial sector

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:48.186
(dramatic Western music)

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.723
- And a problem with
the derivative market

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:52.991
is there is no market.

00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:55.326
So it's like one-on-one
swaps between bankers.

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.728
It's like you and I say.

00:39:56.728 --> 00:39:58.163
"Hey. I know what bank
you're working for.

00:39:58.163 --> 00:40:00.398
"and so I've got some bonds.

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:02.834
"and I want you to
insure 'em for me

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.503
"in case the interest
rate changes.

00:40:04.503 --> 00:40:06.572
"Would you insure
these bonds for me?

00:40:06.572 --> 00:40:07.673
"How much would you charge?"

00:40:07.673 --> 00:40:08.574
You tell me a price.

00:40:08.574 --> 00:40:10.676
I say. "That's a good deal.

00:40:10.676 --> 00:40:14.412
"I'll get a bonus for
setting up the insurance.

00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:15.814
"You'll get a bonus

00:40:15.814 --> 00:40:18.149
"for taking in the money
to do the insurance."

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.685
- But I work at
a different bank.

00:40:19.685 --> 00:40:20.919
- It's a good deal.

00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:22.153
- And I heard you
just bought those.

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.989
And I figure I could
also get those.

00:40:23.989 --> 00:40:25.924
'cause I know a guy in
Saudi Arabia or China

00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:28.259
that would pay two cents more.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.761
and I could make
50 grand off it.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:32.230
- You wind up so far
from the underlying.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.600
- The thing is. it's like the
old insurance principle. it's

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.569
"How many people can insure
one person's house"?

00:40:37.569 --> 00:40:41.507
Can each person in
the neighborhood put
a $100.000 policy

00:40:41.507 --> 00:40:43.709
on that house and each
person collect $100.000

00:40:43.709 --> 00:40:46.277
when the $100.000
house burns down?

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.879
(explosion roars)

00:40:47.879 --> 00:40:49.681
(fire crackling)

00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:52.283
(explosion booming)

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:53.785
- As Americans.
we're shortsighted.

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:55.386
and we don't think long-term

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:57.388
and financial literacy
was not this complicated

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.357
100 years ago. You had
a little bit of money.

00:40:59.357 --> 00:41:00.792
and probably didn't even
have a bank account.

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:02.393
You paid your bills. and
you passed bills around.

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.729
- And you kept it
under the mattress.

00:41:03.729 --> 00:41:05.030
- Right. or you kept
it under the mattress.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.064
Shh. that's not where mine's at.

00:41:06.264 --> 00:41:09.635
- The critical derivatives for
our financial markets today

00:41:09.635 --> 00:41:12.971
are actually the ones
that brought down
the financial system

00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:16.274
in 2008 were the
credit default swaps

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:18.644
and the collateralized
debt obligations.

00:41:18.644 --> 00:41:20.979
And the credit default
swap is basically

00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.915
a kind of an insurance contract.

00:41:23.915 --> 00:41:27.085
which basically says. "If
some assets in the markets

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:31.389
"decline in value. the
insurer has to pay me a fee."

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:34.492
And the beauty of the CDS.
the credit default swap.

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:38.463
was that you didn't have
to hold the asset yourself.

00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:40.932
(fire crackling)

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:42.167
It's like me taking out

00:41:42.167 --> 00:41:44.936
a fire insurance on
my neighbor's house.

00:41:44.936 --> 00:41:47.739
and if that house burns
down. I get the premium.

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:50.676
- The value of these
financial transactions

00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:55.246
is much. much larger than
the tangible. real capital.

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.683
which is basically the
houses of the families.

00:41:57.683 --> 00:41:59.685
the households.
the notional value

00:41:59.685 --> 00:42:02.588
of the derivative
market is $600 trillion.

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.957
And that is about let's say.

00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:08.627
eight to 10 times as
large as global GDP.

00:42:16.434 --> 00:42:18.203
- So an American city with

00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:19.771
how many trillions of dollars

00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:21.840
of real estate
value right there.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.609
or at least hundreds
of billions.

00:42:23.609 --> 00:42:25.310
will no longer be there.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.544
Like. how does that work?

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:27.979
How does that work in
the banking sector?

00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:29.380
How does that work in
the insurance market.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.782
the re-insurance market.

00:42:33.118 --> 00:42:35.621
what's been collateralized
off that real estate?

00:42:35.621 --> 00:42:38.389
- This is not just
different actors.

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.391
exchanging in different markets

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:43.795
or in different
legal transactions.

00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:48.734
our financial system is such
that we have huge banks.

00:42:48.734 --> 00:42:51.903
mega banks. too
big to fail banks.

00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:56.808
very often operating both
sides of the same market.

00:42:56.808 --> 00:43:00.812
- The big banks. they don't
necessarily know how much risk

00:43:00.812 --> 00:43:03.982
their counterparty bank
in some other country

00:43:03.982 --> 00:43:05.516
is willing to undertake.
- No one really

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:08.053
understands the legal
interdependencies

00:43:08.053 --> 00:43:10.088
that are built into
these contracts.

00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:11.857
and that can
ultimately bring down

00:43:11.857 --> 00:43:13.424
the entire financial system.

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:17.095
- The system is so complicated

00:43:17.095 --> 00:43:19.731
that the accountability is lost.

00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:21.933
- So the real value
is actually here.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.434
These are all the transactions

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:26.237
which are built on top
of the real economy.

00:43:28.774 --> 00:43:31.242
(soft music)

00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:00.806
- Then there's Dougherty.

00:44:00.806 --> 00:44:03.274
The small town of
Dougherty is not.

00:44:03.274 --> 00:44:04.976
not a whole lot there today.

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:13.819
Just it was a town that
once had a general store

00:44:13.819 --> 00:44:16.221
when I was growing
up. had the church.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:21.459
had a post office. but
you know. not anymore.

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.600
- Agriculture and rural
America has gotten a preview

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.969
of the automation
that's about to hit

00:44:30.969 --> 00:44:34.105
the rest of the country
in the next 10 years.

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:37.675
- We're here at the town
square in Dewitt. Arkansas.

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:39.811
And if you look around. I mean

00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:42.848
there's not a ton of
bustling businesses here.

00:44:42.848 --> 00:44:44.515
but one of the
busiest businesses

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.251
is Department of Human Services.

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.019
(soft music)

00:44:48.253 --> 00:44:52.858
So when we define the real
economy. let's not forget farms.

00:44:52.858 --> 00:44:56.461
88% are still
small family farms.

00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:59.630
- So this is a grain storage bin

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.934
on my parents' family farm.

00:45:02.934 --> 00:45:05.370
(soft music)

00:45:12.377 --> 00:45:14.712
- This is my dad's place.

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:18.884
He's gonna be 87. mom's 85.

00:45:18.884 --> 00:45:21.386
They've lived here since 1956.

00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:29.727
So. a lot of years.

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.331
- And we are a team.

00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:40.705
- How many times you have
to have intense rains.

00:45:40.705 --> 00:45:44.475
heat spells. freezings at the
wrong point to get the crops

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:46.744
to not come in once?

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.881
- We do protect our farmers.
we give them crop insurance

00:45:49.881 --> 00:45:52.183
and the crop insurance
is subsidized.

00:45:52.183 --> 00:45:54.752
We have agricultural
extension services.

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:56.587
and they pay for that. but
they probably don't pay

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:57.722
the full cost of that.

00:45:58.656 --> 00:46:00.658
It's a free market economy but.

00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:02.427
it's also a national
security issue.

00:46:08.934 --> 00:46:12.237
(birds chirping)

00:46:12.237 --> 00:46:13.604
- Federal crop insurance program

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.274
was started as a
response to the effects

00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:18.743
of the dust bowl and
the Great Depression.

00:46:18.743 --> 00:46:21.412
Many. many areas throughout
the United States were.

00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:24.615
were severely affected
by the Dust Bowl.

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.952
many farmers lost everything.

00:46:26.952 --> 00:46:28.954
In addition to most of America

00:46:28.954 --> 00:46:30.555
being devastated
by the depression.

00:46:30.555 --> 00:46:34.893
farmers acutely suffered
during that time.

00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:39.364
(somber music)

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.272
Many parts of the plains

00:46:47.272 --> 00:46:50.575
were just completely
filled with dust.

00:46:50.575 --> 00:46:53.979
Many crops were lost
due to the weather.

00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:56.481
the extreme weather.
due to insects.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.153
(somber music)

00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:14.332
- But it's the large
scale like my dad said.

00:47:14.332 --> 00:47:17.435
the large scale events that
everybody kinda worries about.

00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:19.004
like a big drought.

00:47:24.509 --> 00:47:28.179
- I think that our
aquifer in some places

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:32.951
is down to like 20% and
then a lot of places at 50%.

00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:35.420
and we're actually
using more water than

00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.289
we have at any other time.

00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.627
We have our pumping plants in

00:47:42.627 --> 00:47:44.862
and we're building on canals

00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:46.998
and this is actually
the first phase.

00:47:46.998 --> 00:47:50.668
We're trying to get water
to this. this Indian bio

00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:55.673
and then we're gonna use that
for the main water supply.

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:59.544
In Arkansas. we're gonna
have a drought event.

00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:01.046
every growing season.

00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:04.715
It doesn't matter.
if we just came

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.851
like this last flood
that we had here.

00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:09.054
as soon as we came out
of that flood event.

00:48:09.054 --> 00:48:15.660
we were irrigating because our
soil is. it's not real deep.

00:48:15.793 --> 00:48:18.196
We have what they call a
hard pan underneath it.

00:48:18.196 --> 00:48:19.897
pretty close to the surface

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.399
- Which helps with
the rice growing.

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:22.733
- Yes. very helpful.

00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:26.972
It just gets more
expensive every day.

00:48:26.972 --> 00:48:28.473
We thought we were gonna have

00:48:28.473 --> 00:48:31.342
a lot of infrastructure
money maybe to come about.

00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:33.644
but it hasn't come about.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.746
- And its federal infrastructure
money that coming?

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:38.249
- Well. the way that was
originally set up was that.

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:44.489
the federal government was
gonna be responsible for 65%

00:48:44.489 --> 00:48:48.759
the state 10. and our
local district. 25.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.761
And there's a lot of
people benefit from this

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.430
other than just the farmers.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.333
but that's. who's
got to pay for it

00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:56.734
'cause those are only the ones

00:48:56.734 --> 00:48:58.336
that's actually using the water.

00:49:00.205 --> 00:49:01.606
- And I'm assuming
we'll have to do

00:49:01.606 --> 00:49:03.341
a whole bunch of
stuff like that.

00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:07.778
As temperature rises and
rain patterns change.

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.348
When every person we've
talked to about farming

00:49:10.348 --> 00:49:12.117
and different methods of farming

00:49:12.117 --> 00:49:17.122
whether it's till or no
till or organic or not.

00:49:17.122 --> 00:49:18.123
(tractor engine purring)

00:49:18.123 --> 00:49:19.757
Each piece of land is different.

00:49:20.558 --> 00:49:23.128
And each little
community is different.

00:49:23.128 --> 00:49:25.096
And the ecosystem
there is different.

00:49:25.096 --> 00:49:28.633
So how can a giant JP Morgan.

00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:32.137
how can they service
a community like this?

00:49:32.137 --> 00:49:35.140
- Well. and why
would they want to?
- Yeah.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.974
- That's the rest of the story.

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.309
I mean. that's not
gonna be a profit center

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:40.278
for them to come out
here and look at a man

00:49:40.278 --> 00:49:43.281
that's farming
2.000. 3.000 acres.

00:49:43.281 --> 00:49:47.985
They're looking for
20. 50.000 acre farms

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:51.822
to where they can justify
spending some time on them.

00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:55.726
- The relationships with the
banks they've gotten big too.

00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:57.328
But it used to be
these smaller banks

00:49:57.328 --> 00:50:02.267
and they knew your
dad and his dad.

00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:04.835
If you went to a farm sale and
"Hey I liked this tractor."

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.838
and it was $27.000.

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:10.075
You just call the bank
and say. "Hey. I need it."

00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:11.509
"Okay. it's in your account."

00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.011
(gentle foreboding music)

00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:18.516
- 60 years ago if you made a
crop. you made money period.

00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:21.819
If you made a crop.
you paid all your bills

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:23.521
and you could send
your kids to school

00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:25.190
and you buy your groceries.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.491
You were okay.

00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:31.196
Today. you can make a
crop and lose your assets.

00:50:31.196 --> 00:50:34.499
(gentle ominous music)

00:50:36.101 --> 00:50:38.035
(tractor engine revving)

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:41.672
- Everybody out here.
it's all family and.

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:49.046
I mean. if you were 30
years ago when we did this

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:54.285
we get all. a
combine was $35.000.

00:50:54.819 --> 00:51:00.291
And now a combine is $400.000.

00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:03.961
(light airy music)

00:51:03.961 --> 00:51:06.464
- When you're looking
at machines that.

00:51:06.464 --> 00:51:08.199
so by the time you
have your headers

00:51:08.199 --> 00:51:10.168
and your everything
to go with it

00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:13.070
being upward close to
half a million dollars.

00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:16.741
Where else is
someone else buying

00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:18.543
half a million dollar equipment

00:51:18.543 --> 00:51:21.379
and I'm barely making ends meet.

00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:24.749
(tractor engine revving)

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.219
It gets more
challenging every year.

00:51:28.219 --> 00:51:34.525
- The cost of production
and agricultural costs

00:51:34.659 --> 00:51:38.363
or just to be a farmer
and even a small farmer

00:51:38.363 --> 00:51:39.997
are almost cost prohibitive

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:43.868
unless your family has been
in farming for generations.

00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:47.205
- Thank God almighty for
such a good looking crop

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:51.008
while others have
had to struggle.

00:51:51.008 --> 00:51:52.243
(light airy music)

00:51:52.243 --> 00:51:53.544
- Oh. here's some fellows.

00:51:53.544 --> 00:51:55.680
- Yeah. that's who
we're riding with.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.947
Y'all be riding with him.

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:59.684
(phone ringing)

00:51:59.684 --> 00:52:01.686
(indistinct)

00:52:01.686 --> 00:52:03.020
Alright. thanks Zach.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.289
See you there.

00:52:04.289 --> 00:52:07.358
(tractor engine revving)

00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:09.227
- Farms are similar
to owning a house.

00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:10.961
You've gotta clean the gutters.

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:13.364
You've gotta sweep the sidewalk.

00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:14.765
And the same thing with a farm

00:52:14.765 --> 00:52:17.968
you've got certain maintenance
that have to be done

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:20.471
on annual basis to keep
it in a working order.

00:52:22.407 --> 00:52:26.377
- Before automation. everything
in here is handwritten.

00:52:27.278 --> 00:52:29.780
- 24th. 1955.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.449
- Yep. And everyday...

00:52:31.449 --> 00:52:33.451
- And that's everything that
happened during that day

00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:34.885
all the money that came in.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.654
- They made four loans.

00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:39.324
Like this is. these are the
loans that we made that day.

00:52:39.324 --> 00:52:44.262
And you see the size of
the loans; $150. $500.

00:52:44.262 --> 00:52:45.896
- The countryside across America

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:48.299
not just in our rural community
but other rural communities

00:52:48.299 --> 00:52:51.168
used to have a lot of
small community banks

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:55.005
that were very plugged
into their communities

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.474
and to the people
that live there.

00:52:56.474 --> 00:52:57.675
And trying to help them

00:52:57.675 --> 00:52:59.810
grow their businesses
and their lives.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.514
So just afraid of what the
landscape holds going forward.

00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:05.015
You're just a number.

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.117
you're CUSIP number
on a bond security

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.119
and here's where you
mail your check now.

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:12.357
- It's getting harder and
harder for those farmers

00:53:12.357 --> 00:53:15.826
to stay in business because
they cannot get the funding.

00:53:15.826 --> 00:53:19.997
Because with each year
of them incurring loss

00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:22.032
and then no hope of...

00:53:22.967 --> 00:53:25.503
The prices don't get
better the next year

00:53:25.503 --> 00:53:28.939
regardless of the type
of natural disasters

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.375
and things that happen.

00:53:30.375 --> 00:53:32.277
And so the farmer gets
further and further behind

00:53:32.277 --> 00:53:34.779
and we've had several
farmers that are actually

00:53:34.779 --> 00:53:36.013
going out of business.

00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:37.214
They're having to
sell their equipment

00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:40.885
and turn the farm over
to someone else to farm.

00:53:40.885 --> 00:53:44.221
(gentle ominous music)

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.057
- It's actually something
that I have no control over.

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.559
And none of us around
in England. Arkansas

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:50.227
have any control over.

00:53:53.398 --> 00:53:56.401
And at the last
one. like in 2008

00:53:56.401 --> 00:53:57.902
when they were saying that.

00:53:57.902 --> 00:54:00.405
"The banks wouldn't have money
to loan to your farmers."

00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:03.908
And I had several
farmers that were just

00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:05.175
pulling their hair out.

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.211
They were just. "Are you
gonna be able to loan me

00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:08.913
enough money to
finish this crop?"

00:54:08.913 --> 00:54:10.180
And I finally told him.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.682
"Just go home and
watch Andy Griffith

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.886
and quit watching CNN and Fox."

00:54:15.886 --> 00:54:19.089
And said. "You know.
as far as I know

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:21.992
we're gonna have the money and
we're gonna take care of you

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.932
and you need to quit
watching all of those..."

00:54:28.499 --> 00:54:29.867
- Stuff to scare you.

00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:31.936
- Yeah. That you
have no control over.

00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:35.373
So a couple of weeks later.
he came back and said.

00:54:35.373 --> 00:54:36.707
"You know that was
the best advice

00:54:36.707 --> 00:54:39.076
I've gotten so far this year."

00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:42.079
- The rainfall amounts. we
don't get an inch anymore.

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:45.015
It's either three
inches or nothing.

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.451
Everything is extremes.

00:54:46.451 --> 00:54:49.720
(gentle ominous music)

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:57.795
(gentle foreboding music)

00:54:57.795 --> 00:55:02.299
- Many of those restrictions
on banks are being peeled back.

00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:04.469
So we still have
trading in derivatives.

00:55:04.469 --> 00:55:07.405
It's not. we don't
know what it is.

00:55:07.405 --> 00:55:10.541
There's hundreds of
trillions of dollars

00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:15.546
maybe 600. maybe 800 trillions
of dollars of derivatives

00:55:15.713 --> 00:55:20.317
on currency exchanges
that can't be covered.

00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:22.920
(gentle ominous music)

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.321
- It's like after 1980s it was.

00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.223
"Oh. Gordon Gekko
is a great guy.

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:27.825
He taught us greed is good."

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:28.793
Look what it's gotten us.

00:55:28.793 --> 00:55:30.395
- It's a cycle in America.

00:55:30.395 --> 00:55:31.762
You have to create wealth.

00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:33.163
You can't create wealth

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.966
by just taking it from
other people through taxes.

00:55:35.966 --> 00:55:37.968
People have to be
incentivized to create wealth.

00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:39.504
And this has been the great-
- Okay. but wait a minute-

00:55:39.504 --> 00:55:41.972
- This has been
the great virtues

00:55:41.972 --> 00:55:44.308
of Western democracy
for 300 years...

00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:46.944
- But it's also been the
massively misunderstood.

00:55:46.944 --> 00:55:50.748
So go back to the
post-civil war United States

00:55:50.748 --> 00:55:51.916
and the growth.

00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:54.919
The growth was made off land

00:55:54.919 --> 00:55:57.788
that people were literally
killed and chased off of

00:55:57.788 --> 00:56:01.492
and they're like. "Hey man.
look at all this free land."

00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:03.861
And that's how money was made.

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.267
- You have to resolve that we
can do better going forward.

00:56:12.036 --> 00:56:16.106
American capitalism can
be pretty heartless.

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:18.976
If you look back at
the American Civil War

00:56:18.976 --> 00:56:21.045
and what happened
right afterwards.

00:56:21.045 --> 00:56:23.648
we industrialized America.
we went into the Gilded Age.

00:56:23.648 --> 00:56:26.451
People look at these
"robber barons" and said.

00:56:26.451 --> 00:56:27.852
"This can't last."

00:56:27.852 --> 00:56:30.387
(somber music)

00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:34.124
And we ended up in the
progressive movement.

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:38.228
This is the age of Reagan.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.297
The Reagan era
was the relaxation

00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:41.999
of the administrative state.

00:56:41.999 --> 00:56:46.804
It was the sort of. let
big firms get bigger.

00:56:46.804 --> 00:56:48.405
It's let's make money.

00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:49.707
Let's do it all with money.

00:56:49.707 --> 00:56:51.909
Let's let charities
take care of people.

00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:53.911
Forget about
government programs.

00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:56.346
And that's run since
Reagan was elected.

00:56:57.815 --> 00:57:00.017
- Thank you very much.

00:57:00.017 --> 00:57:01.519
- I was raised red.

00:57:01.519 --> 00:57:03.688
I was raised in a red family.

00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:07.191
I grew up in the '80s.

00:57:07.191 --> 00:57:10.194
(upbeat '80s music)

00:57:19.737 --> 00:57:22.439
Fell in love with Ronald Reagan.

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:23.841
I idolized Reagan.

00:57:23.841 --> 00:57:27.077
I saw Reagan and I
said. "I want his job."

00:57:27.077 --> 00:57:31.115
In fact. my parents told me
I mailed him a dollar bill.

00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:35.252
I defaced the dollar bill
with my picture on it.

00:57:35.252 --> 00:57:38.789
- The maxim is.
Doveryai. no proveryai

00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:41.125
trust but verify.

00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:43.561
(audience laughing)

00:57:43.628 --> 00:57:45.630
- [Translator] (speaking
foreign language)

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:47.798
- (speaking foreign language)

00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:49.967
- [Translator] You repeat
that at every meeting.

00:57:49.967 --> 00:57:51.602
(audience laughing)

00:57:51.602 --> 00:57:54.138
- But I wanted to
be in politics.

00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:57.542
I wanted to be the first woman.
president of United States.

00:57:57.542 --> 00:57:59.209
I thought it was fascinating.

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:00.878
- We can leave our children

00:58:00.878 --> 00:58:05.082
with an unrepayable. massive
debt and shattered economy

00:58:05.082 --> 00:58:07.484
or we can leave them liberty

00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:09.486
in a land where every individual

00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:12.823
has the opportunity to be
whatever God intended us to be.

00:58:14.892 --> 00:58:17.061
- People like to say
economics is a science

00:58:17.061 --> 00:58:19.564
but it really follows politics.

00:58:19.564 --> 00:58:23.668
Keynes came out and looked at
it. he saw the political need.

00:58:23.668 --> 00:58:26.003
That's how we understood
macroeconomics.

00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:27.237
Friedman came out
and looked at it

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:29.674
and he saw deficit spending

00:58:29.674 --> 00:58:33.243
and he saw government control
and he saw high taxes.

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.745
and he said. there has
to be a better way.

00:58:34.745 --> 00:58:37.848
He reinvented
classical economics.

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:40.017
They called it
Neoliberal Economics.

00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:43.153
- Quoted Milton
Friedman and said that.

00:58:43.153 --> 00:58:46.657
that how the economy
of the United States

00:58:46.657 --> 00:58:51.195
oughta be judged by the
number of imports that we have

00:58:51.195 --> 00:58:52.462
and not exports.

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:55.199
And I thought maybe this
was a typo or something.

00:58:55.933 --> 00:59:00.037
And so I asked him. I said.
"I mean. are you for real?"

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:03.307
- Trickle-down economics
starts in 1980.

00:59:03.307 --> 00:59:04.208
It's right around in there.

00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:05.976
Late '70s. we get into it.

00:59:05.976 --> 00:59:07.945
But the bottom line is.
has two parts to it.

00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:09.714
First fire the cops.

00:59:09.714 --> 00:59:12.049
Not the cops on Main Street.
the cops on Wall Street.

00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:13.217
Turn them loose.

00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:15.385
Let those banks do
whatever they wanna do.

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:19.690
- And so here we are now. 40
years into the age of Reagan

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.892
and people are looking
at what it's done. okay.

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:23.894
It's made a lot of
people really wealthy.

00:59:24.328 --> 00:59:28.032
We won the Cold War
during that period.

00:59:28.032 --> 00:59:31.802
Not necessarily because of
that. but we won the Cold War.

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:36.340
And America became
this supreme power.

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:39.576
But for the people of America.
it hasn't been so good.

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:41.545
- I know. their real
wages went down.

00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:44.414
- Real wages went down and
people in this country look back

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.716
and they wanna make America

00:59:45.716 --> 00:59:47.584
as great as it was in the 1950s.

00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:50.254
That's when the marginal
tax rate was 91%.

00:59:50.254 --> 00:59:51.088
- [Man] I know.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.660
- Ronald Reagan. my
mother loved him.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.663
She watched him every
Sunday night on GE Theater.

00:59:58.663 --> 01:00:02.032
At the end. he would say.
"At General Electric.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:04.835
progress is our most
important product."

01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:08.605
- [Wesley] What would
wrong Reagan say.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:13.177
if you told him that GE spends
more money on stock buybacks

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:15.112
than it does on R&D?

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:18.448
In 1950. stock
buybacks were illegal.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.351
They were considered
market manipulation.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:25.355
Now. investment analysts
look at that company and say

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.091
"A lot of companies
are really smart.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:28.859
I think their stocks
gonna continue to grow up

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:32.963
because they've got a really
great stock buyback program."

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.965
It does nothing for the economy.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.471
- The average American is...

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.808
they're living in
the GDP of 1980.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.109
- Yeah.

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:46.777
I mean. yeah. clearly
the world has changed.

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.813
and the commodities you can buy

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:50.080
are not the same commodities.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.648
but in terms of your
let's say average

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.818
to the extent that we can
measure living standards.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:55.585
living standards
have not improved.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.489
Firms finance their investment
out of their profits.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:00.991
that's what people think.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.828
Now. if you look at the 500
biggest U.S corporations.

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:07.264
50% of the profits
are paid as dividends.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:10.667
50% of the profits are
useful buying back stocks.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.803
All the profits
dissipate. are gone.

01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:15.005
So how do they finance
their investment?

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.406
If they--
- Debt!

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.341
- Debt.

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.677
- [Newsman] The president
expressed surprise

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.847
about the collapse on
the markets yesterday.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:26.483
He's still enduring popularity
as much to the economic boom

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:29.519
that America has enjoyed
under his leadership.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.857
- More people are working
than ever before in history

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:35.692
where our productivity is up

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.695
so is our manufacturing
product up.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:43.868
There is no runaway inflation
as there has been in the past.

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:47.772
So as I say. I don't
think anyone should panic

01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:51.041
because all the economic
indicators are solid.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.712
- [Newsman] But the warning
signs have long been there

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.348
in the closed factories in
many American small towns.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.450
- I mean. there is this notion

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.452
of billionaires
creating employment.

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.655
and that is
trickle-down economics.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.724
The problem about that
is that in history.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.226
it has never happened.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.661
There is no such thing as
trickle-down economics.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.463
It simply doesn't exist.

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.399
- [Man] It really
is voodoo economics.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.805
(bird cawing)

01:02:20.805 --> 01:02:23.140
- When you put the smartest
people in the world in finance

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.308
which is what we've done

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:26.743
for the last 25 years
in this country.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.848
you can't hold back
their imagination
and their creativity.

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:34.751
- The speed and scale of
global economic change

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.753
has overwhelmed the
national systems

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.655
of rules and regulations.

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:40.557
So our first test
is to agree tougher

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:44.094
and more transparent supervision
of banks. hedge funds

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.831
and what is known as the
global shadow banking system.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.402
- And so when you
get right down to it.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:53.770
I'm a licensed banker.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.440
And so when the regulators
come to my bank.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.042
we're very simple little bank.

01:02:58.042 --> 01:03:00.344
They look for the SOP.
they look for due diligence

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:02.079
on projects we've done.

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:03.613
It's pretty easy.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:08.352
You go to a big bank. Wells
or JP Morgan or Goldman.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.887
and you're a regular like.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:12.522
"What is this? I see these
emails and... " I mean.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.359
they don't understand it because
they're not working in it.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.260
They didn't invent it.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:17.862
- Sure.
- It's like trying
to teach people

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:19.964
a theory of quantum gravity

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.032
when they've had a high
school physics course

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:24.734
and they're inspecting
Stephen Hawking or something.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.905
(gentle music)

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.706
- [Katharina] The earth is
like a bounded natural system

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:32.042
that can't expand forever.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.477
The beauty of the legal code

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:35.880
and derivatives are a
product of the legal code

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.416
is that we can expand it
how far we want. right?

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:41.085
So we always create
new types of assets.

01:03:41.085 --> 01:03:44.721
we create new types of
legal tricks in the end.

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:47.157
and the two systems are
not easily compatible.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.826
(gentle music)

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.163
- If you're very rich and
you gamble with your money

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.999
and you lose it in Las Vegas.

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:58.135
that is what you want
and it's your problem.

01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:02.572
But here. if they lose their
money here. it is our problem.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.841
- The market can't punish

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.843
for things it doesn't
know anything about.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.079
- And they haven't
factored any of the risks

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:11.781
that all this could change.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.151
- Natural disaster could
have major repercussions

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:15.652
for our financial system.

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:19.023
just because they will have
an effect on the asset values.

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.190
- [Roosevelt] The new law

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.360
allows the 12
federal reserve banks

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.863
to issue additional
currency on good assets

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:30.367
and thus the banks that
reopen will be able to meet

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.502
every legitimate call.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:34.438
It is sound currency

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:39.209
because it is backed
by actual good assets.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.811
(water gurgles)

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.048
(sizzling)

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:49.486
(helicopter engine revving)

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:52.389
(gentle music)

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.459
- And so what happens is
that there's an event.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:59.329
And then when the event
happens. then everybody wakes up

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:02.799
and sadly there's what we
call in a financial system.

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:06.971
contagion. and people
unload. they unload stocks.

01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:09.473
they try to get their
derivatives repaid.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.875
They want their insurance
policies cashed.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.810
And the market
starts to unravel.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:16.413
When the market
starts to go down.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.516
the plugs get pulled everywhere.

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.918
And so what you're dealing
with in climate change.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.254
it's not only the direct impact.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.656
but also the possibility
of contagion.

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:27.757
- Economic contagion.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:28.592
- Economic contagion.
- Financial.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:29.526
- Yep.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:30.760
(air blowing)

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.329
- Those views are
merely forecasts.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:35.332
and as always will
evolve with the arrival

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.533
of new information.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:37.767
(sirens blaring)

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.236
- Mike. they're on the
bell. hold the bell.

01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:41.738
(indistinct) the bells.

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:43.440
- We actually have made it clear

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.376
that we will bail out
these financial actors.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:47.577
We will bail them.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.446
This cannot be sustained.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.581
- If it runs only because
the central banks go in

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.283
and buy assets. right?

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.884
Recently it was
proposed that the

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:56.253
European Central Bank

01:05:56.253 --> 01:05:58.855
should also start buying
shares of companies.

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:01.525
So not only debt. but shares.

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:04.961
So we're effectively
socializing the obligation

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.531
to create financial returns

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:10.867
for the holders
of capital assets.

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:13.603
And that can't go on forever.

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:16.373
(cheerful music)

01:06:22.246 --> 01:06:24.314
- Even though every
politician says.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.084
"This is the most important
election in your lifetime."

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:33.090
These forces aren't tamed or
unleashed by a single election.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.393
(audience cheering)

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.396
- In the news in the
last couple of weeks.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.765
we've read about
the coronavirus.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.267
And dude. China's acting like

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:45.169
this is (scoffs) like
zombie apocalypse.

01:06:45.169 --> 01:06:46.570
- I'm actually kind
of afraid of that

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.138
corona virus. man.
- Yeah. No. I don't wanna get

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.406
on a plane.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:51.007
Do we have a government
that's competent enough

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.111
and organized enough to
handle that kind of response?

01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:56.080
- No. man. I mean.
we can't even handle

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.415
like homelessness
in the city of LA.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:06:59.949
You know what I mean?

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.452
Like we can't even figure out
how to properly fund anything.

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:04.321
let alone a pandemic.

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:06.990
(gentle music)

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.527
- Americans live
under the illusion

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.696
that they're incredibly
different from other people.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:15.665
When I was in college
just everything started

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.667
to melt down in the Balkans.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.437
everyone's like. "These
people are savages.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:23.140
"They've been fighting each
other for hundreds-of-years."

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.710
It's like they just came down
out of the trees or something.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.546
Then you're there
and you realize

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:32.549
these people live in houses
that have electricity

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.651
and two-car garages
and refrigerators

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.653
and not only
children in college.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:39.323
but several generations that
have gone through college

01:07:39.323 --> 01:07:42.659
and they all spoke
the same language.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:45.329
(gentle music)

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.864
And these people
(jet engine roaring)

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:49.333
killed each other.

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:54.238
They committed genocide.
250.000 killed. rape camps.

01:07:54.338 --> 01:07:57.541
concentration camps.
ethnic cleansing.

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:02.579
- This was a plan to
ethnically cleanse Kosovo

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.748
and get rid of the
Albanian population.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:06.350
Are we going to stand for that?

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:09.753
Is France going to stand
for that? I don't think so.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:11.020
- [Interviewer]
Like many countries

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.690
as a system starts
to break down the.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.260
in their case. it was
the communist system.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.495
and in our case. our
capitalist system

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.197
is starting to break down

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:24.934
and people turn on each other
because some leaders think

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:28.837
"Everybody's upset right now
and I can motivate my group

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:30.540
"to take stuff from
another group."

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.276
- [Narrator] Europe has
not seen displaced people

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:35.612
in these numbers since
the Second World War.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.047
- And those are the kinds of
things we have to worry about

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:40.950
with climate change.
because it happens when.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.952
resources start to get tight.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:46.423
and everybody's a
human. everybody's
prone to these things.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:49.226
- We've pre-cut boards that
we can put over the windows

01:08:49.226 --> 01:08:51.395
in the event that there are
looters and things like that

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:52.595
to protect the house.

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:55.565
Yeah. You saw what
you want right?

01:08:55.565 --> 01:08:57.267
- We knew they wanted.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:09:02.806
- The UN said just two weeks
ago. a billion within 30 years.

01:09:02.806 --> 01:09:05.541
- Okay. A billion displaced
people. a billion refugees

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:06.943
because they can't grow their
food the way they used to

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:09.313
because of the drought
or because of floods

01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:11.815
or because of
collapse of systems.

01:09:11.815 --> 01:09:13.217
- [Reporter] How much
worse is this gonna get

01:09:13.217 --> 01:09:14.318
before it gets better?

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.220
- I think the general view

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.789
is this is going to
continue deteriorating

01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:21.825
for the time being.

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:24.093
the next rains are
a long while off.

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.330
- For the world. this
is a very bad thing

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:29.833
because it's billions
of people dislocated.

01:09:29.833 --> 01:09:32.469
massive economic consequences.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.638
(fireworks cracking)

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:37.474
- Can you have a
society that's been

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:40.644
as successful as this one
has in a material sense?

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.345
And can it transform itself?

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:45.315
You know. in the past empires
haven't been able to do that.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.851
What would these Romans say?

01:09:49.253 --> 01:09:50.586
Could they help us?

01:09:51.521 --> 01:09:52.656
- [Wes Jr.] Unlikely.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.690
- [Wesley] Unlikely.

01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:55.124
(gentle music)

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:58.127
The heritage of
America is Roman.

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:00.764
All the men who wrote their
constitution had studied

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:02.866
the history of Rome.

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.635
I mean. the Senate it's Roman.

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:08.371
- And it's failing us just
like the Roman Senate failed.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:11.207
- You know. there was a
Greek philosopher who said

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:14.644
that governments
go through cycles.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:18.482
They go from a
democracy to oligopoly

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:23.719
to dictatorships
and they collapse.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.856
- I know we're talking
about Aristotle but..

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:29.157
- Actually it wasn't Aristotle.
it was a different guy.

01:10:29.157 --> 01:10:30.559
- No. it was Aristotle.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.896
- No. it was maybe
it was Polybius.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.063
I forget who it was.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:37.233
- I'll bet you cash.
it's Aristotle.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.869
'cause we're in Vegas. I will
bet you cash it's Aristotle.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:42.906
because Aristotle came
up with the definitions

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:44.841
of the three kinds
of governments

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.743
and their alter egos.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:49.813
So you have a democracy
which when it goes bad.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.315
becomes a mobocracy.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.651
You have a monarchy.

01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:57.687
which when it goes
bad becomes a tyranny

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.988
and you have an aristocracy.

01:10:59.988 --> 01:11:02.658
which when it goes bad
becomes an oligopoly.

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:10.500
- He's building on the
work of a predecessor.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.035
What's the name of
the predecessor?

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:13.937
We have to find that out.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.171
- [Wes Jr.] I don't
know. you tell me.

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.340
- [Wesley] We'll find it.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.841
I don't know. I
have to look it up.

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:20.610
- [Narrator] Wealth was
obtained largely through trade.

01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:23.680
into the warehouses
full of goods

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.115
from all over the
empire and beyond.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.419
It was the wealthy few
rather than the many.

01:11:29.419 --> 01:11:31.120
who benefited from the riches

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.221
and vast resources
of the empire.

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:37.361
This imbalance and the
irresponsible behavior

01:11:37.361 --> 01:11:38.962
of public officials.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:42.398
would become major reasons
for Rome's eventual decline.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:47.537
- Okay. so dad
and I had this bet

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.473
and I need you to
see if I'm right

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:50.974
or he's right.
- Okay.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:53.276
- It's about Aristotle.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:54.811
- Oh boy.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:55.745
- I know. I know.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.046
(laughing)

01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:00.484
So I was like well.
Aristotle described.

01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:02.486
the death of democracy
and what happens

01:12:02.486 --> 01:12:05.121
to different forms of
government as they decay.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.958
(gentle music)

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:16.833
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:10.219
- Well you see Alessia. I know
from also from your studies.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.989
that the collapse
of the Roman Empire

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:17.293
was mainly a huge. gigantic.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:21.498
enormous. humongous.
financial collapse.

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:25.902
At some point. the emperors
had just run out of money.

01:13:27.671 --> 01:13:30.005
- There are lots of
different theories

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:32.208
why the Roman
Empire did collapse.

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:33.510
I think what we know now.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.513
is that there has been
a long economic decline

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:37.981
before the Roman
Empire collapsed.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:40.650
before the German
hoards came down

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.752
and conquered Italy.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.353
and conquered Rome.
ultimately. right?

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:48.758
So the question is
what triggered the
long economic decline?

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:52.261
- Disparity between
the rich and the poor.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.931
- Onistorus and Miliorus they...

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.264
- Yes. you're
speaking Latin now.

01:13:56.264 --> 01:13:57.567
- Yeah. yeah Latin.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.603
- Massive amounts of inequality

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.939
may not be politically
sustainable.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:07.443
Governments fund themselves
through either debt.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.678
or through taxation.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:10.179
In Rome you would basically go

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:13.683
and try to squeeze
more returns out of

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:15.118
provinces that you occupied.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:18.054
or you might launch another
war to get the returns.

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.456
to feed Rome and
feed those who were

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.125
running the system overall.

01:14:23.527 --> 01:14:25.529
And I think that's
the common denominator

01:14:25.529 --> 01:14:27.897
because we live in a quite
different system today. right?

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:29.566
So today it's our central banks

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.901
who are doing the
rescue operation.

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.469
- One thing about the
financial markets.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.972
one of their real power is.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:39.407
if they can pull forward
action from the future

01:14:39.407 --> 01:14:41.911
to the present. if
there's credible policy.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:44.380
after all. most of
what central banks do

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.949
is effectively that.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.885
- So big trees fall hard.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.154
The market can
adapt to anything.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.656
as long as there's clarity.

01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:55.124
transparency and honesty

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:58.562
and I don't think
we're getting that.

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.164
- There were a lot of things
that caused the problem.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:04.968
but. I mean. essentially.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:06.434
the structure of Rome

01:15:06.434 --> 01:15:08.838
held together for
a good long time.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.007
until finally it just ran out

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:15.745
of economic wherewithal
and leadership.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:17.581
- Politicians were bought.

01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:20.617
what the founders of
our republic warned us

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:23.286
about over and over that
if you get really wealthy

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:26.022
and you lose your moral
character. it's over.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.757
- Well. that's where we are.

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:30.526
- Because we are very
close to a moment

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:35.531
in which we could
start slowly going down

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.867
and if we are not very careful.

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:40.804
we will go down faster and
faster and faster and faster.

01:15:40.804 --> 01:15:42.105
(exclaiming)

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:43.306
Roller coaster.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:45.508
It will be a lot of fun. maybe.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:48.544
You know the
ancient malediction.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:52.380
may you live in
interesting times.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.718
(loud bang)

01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:59.723
- So. that's how
it ended last time.

01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:04.728
Except this time. it
won't just be barbarians.

01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:06.963
it'll be the planet
itself that's on fire.

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:09.565
(fire roaring)

01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:13.568
- [Man] There's still
active fire in that area.

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:16.472
Monitor the conditions
and know what you'll do

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.907
if the fire threatens
(indistinct)

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:21.377
- [Woman] In the smoky
aftermath of the worst start

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:23.746
to fire season
anyone can remember.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.648
while some search for solutions.

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:27.583
others want someone to blame.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.753
(gentle somber music)

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.587
- Probably should take a
break and let it settle in.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.656
take an intermission.

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:39.028
- Financial ingenuity has
been part of this system

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:41.097
since the Dutch invented the...

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.365
- Okay.

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:43.599
- But a lot of it
- liability company

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.534
- isn't financial
- and Lloyds of London.

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:46.568
But dad. listen.

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.004
- People get pretty...

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.505
- Everybody thought Bernie
Madoff was a genius.

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:50.707
- Yeah.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:52.942
Foreign investors looked
at the United States

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:57.013
and said. "the United
States they're the best.

01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:59.916
"That's the safest place in
the world I can put my money".

01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:02.218
- [Woman] I mean. we've
had. I don't know.

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.452
five. six biblical-like events.

01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:05.789
We're continuing to have them.

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:10.794
so I need to
question the validity

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.464
of the value of. and viability

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.266
of my land long-term.

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:19.803
(upbeat music)

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:25.742
- A little over seven years ago.

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:28.044
Hurricane Sandy
blew through here.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:31.815
causing tens of billions of
dollars in property damage.

01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:36.820
and since then. New
York has built more.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:42.925
bigger. taller and
more expensive.
because we. the people.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:47.496
are on the hook for the
cost of the insurance

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.566
if another hurricane comes
and hits New York City.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:53.136
(rain pouring)

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.173
(metal banging)

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:00.409
The National Flood
Insurance Program

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:04.580
is a federally-run public
program of insurance.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:07.984
It's run by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:13.456
It provides flood insurance
for virtually all homeowners

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.523
and small businesses
in the country.

01:18:15.523 --> 01:18:17.193
So this is pretty
unusual. actually.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:19.128
Most other countries
have private markets

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:21.697
for flood insurance.
but the U.S does not.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.100
(sirens blaring)

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.436
- It's a supplementary
policy that is subsidized

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:32.441
by the government. and so all
citizens are. to some extent.

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:36.045
footing the bill for
coastal property owners.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:41.851
- In order to build a huge
condominium development

01:18:41.851 --> 01:18:43.787
in a flood plain in New
York City. you. of course.

01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:44.954
need a lot of capital.

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:48.724
Municipal actors in New York
City are very interested

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:53.029
in continuing to promote a
version of New York City.

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:57.633
in which as much of the
available land remains viable

01:18:57.633 --> 01:18:59.168
for continued
economic development.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:03.005
because property taxes are so
important there. as elsewhere.

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.311
- Well. the original program

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:09.913
of the National Flood
Insurance Program

01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:13.549
was supposed to stop
construction in very
high risk areas.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.718
Areas where water
moves with velocity.

01:19:15.718 --> 01:19:17.987
particularly flood
ways along the river.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:21.023
where water moves the
same rate as the river.

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:24.593
hurricane-zoned areas. where
the storm surge comes in.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.594
The building is.

01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:29.532
it's almost impossible to
build a really safe building

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:32.735
against a 14-foot wall
of water coming in at you

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:34.403
in a storm surge.

01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:38.441
There's a lot of vested
interests that don't care.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:41.244
construction
industry. for example.

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:45.748
They'd like to build
a house on a beach

01:19:45.748 --> 01:19:47.851
while the tide is out. as
long as they can sell it

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:49.853
before the tide comes back in.

01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:52.588
(water flapping)

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:55.791
And once they've
sold it. of course.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.693
the risk is now somebody else's.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:02.465
- The ways in which financial
actors securitized mortgages

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:06.702
in the run-up to the
last financial crisis

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:07.937
is still going on.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:09.772
- So the building
contractors all want

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:12.441
to minimize the flood program.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:14.443
The town wants to minimize it.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:16.980
wanna hold down the
elevations on the maps

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.148
and fight that every
map that comes out

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.782
by the National Flood
Insurance Program.

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:24.553
that causes problems.
delay in implementation.

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.255
maybe never implementation.

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:28.958
- The coastal communities

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.995
are on some of the most
valuable land in the country.

01:20:31.995 --> 01:20:34.964
And as a consequence.
people are gonna fight

01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:38.501
to protect their
investment position.

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.971
- I thought. okay. the
city's not requiring me

01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:44.139
to have flood insurance.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:47.343
My realtor didn't tell me I
had to have flood insurance.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.645
- Honestly. you don't
look at the flood maps

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:51.580
when you move into
a neighborhood.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.351
You fall in love with the
house. and 85% of the people

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.186
in my neighborhood
were not insured.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.922
- [Narrator] Shelter.

01:20:58.922 --> 01:21:01.958
- The United States
is uniquely vulnerable

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:06.462
to building into
disaster-likely.

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:10.666
physically vulnerable areas.
because of our reliance

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:15.138
on local rule. particularly
for zoning decisions.

01:21:15.138 --> 01:21:18.707
That's part of our bedrock
of the United States.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.809
state rights and local rights.

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:23.812
and it's actually has
a lot of advantages.

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.982
but it has a major disadvantage.

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:30.886
which is that local
governments depend on revenues

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.157
that are coming from their
buildings. from their residents

01:21:34.157 --> 01:21:37.994
who are building and
living in their localities.

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:42.966
and that means that
all residents benefit
from development.

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:51.040
- The politics of provision
are so tied up with land values

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.243
in the United States. that
if property values go down.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:57.913
then the tax assessments
adjust to reflect that.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.183
and you're bringing in less
revenue for the tax base.

01:22:00.183 --> 01:22:03.052
which means less investment
in local amenities

01:22:03.052 --> 01:22:06.189
and schools and local
public transportation.

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:13.329
- In Texas. we don't
have state income tax.

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:15.931
That's another reason
why you wanna live here.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.867
because it's cheap. but people
are taxed on their land.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:24.707
- The maps that are in
existence for where a 100

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:27.943
or 500-year flood will
happen are so outdated

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:32.248
and no longer accurate. the
risk and the cost of that risk.

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:36.952
even within the insurance
industry. is not as accurate

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:39.555
as it needs to be. in
order for us to appreciate

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:40.956
what the cost of climate is.

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:45.394
- Insurance actors
have found ways

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:48.964
to take an insurance
policy and securitize that.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.966
and transfer it to kind
of capital risk markets.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.102
so they're not really
holding the bag.

01:22:53.102 --> 01:22:55.804
which means that they're
willing to underwrite more

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.306
and more property.

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:59.308
which means that people
can kinda continue to build

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.576
in risky areas.

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:04.147
- I don't think anyone
would wanna come in

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:07.483
and look at the house and
come through salt water

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.818
and wanna buy it.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.921
(water splashing)

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.723
- This is my nest egg.
- Yeah. this is your nest egg.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.791
- This is how I'm gonna help
my kids and my retirement.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:19.327
- But now. because you
bought it in an area

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.496
where there's rising sea level.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.732
maybe that nest
egg's not so secure.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:28.003
In order to convert
his nest egg to cash.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:31.074
he's gotta be able
to sell the house.

01:23:31.074 --> 01:23:35.344
but now nobody will insure
the next 30 year mortgage.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.346
What happens to John?

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:39.282
- [Wesley] John's lost
his retirement nest egg.

01:23:39.282 --> 01:23:44.019
- Okay. so John is now
literally John on the street.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.991
- [Wesley] The nice house
that we're gonna buy

01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:50.659
in Florida to retire...

01:23:51.427 --> 01:23:53.129
- This was their
house in Florida.

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:54.530
They were gonna move to Alabama.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.799
- [Wesley] Okay. well.
they're not moving.

01:23:56.799 --> 01:23:58.666
They may still move to Alabama.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.469
They may be living
in a trailer park.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:03.871
- Flood involves
the U.S government

01:24:03.871 --> 01:24:05.474
in this really peculiar way.

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:09.212
fire is privately underwritten.

01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:10.978
so it's private insurers

01:24:10.978 --> 01:24:15.550
and what's happening
with fire risk.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.820
is that some of the
primary insurers

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.054
are going out of business.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.723
in events like the
California wildfires.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.125
that can put an insurer
out of business.

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:24.727
if they have
outstanding liabilities

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.662
that exceed what
they can pay off.

01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:30.866
- [Wes Jr.] Then
we started talking

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:33.469
and you told me
about buying a house

01:24:33.469 --> 01:24:34.837
in Sausalito.

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:36.139
So what happened?

01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:37.873
- So we call the insurance
company two days before.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:39.375
two or three days before

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:40.743
and let them know we're
gonna close in a few days.

01:24:40.743 --> 01:24:42.010
And they call us back and say.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.212
" Hey. we can't
insure that house"

01:24:43.212 --> 01:24:44.680
And I'm like. "what?"

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.316
And they're like " yeah. it's
on a list of neighborhoods

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:48.717
"that we don't insure anymore"

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:51.987
So these entire neighborhoods
are gonna be uninsured

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:53.189
and they also told us.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.090
they don't know if
they're gonna reinsure

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.059
the current owner
of the house either.

01:24:57.059 --> 01:24:58.894
That's an entire.

01:24:58.894 --> 01:25:02.264
billions of dollars of
houses across the state.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:04.400
that it's gonna have
an insurance problem.

01:25:05.568 --> 01:25:09.205
(jet engine roaring)

01:25:09.205 --> 01:25:12.441
- The insurance companies
are insuring for one year.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.743
So as things get worse.
the insurance companies

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:17.112
are definitely not
going to be able

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:19.448
to come to the rescue
of these homeowners.

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.386
- These latent.
hidden climate risks

01:25:23.386 --> 01:25:26.621
that might exist in
different places.

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.191
in different housing markets.

01:25:28.191 --> 01:25:30.459
should they burst.
could take down

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.127
the entire financial system.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:38.901
- And right now this house
is listed for $49.000.

01:25:38.901 --> 01:25:42.737
At the peak of the market.
it went to about $250.000.

01:25:43.871 --> 01:25:46.242
- It's not only the owners
that lose their assets.

01:25:46.242 --> 01:25:48.076
it's the financial
intermediaries that lose

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.645
their claims against them.

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:52.047
It's those that bought
the secularized mortgages

01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:54.583
and other assets that
are linked to them.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:57.820
just as we've seen
in the 2008 crisis.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.323
- And unless we're prepared
to continue to write

01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:02.391
the same check over
and over again.

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:04.393
we need to start to scrutinize.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.833
are we hardening the utilities
and the infrastructure

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:13.168
around these homes sufficiently.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.103
so they can weather these
storms going forward?

01:26:16.103 --> 01:26:18.841
Or should we in fact not permit

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:23.346
the investment of capital.
that is going to be subject to.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.251
climate change conditions
in a negative way

01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:29.752
and we need to think about that.

01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:32.521
- No. that's the
really scary thing

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:35.458
because we're not. you
know we're not hardening

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.125
any of our infrastructure.

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:37.960
(laughing)

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.027
I mean. not yet.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:39.962
It's very expensive.

01:26:39.962 --> 01:26:40.862
There's guys thinking about it.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.630
but nobody's done it yet.

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:45.032
(train approaching)

01:26:45.032 --> 01:26:47.335
- Well. from an oil
company standpoint.

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:51.507
most of the major assets
in the United States

01:26:51.507 --> 01:26:54.610
and actually globally.
are on the coastline.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:27:01.116
From that standpoint. the
facilities are as vulnerable

01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:03.018
as people's homes.

01:27:03.018 --> 01:27:05.288
So there's a lot of
offshore infrastructure

01:27:05.288 --> 01:27:06.989
in the Gulf of Mexico.

01:27:06.989 --> 01:27:10.293
but that comes on shore
to a lot of pipelines

01:27:10.293 --> 01:27:12.695
that are right at the coastline.

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:15.230
And so as the coastline erodes.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:18.567
those pipelines become
noticeable and vulnerable

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:22.871
and have to be buried deeper.

01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:26.074
or infrastructure put
around it to protect it.

01:27:26.809 --> 01:27:30.178
So indeed. yeah. hardening
of infrastructure.

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:34.416
utilities and fires have
been associated with that.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.419
or the pipelines.

01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:40.055
People are worried about how
to protect those going forward.

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:44.827
- Nature's gonna be
eroding the foundations

01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:46.094
of our economy.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.764
(waves roaring)

01:27:53.436 --> 01:27:57.072
- So. sometimes I'm out
in a place like this.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.609
and I imagine what it
would be like to come here

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:03.077
with no money in my pocket.

01:28:04.347 --> 01:28:07.782
fleeing an economic meltdown.

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.218
'cause you know look. we
do have plenty of land.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.357
but if I had to survive out here

01:28:14.357 --> 01:28:15.591
and didn't have the money

01:28:16.859 --> 01:28:19.362
to buy something to
provide me power.

01:28:20.429 --> 01:28:22.431
some way to get water.

01:28:22.431 --> 01:28:23.932
out of a fairly dry land.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.570
while we love pristine nature

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:29.237
and we like to hike in it.

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:32.139
hunt in it. camp in it.

01:28:32.139 --> 01:28:34.410
all those things we do

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:39.081
thanks to the technology
that you bought at the store.

01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:43.652
The tent. the gun.
the flashlight.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:47.723
the lighter. these things are
made in human communities.

01:28:47.723 --> 01:28:51.093
in factories. not by
people on the run.

01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:52.795
not by people out of capital.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.633
(gentle music)

01:28:59.402 --> 01:29:00.835
It's all about capital.

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:05.841
So here's what happens.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:08.943
capital is gonna flow to where
it can make the most money

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.112
for the capital owner.

01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:12.246
A town like this.

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.650
which was a silver mining town.

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:17.952
is a good example
of foraging theory.

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:20.155
where if you're an animal or.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:24.359
and these things translate
into the human world as well.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.193
and you've got a choice
between two things.

01:29:26.193 --> 01:29:27.763
one that's easy to get

01:29:27.763 --> 01:29:29.197
and one that's hard to get.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.834
If the easy thing to
get is worth more.

01:29:31.834 --> 01:29:33.469
that's what you're gonna go for.

01:29:33.469 --> 01:29:35.704
So that's what
produces boom towns.

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:39.207
because at one point the silver
was really easy to get to

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:40.375
and worth something

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.645
and then when the
silver market crashed.

01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:44.480
well. it wasn't worth anything.

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.184
So they moved on. to find the
next easiest thing to mine.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:55.123
These patterns of capital
do not change over time.

01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:59.027
Capital is always gonna
seek the greatest return

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:02.197
and as soon as that
return isn't paying off.

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:05.166
it's gonna pull up stakes
and go somewhere else.

01:30:05.568 --> 01:30:09.905
- The way to define
capital is the money

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:14.175
that is going to be used
to create something.

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:17.680
- People are very myopic.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.883
They are just looking at
what's in front of their face

01:30:20.883 --> 01:30:23.251
and the portfolio
that's right there.

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.688
how they're gonna make
money in the short term.

01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:33.728
- How you doing Frank?

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:34.897
(laughing)

01:30:34.897 --> 01:30:37.933
So look. we look
around and it's like.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:39.201
this is all the capital.

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:40.702
this is all the
capital in the world.

01:30:40.702 --> 01:30:42.103
headquartered right here.

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.438
- Right.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:47.442
- And I'm assuming they
all wanna live past 2050

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:49.277
and so we gotta change over.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:54.449
Are they beating down a
trail to your door to invest?

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:55.951
- No. they're not.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:59.353
We have to search for the
right type of investors

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.223
for our projects.

01:31:01.223 --> 01:31:06.028
And when we do find the
investors for our projects.

01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:10.432
it's extremely difficult
to create the value

01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:14.302
or pull out the value for our
projects that the investors

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:17.439
recognize immediately.

01:31:17.439 --> 01:31:22.377
- If somebody can get 15% on
their money doing derivatives.

01:31:22.377 --> 01:31:24.947
why would they wanna
get 5% on their money

01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:27.382
doing renewable?

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:29.552
- Because they would be able

01:31:29.552 --> 01:31:32.555
to use the investment
tax credit.

01:31:32.555 --> 01:31:33.922
Everybody wants a return

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:36.892
and everybody wants to
maximize their return.

01:31:36.892 --> 01:31:40.829
And the only groups that I
know can maximize their return

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.498
for renewable energy
projects today.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:48.236
are the wealthy individuals
that have passive income.

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:50.606
- And. what do we think of
as like wealthy individuals?

01:31:50.606 --> 01:31:53.842
So I think a lot of Americans
think if someone has $500.000.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.077
they are a wealthy individual.

01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:56.679
- I'm talking about
people who have

01:31:56.679 --> 01:31:59.181
hundreds and hundreds
of millions of
dollars of net worth.

01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:02.585
- So minimum. a hundred
million dollars of net worth.

01:32:02.585 --> 01:32:04.952
- I would say so. but
there's not many people

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:07.755
maybe less than 1%
of the population

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:10.358
that has that type of
investment portfolio.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:14.162
or investments generating
passive income.

01:32:14.763 --> 01:32:16.298
- Any more comments?

01:32:16.298 --> 01:32:18.266
- That's pretty close
all right. pretty close.

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.101
- Perfect.

01:32:19.101 --> 01:32:20.035
- All right.

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:21.837
- So when there's not investment

01:32:21.837 --> 01:32:24.873
in the market towards
the technology

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.943
that would help for
climate solutions.

01:32:27.943 --> 01:32:30.312
and renewables and clean energy.

01:32:30.312 --> 01:32:33.315
then that trickles
down into the entire.

01:32:34.717 --> 01:32:38.286
the entire life
stream or life cycle.

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:41.724
you know. the whole
flow of business.

01:32:41.724 --> 01:32:44.492
- Lord Keynes. who was the
founder of macro economics

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.162
asked the question.
why do people invest?

01:32:47.162 --> 01:32:49.698
And honestly. there's no answer.

01:32:49.698 --> 01:32:52.367
He called it animal spirits.

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:56.871
I can tell you people
are risk averse.

01:32:56.871 --> 01:33:00.242
And after 2008. they're
even more risk averse.

01:33:01.644 --> 01:33:03.545
When I go to these
business conferences

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:05.347
and I see my friends.

01:33:05.347 --> 01:33:07.750
I asked the guy who's worth
a hundred million dollars.

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:09.317
I said. what are
you working on now?

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:11.253
He says. you know.
he said. I'm just.

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:13.355
I'm pretty happy where I am

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:17.525
and you know. I've got
the house in Mexico

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.361
and we're looking
after the grandkids.

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:22.430
and I mean. he's not
investing in taking risks.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.700
He's not creating jobs
for the rest of us.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.368
at least not directly.

01:33:26.368 --> 01:33:28.871
That's the animal spirits
that are out there

01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:31.606
in too much of the business
community right now.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:34.442
So the only way you
can replace that

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:37.045
is with government leadership.

01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:40.282
The Erie Canal. the
Transcontinental Railroad.

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:43.719
the Panama Canal.
the space program.

01:33:43.719 --> 01:33:46.855
the interstate highway system.

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:50.458
in no case did a group of
entrepreneurs get together

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:53.428
and say. hey let's build the
interstate highway system.

01:33:53.428 --> 01:33:57.866
No. it was a dream
that Ike pushed in 1955

01:33:57.866 --> 01:33:59.702
that came from a study done

01:33:59.702 --> 01:34:02.103
during World War
II that showed that

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.606
you needed these highways for
national security purposes.

01:34:04.606 --> 01:34:06.942
- This is no partisan policy.

01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:11.914
No one has a monopoly on truth.

01:34:11.914 --> 01:34:14.416
and on the facts that
affect this country.

01:34:14.416 --> 01:34:15.617
we must work together.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:19.321
- The United States is
highly dis-aggregated.

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:21.889
We have 50 states. one nation.

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:23.225
many counties. many regions.

01:34:23.225 --> 01:34:24.459
tens of thousands of cities

01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:26.428
they all have a voice
in how things are done.

01:34:26.428 --> 01:34:30.132
And it's hard to get us to
collaborate on certain projects.

01:34:30.132 --> 01:34:33.068
unless we all align and
agree it's necessary

01:34:33.068 --> 01:34:35.337
and we feel some
urgency to get it done.

01:34:37.272 --> 01:34:39.241
- If the Australian
military study.

01:34:39.241 --> 01:34:40.475
the U.S military study.

01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:42.677
and the British military
study are all correct

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:44.980
we've got about 30 years

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:48.183
if we don't do anything
until civilization collapses.

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:51.286
Which I'm guessing doesn't
have a good rate of return.

01:34:51.286 --> 01:34:52.187
- Correct?

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:54.089
So Wes there are actually those

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.591
who would tell
you that we may be

01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:58.693
beyond the tipping
point already.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:01.196
I don't subscribe
to that. by the way.

01:35:01.964 --> 01:35:05.000
If you do subscribe to that then

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.302
it almost makes
the investment in.

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:10.806
you know wind and
solar. not pertinent.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:20.715
- [Wesley] What's the most
valuable thing in the world?

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:22.717
The most valuable thing.

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:25.954
it's oil reserves in the ground.

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:29.023
It's worth more than the
GDP of the United States.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:31.226
more than the stock market.

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:34.529
more than the stock markets
of all the Western countries.

01:35:34.529 --> 01:35:36.398
it's oil in the ground.

01:35:36.398 --> 01:35:41.403
and the people that have that
oil. they want it to be used.

01:35:41.804 --> 01:35:43.839
Whatever you hear
about Saudi Arabia

01:35:43.839 --> 01:35:45.240
saying they're
going to. you know

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.675
move beyond a petrol
based economy. yell. yell.

01:35:48.675 --> 01:35:50.678
but they're going to
move at their pace

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:53.514
and they need those petro
dollars to get there.

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:57.552
The societal costs right
now are much greater

01:35:57.552 --> 01:36:01.056
than the economic costs of
taking it out of the ground.

01:36:01.056 --> 01:36:03.725
So you have to recognize
the societal impact

01:36:03.725 --> 01:36:05.160
and you have to make the people

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.495
who are producing
it and selling it.

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:09.898
and the people who are buying it

01:36:09.898 --> 01:36:13.668
pay the full cost of using it.

01:36:13.668 --> 01:36:15.603
And that. that means a tax.

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:18.773
- But we didn't even do
that with security though.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:20.608
because I mean. realistically

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:23.245
we've subsidized the oil
industry for 50 years

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:25.380
by knocking over governments.

01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:28.550
by protecting shipping
lanes for it. oil lanes.

01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:31.219
so we couldn't even do
it when it came to like

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:37.359
having them pay for their
own extraction and security.

01:36:37.359 --> 01:36:38.894
- It's true.

01:36:38.894 --> 01:36:41.129
But one of the reasons we
couldn't do it is because.

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.630
we didn't really
have the alternative.

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:45.300
- What's the sound?

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.136
- We didn't really have the
alternative technically.

01:36:54.409 --> 01:36:57.579
(jet engine whirring)

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:03.418
(fire blazing)

01:37:07.255 --> 01:37:09.124
- [Narrator 1] Engineers
worked under fire

01:37:09.124 --> 01:37:11.826
to douse oil
pipelines set ablaze

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:13.428
by retreating Iraqi troops.

01:37:18.733 --> 01:37:21.436
Animal fats. and tallow
could no longer supply

01:37:21.436 --> 01:37:23.972
the ever growing need for
candles and lubricants.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:27.842
Whale oil. which had long
been the chief illuminant.

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.511
was becoming scarce.

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:31.980
Yet the demand for artificial
light was increasing.

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:35.984
In 1850. a lamp capable
of efficiently burning

01:37:35.984 --> 01:37:38.753
a refined product of
petroleum was invented.

01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:39.521
- Oil!

01:37:39.521 --> 01:37:43.691
- Oil!

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.660
- Early oil production.
they used steam power

01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.029
for the drilling.
for the riggings

01:37:47.029 --> 01:37:48.530
of different pieces
of equipment.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.298
and that steam power
probably was produced

01:37:50.298 --> 01:37:51.532
by burning wood or coal.

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.535
So you'd use wood
or coal to get oil.

01:37:53.535 --> 01:37:55.202
Today. we use
electricity to get oil.

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:56.504
We use gas to get oil.

01:37:56.504 --> 01:37:58.040
So we use one form of
energy to get another.

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.375
And that's one of the
interconnected aspects

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.210
of energy that's kinda
surprising for people

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:03.710
is how interdependent is.

01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:06.214
We don't have an economy that
runs on one form of energy.

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:08.951
we have an economy that
runs on many forms.

01:38:08.951 --> 01:38:12.387
(water splashing)

01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:14.822
(soft music)

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.732
- Part of this equation.

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.001
certainly in the short term

01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:28.170
to this time period
you're worried about.

01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:31.339
is modulating consumption and
adjusting cultural behavior.

01:38:31.339 --> 01:38:32.574
But people aren't
talking about that.

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:34.076
no one wants to blame anybody.

01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:35.510
If you wanna blame industry.

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:37.245
well. industry exists because
people buy their things

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:38.413
or use their things.

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:39.914
So they're the
ultimate consumers.

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:42.050
Are we gonna carbon tax them?
Are we gonna punish them?

01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:43.550
Or maybe part of
the equation is.

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.087
we all accept responsibility

01:38:45.087 --> 01:38:46.921
and we get a cultural
change to take place here

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.191
to go back to where we were
20. 30 or 40 years ago.

01:38:49.191 --> 01:38:50.657
- We might. but that's hard.

01:38:50.657 --> 01:38:54.196
- The vast majority of our
individual impact comes from.

01:38:54.196 --> 01:38:57.099
housing. transport and food.

01:38:57.099 --> 01:38:59.166
These are kinda big
structural issues

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:00.934
that can't really be
addressed adequately

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:04.272
by changing the brand
of paper towels you buy.

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:08.010
- We live in an energy
consumption society.

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:12.580
And the way to look at things.

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:17.419
we have to be aware that
nothing comes for free.

01:39:19.221 --> 01:39:21.689
We have to be aware that
everything costs energy.

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:22.857
whatever you do.

01:39:24.026 --> 01:39:26.460
(soft music)

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:40.308
- This is not what public
space looks like in the U.S.

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:43.145
but I noticed here
in the Netherlands.

01:39:43.145 --> 01:39:45.413
everybody's riding
bikes everywhere.

01:39:45.413 --> 01:39:46.781
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:46.781 --> 01:39:51.386
- And that doesn't
strangely require gasoline.

01:39:52.487 --> 01:39:53.755
- Nope.

01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:59.127
(upbeat music)

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:06.234
- The question
is. can we replace

01:40:06.234 --> 01:40:09.071
fossil fuels with
renewable energy?

01:40:09.071 --> 01:40:11.005
And this is a very
tricky question.

01:40:11.906 --> 01:40:16.644
It raises enormous debates

01:40:16.644 --> 01:40:21.483
and people get angry when
you asked them this question.

01:40:21.483 --> 01:40:24.752
because it is not
clear what you mean.

01:40:24.752 --> 01:40:29.523
If you mean that you can
satisfy people's greed

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.659
with renewable energy.

01:40:31.659 --> 01:40:33.027
then the answer is no.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.465
If you mean renewable
energy could produce

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.770
a sufficient amount of
energy in order to survive.

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.672
then the answer is yes.

01:40:44.672 --> 01:40:48.876
- We are in an energy efficient
home now. that we've rebuilt

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:55.383
that our household use
alone is twice the size

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.719
of the average American.

01:40:57.719 --> 01:40:59.121
that woke me up.

01:40:59.121 --> 01:41:00.688
I can't count the
number of trips

01:41:00.688 --> 01:41:03.325
that I've taken around
the world for business.

01:41:03.325 --> 01:41:05.827
but that two
international trips.

01:41:07.228 --> 01:41:12.467
was equal to one year of
utility energy in my home.

01:41:12.467 --> 01:41:17.405
And that really had me
thinking about travel.

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:20.742
It had me thinking
about what I eat.

01:41:23.245 --> 01:41:24.978
- [Michael] Another
surprise for many people

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:27.182
is how much energy we
use in the food system.

01:41:27.182 --> 01:41:28.916
- [Narrator] And
complete dinners.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.352
- [Michael] In
the United States.

01:41:30.352 --> 01:41:32.219
we use 100 quadrillion
BTU of energy a year.

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.255
A BTU is our British
thermal unit.

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:36.824
One BTU is about the energy
content of a kitchen match.

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.526
So in the United States. we use

01:41:38.526 --> 01:41:40.928
100 billion million kitchen
matches of energy per year.

01:41:45.767 --> 01:41:49.771
10 quads. 10 quadrillion
BTU is for the food system.

01:41:49.771 --> 01:41:51.339
One of those quads is
in the food itself.

01:41:51.339 --> 01:41:52.874
Food is a form of energy.

01:41:52.874 --> 01:41:55.343
We're ingesting at one quad
of food energy into our bodies

01:41:55.343 --> 01:41:57.579
for 330 million
Americans every year.

01:41:57.579 --> 01:42:00.248
The other nine quads is for
the rest of the food system.

01:42:00.248 --> 01:42:03.050
This is in the agrochemicals.
the fertilizers and pesticides

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:06.120
diesel for tractors. the
energy for refrigeration.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.456
the energy for drying
crops at silos.

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:09.757
warehouses. transportation.

01:42:09.757 --> 01:42:11.393
plus the energy to
cook at our homes.

01:42:11.393 --> 01:42:12.627
- [Narrator] Pies are done.

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:13.861
- [Michael] Three or
four quads of that

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:15.463
is just for the cold chain.

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:16.798
That's the refrigeration system:

01:42:16.798 --> 01:42:19.267
refrigerated trucks.
refrigerated warehouses.

01:42:19.267 --> 01:42:22.304
and refrigerators and freezers
at our homes and businesses.

01:42:22.304 --> 01:42:24.406
The energy embedded
in the cold chain

01:42:24.406 --> 01:42:26.040
of the food system
in the United States

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.642
is more energy than
entire countries

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:30.545
like Switzerland and Sweden
consume in a year combined.

01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:38.119
The energy embedded in the
edible food we throw away

01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:41.623
is also enough to power
entire countries elsewhere.

01:42:41.623 --> 01:42:42.990
Sadly. we throw away like

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:44.892
a fourth to a half
of our edible food.

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:48.663
(upbeat music)

01:42:52.767 --> 01:42:54.636
- [Wesley] Okay so
Michael. here we are.

01:42:54.636 --> 01:42:55.603
We're surrounded by water.

01:42:55.603 --> 01:42:56.804
- [Michael] Yeah.

01:42:56.804 --> 01:42:57.772
- [Wesley] And what's
the relationship

01:42:57.772 --> 01:42:59.273
between water and energy?

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.075
- [Michael] The water energy
relationship is twofold.

01:43:01.075 --> 01:43:03.278
One is we use a lot
of water for energy.

01:43:03.278 --> 01:43:04.946
We use water to
cool power plants.

01:43:04.946 --> 01:43:07.315
we use water to
irrigate biofuels.

01:43:07.315 --> 01:43:08.782
we use water for oil
and gas production.

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:10.518
we use water to make
steam at refineries.

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:12.454
In fact. if you look all up and
down the energy supply chain

01:43:12.454 --> 01:43:14.155
water's at every step.

01:43:14.155 --> 01:43:15.990
- Our well went dry.

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.824
- Dead.

01:43:16.824 --> 01:43:18.326
- Yeah. that's dead.

01:43:18.326 --> 01:43:21.162
- This is where the water.
that would be the full mark.

01:43:21.162 --> 01:43:24.866
It's not a fantasy
apocalypse movie landscape.

01:43:24.866 --> 01:43:27.369
It's now and it's real.

01:43:27.369 --> 01:43:28.702
- So the grid might be strained

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:30.538
if you don't have water
available for cooling.

01:43:30.538 --> 01:43:32.507
at least the way we have
most power plants today.

01:43:32.507 --> 01:43:33.708
where they use heat.

01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:35.777
they then need a
water for cooling.

01:43:35.777 --> 01:43:38.045
Modern forms of like solar
panels or wind turbines

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.814
don't need water coolings.

01:43:39.814 --> 01:43:43.050
- The average life for PV
panels is what. 20 years?

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:43.951
- 20. 25 years.

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:45.219
- 20. 25 years.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:47.522
- Maybe 30 years. yeah.
- So the people who say.

01:43:47.522 --> 01:43:49.391
well. it takes seven
years of energy

01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:52.193
to produce this PV panel.
but then you're getting.

01:43:52.193 --> 01:43:54.896
that means you're getting 18
years of energy free.

01:43:54.896 --> 01:43:56.398
So you've cut down.

01:43:56.398 --> 01:43:59.133
- Even then you're getting 18
years of energy for free.

01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:01.503
- So me John Q Public.

01:44:01.503 --> 01:44:02.737
I'm like. hey man.

01:44:02.737 --> 01:44:04.572
I wanna put some money
into your solar farm.

01:44:04.572 --> 01:44:08.809
- No. not until the government
gets involved with things.

01:44:08.809 --> 01:44:12.746
puts us into a pari passu
position with fossil fuels.

01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:14.081
- I've got a lot of friends

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:15.517
who are in the
renewable business.

01:44:15.517 --> 01:44:18.052
and there's a really
big problem in terms of.

01:44:18.052 --> 01:44:19.821
you know. you've got the
power purchase agreement.

01:44:19.821 --> 01:44:21.656
you've got all the
permitting done.

01:44:21.656 --> 01:44:23.758
You've even got
interconnect agreements.

01:44:23.758 --> 01:44:25.360
except what's happening is.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.362
grid companies are delaying

01:44:27.362 --> 01:44:28.563
and not letting
them on the grid.

01:44:28.563 --> 01:44:29.764
What's going on with that?

01:44:29.764 --> 01:44:31.999
- I think one of the
challenges we have is.

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:33.668
who has access to
the infrastructure

01:44:33.668 --> 01:44:35.670
and democratizing
the infrastructure

01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:37.271
is a way to open it up so that

01:44:37.271 --> 01:44:39.841
more solutions can
be brought forward.

01:44:39.841 --> 01:44:41.075
This is something that we did

01:44:41.075 --> 01:44:43.344
with telecommunications
in the 80s with AT&T.

01:44:43.344 --> 01:44:45.179
AT&T had built out all
the wires and poles.

01:44:45.179 --> 01:44:46.681
and they were
required to open up

01:44:46.681 --> 01:44:48.182
their infrastructure
for other companies.

01:44:48.182 --> 01:44:50.284
And that's why we have
so many phone companies.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:53.054
and long distance companies
now that we didn't have before.

01:44:53.054 --> 01:44:54.522
The same thing could happen

01:44:54.522 --> 01:44:56.624
with democratizing the
electrical infrastructure.

01:44:56.624 --> 01:44:58.693
More solutions would be
plugged in more wind and solar.

01:44:58.693 --> 01:45:00.027
and we have more
technologies along the way.

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:02.096
And this is where
long range planning.

01:45:02.096 --> 01:45:04.065
stable governance really matter.

01:45:04.065 --> 01:45:05.532
- Kind of what I'm hearing is.

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.902
it's not a technology problem.

01:45:07.902 --> 01:45:09.136
- No. not a technology problem.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.271
- It's not an
engineering problem.

01:45:10.271 --> 01:45:12.639
- No.
- It's a financial
engineering problem.

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:21.115
- [Luka] Energy poverty. lack
of food. income inequality.

01:45:21.115 --> 01:45:24.118
So it's up to us now
to form the policy

01:45:24.118 --> 01:45:28.121
that is going to
help bridge this gap.

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:31.593
- In 1941. when the
United States went to war.

01:45:31.593 --> 01:45:34.295
and people saved tin
cans and aluminum

01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:38.833
and gave up. women gave
up buying nylon stockings.

01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:41.669
and everything was done
for the war effort.

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:44.338
But the war was there.
was right in front of us.

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:47.273
And young men were being
drafted and sent overseas.

01:45:47.273 --> 01:45:48.910
and casualties were coming home.

01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:51.077
And this is different.

01:45:51.077 --> 01:45:56.083
It requires the same type of
reorganization or commitment.

01:45:57.018 --> 01:45:57.952
- But why didn't
they call on me?

01:45:57.952 --> 01:45:58.853
I could have done something.

01:45:58.853 --> 01:46:01.188
(jazz music)

01:46:10.164 --> 01:46:12.099
- That was then.
and this is now.

01:46:12.099 --> 01:46:13.601
Check out our new lot

01:46:13.601 --> 01:46:17.138
the okay solutions lot with
millions of new solutions

01:46:17.138 --> 01:46:19.340
and more coming
every single day.

01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:22.043
Looking for something that's
easy and in your price range.

01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:23.844
check out our
pre-owned solutions.

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:26.448
Like changing a light
bulb or walking to work.

01:46:26.448 --> 01:46:29.651
or our mid-sized selections
like regenerative agriculture.

01:46:29.651 --> 01:46:32.318
or a price on carbon.
or you'll love a variety

01:46:32.318 --> 01:46:35.957
of brand new solutions with
that brand new solution smell.

01:46:35.957 --> 01:46:38.660
Like de-leveraging climate risk
from the derivatives market.

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.896
or the million mile battery.
which is coming soon.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:44.999
Just listen to one of
our satisfied customers.

01:46:44.999 --> 01:46:47.068
- Michael. you are now in
charge of the United States

01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:50.472
Energy policy and
you have free reign.

01:46:50.472 --> 01:46:52.206
How would we make
the transition?

01:46:52.206 --> 01:46:54.407
- For national security reasons
and for economic reasons

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:55.577
and for environmental reasons

01:46:55.577 --> 01:46:57.011
there are many
reasons to do this.

01:46:57.011 --> 01:47:00.748
We need to harden. improve
and expand our grid.

01:47:00.748 --> 01:47:02.684
Maybe even using the
interstate highways.

01:47:02.684 --> 01:47:04.351
We already have the rights
of way and put lines

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:07.088
above ground or below ground.
create a national network.

01:47:07.088 --> 01:47:10.257
And then it will span and
reach to the sunny windy areas.

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.259
and already connects
to the urban areas.

01:47:14.327 --> 01:47:15.530
And once we have the network.

01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.098
we can plug in whatever we want.

01:47:17.098 --> 01:47:19.701
build the infrastructure first.
then the energy will follow.

01:47:19.701 --> 01:47:21.168
But we have to put a
price on pollution.

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:23.337
We'll take the money from
the price on pollution

01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:25.005
to clean up the trash.

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:25.940
So let's take the United States

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.675
6 billion tons of CO2 a year.

01:47:27.675 --> 01:47:28.910
put in the atmosphere.

01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:31.178
And let's say we're
willing to pay

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:34.281
I don't know. $30
a ton to remove it.

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:36.050
That works out to if I
do my math correctly.

01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:37.684
$180 billion a year.

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:39.053
Sounds like a lot of money.

01:47:39.053 --> 01:47:40.287
That's less than what we spend

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:42.056
on just dealing with
trash from cities.

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.392
Why not spend another couple
hundred billion cleaning

01:47:45.392 --> 01:47:46.960
up the waste in the atmosphere.

01:47:47.795 --> 01:47:49.731
Let's take the CO2
and put it into the soil.

01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:51.465
Like. let's pay farmers
to take the Co2

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.367
out of the atmosphere
into the soil.

01:47:53.367 --> 01:47:56.070
(soft gentle music)

01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:04.746
We need to get more of that
national security mindset.

01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:10.084
- If you have a built
to last strategy.

01:48:10.084 --> 01:48:12.219
then you do want to look at

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:14.321
what's happening in
these longer horizons

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.423
and it's absolutely critical.

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:19.326
- It's gonna take
all forms of energy

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:22.897
and all people to move us
through this transition.

01:48:22.897 --> 01:48:26.166
- Otherwise. I don't think
we actually stand a chance.

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:28.603
(jazz music)

01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:31.939
- I'm trying to get
rid of this car.

01:48:31.939 --> 01:48:35.677
but it's like quitting
smoking. it's not easy.

01:48:35.677 --> 01:48:38.445
You are so used
to certain things

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:40.782
that it is very difficult.

01:48:43.017 --> 01:48:46.320
- The Romans had done
a lot of bad things

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.521
to the ecosystem.

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:48.956
- Yeah.

01:48:48.956 --> 01:48:53.193
- But. they had not
destroyed it as we could do.

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:58.199
- FEMA estimates for
every dollar spent
on hazard mitigation

01:48:58.199 --> 01:49:01.702
you save $4 in disaster
recovery costs.

01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:04.871
So we're already
spending the money.

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:07.174
There's the sense that
it's perhaps too expensive

01:49:07.174 --> 01:49:08.843
to prepare for climate change.

01:49:08.843 --> 01:49:10.645
but we are already
spending the money.

01:49:10.645 --> 01:49:13.480
We're spending it after
every disaster hits.

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.549
(airplane humming)

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:17.952
(jazz music)

01:49:20.822 --> 01:49:23.791
- When I was growing
up. there was the draft.

01:49:23.791 --> 01:49:26.227
So everybody thought they had
an obligation to the country.

01:49:26.227 --> 01:49:30.031
If you went to a land-grant
college you were drafted.

01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:32.466
Now it's different.

01:49:32.466 --> 01:49:34.902
The trust in government's gone.

01:49:34.902 --> 01:49:37.304
the obligation to
government is gone.

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:40.742
If we could take some of
that spirit of patriotism

01:49:40.742 --> 01:49:45.579
and service and rebuild
it into doing something

01:49:45.579 --> 01:49:46.914
for the environment.

01:49:48.182 --> 01:49:50.584
- This entire thing
is built out of carbon

01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:52.253
that comes out of
the atmosphere.

01:49:55.356 --> 01:49:57.224
- We need a hundred
thousand young people

01:49:57.224 --> 01:49:59.526
to give up part of their summer

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:02.228
and form up and
really work this.

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.264
We could control
these pine beetles

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:05.767
that are destroying the forest.

01:50:05.767 --> 01:50:08.770
We could plant new trees. but
it should be done not only

01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:13.675
for pay as a guaranteed job.
but it should also be done

01:50:13.675 --> 01:50:17.879
for every citizen's obligation
to take care of the land.

01:50:17.879 --> 01:50:19.380
That's what I'd like to see.

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:20.514
- It sounds like you're trying
to inspire a whole generation

01:50:20.514 --> 01:50:21.716
of people to pay for it.

01:50:21.716 --> 01:50:23.684
- Well. it sounds like something
that old guys would say.

01:50:23.684 --> 01:50:25.019
(laughs)

01:50:25.019 --> 01:50:25.952
- Whoa.

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.855
- Baby baby.

01:50:27.855 --> 01:50:29.290
Can you smile for us?

01:50:30.892 --> 01:50:32.193
That's a good noise.

01:50:33.059 --> 01:50:35.697
It's made me want to be more
of a fighter for her sake.

01:50:36.197 --> 01:50:39.532
The transformation is
potentially exciting.

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:41.235
because we can think not only

01:50:41.235 --> 01:50:43.938
about losing things that
we have always wanted

01:50:43.938 --> 01:50:45.272
but also letting go of things

01:50:45.272 --> 01:50:47.709
that we perhaps
don't benefit from.

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:51.913
We can lose in order to
transform into something else.

01:50:51.913 --> 01:50:55.549
It's not as kind of confident
that things will be okay.

01:50:55.549 --> 01:50:57.919
but it finds possibility
in a ways that

01:50:57.919 --> 01:50:58.986
things will have to change

01:50:58.986 --> 01:51:01.723
in kind of really dramatic ways.

01:51:02.156 --> 01:51:06.127
(speaking in foreign language)

01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:28.349
- And so we are looking
at diversifying the types

01:51:28.349 --> 01:51:31.252
of crops that we are
wanting to plant.

01:51:31.252 --> 01:51:35.121
and also work with
conservation type programs

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:37.859
to help preserve
species and habitat.

01:51:37.859 --> 01:51:40.427
And let nature take it's course

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:43.965
and bring back
species that we need

01:51:43.965 --> 01:51:47.601
and that the crops actually
need to be productive.

01:51:47.601 --> 01:51:50.004
(jazz music)

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.210
- [Warren] We don't want a
hurricane or a tropical storm.

01:51:56.210 --> 01:51:58.813
they're already geared up
the crops are turned in.

01:51:58.813 --> 01:52:00.614
They wanna go ahead
and get finished.

01:52:00.614 --> 01:52:02.282
People wanna know where
their food came from.

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:04.518
Well. at some point maybe
people will wanna know

01:52:04.518 --> 01:52:06.053
where their banker
lives and who he is.

01:52:06.053 --> 01:52:07.822
And do I have a
relationship with him

01:52:07.822 --> 01:52:10.858
that when I need some
money to fix something

01:52:10.858 --> 01:52:12.894
I can maybe find
somebody to help me?

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:16.063
- Yeah. I mean.
it's not a matter of

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:17.898
the government
telling banks what to do.

01:52:17.898 --> 01:52:19.800
or telling us what we can do.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.736
No. I mean. there's still
lots of possibilities.

01:52:22.736 --> 01:52:26.639
We should have smaller banks
basically split them up.

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:29.309
and not make them
too big to fail.

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:32.847
If they make mistakes. they
should fail without causing

01:52:32.847 --> 01:52:34.681
a total systems crisis.

01:52:36.217 --> 01:52:39.585
And probably what also needs
to be done is introduce rules

01:52:39.585 --> 01:52:42.489
which make it impossible
for the financial sector

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:45.759
to create within the
financial sector itself

01:52:45.759 --> 01:52:47.594
so much additional debt.

01:52:50.197 --> 01:52:54.768
- We have to somehow correct
this market imperfection.

01:52:54.768 --> 01:52:57.004
- If you want to
have a derivative.

01:52:57.004 --> 01:52:59.073
if you want to hedge
your risk fine.

01:52:59.073 --> 01:53:01.541
but you must have exposure
to the underlying asset.

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.913
- [Robert] I remember
I was watching on TV

01:53:05.913 --> 01:53:08.282
after a major flood
down in Florida.

01:53:08.282 --> 01:53:10.517
and they were interviewing
this guy and he said.

01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:14.455
"My father rebuilt twice. my
grandfather rebuilt twice."

01:53:14.455 --> 01:53:16.723
And he says. "And I'm
gonna rebuild again".

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:18.425
And the reporter turned
into the camera and said.

01:53:18.425 --> 01:53:20.094
"That's the American way".

01:53:20.094 --> 01:53:24.231
Well. I thought the reporter
should say. that's stupid.

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:29.270
You can't keep doing
it over and over again

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:31.272
that's the definition
of insanity.

01:53:33.707 --> 01:53:38.079
- So it's basically trust
in the monetary management

01:53:38.079 --> 01:53:41.148
and trust in the future
productivity of a country

01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:43.650
that gives us trust
in the currency.

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:46.387
Not the idea that there
are some gold barons hidden

01:53:46.387 --> 01:53:47.487
in the federal reserve.

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:49.891
(jazz music)

01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:54.594
- And so there is a
point of resistance

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:57.664
at which governments
aren't going to be.

01:53:58.332 --> 01:54:01.936
have access to capital
to address the problem.

01:54:03.337 --> 01:54:05.072
- We're rich.

01:54:05.072 --> 01:54:06.840
(thunderstorm rumbling)

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.175
- You know. the fear is.

01:54:08.175 --> 01:54:09.943
if we cannot bail out
the system anymore

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:12.746
it will come crushing down
with huge side effects.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.648
The hope and that
sounds a little cynical

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:19.020
but I think the hope is
we probably can reorder

01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.522
our system only after a crash.

01:54:21.522 --> 01:54:23.690
And I think that human
history is such that

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:26.660
we are unable to make
really fundamental change

01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:29.530
in the way we live and the
way we organize ourselves

01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:31.132
without such a crash.

01:54:31.132 --> 01:54:34.201
Nobody wants it. and I'm the
last person who wants it.

01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:37.603
And if I think back to the
1930s. and I'm German. right?

01:54:37.603 --> 01:54:39.473
And you think about
what the repercussions

01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:42.009
of a major crisis can be.

01:54:42.009 --> 01:54:43.877
We just don't know how
we would get out on

01:54:43.877 --> 01:54:45.546
the other end of the tunnel.

01:54:45.546 --> 01:54:48.049
I think without this
crisis. I just don't see

01:54:48.049 --> 01:54:50.817
enough political leverage
to fundamentally alter

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:53.387
the way we organize
our financial system.

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:56.357
- When climate change happens.

01:54:57.291 --> 01:55:00.061
there will be real problems
and it will be real.

01:55:00.061 --> 01:55:02.029
as you said. there will
be real scarcities.

01:55:02.029 --> 01:55:04.630
and it will be real migrants
coming. and there will be an...

01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:06.200
- And that's what I.

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.169
and then will really be
broke because it'll be

01:55:08.169 --> 01:55:11.405
after you've had that collapse
of the inverted pyramid.

01:55:11.405 --> 01:55:12.706
And then it's like. then it's

01:55:12.706 --> 01:55:15.376
like asking Somalia to
fight climate change.

01:55:15.376 --> 01:55:16.309
- Yeah. yeah.

01:55:18.812 --> 01:55:21.348
- [Wesley] So your
criticism would be

01:55:21.348 --> 01:55:23.017
that we're not facing reality

01:55:23.017 --> 01:55:24.818
and not adapting to it?

01:55:24.818 --> 01:55:26.253
- That's correct.

01:55:26.253 --> 01:55:28.655
- My answer to that is. I
still have faith in democracy.

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:30.691
I believe we can
do it as a people.

01:55:30.691 --> 01:55:32.994
I believe we can
do it as a society.

01:55:32.994 --> 01:55:34.761
And I believe we can
take the institutions

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:37.898
of the United States that have
served this country very well

01:55:37.898 --> 01:55:41.035
for over 200 years. and
move into the 21st century

01:55:41.035 --> 01:55:43.437
and still help lead
mankind forward.

01:55:44.205 --> 01:55:47.108
It's an article of
faith. but it's the faith

01:55:47.108 --> 01:55:48.442
that motivates action.

01:55:49.276 --> 01:55:51.278
We have almost all the tools

01:55:51.278 --> 01:55:53.447
and all the financial resources.

01:55:53.447 --> 01:55:57.384
and all the institutions that
could solve this problem.

01:55:57.384 --> 01:56:01.288
It's the kind of challenge that
could bring mankind together

01:56:01.288 --> 01:56:03.790
in a way we've never been
brought together before.

01:56:04.958 --> 01:56:07.193
- I wish there was
more conversation.

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:10.864
more guys on the opposite
side talking together.

01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:12.766
Because everybody as we feel.

01:56:12.766 --> 01:56:14.701
there are people feeling
opposite from us

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:17.271
that are just as righteous
and all of that stuff.

01:56:17.271 --> 01:56:19.706
But we ought to get
together to see...

01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:22.043
- The thing if you get
together with people like this.

01:56:22.043 --> 01:56:24.245
what you find is
the disagreements

01:56:24.245 --> 01:56:27.081
are pretty narrow actually.
- Yes. that's what I mean.

01:56:27.081 --> 01:56:30.384
- The people are mostly
agreed on like 95%.

01:56:30.384 --> 01:56:31.618
- Yeah.

01:56:31.618 --> 01:56:33.820
- But. but there are
forces in the culture

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:37.924
that want to sharpen and
popularize those disagreement.

01:56:37.924 --> 01:56:38.825
- Yeah.

01:56:38.825 --> 01:56:40.161
- It's a human nature issue.

01:56:40.161 --> 01:56:40.994
- Okay?

01:56:40.994 --> 01:56:41.962
- So what sells?

01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:44.264
Tell me. what sells?

01:56:44.264 --> 01:56:45.398
What do you pay attention to

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:46.400
when it's happening around you?

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:47.334
- You gotta find people--

01:56:47.334 --> 01:56:48.835
- Conflict. conflict. conflict.

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.071
- It's true. It's true.
- That's it.

01:56:50.071 --> 01:56:53.273
- To create that
kind of a dialogue

01:56:53.273 --> 01:56:54.741
between a father and a son.

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:57.478
that love thing. I
mean. this is my kid.

01:56:57.478 --> 01:57:00.013
You guys must have some
wild conversation man.

01:57:00.013 --> 01:57:01.582
- It's what gets me.

01:57:01.582 --> 01:57:03.784
I totally...
- This is the basis

01:57:03.784 --> 01:57:05.519
- disagree with that.
- of democracy and capitalism.

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:07.621
- No. I disagree with that.

01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:10.191
(wind blowing)

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.803
(gentle jazz music)
