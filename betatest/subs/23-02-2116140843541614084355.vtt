00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.295
Hello?

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:56.028
I'm home about to leave.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:03.195
Okay. I'll do it right now.
but then that's it.

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:06.373
I'm leaving immediately.

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:09.229
Understood.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:22.988
Who is it?

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.121
This can't be happening.

00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:25.081
I'm sorry.

00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:50.105
Good afternoon. We're now approaching
Santa Clara airport. It's 12:00 p.m...

00:08:58.715 --> 00:09:00.718
Welcome to Santa Clara!

00:09:00.818 --> 00:09:02.312
Hi.

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:07.725
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks. Dad.

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.672
- So grown up.
- You look exactly the same.

00:09:12.229 --> 00:09:14.853
Look at my granddaughter.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.667
Such a beautiful smile.

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:19.703
Beautiful brown eyes.
just like your mother.

00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:22.073
I've got brown eyes. too.

00:09:22.173 --> 00:09:24.514
You're a Harriman.

00:09:25.643 --> 00:09:27.845
Look at the size of you!

00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:30.948
We're gonna have to stop you
growing up too quick.

00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:33.550
- How was the flight. Paul?
- Oh. it was fine.

00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:39.423
Welcome to Colombia. You'll have
better weather here than in London.

00:09:39.523 --> 00:09:42.327
Your boxes arrived safely
and they're waiting for you at the house.

00:09:43.127 --> 00:09:46.497
Santa Clara was built around
the Aguas Rojas neighborhood.

00:09:46.597 --> 00:09:49.332
It used to be a fishing village.
now it's grown into a town.

00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:55.167
The fishing has gone.
Everyone works in the factory.

00:09:56.774 --> 00:09:58.636
They're lovely people.

00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:01.836
Very warm. very hard-working.

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:04.115
A little bit young. no?

00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:06.929
Rules are a little different here.

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:12.389
So. Sarah. I have to travel
to Sao Paulo next week.

00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:15.960
which means we have a few intense days
ahead of us at the plant.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.663
- Great.
- Grandpa. what do you do in your factory?

00:10:20.263 --> 00:10:23.868
We make paper.
And your mom is going to work there.

00:10:24.368 --> 00:10:27.737
- She's going to be the boss.
- That's right!

00:10:28.472 --> 00:10:32.209
And when you grow up.
if you're a good girl.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:33.944
you can be the boss. too.

00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:37.446
Unless you want to be a rock star.

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.557
Come on! Get out of the road!

00:10:54.598 --> 00:10:56.732
Hey. can you open the window?

00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:39.842
Here we are! This is your new home.

00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:43.514
Come on. sweetie.

00:11:43.614 --> 00:11:45.723
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

00:11:46.317 --> 00:11:50.187
- It's huge. How did you find it?
- It belongs to the company.

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:53.532
Most executives don't bring their families
or they prefer to stay in town.

00:11:56.459 --> 00:11:58.596
Nobody has lived here for years.

00:11:58.696 --> 00:12:01.232
So. how is the art world
treating you. Paul?

00:12:01.332 --> 00:12:05.486
You know. it's never gonna make me rich.
but it's all right. it's okay.

00:12:05.836 --> 00:12:07.872
- Oh. you like it?
- It's a castle!

00:12:07.972 --> 00:12:11.144
It is a castle! Here.
Hold it there. Gotcha!

00:12:12.743 --> 00:12:15.346
She looks beautiful! Come here.
I want to show you something.

00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:17.821
A big surprise for you down here.

00:12:41.304 --> 00:12:45.336
- Well. it definitely doesn't suck.
- No. it does not.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.247
It's amazing!

00:13:14.604 --> 00:13:16.148
Don't jump!

00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:20.945
Thank you. Jordan.
This is all very nice. Thank you.

00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:23.247
It's my pleasure.
How do you like Hannah's house?

00:13:23.347 --> 00:13:25.483
Yeah. it's great.
She's going to love it. Thank you.

00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:28.419
I meant to tell you. the help will be here
tomorrow if you need a hand with anything.

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:30.120
Okay. Okay.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.756
I'm heading off now.
but I'll come back tomorrow.

00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:34.758
Take you into town. if you want
to pick up some supplies or...

00:13:34.858 --> 00:13:36.627
- Okay.
- Thanks. Dad.

00:13:36.727 --> 00:13:38.996
Okay. Bye. Hannah!

00:13:39.096 --> 00:13:42.731
- Bye. Grandpa! Thank you!
- You're welcome!

00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:48.071
Not sure why. but I thought
he was gonna hate me like...

00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:50.200
a little less in Colombia.
Just like a little bit.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.300
- He doesn't hate you.
- He hates me.

00:13:54.545 --> 00:13:58.627
- We're going to be happy here.
- Of course. Of course. we will.

00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:13.163
Dad. I can't sleep.
This room is too big.

00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:16.767
- Okay. let's play our game.
- Okay.

00:14:16.867 --> 00:14:18.752
Mermaid.

00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:21.305
Dream.

00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:23.874
Mother.

00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:26.310
Room.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.212
Market.

00:14:28.712 --> 00:14:30.288
Treasure.

00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:38.029
- Elevator.
- Good.

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:40.709
Rabbits!

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:46.149
- Turtle.
- No. no. no. Rabbits.

00:14:46.497 --> 00:14:48.554
Silver.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.066
River.

00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:54.525
Rock.

00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:56.974
Kid.

00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:58.789
Dad.

00:14:59.643 --> 00:15:01.226
Dark.

00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:02.978
King.

00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:07.098
Good.

00:15:07.518 --> 00:15:09.711
Good night. sweetie.

00:15:18.628 --> 00:15:20.662
Can you close that?

00:15:23.733 --> 00:15:25.633
Of course.

00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:59.221
This is the central market. You can find
almost everything you'll need in here.

00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:03.607
It's especially crowded these days
because of the celebration.

00:16:03.707 --> 00:16:05.676
What's all this about?
What are they celebrating?

00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:08.678
It's called
"La Fiesta de los Niños Santos".

00:16:08.778 --> 00:16:12.407
Why are they putting on those bandages.
Grandpa? Are they sick?

00:16:12.507 --> 00:16:15.786
They're dressing up. honey.
Happens every year.

00:16:15.886 --> 00:16:19.456
They celebrate something that happened
a long. long time ago.

00:16:19.556 --> 00:16:22.357
Well. everything here happened
a long time ago.

00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:29.188
Look at those candy! You like those?

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:32.836
What about this one? Or this one?

00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:36.140
Break out the wallet.
We're in deep trouble now. my man.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.826
- Yeah. I see it.
- How much is this?

00:16:39.977 --> 00:16:42.577
You get down. I'll get the money.

00:17:07.403 --> 00:17:09.239
- We got jugs.
- Wind chime?

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.206
I'm good for wind chimes.
right this second.

00:17:15.044 --> 00:17:16.899
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

00:17:18.648 --> 00:17:21.550
Sarah. have you got Hannah?

00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:39.470
- Hannah!
- Mummy!

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.006
- Sweetie. I told you to stay close.
- Silver's gone!

00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:44.908
It's okay. you're fine. you're fine.

00:17:45.008 --> 00:17:47.175
She's okay.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.423
- Just try it.
- No.

00:17:59.523 --> 00:18:02.675
- No? You didn't eat anything today.
- I'm not hungry.

00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:07.247
Hey. kiddo. look at this.
I got your favorite dessert here.

00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:11.635
We got strawberry yogurt. we got bananas.
we got some chocolate. What do you think?

00:18:11.735 --> 00:18:15.205
Two little bites of this. and you get
to have all of this. What do you think?

00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:16.873
I want Silver back.

00:18:17.873 --> 00:18:20.510
You want Silver back?
Well. we've already talked about that.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.112
We're going to go look
for him tomorrow. okay?

00:18:22.212 --> 00:18:24.987
A little girl took him.
She had a mask on her face.

00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:26.715
She had a mask on her face?

00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:32.623
Come here. We're going to go upstairs.
Say goodnight to Mommy.

00:18:32.723 --> 00:18:34.458
Good night. sweetheart.

00:18:34.558 --> 00:18:35.859
And we're going to try
and calm down here.

00:18:35.959 --> 00:18:37.519
- What do you say about that?
- Okay.

00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:42.466
- I don't like losing my stuff. either.
- I didn't lose him. She took him!

00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:45.670
Okay. okay. a little girl
took him. I understand.

00:19:07.456 --> 00:19:11.528
She was pretty upset there.
She's okay now. she's asleep.

00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:13.297
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah.

00:19:13.397 --> 00:19:15.885
- She'll forget about it.
- She will.

00:19:17.434 --> 00:19:21.400
- You okay? Are you a bit nervous?
- I feel like it's the first day of school.

00:19:22.506 --> 00:19:24.472
You're gonna be great.

00:19:26.509 --> 00:19:27.649
Come here.

00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:38.188
I've made a cream cake. Thank you.

00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:42.626
Would you like me to pour you some tea?
Yes. please. With sugar? Yes.

00:19:42.726 --> 00:19:44.227
- Hey. hey.
- Hi.

00:19:44.327 --> 00:19:45.462
- You all right?
- Yes.

00:19:45.562 --> 00:19:47.414
- Okay. I'm gonna be over there working.
- Okay.

00:19:47.514 --> 00:19:49.371
- Okay?
- Yeah.

00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:52.015
- Would you like some sugar?
- No.

00:19:52.903 --> 00:19:56.942
I've made you a surprise birthday cake.

00:19:57.908 --> 00:20:01.351
Thank you. I can drink the tea.

00:20:04.313 --> 00:20:07.579
I can't eat the cake
because I'm on a diet.

00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:13.765
You look sleepy.

00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.401
I can't believe you remembered
my birthday.

00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:23.515
So. I'll give you some cake.
It's my specialty.

00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:27.519
You can have some tea. Yes.

00:20:28.472 --> 00:20:29.704
Thank you.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.141
And...

00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:12.014
Hannah!

00:22:20.182 --> 00:22:21.360
Hannah!

00:22:33.062 --> 00:22:34.293
Silver!

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.014
Hannah! What are you doing
out here. kiddo?

00:22:50.114 --> 00:22:52.248
Not out of my sight.
that's our rule. you know that.

00:22:52.348 --> 00:22:54.017
- Silver's here!
- Come here.

00:22:54.117 --> 00:22:56.953
Okay. There's nothing there. Hannah.

00:22:57.053 --> 00:23:00.388
- Anyway. I thought you said someone took him.
- But I just saw him.

00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:04.094
Come on. don't make things up.

00:23:04.194 --> 00:23:07.163
Besides. everyone knows if you spend
too much time alone in the jungle...

00:23:07.263 --> 00:23:11.906
- you turn into a monkey.
- Dad. you're the one making things up.

00:23:13.569 --> 00:23:15.155
Hi.

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:17.107
- Hi.
- Hi. Mr. Holden.

00:23:17.207 --> 00:23:19.836
No. Paul. please. Catalina. right?

00:23:19.936 --> 00:23:22.112
- Yeah. nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:23:22.212 --> 00:23:23.883
- And you must be Hannah. right?
- Hi.

00:23:23.983 --> 00:23:28.417
Hi. I brought these for you.
Do you like stickers?

00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:30.353
She wants to say thank you.
Say thank you. buddy.

00:23:30.453 --> 00:23:31.588
- Thank you.
- There you go.

00:23:31.688 --> 00:23:34.591
- You're welcome.
- Would you like to look at my toys?

00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:36.960
- Sure.
- I'll go grab us some lemonade. okay?

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.626
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:23:39.595 --> 00:23:43.709
- Wow! You have a lot of toys!
- I have more than eighty. I think.

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:45.633
- Really?
- Maybe even more. I don't know.

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:03.598
We changed the whole system
a few years ago.

00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:06.222
Where's the chlorine plant?

00:24:06.322 --> 00:24:08.625
We don't produce
our own whitener anymore.

00:24:08.725 --> 00:24:13.372
It's cheaper to import it. and we don't
have to worry about the mercury.

00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:16.678
There used to be a plant
over at the old mill.

00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:19.335
but it was too dangerous.

00:24:19.735 --> 00:24:22.572
I want to introduce you to some
of the state committee members

00:24:22.672 --> 00:24:24.975
- who regulate the business.
- What? Right now?

00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:26.643
No. no. no. no. no.

00:24:26.743 --> 00:24:30.893
Tonight. at dinner.
The festival will have started then.

00:24:30.993 --> 00:24:33.555
- it should be a lot of fun.
- Okay.

00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:44.954
Can you give me a hand?

00:24:49.231 --> 00:24:52.435
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:54.577
You almost ready?

00:24:54.738 --> 00:24:56.584
Almost.

00:25:01.677 --> 00:25:03.745
- Looks good. kiddo.
- Thank you.

00:25:13.822 --> 00:25:15.423
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:25:18.493 --> 00:25:20.930
You been doing this a long time?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.687
Yeah. about five years.
I'm working to pay my studies.

00:25:24.787 --> 00:25:26.469
- Oh. yeah?
- I'm almost a teacher.

00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:28.138
- You want to be a teacher?
- Yeah.

00:25:28.238 --> 00:25:29.906
That's great.

00:25:30.306 --> 00:25:31.674
Here's our numbers.

00:25:32.245 --> 00:25:35.700
Hannah goes to bed at 8:30.
She's gonna say 9:00.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.047
- It's 8:30.
- Okay.

00:25:37.247 --> 00:25:41.451
We'll be home at 11:00. We're going
to the... What is it? La fiesta de...

00:25:41.551 --> 00:25:44.554
- La Fiesta de los Niños Santos.
- Yes. that's right.

00:25:44.654 --> 00:25:47.924
- The festival of the children?
- Yeah. of the saints children.

00:25:48.024 --> 00:25:50.326
It has a very special meaning
for the people of Santa Clara.

00:25:50.426 --> 00:25:52.529
Yeah. it seems like
a very big celebration here.

00:25:52.629 --> 00:25:55.064
Well. not a celebration.

00:25:55.164 --> 00:25:58.815
The fiesta is more
about remembering our past.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.906
It happened hundreds of years ago.

00:26:03.006 --> 00:26:05.775
The conquistadors reached Santa Clara.

00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:09.012
but when they got here.
they just found a poor village.

00:26:09.112 --> 00:26:11.181
so they kidnapped all the children

00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:15.418
and locked them up in a temple
and asked for a ransom...

00:26:15.518 --> 00:26:17.518
their weight in silver.

00:26:22.024 --> 00:26:25.528
The people of Santa Clara asked
all the surrounding villages for help

00:26:25.628 --> 00:26:27.964
to gather enough silver
to pay the ransom.

00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:30.633
The conquistadors kept the silver.

00:26:30.733 --> 00:26:35.004
but they didn't keep their word
and they lit the temple on fire.

00:26:35.782 --> 00:26:37.171
With the children inside?

00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:49.719
Some people believe the ghosts of the kids
are still around looking for revenge.

00:26:49.819 --> 00:26:52.622
Anything bad that happens
is blamed on them.

00:26:53.222 --> 00:26:54.989
What do you believe?

00:27:01.863 --> 00:27:04.201
You know you can call us anytime
while we're gone. okay?

00:27:04.401 --> 00:27:06.740
Even if it's just to say hi.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.452
Are you going to show your drawing
to Catalina when I'm gone?

00:27:09.552 --> 00:27:10.640
Might do.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.340
- Come on. let's go.
- Okay.

00:27:30.525 --> 00:27:33.961
- <i>Buenos noches.</i>
- <i>Buenos noches. Señor</i> Harriman.

00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:40.668
Hey!

00:27:43.138 --> 00:27:44.307
- How are you?
- <i>Señor</i>.

00:27:44.407 --> 00:27:47.744
Sarah. I'd like you to meet an old friend
of mine. a very good man.

00:27:47.844 --> 00:27:50.480
Andrés Contreras.
he's the local company doctor.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.716
- Oh. nice to meet you.
- And you.

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:53.984
- This is my husband. Paul.
- How you doing?

00:27:54.084 --> 00:27:55.819
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:57.652
<i>Por favor.</i>

00:28:04.326 --> 00:28:05.202
Jordan!

00:28:06.763 --> 00:28:08.299
Jorge!

00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:10.667
- Senator.
- Oh. thank you.

00:28:10.767 --> 00:28:13.036
Sarah. I'd like you to meet
Senator Marañon.

00:28:13.136 --> 00:28:16.139
Sarah is going to be the new
General Manager at the plant.

00:28:16.239 --> 00:28:19.576
- Oh. great.
- I'm very excited to be here.

00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:22.512
I look forward to knowing
more about this country.

00:28:22.912 --> 00:28:25.281
Very impressive indeed.

00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:28.275
Your father has been a great friend
of our community for a long. long time.

00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:30.254
- Oh. come on. Come on. let's eat.
- Okay.

00:28:31.054 --> 00:28:32.983
Doctor Contreras.

00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:39.960
Tomorrow we're going to play
all the morning.

00:28:40.463 --> 00:28:42.032
Sounds good?

00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:45.383
But now it's time to sleep.

00:28:48.504 --> 00:28:51.472
- And have a good night. honey.
- Thank you.

00:28:56.945 --> 00:28:58.712
Good night.

00:29:33.782 --> 00:29:36.450
Come on. Sarah. Dance with your father.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.732
So. what kind of job
did you leave behind to come here?

00:29:49.832 --> 00:29:52.520
No. no. I'm keeping my job.

00:29:52.969 --> 00:29:55.672
I'm an illustrator.
I illustrate children's books.

00:29:55.772 --> 00:29:59.106
I wish I could treat
my patients from anywhere.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.778
You still have it.

00:30:07.449 --> 00:30:08.818
You were so young.

00:30:08.918 --> 00:30:11.154
I'm starting to forget
what she looks like.

00:30:11.254 --> 00:30:13.754
She would have been proud of you.

00:30:15.824 --> 00:30:16.759
Did you grow up here?

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:18.895
My parents moved here
when I was a child.

00:30:18.995 --> 00:30:22.551
when my father started working
as a doctor at the paper mill.

00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:23.824
Really?

00:30:23.924 --> 00:30:27.870
They lived in your house.
My father had his clinic there.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.975
Oh. yeah? You ever live there?

00:30:30.075 --> 00:30:33.309
No. I was sent away to boarding school.

00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:35.411
Jordan sent Sarah
to boarding school in the States.

00:30:35.511 --> 00:30:38.648
- Is that where you guys met?
- No. no. we met in New York.

00:30:38.748 --> 00:30:41.584
We got married there
and then we moved to London.

00:30:41.684 --> 00:30:44.494
We had our daughter. Hannah. and...

00:30:44.894 --> 00:30:47.156
- now we're here.
- It's a good decision.

00:30:47.256 --> 00:30:51.361
I worry about moving her around too much.
but you know we gotta be together. so...

00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:56.529
Many may advise against bringing children
to a place like Santa Clara. but...

00:30:57.032 --> 00:31:01.037
- What do you mean?
- Some people are concerned about safety.

00:31:01.137 --> 00:31:04.304
And the dark legends
don't exactly help. either.

00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:22.456
Paul! Paul. come here!

00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:33.936
It's so beautiful.

00:31:34.136 --> 00:31:36.205
Well. it's not really.

00:31:36.305 --> 00:31:39.642
Five hundred years ago. the conquistadors
came here looking for silver

00:31:39.742 --> 00:31:42.688
and burned all the children
of this village alive.

00:31:44.713 --> 00:31:48.115
They put cloth on their faces
to cover the burns.

00:31:49.818 --> 00:31:52.666
They're taking the statues
to the church.

00:31:53.823 --> 00:31:57.825
People go there and pray
to appease their angry spirits.

00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:23.989
Silver!

00:35:37.645 --> 00:35:39.701
Come here. Silver.

00:35:40.049 --> 00:35:41.671
Come here.

00:35:56.764 --> 00:35:57.965
Silver.

00:36:14.282 --> 00:36:16.919
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:20.044
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:21.828
Okay.

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:09.905
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:12.341
- You're back so early.
- Oh. we're getting old.

00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:16.345
- How did everything go?
- Fine. Just... fine.

00:37:16.445 --> 00:37:18.047
Is she asleep upstairs?

00:37:18.847 --> 00:37:20.682
Mum!

00:37:21.493 --> 00:37:23.590
Catalina!

00:37:25.253 --> 00:37:29.091
Mum! Catalina!

00:37:29.391 --> 00:37:33.460
Can you hear me? Mum!

00:37:34.596 --> 00:37:36.560
Help me!

00:37:38.534 --> 00:37:39.885
I'm stuck!

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.480
Hannah!

00:37:59.887 --> 00:38:02.992
- No. she's not here.
- Hannah!

00:38:03.292 --> 00:38:05.003
Hannah!

00:38:05.343 --> 00:38:07.303
Hannah!

00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:13.710
Hannah?

00:38:16.037 --> 00:38:17.485
Hannah!

00:38:19.974 --> 00:38:21.979
She's got to be up here.

00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:29.062
Hannah?

00:38:30.251 --> 00:38:32.288
The dumb waiter.

00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:41.886
- She's in here! She's in here! Hannah!
- Come on.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.004
Oh. sweetie.
Oh. you're okay. you're okay.

00:38:49.104 --> 00:38:50.173
- Hannah!
- Sweetie. wake up.

00:38:50.473 --> 00:38:54.576
- Sweetie. sweetie. look at me.
- Hannah! Hannah.

00:38:54.676 --> 00:38:56.479
- Open your eyes.
- Hannah. open your eyes.

00:38:56.579 --> 00:38:58.403
She's burning up.

00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:27.676
- Hannah Holden?
- Yeah.

00:39:28.345 --> 00:39:32.481
Have a fever. disorientation.
pain in her joints.

00:39:32.581 --> 00:39:34.717
- It's probably the flu.
- What about that rash?

00:39:34.817 --> 00:39:39.054
The rash could be anything.
Something she ate or an insect bite.

00:39:39.154 --> 00:39:41.156
Do you know if she drank tap water?

00:39:41.256 --> 00:39:44.360
I don't think so.
I told her not to. Excuse me.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.962
In my opinion. she needs to rest.

00:39:47.062 --> 00:39:49.698
She should take an aspirin
and drink a lot of water.

00:39:49.798 --> 00:39:52.668
And we can keep her under
observation if you want...

00:39:52.768 --> 00:39:55.204
and run a blood test. just to make sure.

00:39:55.304 --> 00:39:58.040
- That won't be necessary.
- Excuse me?

00:39:58.408 --> 00:39:59.928
The company plan will cover it.

00:40:00.609 --> 00:40:03.728
If I may... Doctor. realistically.

00:40:03.828 --> 00:40:08.721
how long will it take you to get
Hannah's blood test results back?

00:40:10.384 --> 00:40:12.054
- A few weeks.
- Okay.

00:40:12.654 --> 00:40:15.524
We can have them back
in less than 48 hours.

00:40:15.654 --> 00:40:16.959
Okay.

00:40:17.059 --> 00:40:19.760
We're going to have to do
what's best for Hannah.

00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:16.852
Is she okay?
I'm sorry about what happened.

00:41:16.952 --> 00:41:18.621
I don't understand how she got in there.

00:41:19.221 --> 00:41:21.423
I don't know. She was asleep
when I checked.

00:41:21.523 --> 00:41:24.435
Come on. there's something strange
going on here. What are you not telling us?

00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:30.770
Look. I'm not the kind of person
who believes in these sort of things...

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:36.105
but there was something
around the house.

00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:38.538
Like ghosts.

00:41:41.575 --> 00:41:44.398
Okay. you know what? This is not
going to work. I'm very sorry.

00:41:44.498 --> 00:41:46.649
but you don't have
to come back tomorrow. okay?

00:41:46.749 --> 00:41:48.215
Okay.

00:42:03.399 --> 00:42:05.197
I'll call the company tomorrow
and find somebody new.

00:42:05.297 --> 00:42:07.098
- Okay.
- I'll watch Hannah tonight.

00:42:07.198 --> 00:42:09.236
- Okay.
- Get some rest.

00:43:47.335 --> 00:43:48.737
Are you okay. sweetie?

00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:52.372
- Can I have some water. please?
- Yeah. of course.

00:44:08.723 --> 00:44:10.222
Hi.

00:44:11.293 --> 00:44:12.755
Hey.

00:44:13.361 --> 00:44:16.803
- How's she doing?
- She's been sleeping all day.

00:46:51.652 --> 00:46:53.286
Paul?

00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:14.511
Paul?

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.783
What are you doing?

00:47:22.183 --> 00:47:24.018
Paul?

00:47:25.587 --> 00:47:27.620
Are you okay?

00:47:28.724 --> 00:47:30.657
I think I heard something.

00:47:39.099 --> 00:47:41.280
Hannah is awake.

00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:45.495
Let's go back inside the house.

00:47:49.571 --> 00:47:50.878
There's someone in there!

00:47:58.352 --> 00:48:01.423
- She's okay! She's okay!
- Are you okay?

00:48:01.523 --> 00:48:03.783
I could have sworn
that I saw someone up here.

00:48:05.093 --> 00:48:06.911
It's okay.

00:48:08.196 --> 00:48:10.899
I think we're just both really tired.
And I think we need to get some rest.

00:48:10.999 --> 00:48:14.269
We've got to sleep.
It's been a long night.

00:48:14.369 --> 00:48:17.670
Okay? Let's sleep.

00:48:44.498 --> 00:48:45.834
- Excuse me. Marí­a.
- Yeah?

00:48:45.934 --> 00:48:49.337
Do you know where do we
keep the... balance sheets?

00:48:49.437 --> 00:48:51.907
They are on the server
and there are copies in your office.

00:48:52.007 --> 00:48:55.744
Yes. no. I saw those.
I mean from like 20 years ago.

00:48:56.044 --> 00:48:59.433
- Mr. Harriman might know.
- Sarah.

00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:05.620
She's fine.
The results came back normal.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.356
No. she's not fine.
And it's not just the flu.

00:49:08.456 --> 00:49:11.893
Okay. flu symptoms vary depending
on the strain and environment...

00:49:11.993 --> 00:49:16.631
but no. it's probably an intestinal virus
and it's very common in the tropics.

00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:19.141
Give her this for four days.
twice a day.

00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:21.334
- She'll be fine.
- Okay.

00:49:50.598 --> 00:49:52.200
What was that about?

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.970
What they don't teach you
at business school.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:58.574
Have you seen the financials
from 20 years ago? I can't find them.

00:49:59.274 --> 00:50:01.022
Yeah. that's tricky.

00:50:01.122 --> 00:50:05.180
Everything is computerized now. I don't
even know where half that old stuff is.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.916
I'll get someone to dig it out for you.

00:50:08.216 --> 00:50:11.589
- Tell me. how's Hannah?
- Contreras thinks it's an intestinal virus.

00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:14.890
Are you going to be all right
when I go to Sao Paulo?

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.224
Yeah.

00:50:16.324 --> 00:50:18.825
- You sure?
- Yeah. I think so.

00:50:28.969 --> 00:50:31.006
I think we gotta get
a second opinion here. Sarah.

00:50:31.106 --> 00:50:34.809
She's getting worse and these pills.
they're not working.

00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:36.676
Look at this.

00:50:37.145 --> 00:50:39.312
Why didn't you call me?

00:50:43.751 --> 00:50:45.484
I don't know.

00:50:49.056 --> 00:50:51.971
Listen. I think I gotta get her home.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.430
Until she's better. I think
I gotta get her to a real hospital.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.331
No.

00:50:56.431 --> 00:50:59.231
- What do you mean. no?
- No. we should all go.

00:51:00.567 --> 00:51:02.971
It's my fault. It's my fault
for bringing her here.

00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:06.074
This is not your fault. We both
brought her here. you know that.

00:51:06.174 --> 00:51:09.542
- We should leave here tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:51:14.098 --> 00:51:16.449
Everything is gonna be okay. sweetie.

00:51:18.619 --> 00:51:20.789
- I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
- Okay.

00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:24.076
I want to stay up with her tonight.

00:52:02.663 --> 00:52:04.199
Sarah?

00:52:04.299 --> 00:52:07.991
- Yeah. I'm just looking for a candle!
- Okay.

00:53:49.804 --> 00:53:52.161
Sarah? You okay?

00:54:02.182 --> 00:54:03.783
Where is my daughter?

00:54:06.254 --> 00:54:08.054
Mummy!

00:54:09.022 --> 00:54:10.289
Hannah!

00:54:11.291 --> 00:54:12.792
Stop!

00:54:14.495 --> 00:54:17.196
Oko-maha-neea.

00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:30.110
Oko-maha-neea.

00:54:33.013 --> 00:54:34.949
Oko-maha-neea.

00:54:35.749 --> 00:54:37.150
Where is my daughter?

00:54:39.153 --> 00:54:42.254
Oko-maha-neea.

00:54:45.859 --> 00:54:46.926
Hannah!

00:54:50.364 --> 00:54:51.864
Stop!

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.668
- Hannah!
- Sarah!

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.564
Hannah!

00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:02.482
Wait up!

00:55:08.282 --> 00:55:09.938
Sarah!

00:55:10.285 --> 00:55:11.784
Let her go!

00:55:13.587 --> 00:55:14.821
Stop!

00:55:21.795 --> 00:55:23.390
Hannah!

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.214
Hannah!

00:55:26.148 --> 00:55:27.775
Hannah!

00:55:28.336 --> 00:55:30.169
Hannah!

00:55:33.674 --> 00:55:35.203
Hannah!

00:55:35.603 --> 00:55:37.065
Hannah!

00:55:41.815 --> 00:55:44.219
- <i>Try to stay calm. Sarah.</i>
- Okay.

00:55:44.319 --> 00:55:47.789
- <i>I'll call the senator.</i>
- Thank you. Thank you. Dad.

00:55:47.889 --> 00:55:49.591
<i>Try to stay calm.</i>

00:55:49.691 --> 00:55:52.820
<i>I'll take the next plane home.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.</i>

00:55:57.331 --> 00:56:00.117
- He's getting on a plane tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:56:00.217 --> 00:56:02.796
Sir. you were saying...

00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:06.541
Sorry.

00:56:07.543 --> 00:56:10.612
I was saying. it's a bit difficult to explain.
but our daughter wasn't alone.

00:56:10.712 --> 00:56:13.677
- Was she with her nanny?
- No. she was not with the nanny she was...

00:56:15.077 --> 00:56:17.719
she was dragged away by kids.
she was dragged away by little kids.

00:56:17.819 --> 00:56:19.620
- Teenagers?
- No. little kids.

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.690
- They tied her up and they...
- It was a huge storm...

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.894
with all of the lightning and darkness.
it must be very disorienting.

00:56:25.994 --> 00:56:28.863
I know what I saw. I know what she saw.
My daughter is missing.

00:56:28.963 --> 00:56:31.466
Can you please just tell me
what you're gonna do to find her?

00:56:31.566 --> 00:56:33.835
I know it's hard for parents
to sit back.

00:56:33.935 --> 00:56:35.837
but it's too easy to get lost
in these jungles.

00:56:35.937 --> 00:56:38.373
especially for people
who aren't familiar with them.

00:56:38.473 --> 00:56:40.975
Our best people are already
out there looking for her.

00:56:41.075 --> 00:56:43.778
We'll do everything we can
to find her. okay?

00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:46.698
Trust us. we'll find your daughter.

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:49.548
Come on. guys!

00:57:31.558 --> 00:57:33.789
I can't stay here.

00:57:35.825 --> 00:57:36.932
I can't... I can't do it.

00:57:37.032 --> 00:57:40.502
I can't wait for them to come back and
tell me haven't found her. I can't do it.

00:57:40.702 --> 00:57:44.273
- Well. I can't wait around here. either.
- Yeah. but one of us has to stay.

00:57:45.573 --> 00:57:46.941
Let me try and go and do something.

00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:49.349
- Try what?
- I don't know.

00:57:55.115 --> 00:57:57.216
I'm going to find her.

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:19.374
Excuse me. "Santa Clara.
Calle siete. apartamentos"?

00:58:19.474 --> 00:58:22.410
Yeah. up the stairs. around back.

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:23.940
Up there?

00:59:00.253 --> 00:59:01.277
Paul?

00:59:03.884 --> 00:59:06.821
I need your help. Catalina.
They took Hannah.

00:59:06.921 --> 00:59:07.904
What do you mean?

00:59:09.157 --> 00:59:11.989
You said you saw something
in the jungle.

00:59:12.393 --> 00:59:14.046
Well. so did I. I saw it. too.

00:59:15.863 --> 00:59:18.760
I saw the kids and I need your help.

00:59:19.853 --> 00:59:21.967
How can I help you?

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.873
What does "Oko-maha-neea" mean?

00:59:36.783 --> 00:59:39.887
This is it. this is Oko-maha-neea.

00:59:39.987 --> 00:59:42.958
In Spanish it's "Aguas Rojas".
"Red Waters".

00:59:44.358 --> 00:59:46.158
Let's go.

00:59:48.028 --> 00:59:50.498
A lot of people in this part of town
only speak Koreguaje...

00:59:50.598 --> 00:59:53.501
- so let me do the talking.
- So where do we go?

00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:56.270
If you want to find out
what's going on around here...

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.398
there's only one place.

00:59:59.273 --> 01:00:00.663
The church.

01:01:39.473 --> 01:01:42.309
This church was built
on the remains of the temple...

01:01:42.409 --> 01:01:45.262
where the Niños Santos
were burned alive.

01:01:45.446 --> 01:01:47.047
That's why they bring
their statues here?

01:01:47.147 --> 01:01:50.140
Yes. Let me talk to the priest.

01:01:52.085 --> 01:01:56.676
- Father. how are you?
- So good to see you again!

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.872
Wait!

01:02:41.267 --> 01:02:42.835
Stop!

01:02:49.576 --> 01:02:50.751
Where's my daughter?

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:01.652
Stop!

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.702
Hey!

01:04:21.802 --> 01:04:23.738
What are you doing here?

01:04:23.838 --> 01:04:26.038
One of those kids went in there.

01:04:47.827 --> 01:04:49.608
Hello?

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.890
Hello?

01:05:01.241 --> 01:05:03.394
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay!

01:05:03.878 --> 01:05:05.544
It's okay!

01:05:25.111 --> 01:05:26.921
Do you have a picture?

01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:28.545
Yeah.

01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:35.863
Here. Her name is Hannah
and she was taken earlier tonight.

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:40.617
I think your son might have some idea
what happened to my daughter.

01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:54.103
Her son died 20 years ago.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.908
No!

01:08:57.143 --> 01:08:59.570
Some nights she still sees him.

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:02.116
in the shadows. her little Daniel.

01:09:02.216 --> 01:09:04.583
This is the boy that I followed.

01:09:10.023 --> 01:09:11.876
He always listened and behaved.

01:09:11.976 --> 01:09:15.829
but one morning he wanted
to go out to play. She refused.

01:09:15.929 --> 01:09:18.430
He had been sick for many days.

01:09:22.501 --> 01:09:25.362
Fever. rash...

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:27.857
same as his friends.

01:09:28.876 --> 01:09:30.865
But he insisted.

01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:35.315
And he never came back.

01:09:36.086 --> 01:09:38.686
He disappeared. They all did.

01:09:38.786 --> 01:09:42.440
Now all she wants is for someone
to tell her what happened.

01:09:42.756 --> 01:09:44.122
I'm very sorry.

01:09:48.896 --> 01:09:51.658
He says it was the Niños Santos.

01:10:01.073 --> 01:10:02.913
Many people said it was a curse.

01:10:03.437 --> 01:10:07.747
that the Niños Santos made the children
sick and then took them.

01:10:07.847 --> 01:10:09.216
But she doesn't believe that.

01:10:09.716 --> 01:10:11.883
If she doesn't believe that.
then what did happen?

01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:17.374
The river...

01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:21.239
it was something in the water.

01:10:54.365 --> 01:10:58.745
We're running out of time.
Tell her that my daughter was sick. too.

01:10:59.232 --> 01:11:02.735
Just like her son. What did you do?

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.344
Nobody helped us. nobody cared.
It was a difficult time for them.

01:11:10.544 --> 01:11:14.815
And her husband lost his job
because they closed the paper mill.

01:11:15.015 --> 01:11:16.181
What paper mill?

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.272
The paper mill is that way.

01:11:25.025 --> 01:11:27.137
The old Harriman mill.

01:11:31.964 --> 01:11:33.498
I have to go there.

01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:56.308
Sarah?

01:11:58.424 --> 01:11:59.278
Are you okay?

01:11:59.378 --> 01:12:01.395
- What is this?
- Files.

01:12:01.495 --> 01:12:03.797
These children have the same symptoms
as my daughter!

01:12:03.897 --> 01:12:06.333
They all have the same diagnosis.
Mercury poisoning.

01:12:06.433 --> 01:12:07.935
- What is going on here?
- I don't know.

01:12:08.035 --> 01:12:10.404
No. your signature
is all over them. Look!

01:12:10.504 --> 01:12:12.623
Okay. let me see.

01:12:37.296 --> 01:12:39.299
It's not my signature.

01:12:39.699 --> 01:12:41.235
What? What are you talking about?

01:12:41.335 --> 01:12:44.890
It's my father's. Look at the date.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.710
My father was the company doctor
at the time.

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:52.077
Just like I am now.

01:12:57.116 --> 01:12:58.585
That's my father.

01:12:58.885 --> 01:13:01.855
And where is he? Where is he now?

01:13:01.955 --> 01:13:03.655
He died 20 years ago.

01:13:54.173 --> 01:13:55.640
Any news?

01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:09.423
I spoke to Marañon
on the way from the airport.

01:14:09.523 --> 01:14:11.690
The federal police are getting involved.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.565
What do you know
about mercury poisoning?

01:14:20.367 --> 01:14:22.305
Mercury poisoning?

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:24.305
Why?

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:29.474
Nine children were sick
with mercury poisoning in 1992...

01:14:29.876 --> 01:14:32.377
and the company doctor treated them.

01:14:47.059 --> 01:14:49.062
We had some mercury leakage
at the old mill.

01:14:49.162 --> 01:14:52.779
- They died!
- We tried to save them.

01:14:54.434 --> 01:14:56.468
But it was too late.

01:15:01.573 --> 01:15:03.810
We did what we had to do
to protect the company.

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.314
They were just children!
They have families.

01:15:07.414 --> 01:15:11.102
Do you think I set out to kill
these children deliberately?

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.178
Do you think I'm a monster?

01:15:16.322 --> 01:15:18.491
When I came here 20 years ago.
there was nothing.

01:15:18.591 --> 01:15:20.560
just a river and some poor fisherman.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:24.755
Now they have jobs. pensions. doctors.

01:15:26.967 --> 01:15:29.597
I came to this jungle

01:15:29.697 --> 01:15:31.900
and civilized it.

01:15:34.474 --> 01:15:37.111
Business is tough. Sarah.

01:15:37.711 --> 01:15:40.814
Difficult decisions have to be made.

01:15:40.914 --> 01:15:43.044
And sometimes...

01:15:44.418 --> 01:15:47.346
Sometimes there's collateral damage.

01:15:50.175 --> 01:15:54.427
Hannah is sick with mercury poisoning.
Is she collateral damage?

01:15:55.428 --> 01:15:58.732
That's impossible. We have no mercury
at the plant anymore. I told you that.

01:15:58.832 --> 01:16:01.736
Those children took Hannah.
I'm telling you. I saw it with my own eyes.

01:16:01.836 --> 01:16:04.392
That's delusional.
Those children are dead and buried.

01:16:04.492 --> 01:16:07.706
Where are their families?
I need to speak with them.

01:16:10.309 --> 01:16:12.877
Those families can't help you.

01:16:14.714 --> 01:16:16.714
They know nothing.

01:16:18.817 --> 01:16:21.241
You never told them?

01:16:25.157 --> 01:16:26.926
Where did you put the bodies?

01:16:45.104 --> 01:16:46.987
Which way is it?

01:17:44.753 --> 01:17:45.638
Look!

01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:48.109
She's in here somewhere.

01:17:49.109 --> 01:17:50.844
- Hannah!
- Hannah!

01:17:50.944 --> 01:17:54.946
- Hannah!
- Hannah! Hannah!

01:17:57.749 --> 01:17:58.883
Hannah!

01:18:02.221 --> 01:18:05.279
Wait! Sarah!

01:18:42.561 --> 01:18:44.696
Hannah. are you there?

01:19:04.817 --> 01:19:08.182
Wait! Where is my daughter? Hannah!

01:19:26.004 --> 01:19:27.801
Hannah!

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.811
- Can you hear me?
- Mermaid!

01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:32.865
Hannah!

01:19:34.547 --> 01:19:36.286
Mommy's here!

01:19:36.386 --> 01:19:37.951
