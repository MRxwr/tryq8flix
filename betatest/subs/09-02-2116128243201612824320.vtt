I have got something even better.

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.574
What else? We have enough.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.240
I caught a big one today

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:51.283
and I am sharing.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.573
Fresh and alive.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.115
What about it?

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.324
Here comes our fish.

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.032
Little bastard.

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.453
A friend of yours?

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.832
You messed him up good.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.240
How would I tell?

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:57.907
It's Van!

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.535
You can't tell?

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.158
I have kept him around for 3 years!

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:07.490
You bastard.

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.578
3 years!

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:11.414
I have been clueless.

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:13.873
I knew nothing!

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.081
I am always careful.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.198
always cautious.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:31.624
It's not even half way through the year and

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:35.200
we have already been busted thrice!

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.373
Why is that?

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.914
We have a traitor!

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.615
I won't let you die just yet.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.539
Are you even sure?

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:58.702
You are so loud.

00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:00.184
The cops have every reason to be after you.

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:01.163
You busted him so easily.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:03.039
He is a pretty bad mole.

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:05.449
All these years. how could
we not notice a thing.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:16.948
We found

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.081
this tracker on him

00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:21.248
when we were dealing yesterday.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.623
If he is not a mole.

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.039
is it you?

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:33.875
What are you doing?

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.414
You never learn. do you?

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:36.573
This thing

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:37.535
is going to bring all the cops here.

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.103
You want all of us to go down at once?

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:46.703
Officer tuen. have you found Van?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.240

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Copy that.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:09.157
Right. You know what you are doing.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.954
Why don't you nail him to the cross?

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:14.618
Brother ting.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.250
Say it.

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.078
Why did you have a tracker?

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.333
Take it or leave it.

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:42.372
You are a tough one. aren't you?

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.617
Let's see how many fingers
you have here for me to bust.

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:55.498

I'll talk.

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.243
Son of a bitch.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:25.907
Wait. ting!

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:29.786
If he really is a cop.
killing him isn't the best move.

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.958
Boss.

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:33.208
The cops are here!

Sit tight.

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:47.118
This cop isn't playing.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.452
Is he getting a medal for this?

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:57.792
Hang on.

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:04.282

His name was chau hung wan.

He was our colleague.

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.785
He went undercover for 3 years.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.573

fuk wor triad drug deal crackdowns.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.914

of the fuk wor triad.

will not die in vain

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:48.498
and the drugs are not getting out there

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.582
to jeopardize the society.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:50.990
Not an ounce.

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:52.208
This time

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.039
we are annihilating

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.410

I was told

you see a rat in your kitchen.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:08.911
it means it is multiplying from 1 to 2.

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:09.913
4 to 8.

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.368
And then an entire herd.

00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:14.829
It is bringing its family and friends.

00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:17.449
I've got it. boss.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.536
I am the rat poison.

00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:21.119
Rest assured. It will be a clean cut.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.865
Rat poison.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.367
What a name.

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:30.039
You've got balls.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.411
Killing a cop?

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:43.157
Boss.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.740
He was a traitor!

00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:46.578
It's life or death!

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:48.707
He could have screwed us over!

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.456
How do I know

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
who is a rat and

00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:53.663
who is an undercover cop?

00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:55.539
Thanks to you.

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:57.623
we are closed for 2 months.

00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.581
Have you done the math on my loss?

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:00.705
Boss.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.456
This is on me.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.456
I took the rat in.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.035
Glad you realize your mistake.

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:10.165
I was about to say.

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:12.407
loyalty is everything here.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.287
Word has it that your
meth is all watered-down.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.615
Do you know how lethal this is

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:18.578
to our reputation?

00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:22.323
It's just a rumor.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.275
- Do you know how much I have done to help...
- Are you done?

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:26.684
Why are you cutting him off?

00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.143
- He is explaining!
- What's there to explain?

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:29.847
- An explanation for boss!
- That's enough!

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.367
Being responsible isn't a bad thing.

00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:38.042
Alright.

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:40.161
I am sending you to Cambodia

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.698
to search for new suppliers.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.331
Don't bother to come back

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:46.123
empty-handed.

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:48.199
I worked my ass off for the gang and

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.286
you are sending me off?

00:13:56.542 --> 00:13:57.542
Hey!

00:13:58.167 --> 00:13:59.077
Boss

00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:01.081

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.285
Where are your manners?

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.660
Thank you.

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:08.827
Don't give me that look.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.035
Alright.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.448
- East.
- Yes.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.115
Tell us about your new plan.

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:16.448
My brothers.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.831
We will deal with

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.198
the eastern trade company

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:19.997
next week.

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:22.704
This is our first ever cooperation

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.331
with them.

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:25.285
Their goods are

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:26.288
of high quality and

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:27.573
pricey.

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:30.662
They are going to
monopolize the supply soon.

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:33.541
Therefore. the earlier we deal with them

00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:34.893
the more beneficial it is for us.

00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:36.828
This time we are working with their ceo.

00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.411
Mr. sung.

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:40.331
He is a businessman through and through.

00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:41.660
Money is his only delight.

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:42.788
Absolutely ruthless.

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:44.125
East.

00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:45.827
Careful.

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:46.875
Sure thing.

00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:48.289
Joss. Shawn.

00:14:48.417 --> 00:14:50.078
We have to talk.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.032
You've got balls.

00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:05.620
Brother hei told us not to
sell in these 2 months.

00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:07.915
- What are you doing?
- What now? You got a problem?

00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:08.958
Tell my boss. kit!

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.490
Huh? You bluffing me?

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:11.452
Can't 1?

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.940
It's none of your business! Shut it!

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:15.240
No is no!

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:16.292
I am selling it!

00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.574
Tell your boss that

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.286
ting makes the call here.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.413
Go.

00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:28.702
Go!

00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:35.493
You should go.

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:36.782
Where are you going. boss?

00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:38.292
Mind your own business.

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:19.618
Enjoy.

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.414
I'll be right here when you need me.

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:22.789
Alright. Thank you.

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:26.868
Ting.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:29.202
Have you been waiting?

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.660
It's been less than 30 seconds.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.742
It's rare to see you here twice in a week.

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:34.952
What's the occasion?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.366
It's nothing. I just
couldn't decide what to eat.

00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:38.497
Your place is the best.

00:16:38.542 --> 00:16:40.498
No menu. You call the shots.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.698
No fuss for me.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
That's right.

00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:45.452
This is the perfect place for

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.893
people who are exhausted
from working during the day and

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.657
just want to take their mind off everything

00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:49.708
or

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.456
For someone who has decidophobia.

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.035
Which one are you?

00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.163
Me?

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:56.125
Both. I guess.

00:16:57.375 --> 00:16:58.455
Then.

00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:00.101
how about keeping me company for a while.

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:01.456
What do you want to do?

00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:04.456
Drinking of course.

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.244
We don't have a lot of customers tonight.

00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:08.743
What can I get you?

00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:10.248
You know my order.

00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:13.657
Sake...

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.160
With red wine.

00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:21.934
Now that I think about it.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.619
why did you name this place

00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:24.873
bat?

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:26.823
Do you not know the aesop's fables?

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.957
The bat acts as a bird among the beasts and

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.615
a beast among the birds.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.535
In the end.

00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:34.743
neither the beasts nor
the birds trust the bat no more.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.119
If the bat had been a
beast among the beasts

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:38.990
and a bird among the birds.

00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:41.184
There wouldn't be any problem. Would it?

00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:43.073
It's not that simple.

00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.414
This is a choice of

00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:48.244
life and death.

00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:49.618
Here for the dope.

00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:50.768
but didn't bring enough to pay.

00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:52.532
That's a first.

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.911
That's not it.

00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:00.914
you are talking up the price!

00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:01.993
The cops has been

00:18:02.042 --> 00:18:03.122
up in my ass these days.

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.088
I gotta raise the price
to keep me in business!

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:06.827
Alright.

00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:08.206
Dump him into the sea.

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.577
Easy. ting.

00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:18.489
Thank you!

00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:19.622
Let's deal again soon!

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:28.660
Stop!

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.824
Stop running!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.865
Stop!

00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:41.948
Go! Boss!

00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:55.532
Come on.

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:04.164
Pc24601.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.285
Sir!

00:19:09.542 --> 00:19:10.577
Come in.

00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:11.865
I have something to tell you.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.327
Not bad.

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:30.535
You are drunk and managed
to drive all the way up here.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.241
Why aren't you charged
with drunk driving already.

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:34.907
Sure you want me arrested.

00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.573
I almost killed Van that day.

00:19:39.542 --> 00:19:41.248
If I am still in the force.

00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:42.789
with my talents.

00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:44.698
I should be a superintendent now!

00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.073
Do you want me to stay in fuk wor

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:48.911
until I have became the chief?

00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.164
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:51.948
Remember to come and cuff me yourself then!

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:55.119
That way you are wiping out fuk wor and

00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:57.248
earning yourself a merit!

00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:06.948
Next week.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.226
fuk wor will be doing their first drug deal

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.831
with the eastern trade company.

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:11.872
As you know.

00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:13.077
the eastern trade company

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.616
has almost monopolized
the high-end drug market.

00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.164
If their deal

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.740
works out fine.

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.532
it will be an alliance of two giants.

00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:23.331
Vice versa.

00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:24.893
if they couldn't come to terms and

00:20:24.917 --> 00:20:26.248
it blows.

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:29.036
It will be hard for fuk
wor to get any goods.

00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:32.956
I will let you know

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.840
when I know the time and
location of the deal.

00:20:35.792 --> 00:20:36.907
Right.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.662
who's the nutjob that chased me down
to the container yard?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.490
His name is tuen yat fan.

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:43.518
regional anti triad unit senior
inspector of police.

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.078
Rumor has it that he is likely

00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:46.393
to become the youngest superintendent.

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:47.657
Superintendent.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.365
Tell him to watch it.

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:53.032
Don't get into my way.

00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:17.536
Congratulations. fan.

00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:19.699
You passed the interview
and the written test.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.866
You are a chief inspector
starting next week!

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.664
I'll do my best. sir.

00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:25.077
I have faith in you.

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:26.080
make yourself useful.

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:28.207
2 more years. you could
be a superintendent.

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:29.542
Yes. sir!

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.407
Look alive!

00:21:43.792 --> 00:21:44.976
I want to talk to you about a case.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.880
An informer of the criminal
intelligence bureau

00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:48.726
said there will be a big
drug deal next week.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.990
It's worth tens of millions.

00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:53.823
This operation

00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:56.018
targets at the first ever deal
between fuk wor and eastern trade.

00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:57.953
We must break them apart before

00:21:58.792 --> 00:21:59.952
they establish a bond.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.786
I am handing this case to you.

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:03.414
Go back and study it.

00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:06.245
"The word is getting out well.
we are noticing it too."

00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:08.252
"See if you could find out
who was the promoter.”

00:22:16.042 --> 00:22:17.042
"Delete"

00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:46.118
Mr. sung.

00:22:47.042 --> 00:22:48.373
Well done. fan.

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:50.323
Hurry home.

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:51.907
Yes. Mr. sung.

00:22:59.292 --> 00:23:01.749
We are graduates.

00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:04.032
Mr. sung.

00:23:04.292 --> 00:23:06.578
I wouldn't be where I am today without you.
Thank you.

00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:09.241
What would you like me to
do for you after this?

00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:12.225
I want you to get into the police force.

00:23:22.917 --> 00:23:24.453
"You died"

00:23:27.833 --> 00:23:29.073
gentlemen.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.617
This deal with easten trade company
is rather big.

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:34.032
According to brother hei.

00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:36.537
we each have to send one man out to

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:37.663
keep an eye on each other.

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.101
They will be kept at the same place
the night before the deal.

00:23:40.125 --> 00:23:41.865
If we still have a problem.

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:43.873
there must be a rat among us.

00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:45.618
I am sending chicken.

00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:47.373
Chilli for Shawn.

00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:49.118
Ting for joss.

00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:50.417
Alright.

00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:51.952
You are so smart. boss!

00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:53.581
One move. two gains.

00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:54.934
Killing two birds with one stone.

00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:55.993
Defying heaven and earth!

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:57.198
What the hell?

00:23:57.833 --> 00:23:59.073
Why?

00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:00.657
I am appreciating our boss!

00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:01.788
What's wrong with that?

00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:03.198
I am now walking on sunshine.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.957
I just had a big catch.

00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:07.955
You.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
would be the only one who
could rain on my parade.

00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:13.698
What the heck.

00:24:13.792 --> 00:24:15.077
How dare you!

00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:25.038
Loser.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
That's it.

00:24:35.208 --> 00:24:36.288
I'm out!

00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:52.661
Here is your beef brisket noodles.

00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:01.248
When we first came here.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.282
how much was a bowl of noodles?

00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.744
Probably ten something dollars.

00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:07.788
How about now?

00:25:12.542 --> 00:25:14.078
Fifty something!

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.300
For this deal with the
eastern trade company.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.035
brother hei has appointed you.

00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:24.618
Be careful.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.535
What does that mean?

00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:35.789
Does he trust me or not?

00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:39.493
He doesn't.

00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:54.866
So the five of you
enrolled in the same year?

00:25:55.042 --> 00:25:55.781
That's right.

00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:56.976
We didn't just enroll in the same year.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.286
We lived on the same floor in the dorm.

00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:02.874
Who did best at the academy?

00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:04.032
Of course it's me.

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:06.032
How is that possible?

00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:08.324
You only started making progress
after the director...

00:26:08.375 --> 00:26:09.740
You know...

00:26:09.792 --> 00:26:11.768
What are you talking about?
What did I do with the director?

00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:12.656
You know...

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.615
That time the director asked for you.

00:26:14.667 --> 00:26:16.328
he kept you for almost an hour.

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:18.866
We were worried sick. we almost barged in.

00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:20.869
So what happened?

00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:22.163
We know nothing.

00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:25.200
The point is he got the
silver whistle award afterwards.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:29.164
Keep it to yourself.

00:26:29.208 --> 00:26:30.768
Yeung works for the
ministry of home affairs.

00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:32.018
What if she takes it seriously and

00:26:32.042 --> 00:26:33.726
starts an entire investigation
on the director.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.411
I am not gonna believe in gossips.

00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:36.708
That's right.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.410
We should stop with the gibberish.

00:26:38.458 --> 00:26:39.413
Let's toast.

00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:41.449
To fan. the youngest chief inspector!

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.206
Yes. Cheers!

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.250
Thank you everyone.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.740
- Yeung.
- What is it?

00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:16.032
I have entered upon

00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:17.368
a new phase in life.

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:20.282
I promise to

00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:23.744
share with you

00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:27.493
my every advancement

00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:29.160
and happiness

00:27:29.208 --> 00:27:30.539
in the future.

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:34.247
Thank you.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.830
Thank you.

00:28:01.125 --> 00:28:02.365
Will you marry me?

00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:08.624
Say yes...

00:28:56.917 --> 00:29:00.284
"Mr. s."

00:29:37.167 --> 00:29:38.452
Good morning. Mr. sung.

00:29:38.708 --> 00:29:39.823
Good morning.

00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:41.368
Sit.

00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:48.035
Have some tea.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
You can see the wan chai
police station from here.

00:29:58.375 --> 00:30:00.535
Is that where you were
promoted probationary inspector?

00:30:00.792 --> 00:30:02.874
I will be a chief inspector next week.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.010
I will stay in the
regional anti triad unit.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.490
Also.

00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.994
I proposed to yeung.

00:30:12.292 --> 00:30:13.532
She said yes.

00:30:22.917 --> 00:30:25.283
We will be dealing with
fuk wor in two days.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.831
Our goods are of top-shelf
quality this time.

00:30:27.917 --> 00:30:29.748
It's a lot of money.

00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:32.789
The cops will be onto us.

00:30:32.833 --> 00:30:34.289
You have to be careful.

00:30:34.417 --> 00:30:35.532
This time.

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:37.023
we cannot afford the slightest slip.

00:30:37.542 --> 00:30:38.542
I understand.

00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:40.331
I think I have heard about this.

00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:45.958
Hello.

00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:55.581
Got it.

00:30:59.917 --> 00:31:01.123
That's the way it is.

00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:02.831
The higher you rise.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.581
the harder it gets.

00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:06.327
You gotta get used to that.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.500
Sure thing.

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:12.449
The French baguettes look good today.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.205
It's fresh.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.365
Go get something to eat.

00:31:14.542 --> 00:31:15.542
Sure.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.456
It's so beautiful here!

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.740
- It's a three-storey?
- Yes

00:31:35.792 --> 00:31:36.747
which floor are you taking?

00:31:36.792 --> 00:31:38.578
The roomiest one for sure.

00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:40.289
How about me?

00:31:40.333 --> 00:31:42.665
The second floor can be your study.
What do you say?

00:31:42.708 --> 00:31:43.788
Ok.

00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:45.059
We can design it however we like.

00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:46.414
That's right.

00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:48.707
Are we buying or renting?

00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:51.823
If I don't have a house.

00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:53.740
I would not dare to ask for your hand.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.912
You are the best!

00:31:58.708 --> 00:31:59.993
I'm glad you like it.

00:32:00.083 --> 00:32:02.825
I love it. It's so beautiful.

00:32:03.167 --> 00:32:04.373
Wait a minute.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.741
Can we even afford this?

00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:10.040
This is the mid-levels after all.

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:17.373
Within 2 years.

00:32:18.167 --> 00:32:19.873
I will be a superintendent.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.490
We got this.

00:32:21.792 --> 00:32:22.872
Don't worry.

00:32:24.917 --> 00:32:26.327
I believe in you.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.582
We will trade with fuk wor in two days.

00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:41.726
Our goods are of top-shelf
quality this time.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.082
We must break them apart before

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:45.456
they establish a bond.

00:32:46.042 --> 00:32:47.748
I am handing this case to you.

00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:49.285
Go back and study it.

00:32:50.042 --> 00:32:51.362
Chairman of eastern trade company

00:32:51.458 --> 00:32:52.743
lower.

00:32:52.792 --> 00:32:53.531
That's right.

00:32:53.583 --> 00:32:54.743
- Here.
- How about now?

00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:55.538
Ok.

00:32:55.583 --> 00:32:56.618
- Good.
- Yes.

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:57.667
Perfect.

00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:01.573
I have faith in you.

00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:02.625
make yourself useful.

00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:05.204
2 more years. you could
be a superintendent.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.662
We will surroud the child
with lots of love.

00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:10.040
Our child will grow up big and strong.

00:33:10.083 --> 00:33:12.074
However. we woud have to redecorate after

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:13.581
having a child.

00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:15.782
Do you want a boy or a girl first?

00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:19.369
That's the way it is. The higher you rise.

00:33:19.417 --> 00:33:20.748
the more on your shoulder.

00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:21.913
You gotta get used to that.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.287
To live in fear from dusk to dawn.

00:33:38.542 --> 00:33:40.498
not even a chance of getting a good sleep.

00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:42.369
Be it worrying about getting busted or

00:33:43.042 --> 00:33:44.703
simply to be killed.

00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:48.490
I just want a simple life.

00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:02.289
Dance like everyone.

00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:04.874
communting like everyone.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.831
A game at the court.

00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:09.073
A simple family.

00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:12.165
Go on vacations with the kids occasionally.

00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:24.538
Bro!

00:34:25.458 --> 00:34:26.851
- What are you doing?
- It's not your concern.

00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:28.240
Stay out of it!

00:34:29.042 --> 00:34:29.747
Brother ting.

00:34:29.792 --> 00:34:30.998

- I am calling the poilce.
- Don't.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.500
He is not a foe.

00:34:35.542 --> 00:34:37.032
Excuse us. brother ting.

00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.454

I'm sorry. ting.

00:34:52.083 --> 00:34:53.414
I hope we didn't scare you.

00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:55.578
I'm alright. Just a bit carsick.

00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:57.118
Let me do the introduction.

00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:58.698
My man. chicken.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.160
One of Shawn's. chilli.

00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:02.164
He is joss's right-hand man. ting.

00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:04.494
Brother hei thinks highly of this deal.

00:35:04.792 --> 00:35:06.953
In order to keep the cat in the bag.

00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:08.685
just bear with this for the time being.

00:35:09.792 --> 00:35:12.374
Please hand over

00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:13.865
all your communication devices.

00:35:39.417 --> 00:35:41.908
I was shot at a turf war a few years back.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.206
it shattered my shinbone.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.650
I was in the hospital for 3 months.

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.309
had to put in a few steel discs.

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:48.413
I could never pass customs
without getting pat-downs.

00:36:01.542 --> 00:36:02.702
No movements for 5 hours.

00:36:04.292 --> 00:36:05.828
It must be the meeting place.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.080
"Police headquarters meeting room
7:45am"

00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:09.934
officer lau from the criminal intelligence
bureau received reliable intel

00:36:09.958 --> 00:36:12.476
saying that fuk wor and eastern trade
have already started cooperating.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.036
Officer lau. If you could. please.

00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:15.823
According to my informer.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.411
fuk wor members in charge are

00:36:18.542 --> 00:36:20.999
currently in a building in sai ying pun.

00:36:21.208 --> 00:36:22.328
Ready for action any second.

00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:24.119
Should we take action immediately?

00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.330
No.

00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:26.706
We don't know their

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:27.990
dealing point just yet.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.364
This operation is

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.286
a strike on fuk wor and eastern trade.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.240
We can only arrest them on location

00:36:33.292 --> 00:36:34.623
when they deal.

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:36.999
They are keeping a very
low profile this time.

00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:38.698
I will inform you

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:39.910
when there is progress.

00:36:40.042 --> 00:36:41.248
This operation will be

00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:43.248
led by chief inspector tuen.

00:36:43.667 --> 00:36:44.747
Follow his commands.

00:36:44.792 --> 00:36:45.952
Thank you. officer Lee.

00:36:46.125 --> 00:36:47.831
I want everyone to standby

00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:48.739
at the headquarters today.

00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:50.248
Yes. sir.

00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:08.833
"The word is out. get..."

00:37:36.792 --> 00:37:38.248
Not picking up...

00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:58.666
"An apartment in sai ying pun
11:59pm"

00:37:58.708 --> 00:37:59.322
how is it?

00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:00.285
Is the location confirmed?

00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:01.375
It's done. sir.

00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.953
It's on the second floor. room 203.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.911
but we couldn't get the
visuals on the inside.

00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:20.042
Officer la...

00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:20.826
What is it?

00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:22.411
East brought 3 people in just now.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:23.660
Inform officer Lee to

00:38:23.708 --> 00:38:24.708
get ready.

00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:38.373
Give it to them.

00:38:43.458 --> 00:38:45.915
Retro. I like it.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.786
You will be using it later.

00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:49.164
This phone

00:38:49.292 --> 00:38:52.204
doesn't support 4g.
Wi-Fi. GPS or Bluetooth.

00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:55.119
The cops will not be able to track it.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.992
And. we gave them a little operation.

00:38:58.292 --> 00:39:00.499
No calling. works more
like a walkie-talkie.

00:39:03.417 --> 00:39:05.123
We are dealing at tsing lung tau pier.

00:39:05.417 --> 00:39:07.624
Take off all your clothes.

00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:08.952
Get changed.

00:39:12.833 --> 00:39:13.913
Take your pick.

00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:18.914
Everyone follow me and

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:20.365
do as I say.

00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:22.494
Get in the designated cars.

00:39:33.125 --> 00:39:34.125

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.411
You two. the first white car.

00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:56.868
Officer lau. This is a lot of cars.

00:39:56.917 --> 00:39:58.077
Which one are we tailing?

00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:59.830
We don't.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Yes. sir.

00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:13.874
There are $30 million in the case.

00:40:13.917 --> 00:40:15.623
Keep your eyes open.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.010
- Got it. brother hei.

00:40:41.583 --> 00:40:42.698

Van died because of this thing.

00:40:44.833 --> 00:40:45.743
You want me dead too?

00:40:45.792 --> 00:40:47.592
No one will know if you
put it in your shoes.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.331
I don't use chapsticks.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.206
It's invisible ink.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:57.456
With uv light.

00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.161
I could see the message you leave behind.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.706
Tell headquarters

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:04.809

"Ll have got the location.

00:41:33.042 --> 00:41:33.656
Officer tuen.

00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:34.743
We're ready.

00:41:34.875 --> 00:41:36.081
Shall we go now?

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:44.989

00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:47.083
Yes. sir.

00:41:57.167 --> 00:42:00.159
"Tsing lung tau pier 00:40am"

00:42:04.833 --> 00:42:06.198
what are you doing?

00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:07.952
No. chilli.

00:42:08.208 --> 00:42:10.073
There's no way we have $30 million in here.

00:42:10.125 --> 00:42:11.309
Have you seen $30 million dollars before?

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:12.933
Do you know how much $30 million weighs?

00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:14.434
I haven't seen $30 million in cash.

00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:16.198
but I have seen $300k.

00:42:16.292 --> 00:42:18.123
$300k is about the weight of a mango.

00:42:18.167 --> 00:42:20.087
We certainly don't have a
thousand mangoes here.

00:42:20.125 --> 00:42:21.831
Did you flunk maths?

00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.457
$30 million is $300k times a hundred.

00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:25.660
Is it?

00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:27.619
We still don't have a hundred here. right?

00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:28.907
You try it.

00:42:32.083 --> 00:42:34.950
Mr. sung changed the deal point
to ap lei chau boat shed.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.739
Get there now.

00:42:35.875 --> 00:42:36.990
Copy that. Let's go.

00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:40.706
I'm getting something to drink.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.910
You just had one.

00:42:41.958 --> 00:42:43.573
Another one already?

00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:46.119
Ap lei chau

00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:47.532
is far!

00:42:47.708 --> 00:42:49.494
You are a pain in the ass.

00:42:51.917 --> 00:42:52.917
He is a civic

00:42:52.958 --> 00:42:54.118
gangster.

00:42:54.167 --> 00:42:56.453
Who says we are not civic just
because we are in the gang.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.161
You're right...

00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:00.393
Why are we carrying $30 million around?

00:43:00.417 --> 00:43:01.873
It's heavy. bro.

00:43:01.917 --> 00:43:02.934
Of course we are taking it with us!

00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:04.684
Do you think leaving it
in the car is a better idea?

00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:06.699
Are you done? Let's get going!

00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:08.292
What's the rush?

00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:09.823
Is your mum in labour?

00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:11.331
You go first!

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.163
"Let's call it off tonight."

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.832
Ap lei chau pier.

00:44:00.042 --> 00:44:01.268
Officer lau just informed us that

00:44:01.292 --> 00:44:03.452
the dealing point has been changed
to ap lei chau pier.

00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:14.287
"Ap lei chau pier 01:20am"

00:44:35.208 --> 00:44:36.243
This should be it.

00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:44.323
Brother ting from fuk wor?

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.615
This way.

00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:01.698
We are Hong Kong police.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.161
We are suspecting a drug deal here.

00:45:04.208 --> 00:45:06.244
Everyone on the boat. put your hands up or

00:45:06.417 --> 00:45:07.748
we will take action.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.161
Everyone on the boat. put your hands up or

00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:11.789
we will take action.

00:45:15.417 --> 00:45:16.748
Freeze!

00:45:17.792 --> 00:45:18.827
How about the money?

00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:19.830
Forget it! Worry about yourself!

00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:21.285
- Jump!
- I am afraid of the water.

00:45:40.042 --> 00:45:41.748
This is a good spot.

00:45:41.875 --> 00:45:42.934
We could hide out here for an hour or two.

00:45:42.958 --> 00:45:44.478
then we can go after the cops are out.

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:45.708
2 hours?

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.911
You know what.
I would be exhausted to death by then!

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.559
This is a deal worthing
tens of millions of dollars.

00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:52.494
They are not leaving without an arrest.

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:53.823
We'd better

00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:55.490
get out of here

00:45:55.542 --> 00:45:56.702
before they are here.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:57.989
You have a point. Let's go.

00:45:58.083 --> 00:45:59.083
Come on.

00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:18.664
Police! Stay right where you are.

00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:19.823
Put your hands up.

00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:22.118
Jump on three.

00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:23.828
- Again?
- One. two...

00:46:24.625 --> 00:46:25.831
You bastards!

00:46:39.708 --> 00:46:42.495
"Central 02:00am"

00:46:53.958 --> 00:46:55.243
Brother hei. The goods are fine.

00:47:09.292 --> 00:47:10.612
Pleasure doing business with you.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.500
Brother hei.

00:47:12.625 --> 00:47:14.081
You put on

00:47:14.375 --> 00:47:15.740
quite a show.

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:19.616
The older. the wiser.

00:47:20.417 --> 00:47:21.873
Better safe than sorry.

00:47:21.917 --> 00:47:23.077
Things are tense

00:47:23.542 --> 00:47:25.078
these days.

00:47:25.458 --> 00:47:26.573
I'm sorry

00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:28.282
for your loss.

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.413
Don't be silly.

00:47:29.458 --> 00:47:31.744
A few hundred thousand
dollars for a traitor.

00:47:31.792 --> 00:47:32.907
Not a loss.

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:34.748
- East.
- Yes.

00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:35.792
Find out

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.115
who's the rat among those two.

00:47:38.167 --> 00:47:39.202
Got it.

00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:57.500
Officer tuen. We found a great
amount of cash and cocaine.

00:47:57.792 --> 00:47:58.656
Bring it back to the station.

00:47:58.708 --> 00:48:00.244
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes. sir.

00:48:17.625 --> 00:48:19.365
How is it? Are you ok?

00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:20.868
I'm fine.

00:48:23.583 --> 00:48:24.743
What happened?

00:48:25.417 --> 00:48:26.702
We got busted.

00:48:27.125 --> 00:48:28.456
The cops came out of nowhere.

00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:31.914
Luckily they had a loose aim.

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.248
Else. I would be dead.

00:48:38.292 --> 00:48:39.407
Boss.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.241
would brother hei think I am the rat?

00:48:43.458 --> 00:48:44.573
Don't worry.

00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:46.038
You almost died.

00:48:46.708 --> 00:48:48.039
he would believe in you.

00:48:49.917 --> 00:48:51.248
Clean your wound.

00:48:51.958 --> 00:48:52.958
Eat

00:48:53.125 --> 00:48:54.331
and take a rest.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:49.290
"Out of town. putting the business on halt.
talk when I am back."

00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:15.868
Thank you. Mr. sung.

00:50:15.958 --> 00:50:17.073
I will do my best.

00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:18.447
Mr. sung.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.309
I wouldn't be where I am today without you.
Thank you.

00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:21.448
We are graduates.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.161
What would you like me to
do for you after this?

00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:26.308
I want you to get into the police force.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Thank you. sir.

00:50:30.083 --> 00:50:32.039
"Luen hing drug deal. 11 pm.

00:50:37.833 --> 00:50:39.619
"The game is on."

00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:41.495
"Let's call it off tonight."

00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:45.241
Van died for justice.

00:50:48.042 --> 00:50:49.373
Will you marry me?

00:50:49.792 --> 00:50:51.953
Say yes...

00:50:52.542 --> 00:50:55.454
Fan. you are a chief inspector

00:50:56.875 --> 00:50:58.160
I'll do my best. sir.

00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:10.455
Boss.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.500
this is it.

00:51:11.625 --> 00:51:13.661
We were waiting here that day.

00:51:13.708 --> 00:51:15.494
and set off when we got the message.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.450
Do you know what that guy did?

00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:19.365
He put trash in the bin.

00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:21.198
keeping it civic on the streets.

00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:22.618
That's not all.

00:51:22.708 --> 00:51:24.323
He got another drink

00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:26.744
right when he just finished one off.

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:28.373
Didn't you said he injured his finger?

00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:29.743
He was bleeding and all.

00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:33.875
What is this. boss?

00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:49.782
Ap lei chau pier

00:51:59.833 --> 00:52:00.913
Hello.

00:52:03.042 --> 00:52:03.997
Brother hei has a proposition.

00:52:04.042 --> 00:52:05.122
We will have two deals.

00:52:05.167 --> 00:52:07.203
A fake one and a legit one.

00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:09.032
The cops set up a new unit

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.115
just for busting us.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.491
A new chief inspector will be in charge.

00:52:27.625 --> 00:52:28.705
What is this?

00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:30.664
Which one of us is fleeing?

00:52:30.917 --> 00:52:32.498
No one.

00:52:32.958 --> 00:52:34.494
The deal was busted.

00:52:34.542 --> 00:52:36.328
It was quite a loss for brother hei.

00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:37.948
We are paying him early

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.035
this month.

00:52:39.083 --> 00:52:40.083
It should please him.

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.490
You do know your way around people. boss!

00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:45.874
That's why you are the boss and I am not!

00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:48.705
Let's go.

00:53:32.417 --> 00:53:33.657
Fan.

00:53:35.208 --> 00:53:36.208
Fan.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.286
He said he would be back early.

00:53:53.417 --> 00:53:54.657
Fan.

00:53:54.958 --> 00:53:57.199
- Hey.
- Didn't you say you would be home early?

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.970
Aren't you supposed to be able
to leave earlier after your promotion?

00:54:00.083 --> 00:54:01.789
How is that possible. honey?

00:54:01.833 --> 00:54:04.950
The more capable you are.
the more responsibility you have. Isn't it?

00:54:05.583 --> 00:54:06.447
Alright.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.740
Hurry up.

00:54:07.792 --> 00:54:09.498
I can't do all this by myself.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.455
Alright. I am almost there.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.740
Just a little bit of traffic.

00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:14.623
I will see you soon. Take care.

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:15.580
Alright.

00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:16.823
Who's behind you?

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.250
Who?

00:54:19.708 --> 00:54:20.948
Yeung!

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.500
What is happening?

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.498
What is happening? Who is it?

00:54:26.083 --> 00:54:27.083
What is happening?

00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:35.664
Yeung!

00:54:36.792 --> 00:54:37.998
Yeung!

00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:44.618

00:55:02.583 --> 00:55:03.447
Yeung!

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.832
No!

00:56:30.417 --> 00:56:31.577
Come in.

00:56:39.042 --> 00:56:40.532
The weapon was found in

00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:42.824
a transfer station 700 meters
from the crime scene.

00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:44.268
The identification bureau confirmed

00:56:44.292 --> 00:56:46.434
the finger prints belong
to someone called ting cheuk fei.

00:56:46.458 --> 00:56:47.898
He is a member of the fuk wor triad.

00:56:47.958 --> 00:56:49.698
According to our informer.

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.115
ting cheuk fei was seen

00:56:51.167 --> 00:56:52.577

00:56:52.667 --> 00:56:53.827
Ting.

00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:57.081
Ting cheuk fei.

00:57:08.417 --> 00:57:09.953
Hey man. do you have a phone?

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.364
Hello.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.365
Officer lau. I am in trouble.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.285
You know you are in trouble?

00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:21.573
Why were you ghosting?

00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:22.768
An inspector from the
ministry of home affairs

00:57:22.792 --> 00:57:24.407
was killed last night.

00:57:24.708 --> 00:57:26.468
Your finger prints were
found on the weapon.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.741
Surveillance got a suspect
looking just like you.

00:57:28.875 --> 00:57:29.785
There is also an informer saying

00:57:29.833 --> 00:57:31.869
you were there near the crime scene.

00:57:31.917 --> 00:57:33.873
I was knocked out by a taser last night.

00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:35.573
I was framed.

00:57:35.625 --> 00:57:36.865
Lay low for a while.

00:57:36.917 --> 00:57:38.717
You are only safe when
the murderer is found.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:42.910
Hey.

00:57:42.958 --> 00:57:44.573
do you guys have cams in this car park?

00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:46.581
We don't have that in old ones like this.

00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:48.665
We only got one at the entrance
and one at the exit.

00:57:51.667 --> 00:57:52.782
Joss.

00:57:53.667 --> 00:57:55.203
Ting is one of yours.

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.080
What do you think?

00:57:56.125 --> 00:57:57.125
He was framed.

00:57:57.167 --> 00:57:59.499
There's no reason for ting to kill a cop.

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:01.706
Does he has a lot of enemies?

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.956
Who would want to set him up?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.035
There must be one or two.

00:58:04.125 --> 00:58:05.331
Could be for money.

00:58:05.375 --> 00:58:06.330
That last deal was

00:58:06.375 --> 00:58:08.161
quite a loss.

00:58:08.208 --> 00:58:09.789
So I asked ting to

00:58:10.042 --> 00:58:11.482
get you the money earlier last night

00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:12.489
as a compensation.

00:58:12.542 --> 00:58:13.542
Was it a lot?

00:58:14.125 --> 00:58:15.125
$5 million.

00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:16.955
$5 million.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.615
I would run away with it if it was me!

00:58:18.708 --> 00:58:20.101
He has worked with me for a long time.
I believe in him.

00:58:20.125 --> 00:58:21.205
Sorry.

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.581
I was joking.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.080
Ok.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.990
Brother hei. Give me some time.

00:58:27.083 --> 00:58:28.539
Is 3 days enough?

00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:30.573
I will be waiting.

00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:32.375
I understand.

00:58:33.833 --> 00:58:34.833
Hello.

00:58:35.167 --> 00:58:36.247
Got it.

00:58:36.958 --> 00:58:37.958
Brother hei.

00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:39.490
We have cops outside.

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:42.657
I'll see what it is.

00:58:49.875 --> 00:58:51.740
Police! Sit down!

00:58:51.792 --> 00:58:53.532
Sit!

00:58:54.083 --> 00:58:55.118
Hey!

00:58:55.708 --> 00:58:56.708
Hey!

00:58:56.792 --> 00:58:57.952
What is it?

00:58:58.292 --> 00:58:59.907
- Hey!
- Chan yau hei.

00:59:00.167 --> 00:59:01.768
Your member ting is in suspected connection
with the murder of a police officer.

00:59:01.792 --> 00:59:03.282
Please hand him over.

00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:04.243
Officer.

00:59:04.292 --> 00:59:05.623
Don't you know the laws?

00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:06.998
This is a private property!

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:08.285
Do you have a warrant?

00:59:08.333 --> 00:59:09.518
It's none of your business! Piss off!

00:59:09.542 --> 00:59:10.327
How is it not my business?

00:59:10.375 --> 00:59:12.055
- Are you asking for trouble?
- What is it?

00:59:13.292 --> 00:59:14.684
Brother hei has nothing to do with it.

00:59:14.708 --> 00:59:16.244
Ting is my man. I will go with you.

00:59:23.333 --> 00:59:24.448
Let's go!

00:59:44.667 --> 00:59:46.059
Are we really putting up drawings here?

00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:46.947
Of course.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.332
It looks so much better with drawings.

00:59:49.917 --> 00:59:52.499
I didn't know you can't draw!

00:59:52.542 --> 00:59:54.062
I know how to take care of you though.

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.081
Do you want a boy or a girl first?

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:01.456
Who is behind you?

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.490
Who?

01:00:06.042 --> 01:00:07.042
Yeung!

01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:11.448
What is it?

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:13.865
Yeung!

01:00:18.917 --> 01:00:20.703
You are the frog.

01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:52.032
Officer lam sin yeung was stabbed twice.

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:53.698
right in the liver.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.476
That caused heavy bleeding
and hence her death.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.741
The incisions were very accurate.

01:00:57.792 --> 01:00:59.407
The body was not dragged at all.

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:01.018
so there are no fissures on the wounds.

01:01:01.167 --> 01:01:02.809
It is evidential that.
the murderer was very determined.

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.369
Clean and neat.

01:01:04.417 --> 01:01:06.624
Lam sin yeung fired two
rounds to fight back.

01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:08.627
but only one bullet was
found in the crime scene.

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:11.513
Therefore. it is very likely
that the murderer was shot and wounded.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:12.907
That's all from forensics.

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:14.240
Listen up.

01:01:14.292 --> 01:01:15.532
Team a. team c.

01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:17.244
Go and ask every hosiptal.

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:18.573
your informers.

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:19.707
even black market doctors.

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:21.351
see if they have treated
any bullet wound cases or

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:23.331
any suspected bullet wound cases.

01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:26.283
Other teams and patrol officers.

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:28.369
check every pharmacy.

01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:30.328
see if any suspicious persons

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:33.037
have bought anti-inflammatory
drugs. hemostatics

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.698
or surgical supplies in bulk.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:35.910
Ok.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.476
Why I didn't know about this meeting?

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.364
Calm down.

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:40.577
You are on leave. aren't you?

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:42.365
- Why aren't you resting?
- Rest?

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.908
How can I rest when the
murderer is still out there?

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:47.823
Are you disobeying me?

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:48.947
Look at you.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.226
Your condition and psyche now is

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:52.010
not how it should be as
the chief inspector.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.286
Don't forget we are police.

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:55.733
No matter how difficult the case is

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:57.198
or how mixed your feelings are.

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:59.369
We must remain extremly calm.

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:00.532
As the chief inspector.

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.643
how can you lead your colleagues

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:03.498
when you have lost your chill.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:06.285
Fan.

01:02:06.333 --> 01:02:07.693
I understand what you are feeling.

01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:11.324
We will do yeung justice.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:12.830
Ok?

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.282
Ting! What are you doing?

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.698
Can I stay at your place?

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:45.573
Should I take off my shoes?

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:48.667
Here.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:52.332
You scared me to death just now.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.116
It looks like it hasn't
been worn for a while.

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.539
He is on a business trip.

01:03:03.917 --> 01:03:05.077
Look away!

01:03:06.667 --> 01:03:08.032
My place is a mess.

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:10.498
The restroom is over there.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:14.910
Excuse me.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.910
Excuse me.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.036
I haven't had people clean this place up
for a long time.

01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:36.244
I didn't expect you to come over.

01:03:38.583 --> 01:03:39.868
I'll clean things up.

01:03:41.792 --> 01:03:43.202
You can sleep on the bed later.

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:56.333
Alright.

01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:04.872
Ting.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:24.750
East.

01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:25.998
You were right.

01:04:26.458 --> 01:04:27.994
Fan does want to betray me.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.206
He is climbing higher and
higher in the force.

01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:32.285
getting married and buying a house.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.914
He is at the peak of his life.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.101
Why would he want to
continue to go undercover

01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:37.740
when he is living the good life.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.789
Mr. sung.

01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:41.828
Your plan is magnificent.

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:44.999
It is getting rid of ting. the cop rat and

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:46.789
messing up fuk wor from the inside.

01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:49.289
At the same time. I am
gaining power myself.

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:50.625
Perfect.

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:53.914
What's the most perfect is

01:04:54.167 --> 01:04:56.408
I get to punish our traitor. fan.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:01.700
What was your double major. east?

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:04.203
Criminology and accounting.

01:05:04.583 --> 01:05:05.823
Thanks to you. Mr. sung.

01:05:05.917 --> 01:05:07.282
You paid for my tuition.

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:09.578
so that I could study criminology

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:10.865
in the United Kingdom and

01:05:10.917 --> 01:05:13.875
busted ting.

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:15.990
My investment in you paid off.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.331
Fan...

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.664
This time...

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:24.494
Was killing fan's wife
a little out of line?

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:36.416
With your position in fuk wor now.
I shouldn't say more.

01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:39.123
Keep it up. east.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:40.785
In a few years.

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:42.664
fuk wor will be ours.

01:05:46.625 --> 01:05:47.660
Right.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:49.448
Have you told brother hei that

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:50.831
ting is an undercover cop?

01:05:51.167 --> 01:05:52.782
He might not even believe entirely that

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:54.073
ting killed the cop.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.831
We better save it and

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:56.917
tell that to him later.

01:06:05.167 --> 01:06:06.907
It has to be a hitman.

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:09.830
I agree.

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.285
Hooligans like yourself

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:13.244
will only be flipping machetes around.

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:14.782
Such precision is impossible.

01:06:15.333 --> 01:06:17.324
I am almost at the end of the rope

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:18.911
and you are still joking around!

01:06:19.292 --> 01:06:20.292
Hey.

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.369
Who do you think is setting you up?

01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:24.624
I think it should be someone in fuk wor.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:26.123
We must find the killer to

01:06:26.167 --> 01:06:28.078
know who is behind it.

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:30.078
Alright. Let's split.

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:31.331
You find the killer

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:33.535
and I will dig on the background of fan
and the victim.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:35.285
How about we switch.

01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:36.413
You go look for the killer.

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:39.325
You go sit in the office then.

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:42.163
One day I will.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:44.948
That's durian. Eat.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.122
It's expensive.

01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:48.208
Eat up.

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:52.573
Hurry. There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:06:52.917 --> 01:06:54.578
Don't you know why you are called nasty?

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:55.785
Uncle ting.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.365
Because I am quiet.

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:59.937
I keep my mouth shut all the time.
that's why my breathe smells.

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.203
You don't keep your mouth shut.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.615
You do have bad breathe.

01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:05.434
You don't trust me. but you should
at least trust your daughter.

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:06.038
Am I right. momo?

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:07.990
Yes. You never go to see the dentist.

01:07:08.042 --> 01:07:09.143
That's why you have periodontitis and

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:10.828
bad breathe.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:13.207
How about uncle ting finish up work and

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.241
take your dad to the dentist?

01:07:15.542 --> 01:07:16.782
Great.

01:07:18.708 --> 01:07:19.708
Enjoy you food.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.915
We have information that someone

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.117
had his bullet wound treated by the doctor
from hunan in Yung shue tau.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.785
Take your daughter home first.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.706
Uncle ting. my birthday is in a few days.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.831
Is it?

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:40.476
Then uncle ting is going to
bring a present and

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.582
celebrate with you in a few days.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:44.828
Alright. Thank you. uncle ting!

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.226
Daddy is buying your birthday gift.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.934
Don't go around asking for presents.
Where are your manners?

01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:49.823
She's a kid.

01:07:59.167 --> 01:08:01.203
Who you are looking for is in mong kok.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.581
See it for yourself.

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:17.702
What is it?

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.726
I just looked at the analysis report
from the identification bureau.

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.976
the deal between fuk wor
and eastern trade was probably a set up.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
A set up?

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.703
We ran some tests.

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:26.184
the 15 kilograms of cocaine we uncovered.

01:08:26.208 --> 01:08:28.164
turns out to be bad grade c stuff.

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:30.222
Worth no more than half a million dollars.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.660
There were a lot of fake notes

01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:32.948
in the $30 million cash.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.285
The real ones

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.410
only amount to

01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:36.601
about half a million dollars.

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:37.660
Also.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.410
you should be careful of fan.

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:41.559
I think there's something off about him.

01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:43.018
You think he killed his own wife and

01:08:43.042 --> 01:08:43.997
planted it on me?

01:08:44.042 --> 01:08:44.906
No.

01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:46.664
I think someone wants him dead or

01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:47.948
to give him a lesson.

01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:49.619
You are only a sacrifice.

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:33.948
Move away.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:07.698
Police! Freeze!

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:09.581
Police! Freeze!

01:11:44.917 --> 01:11:46.032
The one who just ran off

01:11:46.125 --> 01:11:47.331
is your wife's murderer.

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.434
If it wasn't you. I would
have gotten him already.

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:50.618
That's impossible.

01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:52.578
I am sure you killed my wife.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:53.956
If it was me.

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:56.324
I would pull the trigger right now.

01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:38.827
Stop!

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.413
Move!

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.573
Brother hei.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.456
What the heck are you doing?

01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:46.663
Boss.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.707
Joss got his brain fried or something.

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:51.323
He is saying I framed ting

01:12:51.375 --> 01:12:53.161
on the killing of the cop.

01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:54.493
I don't have time for that!

01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:56.624
He said ting is an undercover cop.

01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:58.282
He is the most suspicious one.

01:12:58.333 --> 01:12:59.726
What would you do
if I say chilli is an undercover cop?

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.036
- If you have proof...
- Shut up!

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:04.873
East is on it.

01:13:04.917 --> 01:13:06.748
Do what east says

01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:08.157
when you are ready to work!

01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:10.160
You are not serious. boss.

01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:11.789
Listen to him?

01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:13.873
He went to school for a couple of years and

01:13:13.917 --> 01:13:15.637
you are handing the whole gang over to him?

01:13:15.667 --> 01:13:16.577
Are you serious?

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.831
Should I start recruiting

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:19.684
at Hong Kong university
and Chinese university now?

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:20.868
Do as I said.

01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:29.619
Do whatever you like!

01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:35.081
I got you food.

01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:36.331
Come eat.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:41.205
What is it?

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.536
It's your favourite wonton noodle soup and

01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:44.914
steamed vermicelli roll.

01:13:46.042 --> 01:13:48.328
I don't want wonton noodle soup now.

01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:49.663
I want

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:51.494
grass jelly from the b house in yuen long.

01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:55.248
Do I work for you?

01:13:55.292 --> 01:13:56.748
So hard to please.

01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:59.829
I brought you these all the way here.

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:01.532
Stop talking.

01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:03.244
Just eat whatever I give you.

01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:11.164
Hello. What is it?

01:14:12.917 --> 01:14:14.908
Ok. Come pick me up now.

01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:21.081
I'm gonna go take care of something.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.498
Be careful.

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.372
Hello. momo.

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:33.449
Daddy is working. go cut your cake.

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:36.491
Yes. Daddy will be home right after work.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:37.788
For real.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:39.035
- Bye bye.
- How is it?

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:40.476
Brother ting. I have been
looking for a long time.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.615
He is over there.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.289
Who told you to kill that cop?

01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.119
Do you think I won't kill you?

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:27.873
Nasty! Come tie him up for me!

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:29.285
Nasty!

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:57.742
"No caller ID"

01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:05.539
Hello.

01:16:37.625 --> 01:16:39.345
Why didn't you hand him over to the police?

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:42.581
Because this case is not

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:44.161
that simple.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.250
You.

01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:48.532
Speak for yourself.

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.456
It was east.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.615
East told me to wear ting's jacket and

01:16:56.292 --> 01:16:57.407
kill the cop.

01:16:58.292 --> 01:17:00.212
And then plant ting's
fingerprints on the knife.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.739
Say it.

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:13.783
Why did you do it?

01:17:14.292 --> 01:17:15.532
Take it easy.

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:17.414
Don't you want to know who is behind this?

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:20.582
Why would east send someone to kill a cop?

01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:22.289
Even if it's brother hei's order.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:23.914
it shouldn't be your wife.

01:17:24.792 --> 01:17:26.453
So you must keep digging.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:32.785
I found your killer.

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.323
It's your turn to help me.

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:53.664
"Eastern trade company"

01:18:10.042 --> 01:18:11.953
Sung jing kwong!

01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:19.614
Brother hei.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.660
Why did you bring the cop here.

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.581
Let ting explain.

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.205
Brother hei.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.581
I was framed.

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:30.411
Someone wants to mess with fuk wor.

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:33.083
Say it.

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.039
Who told you to kill the cop?

01:18:35.083 --> 01:18:36.083
East.

01:18:38.292 --> 01:18:39.532
What are you playing at?

01:18:41.042 --> 01:18:42.782
Bringing this nobody here to do me dirty!

01:18:43.042 --> 01:18:44.407
What if we have proof?

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.990
What proof?

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:51.167
Boss.

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:55.823
Ting is telling the truth.

01:18:56.417 --> 01:18:57.998
We found $5 million

01:18:58.458 --> 01:19:00.244
in this asshole's house.

01:19:00.292 --> 01:19:01.122
This is the money

01:19:01.167 --> 01:19:02.953
I told ting to give you the other day.

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:06.999
I knew something is up with you. east!

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.157
Bastard!

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:09.208
You.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:10.989
You.

01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:12.407
You are ganging up against me.

01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:13.823
You are setting me up!

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.205
Brother hei.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.090
About our deal with the
eastern trade company.

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:19.829
ting is the mole sent by the cops.

01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:21.115
You are saying I am the mole.

01:19:21.792 --> 01:19:22.531
If I am the mole.

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:24.539
why haven't you told brother hei already?

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:25.618
Because east

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.184
is sent by a certain sung
from the eastern trade company

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:29.039
to mess fuk wor up.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:30.035
Brother hei.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:30.868
No!

01:19:30.917 --> 01:19:32.373
The cop is framing me!

01:19:32.417 --> 01:19:33.452
They are framing me!

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.660
You bastard.

01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:37.157
Pig.

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:38.539
Rat.

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:39.948
You want to mess with us and

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.119
get the eastern trade company to dominate?

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.333
I'll kill you.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.662
Brother hei!

01:19:49.042 --> 01:19:50.782
Brother hei!

01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:51.948
That's not it!

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.410
Son of a bitch!

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.322
Traitor!

01:20:00.583 --> 01:20:01.743
Traitor!

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:38.831
You shouldn't go alone.

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:40.115
You are a cop.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.956
If that's the case.

01:20:44.083 --> 01:20:45.289
you shouldn't be going too.

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.741
Officer lau. Fan is avenging on his own.

01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:10.077
Sung jing kwong!

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.365
Why did you kill my wife?

01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:18.289
I think this is the first time

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:19.664
you call me by my full name.

01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.244
I am asking you! Answer me!

01:23:22.667 --> 01:23:23.667
Bastard.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.786
Do you really think you are a cop?

01:23:26.833 --> 01:23:28.073
I am!

01:23:30.708 --> 01:23:32.118
All these years.

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.248
I got everything done for you!

01:23:34.292 --> 01:23:35.532
Look how you are treating me!

01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:37.039
Remember. You didn't help me.

01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:38.323
I helped you.

01:23:38.417 --> 01:23:40.408
If 1 didn't give you all those intel.

01:23:40.458 --> 01:23:41.559
you wouldn't have arrested so many people.

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:43.995
I only wanted a future. I wanted happiness.

01:23:44.208 --> 01:23:46.540
Why did you kill my wife?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.707
What do I look for in my men?

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:52.990
It's loyalty!

01:23:53.292 --> 01:23:54.953
And they must cut all human ties!

01:23:58.208 --> 01:24:00.199
You bastard is inhuman!

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:02.448
I am not a man.

01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:04.369
I am the god.

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:32.698
I couldn't get rid of you last time.

01:24:32.917 --> 01:24:34.248
You got lucky.

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:35.865
Undercover. right?

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:37.453
I am giving you a ride to hell.

01:24:45.542 --> 01:24:46.542
Don't shoot.

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:48.515
Arresting and killing are very different.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.868
You are a policeman.

01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:01.243
