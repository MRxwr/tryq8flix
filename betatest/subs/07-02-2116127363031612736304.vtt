00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.606
ah ah ah

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:44.889

00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:55.557
ah ah ah...

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.910
Hello. teacher.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.400
Thank you for your training. teacher!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.800
I can take the elixir and become the immortal!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.240
Is there anyone in our generation
who will get the "White Elixir"?

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.660
What's Thirteen doing here?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.520
I'm also confused.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.630
-You found it on the ground. right?
-He was found on the ground as well.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.030
Yeah.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.390
Are you kidding?

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.520
Be off!

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.770
Have you finished transcribing
the "Handbook of Claman"?

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.320
Have you cleaned the academy?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.700
Are you qualified to be here?

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.350
Gathering the spirits of human.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.920
nurtured by energies of sun and moon.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.220
this quintessential elixir...

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.990
can transform foxes into immortals.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.790
The "Elixirs of Soul" were planted
into bodies of "clamen" since hundreds of years ago.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.640
which was cultivated by
the spirits of these humans.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.620
They can only be harvested at the right time.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.340
The acquisition of elixirs...

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.020
has long been the most significant
test for the juniors of our foxes.

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:27.120
The quality of the elixir...

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.710
can represent your power.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.830
You...

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.520
How did you get this elixir?

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.520
I disguised as this claman's wife...

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.770
and pretended to be seriously ill.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.400
So he willingly gave me his elixir.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.670
Moving towards the Extreme Emptiness.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.430
Being faithful to the spirits.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.690
The spirit of one thing...

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.530
can be the spirit of everything.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.310
Witnessing the operation of all things.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.050
I am observing their essences.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.330
All the students got the "Black Elixir".

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.430
Azi is the best student who took the elixir...

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.470
and became a fox spirit with five tails.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.170
The claman volunteered to give her the elixir.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.070
which shows that she was good at deceiving.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.230
On the 15th day of next month.
the Night of Purple Moon.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.840
the "White Elixir of the Soul" that
occurs only once in a thousand years...

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.740
will be acquired by our foxes.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.050
Students of this year. come to
the stage for the lots of clamen.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.030
The White Elixir is rare for thousands of years.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.840
If you can let the claman
donate the elixir voluntarily.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.790
you will become the first-class
fox spirit with nine tails...

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.770
and the supreme among foxes.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.090
What's the matter?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.140
There is one more lot in the furnace.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.850
Who hasn't come to the stage yet?

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.560
Nobody.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.240
The formal students are all here.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.890
Me!

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.400
Me! Me!

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.120
What are you doing?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.140
Aren't you missing one student here?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.870
If that lot doesn't belong to you.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.210
you can't get it...

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.640
even if the furnace opens.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.490
Give me a chance!

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.660
I got a lot.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.260
You can go find your claman...

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.690
according to the notes on the lot.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.590
Why haven't I got a lot?

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.320
I got one.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.700
I got a lot too.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.640
I got a lot.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.470
I got a lot.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.340
Why are you so proud?
You only got an incomplete lot.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.150
Incomplete...

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.840
What are they?

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.020
A pair of ears?

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.670
Can I take another draw?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.160
Thirteen.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.900
you only got an incomplete lot.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.070
There's a good chance that you'll fail.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.820
Anyway. I won't die.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.380
That's possible too.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.470
Even if you would survive.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.670
It'll take another 500 years...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.810
if you had wasted this opportunity.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.800
Anyway. it's an opportunity.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.830
Do you know why you are the only half-bred fox...

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.760
in our tribe of red foxes?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.290
It's because...

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.830
you have an impressive pedigree.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.900
You were originally an immortal fox...

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.780
on the Spiritual Mountain from the
Territory of Departure and Hatred in the West.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.780
You were exiled to the mundane
world to go through your difficulties.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.570
but you are destined to become
a first-class immortal fox...

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.950
and return to Heaven.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.660
I found you by the roadside.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.320
Did you hear me?

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.740
I said that I found you by the roadside.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.290
Any legend?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.740
No.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.540
Not at all? Maybe a little bit?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.840
Not at all.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.350
You don't have an immortal's background.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.740
so if you're not careful enough...

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.620
you'll be beaten back to your original form.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.520
If you still want to go.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.090
here.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.650
take this treasure which can be used
to kill those demons and monsters...

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.700
and take the elixir.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.920
Take care.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.640
Grandpa!

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.470
You are my natural grandfather!

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.370
-You are the kindest to me.
-Don't say that! Don't!

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.020
The fact that you can take that lot...

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.710
is also a providence.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.940
According to this tour. you...

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.780
Thirteen...

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.860
You still don't know where that claman is.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.570
Grandpa!

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.200
I'll give you my most precious thing...

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.340
to exchange your Ying Wuxie.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.060
Thirteen Bai.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.390
I refuse to be tied up with you.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.230
Leave me alone!

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.620
You brat! How dare you steal my thing!

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.350
Wait for my good news. grandpa!

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.390
Elder. help me...

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.330
Come out.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.020
I know you're here.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:17.960
Chief...

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.420
Recently.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.660
many of our juniors died on
the way of acquiring the elixir.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.300
The spiritual cultivation
of Thirteen is not enough...

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.720
I...

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.750
I'm worried that he might be too
careless and make too many troubles.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.120
He...

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.060
He may be the one who will get the White Elixir.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.470
You...

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.440
Take care of him for me.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.390
Okay.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.950
Human world!

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.660
I'm here!

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.460
I don't want to be here!

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.950
Lady. lady.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.820
Excuse me.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.700
Have you ever seen the man in this painting?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.240
No.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.530
No? Thanks.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.530
Sorry.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.790
Excuse me.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.630
Have you ever seen the man in this painting?

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.620
Maybe...

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.680
not.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.250
Excuse me.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.540
Have you ever seen the man in
this painting? He is Liu Daoran.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.070
No.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:54.740
Thanks.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.930
Let's go.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.490
This Childe.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.540
Have you ever seen the man in this painting?

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.300
This Childe.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.630
The Childe who's eating the chicken...

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.180
Please forgive me.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.550
Let's go.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.340
What?

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.470
Thirteen Bai. did you come
down here to improve your food?

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.180
Is eating chicken so happy?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.830
What's the rush!

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.590
I'll do it after eating it.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.940
It's killing me! Claman is already there.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.300
A pair of long ears...

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.930
Claman?

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.730
Where? Where?

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.130
Ears!

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.310
Childe.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.210
you haven't paid the bill.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.380
The bill!

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.470
Don't tell me it's a...

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.280
clamkey?

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.120
Childe.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.010
would you like to rent a donkey?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.140
Our donkeys...

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.070
are extremely tolerant.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.140
You can go everywhere you want.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.470
Childe. according to my observation.
you will pass the examination...

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.390
and return to your home proudly.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.760
Let's... be my friend! I'll give you a discount.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.200
No!

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.210
Childe. you can share a donkey with others...

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.220
You can have a cheaper trip if you
return your donkeys in other places.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.330
Tomatoes on sticks! Sour and sweet!

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.180
Childe. Would you consider our donkeys?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.100
Too many people!

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.920
Where is he?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.660
That one.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.860
There are many ones!

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.770
It's killing me!

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.320
Exactly that one.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.550
Exactly!

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.270
Please. please!

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.010
Please save my little grandson!

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.740
Come on.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:06.550
Thank you. doctor.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.080
Stand up!

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.520
Thank you. doctor.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.530
There are different kinds of
ghosts sealed in this painting.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.830
Drink a bowl of blood every day...

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.140
then your grandson will recover from his illness...

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.640
when the people in the paintings are dead.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.560
Thank you so much!

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.820
What are you doing? The claman is here!

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.630
We shouldn't stay here for a long time.
Maybe next time.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.310
Are you blind?

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.470
Sorry. sorry.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.740
Get up! Your head would get kicked by donkeys!

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.500
Don't kick me!

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:12.860
Childe.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.690
are you okay?

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.880
Let your donkey stay away from me.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.080
My donkey.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.190
my donkey!

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.670
Come back!

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.260
My donkey!

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.350
My donkey!

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.370
Who can stop it for me?

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.400
My donkey!

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.080
Come back!

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.140
Excuse me. excuse me!

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.540
Don't run!

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.560
Sorry!

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.150
Don't run!

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.340
My donkey.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.030
wait!

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.760
My donkey.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.540
Ah!

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.410
If I wasn't trapped in this box...

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.560
The more you rub. the dirtier I get.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.970
Why are you dragging me?

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.030
Where is my donkey?

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.600
How can I know?

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:42.530
Let me go!

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:43.620
Let me go!

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.050
No!

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.990
Give my donkey back!

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.430
I warn you to stop. or I will kick your ass.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.030
Isn't that your donkey?

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.410
Come back!

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.820
Don't run! Give my donkey back!

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.980
You should pursue the donkey.
Why are you pursuing me?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.550
Don't run!

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.590
Come back.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.090
You. an intellectual.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.630
why can you run so fast?

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.380
A gentleman...

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.320
should be agile in words and quick in deeds.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.620
We got lost.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.500
Are you happy now?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.050
You spoiled my important business!

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.200
Do you know the importance of that donkey?

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.460
It's not my donkey.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.010
It's Daoran's donkey.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:42.870
Well.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.380
we'll just have a rest here.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.580
We could find it tomorrow.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.460
You are as stubborn as a donkey.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.470
It's only a donkey...

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:01.660
Donkey...

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.620
Is he my claman?

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.420
You are so dull...

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.480
Gosh. what a gift!

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.710
Maybe this gift will kill you.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:16.940
You should pay me a donkey...

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.390
Are you going to take the imperial examination?

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.690
Me too.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.360
How about we go together?

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.420
I'm not a bad guy.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.260
Give it back to me!

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.130
Okay. okay.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.480
What an idiot.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.390
Are you from Tushan?

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.650
My name is Thirteen. How about you?

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.180
Grandma let me give that donkey to Brother Daoran.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.400
It's only a donkey.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.400
Several years ago...

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.270
Daoran didn't pass the exam.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.870
We had a promise made...

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.300
that we will meet by the riverside...

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.420
and go to the exam together this year.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.220
Poor grandma.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.610
she missed Daoran so much...

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.460
and she entrusted me with the last donkey at home

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.980
and let me give it to Daoran...

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.340
However. by the time I got here.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.980
I was already a day late.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.380
I didn't find him.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.510
but I met you.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.870
Everyone laughs at me for being stupid.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.620
but he never.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.770
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.910
You must help me find my donkey tomorrow.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.500
Of course. I will.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.240
Could you sleep over there?

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.820
Okay.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.790
Do you know who I am?

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.970
How dare you!

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.180
The chief asked me to take care of you.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.970
So what?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.740
It might be a White Elixir this time...

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.700
so you come here to flatter me.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.810
It's the chief's order!

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.850
First.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.190
beware of a Taoist priest.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.470
Second.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.000
think about Chapter 3 and
Section 5 of "Handbook of Claman":

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.090
If you want a human to believe you.
you should do two important things.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.620
"You should lead him into a dangerous situation.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.410
Let him become hopeless or fearful.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.630
Then. give him some hope or clean up the crises."

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.740
Third...

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.270
And so this humble hut of mine
may shelter virtues half divine.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.940
The moss may climb its ruined stair.
and grassy stains the curtain wear.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.080
but...

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.550
but...

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.380
but...

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.170
but...

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.160
but scholars...

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.330
But scholars at their ease within.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.470
for all but Ignorance enters in...

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.570
There are crises everywhere.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.050
The human's heart is sinful.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.540
It was Grandpa who let you help me.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.970
To protect you secretly.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.930
So you should do something for me first...

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.210
Wow!

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.680
My donkey!

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.330
Where did you go?

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.170
It's amazing! Amazing!

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.690
Do you know Tushan as well?

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.500
My name is Wang Zijin.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.760
How about you?

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.260
Thirteen.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:18.460
Thirteen...

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.390
How about your family name?

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.630
Bai.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.410
Bai?

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.210
Then I'll call you Brother Bai later.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.460
Just call me Xiao Bai.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.430
Brother Xiao Bai.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.420
Bamboo is good.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.020
Hollow inside. straight outside.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:33.970
They would rather break than bend.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.040
It would be better if it is drizzling.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.680
right?

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:39.120
Let's ride the donkey.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.810
Me first.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.660
No!

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.510
We can't ride this donkey.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.460
It's Daoran's donkey.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.200
Then you first.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.180
No. no.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.940
let's walk.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.600
It's Daoran's donkey.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.430
We can't ride it.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.930
It won't be destroyed.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.010
We can ride it together.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.720
No.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.300
You have a donkey. but you don't ride it.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.000
Maybe it wants to be ridden?

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.180
This way?

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.350
Don't worry.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.100
We'll just take a shortcut.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.730
Excuse me. is there a hostel near here?

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.660
The Academy of Miserable Sea.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.260
Yes.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.180
The Academy of Miserable Sea.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.140
Don't disturb them.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.460
Do you also come to take the imperial examination?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.740
Come in. please.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.300
Knowledge is infinite.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.970
If you intend to take the examination.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.210
you must pass the Academy of Miserable Sea.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.800
Do you want to know about our
tutorial lessons before the exam?

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.310
Three years of examination. five years of guidance.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.760
We have custom-built lessons...

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.350
including the whole set of services.
from guessing the questions...

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.890
to passing the exam.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.050
One teacher. one student. We don't need 8800.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.720
all we want is 88.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.590
88 pennies?

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:00.050
88 taels.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.790
88 taels of silver!

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.550
Don't disturb them!

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:06.380
Let's go. Xiao Bai.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.520
We can really guess the examination questions!

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.390
The imperial examination became business here.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.180
You can't find a place to sleep...

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.260
in the circumference of dozens of miles.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.800
We don't need any lessons.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.110
One room. Two guests. Only for tonight.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.680
Xiao Bai...

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.260
Xiao Bai...

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.050
Xiao Bai...

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.050
Childe.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.900
Childe.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.640
Childe.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.580
Childe.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.540
Come here. Come.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:20.700
Where is...

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.220
Xiao Bai.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.250
Hurry up!

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.510
That way!

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.690
Go! Let's go!

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:57.840
That way. Go that way!

00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.900
Jump!

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.510
-Xiao Bai.
-Jump. bro.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.100
Sorry.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.890
Help me!

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.050
Zijin. Zijin!

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.350
Get up! Get up!

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.230
Sorry. Xiao Bai!

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:41.720
Hurry up!

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.180
Zijin. Zijin!

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.510
-Sorry!
-It's me.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.260
Hurry up!

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:17.390
Are you okay?

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:18.590
Sorry! Sorry!

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.380
Go. go!

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.870
Zijin. Zijin!

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.800
Jump!

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.560
My target is that one.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.220
Get out of the way now.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.840
then I won't kill you.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.470
Monster!

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.700
I know everything about you.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.910
You are not qualified to criticize me.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.850
Too much nonsense.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.350
Run!

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:56.590
Xiao Bai!

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.180
Zijin. run!

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.660
We can meet again in the future life.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.050
Your puppet trick is superb.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.660
You are a competent companion of me.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.470
When did you brush your teeth last time?

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.760
It's not elastic now.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.300
I sacrificed a lot for you.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.260
Don't forget if you become the immortal.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.800
Okay. okay. I'll make it up for you.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.330
How about my performance?

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.380
It's not too bad.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.060
I have prepared for it carefully for you.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.120
to make sure he'll believe you.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.800
Xiao Bai!

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.350
I'm here to save you!

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.260
Why is he back?

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.430
I don't have a script!
How can I continue to perform?

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.550
I'm not ready to act later.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.510
I just don't know how to do it.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.550
Shut up!

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.430
Open your mouth.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.240
Transform your body first.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:26.900
Oops.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.080
Monster!

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.600
Spit out Xiao Bai! Hurry up!

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.970
Don't push me!

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.870
I don't want to kill anything!

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.780
Okay! You don't want to do it. right?

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.170
Monster!

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.070
-Spit out Xiao Bai!
-There's gunpowder in his hands!

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.020
What should we do?

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.100
How can I know?

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.140
Spit out!

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.630
Did you hear me?

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.100
What should I do? Really spit you out?

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.000
What should I do?

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.430
Use the unique skill!

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:53.420
Spit out!

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.520
Xiao Bai!

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:58.410
Xiao Bai!

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.680
Xiao Bai!

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:11.860
Xiao...

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.690
Let a monster do something wrong...

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:53.980
It's a set of interlocking tricks.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.790
Risk one's life to save another...

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.140
It's a trick of having oneself
tortured to win someone's heart.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.040
How dare you not consult with me in advance?

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.260
-How can I know?
-I think my mouth got burned.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.100
Who are you?

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.410
I...you...

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.140
This is my master.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.260
This is my footman.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.660
Nice to meet you.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.230
See how bad I was injured!

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.620
You should give me something more.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.260
Alright.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.500
I'm taking an elixir.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:22.700
the White Elixir!

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.930
Certainly. I'll look after
you when I become immortal.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.940
What if it's not a White Elixir?

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.920
You're exposed so we have to
play along with this situation.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.950
You just trick that claman to Jiankang City.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.280
I'll help you take a look at that elixir.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.090
Follow my guidance.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:45.660
Monster!

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.860
Spit Xiao Bai out!

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.520
Grasp the opportunity! Don't let him run away!

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.250
I'll...

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.120
protect you secretly.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:57.370
Just go!

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.980
You...you are...

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.700
Sorry...

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.370
I'm a fox spirit.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:39.930
I come here to requite your kindness...

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.660
Requite the kindness...

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.800
What an old-fashioned reason...

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.600
I won't hurt you.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:47.750
Don't be afraid.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.700
I'll transform back to human form.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.050
I remember saving chick. puppy. and piggy...

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.620
but little fox? I don't remember...

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.680
Because it was 500 years ago.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.590
I can't recall.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.740
You certainly can't!

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.650
That happened in your pre-pre-previous life!

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.450
It hurts!

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.500
It's real!

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.660
Weren't you scared?

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.040
I've liked...

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.120
these plays about monsters
and ghosts since I was a child.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.640
I never expect that it actually exists...

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.040
and I could meet a fox spirit...

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.280
who would save my life.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.050
You saved me too.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.830
I remember when I was little.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.520
I fell into a pigsty and got bitten.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:13.500
Grandma...

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.920
took this to treat me.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.410
You should...

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.600
chew it up...

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:22.500
and apply it to the wound.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.620
I don't think I'm hurt that bad...

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:32.160
Donkey...

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:33.920
Where is my donkey!

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.320
Why are you all wet?

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.580
I knew you wouldn't leave my donkey.

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.620
Great!

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.540
I can eat chicken if I follow you.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.410
Hey. this boat doesn't depend on paddles...

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.440
Does it really depend on waves?

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.220
It depends on me.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:37.130
It's amazing!

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.160
Her name is Ying Wuxie.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.120
It's our foxes' greatest treasure.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.910
My grandpa gave her to me.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.660
This is Zijin. This is Ying Wuxie.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:48.440
My name is Zijin.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.400
What can she do?

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.390
Well...

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.740
It's useless. It's just a kind of accessories.

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.560
Let me have a look.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:53.200
Of course not.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.120
This is the treasure of our fox spirits.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.790
Let me have a look!

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:55.430
No.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.330
Hey.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:57.500
do me a favor.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.470
Okay. Is it favorable enough?

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:22.080
The king of foxes...

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.250
He is the king of foxes!

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.290
He is Wang Zijin!

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.020
I'm Wang Zijin.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.180
You're the kind of fox spirits
that have immense power. right?

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.250
Of course!

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.740
I can do whatever I want.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.880
Wow! That's awesome...

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.260
We are just ordinary humans.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.500
We take the examinations of
provinces. prefectures. and counties.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.260
We need to pass these different levels of exams

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.330
and eventually become a successful scholar.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.460
We fight for achievements and reputations.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.990
I envy your freedom...

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.410
and comfort.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.830
Come on. we also have to take examinations.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.640
Really?

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.960
It's just different from your way.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.580
How about you come with me
to take the imperial exam?

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.910
When you take your exam.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.100
I'll do something for you then.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.270
It's a deal. okay?

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.380
I'm here to requite your kindness...

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.830
so maybe I can grant you three wishes.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.720
Passing the examination.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.880
enjoying a happy marriage
and becoming extremely wealthy.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:18.740
How do you like them?

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:21.460
Okay.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.160
you can help me to find Brother Daoran.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.440
This's your first wish.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.960
Why did you always talk about
Daoran. Daoran. and Daoran?

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.610
My family had a history of ink-making.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.500
and our ink supplied to the academy at the county.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.860
Brother Daoran was one of the
first-class talents in the academy.

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:39.620
He became the best primary scholar when he was 17.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.460
Without him.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.330
I may not even know the words.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:48.610
Brother Daoran is my role model.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.120
Okay.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.240
I'll help you find Daoran.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.750
Second.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.550
heal your wound as soon as possible.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.780
I'm already fine.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.020
This doesn't count.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.070
Forget it. Maybe next time.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.740
Hey.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:18.440
do foxes like to steal chickens?

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.180
Those are weasels!

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.450
However. my grandma told me that...

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.010
the most hateful thing in the world...

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.600
is stealing.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.310
I thought killing might be more serious.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.070
To kill is to steal others' lives.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:30.820
How about lying?

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.560
To lie is to steal others' trust.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.370
All of them are stealing.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.090
All of them are hateful.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:37.630
Xiao Bai.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.080
you are a fox spirit.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.410
so you must know a lot.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:42.960
Just ask. idiot.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:44.950
Hmmm...

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.780
Do foxes have something to do with bromhidrosis?

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.880
It's not a question.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.170
Don't be angry.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:50.700
So does it matter or not?

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.280
It doesn't matter!

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.120
Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai!

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:10.920
Look over there.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:13.910
After we've crossed Jiankang City.

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:14.980
we'll arrive the Imperial Examination Room.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.740
where I'll take the exam.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.790
Keep it at the hostel and
we'll pick it up in two days.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:22.580
Okay.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.290
You don't have to worry.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.790
Let's go.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:28.080
Where's the donkey?

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.040
Everything is arranged. Don't worry.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.660
We hardly have the opportunity
to come to Jiankang City.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.220
We should really check it out.

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:35.080
But...

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.040
Let's go!

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.040
So beautiful...

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.620
Xiao Bai...

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:01.910
It's the brothel!

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.530
Childes. come in. take a seat.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:30.930
Don't go!

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:47.890
Childe.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.060
someone is waiting for you there.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.090
He must be Daoran.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.750
Where is that page boy?

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:12.930
Childe.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.940
just cross the bridge.

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.120
It must be here.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.270
What brings Brother Daoran here?

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.090
I'm looking for Mr. Liu from Tushan.

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:41.000
Looking for someone?

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.720
Everyone comes here is looking for someone.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.740
Wait wait.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:48.620
wait...

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.270
wait...

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.660
I'm looking for Liu Daoran from Tushan.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:54.950
He is on the second floor.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:55.910
Upstairs.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.930
Childe.

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.620
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.910
I make this sacrifice for you.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.110
but you are such an unfilial
apprentice...How dare you laugh?

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.760
So. should I laugh or "unfiliaugh"ï¼Ÿ

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.510
Wait a moment...

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.190
I thought we are going to find Brother Daoran...

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.060
Yes.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.210
Go!

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:30.760
Wait. what are you doing?

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:31.850
Wait a moment...

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:32.790
Don't get me wrong!

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:34.290
I don't have the money to spend.

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.410
Xiao Bai!

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.440
Xiao Bai!

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:38.610
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:40.710
Let me go!

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.450
Xiao Bai!

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:43.500
Tonight will be the most important night.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.000
Do we have to do it?

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.950
Humans and foxes belong to different worlds.

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.450
but ghosts are different from both of them.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.080
They can travel freely between
worlds of humans and foxes.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:57.420
so they can see what we can't.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.250
They can see the location...

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.020
and the quality of elixir.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:07.740
They sure can confirm both.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:09.790
Even if you fail.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.120
I'll think of a way to get the elixir.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.680
which is something you can't
learn from the "Claman Manual".

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.000
What are you doing in this broad daylight!

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:19.920
It's already getting dark.

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.080
Open the door!

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.660
She's not going to do
anything to my claman. is she?

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.410
Xiao Bai!

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.550
What can she do?

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.930
Open the door!

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.420
Waves of spring river are as high as the sea.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:42.520
a bright moon rises with the tide.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:47.540
Shimmering moonlight flows with the waves.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:54.780
we can find this moonlight on every spring river.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.070
Childe. sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.410
My name is Yinglian.

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:59.070
You look like my grandma...

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:01.840
the fairy in her stories.

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.440
What's that sound?

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.250
It's hopeful!

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.620
Will she eat him?

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.330
She?

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.200
She dare not do that.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:18.790
She may suck some blood at the most.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:19.890
Okay.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:22.200
I have to take care of my business.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.190
If it's not because of the White Elixir.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:26.970
I won't spend that much of effort.

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:47.610
Childe.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.160
why?

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.440
Childe.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.160
you are bleeding.

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:19.660
My name is Wang Zijin.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Sorry to break into your boudoir.

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:23.200
I also shouldn't have some
dirty thoughts about you.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.330
I'm sorry but I have to leave.

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.750
May I ask your age. Childe?

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.590
Thirteen.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.820
Thirteen?

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.120
Xiao Bai!

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.140
Xiao Bai?

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:35.870
Sorry to bother you!

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:37.900
Why did you run away like this?

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.650
Do you dislike me?

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.410
No. you get me wrong.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.120
That's not my idea.

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.590
You look so gorgeous.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:45.620
so...

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.750
I'd like to ask you...

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:48.160
What?

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:49.960
that...that...

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:52.120
where are you from?

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.630
Maybe the Western Regions.

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:54.780
I don't remember.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.940
It...It...

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.150
It's broken...

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:04.790
May I ask your age. please?

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.620
Your questions were so detailed...

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.910
Are you going to marry me?

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.870
I'm not married.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.100
What a coincidence!

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:18.010
I'm not married. too.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:19.140
I didn't mean it.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.460
I meant that I haven't
thought about getting married.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:26.570
I'll compensate for your losses.

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:28.880
Okay.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.800
I'd like you to compensate for my loneliness.

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:34.870
It's bleeding...

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.370
Lady.

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:53.370
what's wrong?

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:56.810
I'm a dancer. so I have to
practice hard in my daily life.

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.200
You are so hardworking.

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:09.620
Lady. why...

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:12.940
My makeup was messed up..

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.860
I have to refine it.

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:15.770
So...

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:16.310
Don't move!

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:18.300
Stand there!

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.860
Don't turn around!

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.060
I shouldn't look at things which
do not conform to the rites...

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.640
Sorry to offend you.

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:33.280
Lady. how can I compensate for my damage?

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.520
Lady?

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:40.410
Lady?

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.120
Lady?

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:47.370
Lady?

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:55.750
Lady?

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.660
Is it too exciting?

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.450
If you are curious. you can go in to see.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:05.870
If you are distressed. you can go in and persuade.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:06.790
Don't just sit and watch the game.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.370
Wait a moment.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.700
Don't be unreasonable.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.620
You can't blame me for your failure...

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:16.570
Lady?

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.120
Did I let you think about something bad?

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.660
I've never met a person like you.

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:24.620
I've never met a lady like you
too. You're just like a fairy.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.380
You're so beautiful and talented.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.450
Obviously.

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:28.820
you're here because of...

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.070
your miserable fate.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.410
I don't have too much money in my wallet.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.870
If...

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.390
I can get good grades this year.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.300
I must help you to get out of here...

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.160
and get rid of all these sufferings.

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:37.990
What are you doing?

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.520
I won't turn around anymore.

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:44.840
This is my favorite book.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:45.870
and I would like to give you as a gift.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.920
It's bleeding again...

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.380
Lady.

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:55.330
you...

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:56.350
I...

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.940
you're the only one I'll marry!

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.140
Are you crazy?

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.540
I'm absolutely healthy.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.440
It stops...

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:08.520
Don't move.

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:16.430
Lady...

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.210
If we do what spouses do...

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.980
before the rituals of a spouse.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.400
it'll be a humiliation to you.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.290
Lady. lady!

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.750
What do you want?

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.080
What the hell is it?

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.280
It covered everything.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:39.910
Lady.

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:41.680
come on.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.370
I'm afraid that I can't control myself.

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:47.710
So. please tie up my hands and feet for me.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.430
I. Wang Zijin. swear to god.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.040
I will pass the exam...

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:03.330
and propose to you.

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:05.860
if you agree.

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.430
Tonight only belongs to you and me.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.870
It's a long night...

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.140
Do you...

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.380
really want to discuss theories
of Confucius and Mencius?

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.040
No. no.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.290
That's so boring.

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:17.390
How about The Nanhua Classic?

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.390
There was a fish in the North Ocean.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.770
and its name was Kun.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:32.770
The Kun was so huge...

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.460
and I just didn't know how big it is.

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:37.750
Then it became a bird.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.790
and its name was Peng.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.120
The back of Peng is so huge...

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.870
and I just didn't know how big it is.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:49.100
When it vibrated its wings and flied straight up.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.360
these wings were just like
clouds hanging in the sky.

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.910
When the wind blew the sea.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:58.750
this bird would migrate to the southern sea...

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.220
Idiot.

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:07.340
I didn't let you suffer too many losses.

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:34.980
Silly boy...

01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.120
You can't sleep without his snores. right?

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.420
Or you want a game of three-player Chinese poker?

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.850
Give it back to me.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.290
What?

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.520
Give it back to me.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.070
Have you seen it?

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.790
I haven't been close to him.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:55.750
I don't have the opportunity to see it.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.000
I think that achieving the
elixir is not my destiny.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.290
People who don't have wisdom and guts...

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:11.130
like to complain about their fate most.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:13.550
Xiao Bai. I'm in love with someone.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:17.240
I only love Yinglian...

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.170
If he's not my claman.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.340
maybe...

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.250
we could become very intimate friends.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:33.380
Thirteen Bai.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.960
because of your background...

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.960
you have been laughed by
other foxes all these years.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.500
Aren't their laughter harsh enough?

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:40.710
You're such a great guy.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.730
You have a great mindset.

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:44.540
I'll see who dares to laugh at me.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.920
Why don't you keep laughing?

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:47.850
-Keep pretending you don't hear me.
-Why aren't you laughing?

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.700
Hello?

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:50.170
-Laugh! Laugh!
-Wake up!

01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.500
Wake up!

01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:05.500
You're so naughty!

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.060
No. no. no!

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.450
Afraid of water?

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.340
You'll only bully me.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.510
But I'm still happy for you.

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:15.960
At least you could live happily ever after...

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.790
as you'll never know how dumb you are.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.270
Hey. girl.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.940
How dare you play tricks?

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.240
Why can't you do such a little tiny thing?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.070
The lotus that your soul
possessed in is still in my hands.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.620
If I didn't have to use you to get that elixir.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.460
I could destroy you right now!

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.420
I must pass the exam this time.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:02.340
have you ever seen this man in the painting?

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.000
If you see him later.

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:05.360
please tell him that Wang Zijin is waiting for him

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.640
in the Imperial Examination Room.

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.630
Have you ever seen this man in the painting?

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.620
Who are you?

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.700
My name is Wang Zijin.

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.160
Is your father Mr. Wang from Nanjing?

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.620
My father is skilled in making inks.

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.590
which is...

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:19.070
Oh. that's good.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.560
Have you ever seen this man...

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:24.750
I passed!

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.940
I won!

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.340
Don't touch it!

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.900
It's mine!

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:31.090
Don't touch it!

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.830
What are you thinking about?
You'll take the exam tomorrow.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.510
According to your opinions.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.680
how many people will
participate in this examination?

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:55.000
There are only a few that make it...

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.480
Why are you so indecisive?

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.470
If you don't pass it.
nobody will respect you. right?

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.720
You don't have the strength to
propose to your sweetheart. right?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.210
I knew it.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.580
I don't have a respectable
background. just like you.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.920
Actually...

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.950
I'm not a real fox spirit now.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:12.780
It's just an exam.

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:16.060
If you wouldn't pass this time.

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:17.930
you could retake next year.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.710
You studied...

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.750
for yourself.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.260
I believe you can do it.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.050
You can become a real fox spirit.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.980
And a good one.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.050
I'll work hard!

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.420
I can do it!

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.750
God is answering me!

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:08.880
He'll work hard!

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:10.590
He can do it!

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:16.700
Talk about yourself!

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:20.300
I'll be a good fox spirit!

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:22.910
Do it again! Do it again!

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.710
I'll work hard!

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:26.340
I can do it!

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.720
He'll be a good fox spirit!

01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:53.639
We're selecting the scholars of our big country.

01:08:54.059 --> 01:08:55.530
All we want are talented people.

01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:57.620
The classics are here.

01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:59.470
Please search for what you want.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.030
However. if you want to
cheat with your private notes.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.210
once discovered...

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.530
you'll be punished.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.260
The Official!

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.630
Please have mercy on me!

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.519
Don't talk!

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.370
Go in.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.590
Do you want to cut it up to have a look?

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:19.960
Cut it here.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960
Cut it there.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.790
Cut!

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:27.019
Your skill is great.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.229
People who have been searched...

01:09:30.559 --> 01:09:32.179
please take the examination paper...

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.870
and wait for the exam.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.710
Pass the Dragon Gate.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.470
Examination starts now.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.610
7 o'clock in the evening.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.250
You can only pass the exam
if you understand the classics.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.210
Just do it in a spurt of energy.

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:13.960
Sit up straight!

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.310
I've passed it!

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.710
Ghost!

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.580
There's a ghost! Ghost!

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.000
There's a ghost! Ghost!

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.690
Ah!

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:49.610
Silence!

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.630
9 o'clock in the evening.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.420
Don't look anywhere else.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.880
Don't talk to anyone.

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:05.920
Stabilize your mind!

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:38.650
What are you doing here?

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.210
Would like to do a business with you.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.250
Tonight...

01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:52.860
the ghost of this examination room
will capture a bunch of students' souls.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.960
including Zijin's.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:57.600
Passed...

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:02.440
Passed...

01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:06.050
I've passed.

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.630
If the evil spirit is subdued.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.590
the spell will naturally disappear.

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:15.060
which that old fox doesn't know.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.040
Zijin's soul was gone.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.760
so he won't feel any pain.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.740
It's the perfect time to kill him.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.580
as the quality of the elixir won't be changed.

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:40.260
Three fingers next to the Tianchi point.

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:41.880
White elixir.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.650
Did you see it?

01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:48.480
When it's done.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.180
you should help me to take back the lotus.

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:53.740
Don't forget that.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.980
if you don't get it.

01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.430
your 500 years of cultivation will be wasted!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.430
I help you this time.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:03.190
and you should help me too.

01:15:03.690 --> 01:15:05.000
okay?

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.030
Okay.

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:07.730
Brother Daoran!

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:10.610
I finally found you!

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:13.750
I'm Zijin!

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.340
Why are you ignoring me?

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.500
I haven't seen you for so many years.

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.570
Grandma has thought about you for days and nights.

01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:23.070
Many things happened at home...

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.540
I have made a new friend called "Xiao Bai".

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.340
Brother Daoran!

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.540
grandma let me give that donkey to you.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.430
Be off!

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:43.180
Leave!

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:44.750
Wait a moment. Xiao Bai...

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:45.500
Waiting for what?

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:47.340
Your soul is leaving your body!
It'll be too late if you don't go back!

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:49.040
He is Brother Daoran I was always looking for...

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.290
He is already dead!

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:51.790
Dead?

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.500
I don't believe it!

01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:58.000
Don't disturb me! I'm answering the questions!

01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.540
Leave now!

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.500
If I can't pass. nobody can do it...

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.640
We're all the same!

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.690
Who can escape?

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:24.700
Who can do it?

01:17:57.810 --> 01:17:58.730
Zijin!

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.580
Liu Daoran failed too many times in
this exam and died in the examination room.

01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:07.490
He became the ghost and no one could handle it.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.040
Did you forget your objective?

01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:10.650
That was White Elixir!

01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:34.640
You really want to die. right?

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.270
It's over. I'm dead.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.110
Don't you want to take the elixir?

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:36.390
Don't you want to be immortal?

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.210
Don't you want to live?

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:52.300
If you want to save others.
you should recognize yourself.

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.460
I can get you out of here.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.470
only if Liu Daoran can remember the past.

01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:58.710
Don't worry about being alone...

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.120
on the way ahead.

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:05.100
It's up to you to decide...

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:06.690
how far my light will reach.

01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:09.320
Don't worry about being alone...

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.920
on the way ahead.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.000
Brother Daoran!

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.800
Zijin!

01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:13.840
Here's the ink.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.070
Thanks. Zijin.

01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:18.130
I'll give this pen to you.

01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:20.690
You should study hard later.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.440
Thanks. Brother Daoran.

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:27.340
Don't worry about being alone...

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:28.540
on the way ahead.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.250
Everyone in the world...

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.790
knows my heart.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.000
Zijin...

01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:39.190
Maybe one day...

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.250
you'll walk into the examination room.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.500
The pen in your hands...

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.390
will draw a bright future...

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:47.630
and support your great ideal.

01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:52.820
If you and I could be talented
and great contributors...

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.010
we should not be greedy for the earthly attachment.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.630
Families. confidants. lovers...

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.640
even what we think when we first pick up the pen...

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:05.630
can be discarded...

01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:07.510
if it's for merit and fame.

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:09.040
Zijin.

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:11.180
when we meet again.

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.340
the names of you and me...

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.910
will be written into history and epic.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.470
Don't worry about being alone...

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.420
Don't worry about being alone...

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.770
on the way ahead.

01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:26.920
Everyone in the world...

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:29.720
knows my heart.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:32.630
Brother Daoran!

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.080
Zijin.

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:48.920
It's been a long time.

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.130
Brother Daoran!

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.090
I missed you.

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:58.850
Both grandma and I thought of you every day.

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.030
waiting for you to go home.

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:03.570
It's too late.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.180
Everything is too late.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:11.500
It's all that I can do.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.340
Wuxie...

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:21.560
I don't have to be stuck in this box anymore.

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.120
Thirteen.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.130
farewell.

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:34.590
Zijin.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:38.110
you should be careful.

01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:41.580
That fox spirit has followed you all the way...

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:46.160
only to take the elixir of the soul in your body.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.580
3 o'clock in the morning.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.150
Please enjoy your meal!

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:19.690
Xiao Bai!

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.690
Thank you for saving me again.

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.370
It's Ying Wuxie who saved us.

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:30.230
She was supposed to be with my grandpa...

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.240
It's my fault.

01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:35.970
If you have any wish.

01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:38.520
you must tell me.

01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:41.910
I also want to do something for you.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:48.970
Xiao Bai.

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.920
what is the elixir of the soul?

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:05.500
It is...

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.130
It is a...

01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:14.870
elixir.

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.170
Do I have it?

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.120
I can give it to you.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.340
I'm totally fine.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:28.320
Xiao Bai...

01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:31.520
I have another wish...

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.580
I want to get Yinglian out of here.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.770
She used to be an orphan.
abducted by human traders.

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:41.920
sold to Peony Brothel as a prostitute.

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.350
She finally jumped into a river to commit suicide.

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:47.580
Her resentment was too powerful.

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.300
which made her soul possessed
the body of this lotus.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.980
Then. she became the best beauty in Peony Brothel.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:55.870
She ate human hearts...

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.030
and sucked their blood...

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.030
to maintain her look.

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:01.930
You've already known it.

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:06.700
Only someone who really loves her...

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:09.030
can help her release the soul.

01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:14.490
Will you help me to meet my second wish?

01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:20.690
You should think twice...

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:42.620
I. Wang Zijin from Tushan.

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:46.700
have sincerely prepared the betrothal gift...

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.230
for asking Yinglian from the Peony to marry me.

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.800
This wedding is a chance for you...

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:56.250
to take the elixir with the help of that ghost.

01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.250
What a luck for you loser.

01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:59.620
Just follow my lead.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.390
Ms. Yinglian...

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:02.800
will you marry me?

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.790
You've known that I'm...

01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:08.940
Yes. I've known it.
That's why I become more determined.

01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:11.660
More importantly. I've promised you before.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:13.850
I love you sincerely.

01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:20.710
so I don't care if you are human or ghost.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.570
I get along with tree demons.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.770
I'm used to fool around in the
human world with these companions.

01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:31.840
I've got no attachments.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.400
Scared now?

01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:38.080
Do you want to marry me now?

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:38.660
Yes.

01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:41.370
I'm a flower ghost.

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.010
You'll die soon...

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:44.790
if you are with me.

01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:49.080
It's because you don't like me?

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:51.570
Life...

01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:54.260
should be wasted on people you love!

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.610
Silly kid.

01:26:57.230 --> 01:26:59.230
we met by chance like patches of drifting duckweed.

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:01.300
If my life...

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.620
can make my dearest families
or lover fulfill their wishes.

01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:06.060
I won't consider it as "waste".

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.020
Everyone will die. sooner or later.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.870
I don't have the ambition to save the whole world.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.120
I only hope that everyone I care about...

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:17.860
can have a bright future.

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:22.270
I'm only a poor student...

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.080
who was despised when I was a kid.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.850
I've been worrying that if I fail.

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.830
I won't be able to give you a wealthy life.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.630
But I've been thinking that...

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:36.190
fame is nothing more than a weapon.

01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:40.800
which will make me more
capable of protecting others.

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:45.690
On this way of taking the exam.

01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:48.470
I made a bosom friend.

01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:51.120
and I also met you.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.240
This is what I have always dreamed of.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.320
Under the sun. the moon and the sky.

01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:06.970
witnessed by mountains.
rivers. ghosts. and immortals.

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:09.620
I...

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.910
wish that Yinglian and I can be wife and husband.

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.600
We can take care of each other...

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.450
until the advent of samsara.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.900
We won't separate from each other forever and ever.

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.650
whether we are alive or dead.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.140
I'm late for being in your life.

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:27.250
but in the future.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.540
I'll...

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.350
never let you suffer any grievance.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.740
Zijin...

01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:55.690
Sorry.

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:01.150
Old fox. you listen to me.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I quit!

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:18.830
Zijin...

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.580
Come over.

01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:20.540
Xiao Bai...

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:21.200
Don't go over there!

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:24.990
He wants to take advantage of
the wedding to take the elixir.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.750
Yinglian. you're mistaken.

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:29.320
I made him a promise.

01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:35.540
Zijin.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.050
don't trust her!

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:40.200
Don't act like you're trying to save him.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.090
You're the one who wanted him dead.

01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.370
Yinglian. no!

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:53.120
Xiao Bai!

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.500
I can't let him lie to you anymore.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.950
Yinglian. let go of Xiao Bai.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.730
He's my best friend.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:29:59.860
Friend?

01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.750
He made up lies.

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:04.700
pretended to return your favors.

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.860
and cheated you to win your trust.

01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:07.480
just for the trail of acquiring his elixir!

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:09.410
What he wanted was the White Elixir in your body!

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:10.860
I didn't!

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.120
What? White Elixir?

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.990
If he wants it. he can just take it!

01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:15.380
Take it? Then you'll be dead!

01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:17.080
Xiao Bai!

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:19.740
Zijin. just go!

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.760
Xiao Bai!

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.700
I never meant to hurt him...

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:25.160
Still lying!

01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:29.920
Still protecting him!

01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:35.830
Xiao Bai!

01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:36.700
Zijin.

01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:39.740
there are many things.
and I'll explain to you later.

01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:40.920
Explain what?

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:42.960
You foxes are deceitful by nature.

01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:44.500
The time is almost up.

01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:45.940
We all know that if you don't take the elixir.

01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:47.540
you'll return to your original form.

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.010
You'll give up...

01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:50.360
your five hundred years of training?

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.250
Big joke.

01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:53.030
Yinglian!

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.150
I'm begging you!

01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:55.280
Let Xiao Bai go!

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.740
He helped me all the way.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.400
He won't hurt me!

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.040
Xiao Bai!

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.380
How can you be so stupid?

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.410
I have to kill him today.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.830
Or he'll kill you.

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:07.250
Yinglian. don't do it!

01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:23.750
Yinglian!

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:27.040
Thirteen.

01:31:29.010 --> 01:31:29.980
are you alright?

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.360
I had to do it.

01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:33.650
See?

01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:35.420
They're all liars.

01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:45.510
Go!

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:05.420
Yinglian!

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:11.700
Sorry!

01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.230
What can I do to save you?

01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:16.780
Too late.

01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:18.620
Forgive me...

01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:22.720
I've wasted your kindness.

01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:26.040
Sorry. sorry!

01:32:26.690 --> 01:32:27.680
Please tell me!

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.540
What else can I do?

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.640
I'm willing to do anything!

01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:35.120
I'm just a lonely soul...

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:38.850
You've already saved me...

01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:42.390
with your sincere care.

01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:45.450
I have no regrets...

01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:49.250
in this life.

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.540
It's a red-letter day!

01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:07.470
You shouldn't cry.

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.230
I'm afraid there'll be no afterlife...

01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:22.440
Only wish Zijin peace...

01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:25.340
in this life.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.130
Yinglian!

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:04.780
Zijin!

01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:10.450
I just pretended not to know.

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:13.720
I don't want to know.

01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:18.010
I've always trusted you.

01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:20.770
Always regarded you as my best friend.

01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.150
my brother.

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:30.940
Have you ever been sad?

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.740
Have you ever shed tears for anyone?

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.800
I'd rather die just now...

01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:48.090
than believe that this is all your scam.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.250
You said that you've never stolen...

01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:53.250
but you're a liar.

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:54.450
Where's Yinglian?

01:34:54.450 --> 01:34:57.040
Tell me where Yinglian is!

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.700
You stole everything from me!

01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:02.330
All you want is the elixir of the soul. right?

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:03.180
Come on!

01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:04.660
Come and get it!

01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:08.600
Do you think that I really want to get it?

01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:09.990
The acquisition of elixir is my exam!

01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:11.300
What can I do?

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.540
Enough!

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.580
What's all this for?

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.900
How I wish you were not my claman...

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.790
because you are my most cherished friend...

01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:38.990
in my world.

01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:40.410
Go away!

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.710
I should never have come to take this elixir...

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.770
and I shouldn't have lied to you.

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:09.870
I owe you this...

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.390
I'll give it back to you now!

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:31.420
Xiao Bai!

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.030
Thirteen.

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.100
salute to Priest Zhang.

01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:58.030
He has been supervising your
spiritual practice in the human world.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.150
Without him.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.650
you almost made a big mistake.

01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.040
The White Elixir...

01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:09.820
only appears once in a blue moon.

01:37:09.970 --> 01:37:10.920
Stupid kid.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.300
what occurs once in a blue
moon is not the White Elixir...

01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:17.270
but people who can truly sacrifice their lives...

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:19.620
for each other.

01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:22.700
You haven't possessed the
wisdom a thousand years ago...

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.440
so you certainly didn't know that

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.680
you once met a herb-gathering
kid in the mountains...

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.290
who saved your life.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:48.340
That tear is the elixir you planted for yourself.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:50.940
I thought it was a casual talk.

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:54.410
Unexpectedly...

01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:58.270
The fox...

01:37:59.210 --> 01:38:00.510
who had planted it...

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.640
should take it himself.

01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:06.550
It's not your fault to take
the elixir according to your fate.

01:38:09.730 --> 01:38:10.990
Over the years.

01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:14.380
you are the only one who
had taken the White Elixir.

01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:19.480
I want to know ...

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.400
what happened to the claman...

01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:25.100
who volunteered to give you the elixir.

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.410
He has already entered the samsara.

01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:33.400
The best fox furs! Have a look!

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:34.650
Fox?

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.930
Go away. go away!

01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:41.840
Poor things.

01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:43.100
Dad has said that...

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.540
foxes are bad creatures who tell lies.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.110
But it's so sad.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.350
The fate of the claman has long been doomed.

01:38:55.150 --> 01:38:57.810
You can't run away from your fate.

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.730
I know. it's hard.

01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:03.980
but you have to get through this
process of acquiring the elixir.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.440
If you take it. every problem will be solved.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.200
Everyone will respect you.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.010
If you don't. 500 years of effort will be wasted.

01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:14.270
This is the spiritual practice.

01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:16.380
It's providence.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.310
I get it.

01:39:27.690 --> 01:39:28.960
Thirteen.

01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:31.240
it's the last hurdle.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.260
and you have to do it yourself after all.

01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:06.040
I know...

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.050
you won't forgive me.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.390
I lied to you all the way...

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.310
I did all the things only to take that elixir.

01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:17.600
It's true.

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:20.870
It's impossible to say that...

01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:23.720
I won't be sad.

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:26.590
Just pretend that...

01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:30.610
you never knew me.

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:35.170
What'll happen to you if you can't get the elixir?

01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.890
Xiao Bai!

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.570
You've always been with me all the way.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.930
I thought I had made the best friend.

01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:49.360
I thought I still had a long life ahead.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.990
plenty of time...

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.120
and plenty of stories.

01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:58.430
I thought there would be you...

01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:01.530
and Yinglian in my life.

01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:06.610
And I'm the happiest person in the world.

01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:10.940
If it's all because I have one more thing...

01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:12.980
that is available for your use...

01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:18.980
You can just take it.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.520
Sorry...

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.230
I don't remember things in my previous life...

01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:35.410
so I don't want to have any
more regrets in this life.

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.710
I can now assure that my visit to this world...

01:41:39.630 --> 01:41:40.490
is worthy.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.370
I know that becoming immortal is
the most important thing to you.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.850
I'm willing to do it for you.

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:56.470
Let me make my last wish...

01:41:58.310 --> 01:42:00.090
you'll be a good fox spirit.

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:02.940
I'm...

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.140
willing to give you the elixir as a gift.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:32.220
I knew that you would come.

01:43:34.130 --> 01:43:35.630
He was happy.

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.690
At the last moment.

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:41.460
he still thought that the elixir
could help you become immortal.

01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:45.540
I was intended to bury him with kindness...

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.830
I overestimated you.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.920
It's just an ordinary Black Elixir.

01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:02.910
I wasted all my efforts on it.

01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:19.610
You'll pay for his life!

01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:24.350
What can you do?

01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:46.680
Why do you think I followed you all the way?

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.670
How can it be your turn to get this White Elixir.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:53.600
which only occurs once in a
thousand years and I can't even get it?

01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:58.460
You were destined to be trash
from the day you were born.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.820
You don't know what you're capable of.
How can you fight me?

01:47:29.690 --> 01:47:32.130
If you want to die with him.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:35.160
I'll let you.

01:47:41.050 --> 01:47:42.150
My name is Wang Zijin.

01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:43.230
How about you?

01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:45.230
Just call me Xiao Bai.

01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:46.100
Brother Xiao Bai.

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.410
Sorry...

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.170
I'm a fox spirit.

01:47:54.370 --> 01:47:55.550
I come here to requite your kindness...

01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:57.180
I don't remember.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.720
Because it was 500 years ago...

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.350
If you have any wish.

01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:04.600
you must tell me.

01:48:06.190 --> 01:48:08.030
I also want to do something for you.

01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.640
Zijin.

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.420
Sorry.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.440
Stupid kid.

01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:23.700
what occurs once in a blue
moon is not the White Elixir...

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.270
but people who can truly sacrifice their lives...

01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:28.450
for each other.

01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.240
The fox...

01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:34.480
who has planted it...

01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:37.540
should take it himself.

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.270
It's not your fault to take
the elixir according to your fate.

01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:25.850
But you're immortal.

01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:30.520
Isn't that what you want?

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.650
Xiao Bai.

01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:37.260
I know that becoming immortal is
the most important thing to you.

01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:39.170
I'm willing to do it for you.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.770
I'm...

01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:44.410
willing to give you the elixir as a gift.

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.140
You can become a real fox spirit.

01:50:48.190 --> 01:50:49.660
And a good one.

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:52.720
If my life...

01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:54.440
can make my dearest families
or lover fulfill their wishes.

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.130
I won't consider it as "waste".

01:50:56.630 --> 01:50:57.680
Fame is nothing more than a weapon.

01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:01.070
which will make me more
capable of protecting others.

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:05.890
Zijin.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.070
Is this really what I want?

01:52:58.730 --> 01:52:59.320
Grandma!

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.050
You're always in a daze.

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.360
The neighbors are asking...

01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:06.770
Why don't you become an official...

01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:08.460
after passing the exam?

01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:12.830
Grandma.

01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:14.700
Zijin doesn't have ambitions...

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.560
and abilities to be an official.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:19.400
It's a big deal for me...

01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.330
to take care of you for Brother Daoran.

01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:28.280
You always look unhappy.

01:53:30.810 --> 01:53:32.840
I always feel like I've forgotten lots of things...

01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:35.820
but I don't remember what they are.

01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:19.690
Come.

01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:21.460
come here!

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:27.650
Don't be afraid!

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:34.720
Why are you hurt?

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.090
Are you in pain?

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.230
Can I take you home?

01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:41.540
Then I'll treat you.

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:45.370
Do you have a name?

01:54:46.290 --> 01:54:47.480
Let me give you a name.

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.360
How about...

01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:52.610
How about Xiao Bai?

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:53.820
Do you like it?

01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:05.750
Zijin.

01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:10.980
I wish you hadn't met me.

01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:18.790
Then.

01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:22.660
there would only be one less
nine-tailed fox spirit in the world.

01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:33.190
Zijin.

01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:35.950
I'm going to be immortal.

01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:39.670
This is the last time I lied to you.

01:55:54.170 --> 01:55:55.950
With immortals from the heaven and the earth.

01:55:57.150 --> 01:55:59.660
if the scholar Wang Zijin could be reborn...

01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:03.130
I.Thirteen Bai.am willing
to give up my life's work...

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.310
and take the punishment of
the thunder and earthquake.

01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:43.220
Idiot.

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.850
there's no more Thirteen.

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.290
You'll forget everything.

01:56:50.230 --> 01:56:52.660
You'll be the same old Zijin.

01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.840
Okay...

01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:34.360
only the snake will dance
with the sound of the flute.

01:57:38.690 --> 01:57:40.500
From the beginning...

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:44.830
I doubt that the deaths of
juniors of foxes were no accidents.

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.960
It's the difficulty you set for yourself.

01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:52.290
Thirteen might be the only pity.

01:57:53.230 --> 01:57:55.170
That kid will finally become immortal.

01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.730
How can you know that he's not happy now.

01:57:58.050 --> 01:57:59.490
and he won't be happy in the future?

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:12.650
Granny Li's chicken was missing.

01:58:12.650 --> 01:58:13.740
Did you steal it?

01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:14.760
Say something!

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:16.560
I found them!

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:17.550
I found the chickens!

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:18.080
Mum!

01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:20.270
I found them!

01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:21.210
I found the chickens!

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.520
Sorry...

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.290
I got you wrong.

01:58:33.650 --> 01:58:34.520
Remember.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:36.480
Never steal other people's chickens.

01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:37.260
Did you understand?

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.000
Drink as much wine as you like at home.
