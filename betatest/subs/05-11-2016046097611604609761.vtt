the job? And how'd you get it?

They contacted me yesterday
in a panic.

I guess their caterer cancelled.

178
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.565
But they found my food blog
and read my bio and...

179
00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.668
-Wanted to know if I catered.
-If you cater?

180
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.970

on Chicago's top-chef list

Ooh. let me know
if you need a taste tester.

He's in the playroom.

I'm so excited.
now that Jordan's in pre-school.

204

I can really launch
this catering business.

205
00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:43.123
No doubt. You've sacrificed
a lot staying out with Jordan.

206
00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:45.125
Now it's your time to shine.

207
00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:46.793
You're a magnificent chef

208
00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:49.296

her first catering job in years?

The luncheon is this Saturday.

216
00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:09.650
so I won't be able to make it
to your college reunion.

217

Oh.

218
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.655

I really wanted to see you

alumni-of-the-year award.

that if this luncheon goes well.

221
00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.761
then I could potentially
sign a contract

be busy working the whole time.

No. No way. You have to go
accept your award.

I'll ask my dad if he can
keep Jordan for the weekend.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:07.440
Well. let's. uh.
let's have a drink.

335
00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:11.010
Social media... bringing
old friends together.

336
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.082
[laughs]

337
00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:29.295
So I never crossed your mind
after all these years?

338
00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:33.199
Never thought
about looking me up?

339
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.504
Of course I thought about it.

340
00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:40.206
I thought about you. too.

341
00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:44.377
After all.
you never forget your first.

342
00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:49.248
Well. to first love.

343
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.954
It's not the kind of first
I was talking about.

344
00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.256
Ah. yes. I...

345
00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.993
I was your first.

346
00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:03.396
And dare I say. the best.

347
00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.533
-[cell phone ringing]
-Uh. sorry.

348
00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.303
Will you excuse me?

349
00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.906
-Okay?
-Of course.

350
00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:15.941
Hey. babe. What's up?

351
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.444
The luncheon was great. Malik.
They loved everything!

352
00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:22.014
The appetizers. the entrees.
the desserts. everything!

353
00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:24.316
Ah. it's amazing. babe. See...

354
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.519
I-I'm so glad to hear it went
well. I knew you could do it.

355
00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.954
I think it went well enough
that it could set me up

356
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.523
for more catering jobs
at the gallery.

357
00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:32.625
Of course it did.
Your food is amazing.

358
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.428
I'm so proud of you. Michelle.

359
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.163
Well. look. I know you gotta
get back to your friends--

360
00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.031
Yeah. I can't wait to hear
all about it. okay?

361
00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:40.366
I love you. Bye.

362
00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:45.104
Sorry about that.

363
00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.507
-Wifey checking in?
-Where were we?

364
00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:50.543
I believe I was in the middle
of telling you

365
00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:52.445
that you were my best.

366
00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.651
I got your refill.

367
00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:01.721
Single malt. right?

368
00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:02.922
Right.

369
00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.664
Well. this is my room.

370
00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:17.403
Thanks for walking me
to my door. Malik.

371
00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.571
Of course.

372
00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.943
Goodnight. Rayna.

373
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.278
Malik. wait.

374
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:32.651
Wait.

375
00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:42.294
No. no. no.
we can't do this. Rayna.

376
00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.663
We can do whatever we want.

377
00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:50.269
[intense music]

378
00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.711
[groans]

379
00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:30.109
Oh...

380
00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.143
Good morning. love.

381
00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:34.180
[gasps]
Rayna.

382
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.149
You were insatiable last night!

383
00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:40.586
-Um. uh. Rayna. I gotta go.
-Why?

384
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:41.787
I-I'm gonna miss my flight.
okay?

385
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.557
Oh. no. just. you know.
stay in bed.

386
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.293
-You can catch a later flight.
-No. Rayna. Look.

387
00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:49.528
This was a mistake. Okay?

388
00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.132
I don't even remember
what happened last night.

389
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.101
[laughs] I'm happy
to refresh your memory.

390
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:59.238
No. No. Rayna! Rayna!
Stop. Okay?

391
00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:03.242
We're both married.
This should not have happened.

392
00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:05.311
What are you saying?

393
00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:08.314
I'm saying I love my wife.

394
00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:11.751
I... We can't see each other
anymore.

395
00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.453
We're not in college anymore.
Malik.

396
00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.256
We're two consenting adults.

397
00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.791
Nobody has to know about us.

398
00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.093
Us? Us...

399
00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:23.829
Don't say that. don't say "Us."
Th-that is. us is not a thing.

400
00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:26.532
But. sweetie. we had such
a great connection last night--

401
00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:29.769
No. There's nothing else
to discuss here. Rayna.

402
00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:31.570
This never happened.

403
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.707
Now. I gotta go.

404
00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:39.645
Okay.

405
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.515
I understand.

406
00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:48.120
Look. I'm-I'm sorry. Rayna.

407
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.592
[door opens]

408
00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:56.429
[door shuts]

409
00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:59.365
[intense music]

410
00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:27.293
Hey. so when do you think you'll
have that brief ready for me?

411
00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:29.361
Damn. you're really grinding
nowadays.

412
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.263
A brother can't even chill
without you driving us

413
00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:32.865
hard as ever even though

414
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.534
you won the biggest case
of our career two months ago.

415
00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:38.671
Well. putting Simion away
was just the first step.

416
00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:41.674
I mean. I'm proud of that. but
justice never sleeps. my friend.

417
00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:44.176
Yeah. not with you at the helm.

418
00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:45.945
Who else can run
for district attorney?

419
00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.580
-Yeah.
-[Sterling] Nobody.

420
00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:50.449
Chicago's next DA
is gonna be Malik Tucker.

421
00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:52.218
Sterling. what can I do for you?

422
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.686
I'm off to lunch.
but wanted to make sure you've

423
00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.654
got the mayor's golf tournament
on your schedule.

424
00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:59.392
-Yes. we do. sir.
-Yeah. looking forward to it.

425
00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.593
[Sterling] Getting
Mayor Duncan's endorsement

426
00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.861
is gonna seal the deal for you.

427
00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:02.862
Wanna make sure that we leave

428
00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:03.963
this office in good hands

429
00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.331
when the voters send me to the

430
00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.665
governor's mansion in the fall.

431
00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:08.334
Well. we'll be sure to RSVP.
sir.

432
00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.502
Good man.

433
00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:20.162
Oh. I was the second chair

434
00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.498
of the biggest case
this office ever prosecuted

435
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:23.733
and he acts like
I'm the invisible man.

436
00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:25.401
Well. relax. Garrett.

437
00:21:25.434 --> 00:21:26.769
Sterling is gonna make sure
his whole crew

438
00:21:26.802 --> 00:21:28.337
is taken care of
before he leaves.

439
00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.673
[cell phone beeping]

440
00:21:37.847 --> 00:21:41.484
-What's wrong?
-Uh. nothing.

441
00:21:41.517 --> 00:21:45.288
Dawg. that face clearly says
something's wrong. Spill it.

442
00:21:46.622 --> 00:21:49.325
Okay. uh...

443
00:21:49.358 --> 00:21:52.361
You remember when I went back
to my college reunion?

444
00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.430
Yeah. and I told your ass
not to go

445
00:21:54.463 --> 00:21:55.798
because your ex
is gonna be there.

446
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.834
Yeah. Well. something happened.

447
00:22:02.939 --> 00:22:04.907
What happened?

448
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:08.711
I had a few too many drinks
and one thing led to another.

449
00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:12.615
and... next thing I knew. I was
waking up in Rayna's hotel room.

450
00:22:12.648 --> 00:22:14.684
I don't even remember
how I got there.

451
00:22:14.717 --> 00:22:16.719
What do you mean you don't
remember how you got there?

452
00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.554
I don't know.
It was all a blur. man.

453
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:20.323
Why didn't you tell me?

454
00:22:20.356 --> 00:22:21.958
I mean. does Michelle know
you slept with her?

455
00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:23.759
Of course she doesn't know!
Will you keep your voice down?

456
00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:25.761
Man! You crazy?

457
00:22:25.795 --> 00:22:27.196
No. I didn't tell her.

458
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.299
-I don't wanna die.
-Yeah.

459
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:32.268
I've known Michelle longer than
you. and she don't play that.

460
00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:33.603
No. she don't.

461
00:22:33.636 --> 00:22:36.205
Oh. and don't let Terri
find out.

462
00:22:36.239 --> 00:22:39.275
Well. you think I don't know
that? She'd kill me twice.

463
00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:40.977
You would never find my body.

464
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.813
Look. just tell Rayna
what the rules are.

465
00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:45.314
What happened at the reunion

466
00:22:45.348 --> 00:22:47.450
stays buried at the reunion.
period.

467
00:22:47.483 --> 00:22:50.286
Yeah. she's just not
getting the message. bro.

468
00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:52.255
I deleted her number
after that night

469
00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:55.258
and she just
keeps getting new numbers.

470
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.260
She won't stop hitting me up.
I mean. look.

471
00:23:00.396 --> 00:23:01.597
Yeah.

472
00:23:04.534 --> 00:23:06.502
Yeah.

473
00:23:06.536 --> 00:23:08.938
All right. Close your mouth now.

474
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:11.274
She sent that an hour ago.

475
00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:14.310
-The thirst is real.
-[Malik] You're telling me?

476
00:23:14.343 --> 00:23:17.380
Um. since I am single.

477
00:23:17.413 --> 00:23:18.681
you could at least
give her my number

478
00:23:18.714 --> 00:23:20.583
before you block her again.

479
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:22.685
Okay. give me my phone back.

480
00:23:22.718 --> 00:23:24.854
What woman would want
your number. Garrett?

481
00:23:24.887 --> 00:23:27.523
Does anybody in this office
knock before they enter?

482
00:23:27.557 --> 00:23:29.425
Got some intel
on that Jackson DePaul case

483
00:23:29.458 --> 00:23:32.094
you were looking for. Malik.
Very interesting reading.

484
00:23:32.094 --> 00:23:34.397
Thank you. Maria. That was fast.

485
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.532
And I can always count on her.

486
00:23:36.566 --> 00:23:37.800
Hey. just make sure when you

487
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:39.669
become DA.
I get a hefty raise.

488
00:23:39.702 --> 00:23:42.405
Oh. you'll be the first one.
Maria.

489
00:23:42.438 --> 00:23:44.707
-Wait. what about me?
-[Maria] Oh. yeah.

490
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.375
He's only giving raises
to people

491
00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:48.611
that actually work. Garrett.

492
00:23:48.644 --> 00:23:50.646
Hey. will you be able to get
any intel on the Wharton case

493
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.448
for me before you leave
for vacation?

494
00:23:52.481 --> 00:23:54.483
Yeah. of course. I'm not leaving
for Costa Rica...

495
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:56.319
-For a few weeks.
-Okay. Solid.

496
00:23:56.352 --> 00:23:59.121
Any room for me
in that suitcase. Gonzalez?

497
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:00.523
Happy to rub suntan oil

498
00:24:00.556 --> 00:24:02.658
all over
those hard-to-reach areas.

499
00:24:02.692 --> 00:24:04.560
Oh. I bet you would.

500
00:24:04.594 --> 00:24:07.463
{\an8}
[speaking in foreign language]

501
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.502
Y'all are just gonna talk
about me in front of my face?

502
00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:15.671
-No <i>hablo</i> English?
-No <i>hablo</i> English. no.

503
00:24:15.705 --> 00:24:17.840
You know what? It's cool.

504
00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:21.544
Kiss my <i>culo.</i>
How's that for Spanish?

505
00:24:21.577 --> 00:24:24.480
<i>-Muy bien!</i>
-Yeah. It's pretty good.

506

<i>Muy bien!</i>

507
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:32.655
Michelle?

508
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:36.792
Michelle? Anybody home?

509
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:43.432
Ah. What's all this?

510
00:24:43.466 --> 00:24:48.104
This is a special dinner for
the best husband in the world.

511
00:24:48.104 --> 00:24:50.473
And what about Jordan?

512
00:24:50.506 --> 00:24:53.576
-With Terri.
-For the night. Mrs. Tucker?

513
00:24:53.609 --> 00:24:56.512
For the whole night. Mr. Tucker.

514
00:24:56.546 --> 00:25:00.516
[chuckles] Well. in that case.
I propose we skip dinner

515
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:01.851
and go straight to dessert.

516
00:25:01.884 --> 00:25:03.519
[laughs]

517
00:25:03.553 --> 00:25:05.821
Let's talk
so I can share some news.

518
00:25:05.855 --> 00:25:07.790
Wait. what news?

519
00:25:07.823 --> 00:25:11.460
Well. I got a call today

520
00:25:11.494 --> 00:25:13.763
and your awesome wife
just got hired

521
00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:15.698
to cater another event
this Friday.

522
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:19.669
Hey. congratulations!
Chicago's best chef is back!

523
00:25:19.702 --> 00:25:22.071
I am so proud of you. babe.

524
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:25.608
Thanks to you.
the best husband. I did it.

525
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:27.443
Wait. what do you mean
thanks to me?

526
00:25:27.476 --> 00:25:30.513
Well. if you hadn't pushed me
to skip your reunion.

527
00:25:30.546 --> 00:25:32.415
I never would have done it.

528
00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.719
Yeah. Darling. you did it
all by yourself. babe.

529
00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:39.755
And you know what. soon you will
be the most celebrated chef

530
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:42.491
in Chicago. and we can finally
start talking

531
00:25:42.525 --> 00:25:44.961
about you opening
that restaurant you wanted.

532
00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:46.963
Thank you. baby.

533
00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:49.465
Now. come here.

534
00:25:49.498 --> 00:25:50.867
Malik. what are you doing?

535
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.702
-We have to eat!
-You thought I was playing. huh?

536
00:25:52.735 --> 00:25:55.404
-We're going to dessert. Uh-huh.

Of course. babe.
I love you. too.

00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:32.575
And I would never do anything
to hurt you.

I know.

548
00:26:39.148 --> 00:26:41.918
I need to tell you
something. babe.

00:26:41.951 --> 00:26:44.754
-Mm-hmm.
-[cell phone vibrating]

550

When I went back
for my college reunion...

551
00:27:06.642 --> 00:27:07.843
Michelle?

552

Hey. babe?

553
00:27:40.877 --> 00:27:42.778
Heading out already?

554
00:27:42.812 --> 00:27:44.981
Yeah. I'm surprising Michelle
at this art show

555
00:27:45.081 --> 00:27:46.616
she's catering in Hyde Park.

556
00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:48.718
Oh. Well. tell Michelle
I said congrats.

557
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:50.553
The girl can burn.
so I know she'll do her thing.

558
00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:51.821
Yeah. well. why don't you
tell her yourself

559
00:27:51.854 --> 00:27:53.556
and come with me. Garrett?

560
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:56.092
Why would I go to an art gallery
on a Friday night?

561
00:27:56.092 --> 00:27:58.528
Well. Michelle's nervous
about getting back

562
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:00.263
into the food scene.
so she could use the support

563
00:28:00.296 --> 00:28:03.132
from one of our oldest friends.

564
00:28:03.165 --> 00:28:05.668
-No. I'm good.
-Wow. Okay.

565
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:07.169
Well. just saying.
there's bound to be like

566
00:28:07.203 --> 00:28:08.971
a ton of single
and available women

567
00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:10.640
just waiting
to be swept off their feet

568
00:28:10.673 --> 00:28:12.308
and free food and booze.
so your broke ass

569
00:28:12.341 --> 00:28:13.776
doesn't have to spend
for real date.

570
00:28:13.809 --> 00:28:16.045
But maybe you're not
into that. so...

571
00:28:16.045 --> 00:28:18.581
Uh-uh... Why didn't you
say that in the first place?

572
00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.284
[instrumental music]

573
00:28:28.658 --> 00:28:30.293
-This is interesting.
-Yeah.

574
00:28:31.127 --> 00:28:32.828
Okay.

575
00:28:32.862 --> 00:28:34.730
You didn't say there'd be masks.

576
00:28:34.764 --> 00:28:37.833
That's 'cause I didn't know.
bro.

577
00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:40.136
-I feel like the Dark Knight.
-[laughs]

578
00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:42.338
Freaky. I like it.

579
00:28:42.371 --> 00:28:44.240
Of course you do.

580
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:47.610
[Garrett]
What's Terri doing here?

581
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:50.846
Oh. well. Michelle asked her
to help out with the event.

582
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.982
You know. Terri is
the only woman I've ever met

583
00:28:53.082 --> 00:28:55.084
that seems to be immune
to your charms.

584
00:28:55.084 --> 00:28:56.886
Yeah. she's just
overly protective

585
00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:58.588
of her cousin. that's all.

586
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:00.856
She did help raise Michelle
when her mom died.

587
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.092
I know. I know. her heart
is in the right place.

588
00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:06.128
but I just. I'll never be good
enough for Michelle. you know?

589
00:29:06.162 --> 00:29:08.731
What kind of freaky shit
is this?

590
00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:14.003
You see this?

591
00:29:14.103 --> 00:29:17.139
Boy. this is hot.
That ass gets a pass.

592
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:18.708
[intense music]

593
00:29:18.741 --> 00:29:19.942
[Garrett] You see this?

594
00:29:22.712 --> 00:29:23.946
Wait a second.

[Malik] No...

[indistinct chatter]

600
00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:45.635
I just told you about him.
He's here.

601
00:29:45.668 --> 00:29:48.237
-That's your husband?
-Yeah.

602
00:29:48.271 --> 00:29:50.072
-Introduce me.
-Come on.

603
00:29:56.186 --> 00:29:58.054
Yeah. it was a. a surprise.

604
00:29:58.088 --> 00:30:01.758
Oh. Aw. this is so sweet.
Thank you.

605
00:30:01.792 --> 00:30:03.693
Oh. I want you to meet Rayna.

606
00:30:03.727 --> 00:30:07.197
She's the photographer
of this amazing exhibit.

607
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.166
Rayna. this is my husband.
Malik Tucker.

608
00:30:09.199 --> 00:30:12.202
It's nice to meet you. Malik.

609
00:30:12.235 --> 00:30:14.638
I feel like I know you
from somewhere.

610
00:30:14.671 --> 00:30:17.941
No. No. I don't think so.

611
00:30:17.974 --> 00:30:19.776
Are you sure we've never met
anywhere?

612
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.878
[Michelle] Oh. it's probably
from the news

613
00:30:21.912 --> 00:30:24.314
because Malik's face has been
all over the place

614
00:30:24.347 --> 00:30:26.783
since he won the Simion Blake
trial two months ago.

615
00:30:26.817 --> 00:30:29.853
[laughs] Oh. Maybe that's it.

616
00:30:29.886 --> 00:30:31.354
[Michelle] Uh.
I see you have your mask.

617
00:30:31.388 --> 00:30:32.823
But why aren't you wearing it?

618
00:30:32.856 --> 00:30:34.191
Yeah. what's. uh.

619
00:30:34.224 --> 00:30:35.826
what's with the masks anyway?

620
00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:38.728
Oh. I love masquerade nights.

621
00:30:38.762 --> 00:30:41.064
People can hide their faces
and be free.

622
00:30:41.098 --> 00:30:42.933
be who they truly are.

623
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:46.002
I find that everyone
wears a mask.

624
00:30:46.036 --> 00:30:48.738
pretending to be someone
that they're not.

625
00:30:48.772 --> 00:30:50.173
I'm sure you find that
to be the case

626
00:30:50.207 --> 00:30:52.709
in your line of work. too.
Malik.

627
00:30:52.742 --> 00:30:54.244
Isn't that a fun idea. honey?

628
00:30:54.277 --> 00:30:56.713
Your wife did an amazing job
tonight.

629
00:30:56.746 --> 00:30:58.749
Everyone is raving
about her food.

630
00:30:58.782 --> 00:31:01.785
Well. my wife is very talented.

631
00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:04.154
You're a lucky man.
Malik Tucker.

632
00:31:04.187 --> 00:31:06.056
Yes. I am.

633
00:31:07.891 --> 00:31:09.693
We should take a video
for social media

634
00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:11.328
to promote Michelle.

635
00:31:11.361 --> 00:31:13.196

-That was so much fun!
-Oh.

if you want to promote yourself.

652
00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:01.845
especially since you're
returning to the food scene

653
00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:04.347
after being away
for a couple of years.

your wife with the world?

Ah. my wife's food
speaks for itself.

657
00:32:15.525 --> 00:32:17.994
She doesn't need to do
all that social-media stuff.

658
00:32:17.994 --> 00:32:19.362
Oh. well. I don't know. honey.

659
00:32:19.396 --> 00:32:21.131
I mean.
my followers have doubled

660
00:32:21.164 --> 00:32:22.833
since I announced
that I was doing this event

661
00:32:22.866 --> 00:32:24.034
and I tagged Rayna's gallery.

662
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:26.736
Yes. Michelle!

663
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.006
We'll talk about more things
we could do together next week.

664
00:32:30.006 --> 00:32:32.375
[Michelle] Oh. have you seen
Rayna's photos?

665
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:36.513
Yeah.
it's... quite the collection.

666
00:32:36.546 --> 00:32:40.450

my most personal work.

00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:45.756
I tried to get her to tell me
who the man was in the photos.

669
00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:48.191
but she wouldn't reveal
her subject.

670
00:32:48.225 --> 00:32:51.795
I told her
it's our little secret.

671
00:32:51.828 --> 00:32:54.397
I'm sure you can appreciate
discretion. Malik.

672

Hey. are you ready to go. babe?

673
00:32:59.302 --> 00:33:01.471
Uh. yeah. I just have to
finish up some stuff and pack up

674
00:33:01.505 --> 00:33:02.773
and then I'll see you at home.

675

Will you two excuse me?

677
00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:07.310
I think I see someone
interested

678
00:33:07.344 --> 00:33:09.880
in making a purchase.

679
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.383
It was very nice
to meet you. Malik.

680
00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:15.085
[Rayna] Michelle.
we'll talk soon.

681
00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:16.987
-Okay. Yeah.
-See you later.

682
00:33:22.025 --> 00:33:25.028
Ah. you and Rayna
seem pretty close already.

683
00:33:25.061 --> 00:33:28.465
We really vibe.
She's so much fun to work with.

684
00:33:28.498 --> 00:33:31.001
And it's just nice to feel
a little creative stimulation

685
00:33:31.001 --> 00:33:34.337
after being at home
with a toddler for so long.

686
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:36.006
And as you can tell
from the photos.

687
00:33:36.006 --> 00:33:39.342
she. she is super talented.

688
00:33:39.376 --> 00:33:42.913
Her gallery is really gonna help
revitalize the neighborhood.

689
00:33:43.013 --> 00:33:45.515
Well. uh. wait.
Rayna owns the gallery?

690
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:48.885
Yeah. she renovated the loft
upstairs where she's living.

691
00:33:48.919 --> 00:33:51.188
Oh. I'm just glad she's pleased
with my second catering job.

692
00:33:51.221 --> 00:33:53.256
Uh. wait. se-second catering?

693
00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.125
Y-you've worked with Rayna
before?

694
00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:56.593
Yeah. Didn't I tell you?

695
00:33:56.626 --> 00:33:59.129
Rayna was the one that
found me on social media

696
00:33:59.162 --> 00:34:01.565
and booked me for the luncheon
during your reunion weekend.

697
00:34:30.594 --> 00:34:31.995
Rayna!

698
00:34:34.564 --> 00:34:36.399
You're so photogenic. Malik.

699
00:34:36.433 --> 00:34:38.201
What the hell are you doing.
Rayna?

700
00:34:38.235 --> 00:34:40.036
-What do you mean. baby?
-No. cut it out.

701
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.506
Cut. cut all that shit out.
okay?

702
00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:45.008
What are you doing
with Michelle?

703
00:34:45.008 --> 00:34:48.311
She's a talented caterer and
I needed someone for our show.

704
00:34:48.345 --> 00:34:51.848
No. stop... Stop it!
Stay away from Michelle!

705
00:34:54.684 --> 00:34:57.287
I've been trying to reach you
so we can talk.

706
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.555
Did you get my messages?

707
00:34:58.588 --> 00:35:00.290
Yeah. you gotta stop
all that. okay?

708
00:35:00.323 --> 00:35:02.459
Stop the calls. stop the texts.
stop the voicemails.

709
00:35:02.492 --> 00:35:05.462
All of it. Rayna.
I love my wife.

710
00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:08.298
But what about us?

711
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:10.367
No. I told you already.
there is no us.

712
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.371
[laughs] That's where
you're wrong. Malik.

713
00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:17.274
I'm pregnant with our baby!

714
00:35:19.176 --> 00:35:22.279
Preg... Wa-wait.
wh-what do you mean pregnant?

715
00:35:22.312 --> 00:35:24.047
-You can't be pregnant.
-Yes.

716
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.081
No. you can't.
you can't be preg...

717
00:35:25.115 --> 00:35:26.583
I saw the condom wrapper.

718
00:35:26.616 --> 00:35:28.518
Yes. the first time.

719
00:35:28.552 --> 00:35:31.054
As for the second time.

720
00:35:31.088 --> 00:35:33.523
I guess we both got
a little too caught up.

721
00:35:36.193 --> 00:35:38.195
Well. h-how do you even know
it's my baby. huh?

722
00:35:38.228 --> 00:35:40.263
Malik. my love.

723
00:35:40.297 --> 00:35:43.233
you're the only one
I've been with.

724
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:45.402
What-what kind of game
are you playing here. Rayna?

725
00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:48.405
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

726
00:35:48.438 --> 00:35:51.475
I'm not trying
to ruin your life. baby.

727
00:35:51.508 --> 00:35:54.010
I'm just trying to plan
for our future. sweetheart.

728
00:35:54.044 --> 00:35:56.546
There is no future for us.

729
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.648
Uh. what about your husband.
huh?

730
00:35:58.682 --> 00:36:00.517
What husband?

731
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.119
Uh. this guy.

732
00:36:12.496 --> 00:36:15.966
You ca... You-you can't
go through with this.

733
00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:19.970
Rayna. you're gonna destroy
my family.

734
00:36:20.003 --> 00:36:24.474
Oh. baby... we're
your new family now.

735
00:36:44.694 --> 00:36:46.663
-[knocking on door]
-Hey. you wanted to see me?

736
00:36:46.696 --> 00:36:49.599
-Yeah. come in. Close the door.
-Sure.

737
00:36:50.767 --> 00:36:54.004
So what case is this for?

738
00:36:54.037 --> 00:36:56.440
This conversation
isn't tied to a case.

739
00:36:56.473 --> 00:36:58.141
It's personal. Maria.

740
00:36:58.175 --> 00:37:00.444
And I'd like it
to just stay between us.

741
00:37:00.477 --> 00:37:02.612
No problem. boss. Who is it?

742
00:37:09.086 --> 00:37:10.687
-"Rayna Parsons?"
-Yeah.

743
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.356
Those are all the details
I have now.

744
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.425
I want you to find out
everything you can about her.

745
00:37:15.459 --> 00:37:18.228
And. like I said.
just keep it between us.

746
00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:19.563
I heard you the first time.

747
00:37:19.596 --> 00:37:22.099
Do you know
if the woman is dangerous?

748
00:37:22.132 --> 00:37:25.535
I don't. but. uh.
you know. just be safe.

749
00:37:26.336 --> 00:37:27.671
Okay.

750
00:37:33.477 --> 00:37:35.212
You slept with her.

751
00:37:36.513 --> 00:37:39.616
Never mind. I already know.

752
00:37:39.649 --> 00:37:42.486
Uh. I just need you to figure
out what she's planning.

753
00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:45.288
All right. Maria? That's all.

754
00:37:45.322 --> 00:37:47.424
A word of advice. my friend.

755
00:37:47.457 --> 00:37:49.760
you should really
tell your wife. Malik.

756
00:37:51.294 --> 00:37:53.330
Well. I can't. okay?

757
00:37:53.363 --> 00:37:56.366
Not yet. Not until I know
what she's up to.

758
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:18.437
so you need to make sure
and get

759
00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:20.106
the mayor's endorsement
at his golf tournament.

760
00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:21.574
Absolutely.
yeah. I'm looking forward

761
00:38:21.607 --> 00:38:22.608
to beating him on the length--

762
00:38:22.642 --> 00:38:24.143
No. you're not beating anybody.

763
00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:26.546
The mayor wins
his own golf tournament.

764
00:38:26.579 --> 00:38:29.615
Oh. it's like that. Okay.
Well. you know me well.

765
00:38:29.649 --> 00:38:32.118
I don't like to lose.
but I know how to play the game.

766
00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:33.653
Hey. you've done a great job
in the ADA office.

767
00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:35.321
And you've taken on
the toughest cases.

768
00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.689
you've mastered
Chicago politics.

769
00:38:36.722 --> 00:38:38.057
This. I mean. it's the next

770
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.192
logical step in your career.

771
00:38:39.225 --> 00:38:40.493
Thank you. Sterling.

772
00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:42.728
I appreciate your faith.
Yeah. I'm ready.

773
00:38:42.762 --> 00:38:44.597
You gotta know
that when you take the top spot.

774
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.265
you got a bull's eye
painted on your back.

775
00:38:46.299 --> 00:38:47.533
And in Chicago.
sometimes it's tough

776
00:38:47.567 --> 00:38:50.036
to tell the good guys
from the bad.

777
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:53.039
Hm. Well. I'm aware of that.

778
00:38:54.807 --> 00:38:57.710
[intense music]

779
00:39:04.083 --> 00:39:06.319
[Sterling] Uh. Malik?

780
00:39:06.352 --> 00:39:08.454
Hey. You listening?

781
00:39:12.425 --> 00:39:14.760
Uh. yeah. yeah.
I'm sorry. I just...

782
00:39:14.794 --> 00:39:16.729
Look. you just make sure

783
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:18.731
there's no skeletons
in your closet. okay?

784
00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:21.167
Because if Mayor Duncan
extends his political capital

785
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.736
and endorses you.
he damn well better not end up

786
00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:26.572
with egg on his face.
Hey. look at me.

787
00:39:26.606 --> 00:39:28.741
I better not end up
regretting it. either.

788
00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:31.644
Understood. sir.

789
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:34.146
Okay. Good. Let's eat.

790
00:39:43.556 --> 00:39:44.790
[cell phone ringing]

791
00:39:47.193 --> 00:39:49.795
Hey. Maria.
tell me you found something.

792
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:52.798
I pulled a copy of Rayna's
hotel receipt from the reunion.

793
00:39:52.832 --> 00:39:55.601
But when I ran a check
on the address she put down.

794
00:39:55.635 --> 00:39:58.471
it turned out to be fake.
No such location exists.

795
00:39:58.504 --> 00:40:00.406
Wouldn't the hotel have flagged
the fake address

796
00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:02.341
when they ran her credit card
at check-in?

797
00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:04.177
Yeah. that's
the other interesting thing.

798
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.880
Her room was pre-paid with
a credit card from GDW Holdings.

799
00:40:07.914 --> 00:40:09.782
Wait. why would a third party

800
00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:12.218
pay for her hotel room
at a college reunion?

801
00:40:12.251 --> 00:40:14.387
You tell me.
You went to college with her.

802
00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.157
Prior to that weekend. I hadn't
seen her since we graduated.

803
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:20.726
Well. she's definitely trying
to hide something.

804
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.229
-I'll keep digging.
-Okay. Thanks.

805
00:40:23.262 --> 00:40:27.300
And. Maria.
I think you're right.

806
00:40:27.333 --> 00:40:29.735
I-I do need to tell Michelle.

807
00:40:29.735 --> 00:40:31.404
Good luck with that one. <i>papi.</i>

808
00:40:31.437 --> 00:40:33.339
Yeah. thanks. Bye.

809
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.648
-[women screaming]
-Hey. Michelle!

810
00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:45.318
Michelle?

811
00:40:45.351 --> 00:40:47.486
Malik. you're just in time.

812
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.822
Rayna just told me
she's pregnant!

813
00:40:51.624 --> 00:40:54.560
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Malik.

814
00:40:54.594 --> 00:40:58.764
Oh. my God. I am so blessed.

815
00:40:58.764 --> 00:41:02.168
A baby on the way.
a new gallery.

816
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:05.271
an exciting
new business partner.

817
00:41:05.304 --> 00:41:08.241
Moving to Chicago is
the best thing I've ever done.

818
00:41:08.274 --> 00:41:11.644
Oh. We need champagne
to celebrate.

819
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:14.213
Sparkling cider for you.
little mama.

820
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.586
What the hell are you doing
in my house. Rayna?

821
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.588
-Stop it.
-Arrr!

822
00:41:22.622 --> 00:41:25.358
What? I had to drop off
your wife's check.

823
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:27.727
And we needed to discuss
her next catering event.

824
00:41:27.727 --> 00:41:30.329
Listen. what happened between us
was a mistake.

825
00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:32.565
Rayna. stay away from my family.
I'm not playing with you.

826
00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:34.634
What. baby. don't act like
you still don't have

827
00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:35.902
feelings for me.
come on. you and me.

828
00:41:35.935 --> 00:41:36.936
you know you still want me.

829
00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:38.738
And you can have me anytime.

830
00:41:38.738 --> 00:41:40.640
-Any place...
-Come on. stop!

831
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.308
[Michelle] Here we are.

832
00:41:42.341 --> 00:41:43.609
Hey. babe.

833
00:41:47.313 --> 00:41:50.216
Oh. my God.
I am so sorry. Michelle.

834
00:41:50.249 --> 00:41:53.252
I just realized that I have
another appointment downtown.

835
00:41:53.286 --> 00:41:55.421
So I need to leave now
or I'll never be able to make it

836
00:41:55.454 --> 00:41:57.356
with this traffic.

837
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.525
Here is your check.

838
00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:05.264
Thanks. I'm looking forward
to our next event.

839
00:42:05.298 --> 00:42:07.767
I've already started writing
down some menu suggestions.

840
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.901
[Rayna] Perfect!

841
00:42:08.935 --> 00:42:10.303
I'll call you next week

842
00:42:10.336 --> 00:42:11.437
so we can go over the details

843
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:12.505
for the gallery contract.

844
00:42:12.538 --> 00:42:15.474
Con-contract? What contract?

845
00:42:15.508 --> 00:42:18.411
I am launching a weekly mixer
at the gallery

846
00:42:18.444 --> 00:42:20.746
and Michelle agreed to cater.

847
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.715
After all. there are still
so many people

848
00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:25.618
who have yet to see <i>Reunited.</i>

849
00:42:25.718 --> 00:42:28.287
Come on. I'll walk you out.

850
00:42:28.321 --> 00:42:29.889
It's really happening.

851
00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:47.540
Thinking about jumping?

852
00:42:47.573 --> 00:42:50.443
It depends.
What you got for me. Maria?

853
00:42:50.476 --> 00:42:51.878
Did you know
Rayna never graduated

854
00:42:51.911 --> 00:42:54.046
from Wrightwood University?

855
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.449
What do you mean?
Uh. we were seniors together.

856
00:42:56.482 --> 00:42:58.417
I remember she missed graduation

857
00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:00.586
because she had to fly home
last minute for an emergency.

858
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.522
-Her dad got sick.
-Yeah.

859
00:43:02.555 --> 00:43:04.056
That may have been
what she told you.

860
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:07.760
but according to her transcript.
she never graduated.

861
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.762
In fact. the university
asked her to leave.

862
00:43:09.762 --> 00:43:10.930
What's this?

863
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:12.465
Your girl was writing bad checks

864
00:43:12.498 --> 00:43:13.833
to the school.
so they forced her

865
00:43:13.866 --> 00:43:15.701
to withdraw
and agreed not to press charges.

866
00:43:15.701 --> 00:43:17.470
Oh. you've gotta be kidding me.

867
00:43:17.503 --> 00:43:18.838
[scoffs] Nope.

868
00:43:18.871 --> 00:43:20.706
After her college scam.
she pretty much

869
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.708
fell off the radar
for a few years.

870
00:43:22.708 --> 00:43:24.977
[scoffs] This chick was gone
from the planet.

871
00:43:25.011 --> 00:43:26.712
Well. she said she spent

872
00:43:26.746 --> 00:43:28.714
a lot of time overseas
with her photography.

873
00:43:28.714 --> 00:43:30.950
Maybe that's why
you couldn't find anything.

874
00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:32.451
I don't care
where she's been. Malik.

875
00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:34.453
She's still
a United States citizen

876
00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:36.923
and needed to file taxes.
have some bank records.

877
00:43:36.956 --> 00:43:39.525
get a pap smear or something.

878
00:43:39.559 --> 00:43:42.328
Okay. so when did she resurface?

879
00:43:42.361 --> 00:43:43.896
About two years ago.

880
00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:49.735
Wait. Rayna's been to jail?

881
00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:51.737
Turns out your ex-girlfriend
was mixed up

882
00:43:51.737 --> 00:43:53.539
in a pill-mill scam in Florida.

883
00:43:53.573 --> 00:43:56.742
And just as the Miami DA
was about to charge her.

884
00:43:56.742 --> 00:44:00.079
someone made a call and suddenly
the charges were reduced.

885
00:44:00.112 --> 00:44:02.748
-Reduced?
-And by reduced. I mean dropped.

886
00:44:04.383 --> 00:44:06.352
So who made that call?

887
00:44:06.385 --> 00:44:08.454
That's what I'm trying
to figure out now.

888
00:44:08.487 --> 00:44:10.022
Why do I feel like
there's more bad news?

889
00:44:10.056 --> 00:44:12.925
Yeah. the other thing
that I found is

890
00:44:12.959 --> 00:44:14.894
she's currently listed
as the owner

891
00:44:14.927 --> 00:44:18.030
of the Mosaic Art Gallery
as of six months ago.

892
00:44:18.064 --> 00:44:21.100
But this chick has no
bank accounts. no tax records.

893
00:44:21.133 --> 00:44:23.903
nothing. Zilch. <i>Nada.</i>
<i>Esto no es bueno.</i>

894
00:44:23.936 --> 00:44:27.073
So how was she able
to lease an art gallery

895
00:44:27.106 --> 00:44:29.141
without
any financial information?

896
00:44:29.175 --> 00:44:30.843
I mean. I gotta hand it to her.

897
00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:32.745
-She's a crafty one.
-Yeah. you're telling me.

898
00:44:32.778 --> 00:44:34.847
As I was checking the lease
from Cochran Commercial.

899
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:36.883
I saw that she took over
the gallery space

900
00:44:36.916 --> 00:44:39.785
and is holding it
in the name of GDW Holdings.

901
00:44:39.819 --> 00:44:41.821
GDW. Wait. that's...

902
00:44:41.854 --> 00:44:43.523
That's the same name
of the company

903
00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:45.758
that paid for Rayna's
hotel room at the reunion

904
00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:48.127
and the same name
on the check she paid Michelle.

905
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.063
Who. who is behind
this GDW Holdings?

906
00:44:51.097 --> 00:44:53.099
I'm working on it.

907
00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:56.402
But whoever it is

908
00:44:56.435 --> 00:44:59.138
is trying really hard
to hide themselves. Malik.

909
00:44:59.172 --> 00:45:03.743
Okay. Okay.
Uh. just keep digging. Maria.

910
00:45:03.743 --> 00:45:06.445
I'm not gonna let this woman
destroy my life.

911
00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:09.415
I am not gotta let her
take everything I've worked for.

912
00:45:09.448 --> 00:45:10.750
You got it.

913
00:45:23.563 --> 00:45:25.998
-Yo. you gotta check this out.
-Uh. what is it. man?

914
00:45:26.032 --> 00:45:28.501
I have to finish this brief.
Sterling is on my ass.

915
00:45:28.534 --> 00:45:30.937
Trust me. Malik.
you're gonna wanna see this.

916
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.806
-Well. what is it?
<i>-Exciting news...</i>

917
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.007
[Garrett] Looks like
your girlfriend just announced

918
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:36.609
that she's pregnant
on social media.

919
00:45:36.709 --> 00:45:39.512
[sighs] Yeah. I know.

920
00:45:39.545 --> 00:45:41.013
And didn't you say
she was married?

921
00:45:41.047 --> 00:45:43.916
Her relationship status
now says. "Complicated."

922
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.719
Yeah. that's one word for it.

923
00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:48.955
You got something you want
to tell me?

924
00:45:48.988 --> 00:45:51.557
I mean. first you see your ex.

925
00:45:51.591 --> 00:45:53.459
who apparently is your own
personal kryptonite...

926
00:45:53.492 --> 00:45:54.493
Big mistake.

927
00:45:54.527 --> 00:45:55.995
Then the chick starts

928
00:45:56.028 --> 00:45:57.530
sexting you pics and videos

929
00:45:57.563 --> 00:45:58.798
and now she's no longer married

930
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:00.933
and expecting a baby?

931
00:46:00.967 --> 00:46:03.569
Bruh. what's going on?

932
00:46:03.603 --> 00:46:06.639
There's nothing going on.
Garrett.

933
00:46:06.739 --> 00:46:08.941
Dude. I'm your best friend. I
know when something's going on.

934
00:46:08.975 --> 00:46:12.612
But you know what. if that's how
you wanna play it. so be it.

935
00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:14.914
I can tell you where you can get
a good deal on a futon.

936
00:46:14.947 --> 00:46:16.048
You ready for lunch?

937
00:46:16.082 --> 00:46:17.183
No. man.
I'm not coming to lunch.

938
00:46:17.216 --> 00:46:19.485
I gotta finish this brief. okay?

939
00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:20.753
Whatever. man.

940
00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:36.169
You gotta be kidding me. This...

941
00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:40.806
Hm...

942
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.410
-He's so cute.
-Thank you.

943
00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:55.045
So how long have you been
a photographer?

944
00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:57.548
Uh. I started shooting
in college.

945
00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:59.650
My boyfriend
was my first subject.

946
00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:03.020
Boyfriend?
Ooh. that sounds juicy.

947
00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:04.822
Do you guys still keep in touch?

948
00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:06.590
We hadn't seen each other
in years.

949
00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:08.859
but we recently reconnected

950
00:47:08.893 --> 00:47:11.795
on social media.

951
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.398
You're so lucky to have
such a supportive husband.

952
00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:18.869
Malik is an amazing husband.

953
00:47:18.903 --> 00:47:20.604
He's really my best friend.

954
00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:23.541
He's successful and supportive
at the same time.

955
00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:24.675
[Michelle] Yeah.

956
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:29.413
I would really love
to have someone like that.

957
00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:36.854
If. if you don't mind my asking.

958
00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.923
is your boyfriend
excited about the baby?

959
00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.998
[Rayna sniffles]

960
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:49.466
[Michelle] Rayna...

961
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.168
[sobbing]

962
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:53.170
Oh. no. Rayna.
I'm. I'm so sorry.

963
00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:54.872
I didn't mean to pry.

964
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.173
It's okay.

965
00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.712
In addition
to eating everything in sight.

966
00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:04.248
I've been incredibly emotional
these days.

967
00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:06.550
Hormones can be
all over the place

968
00:48:06.584 --> 00:48:08.619
during your first trimester.

969
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.722
It's not that. It's just...

970
00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:15.259
What is it. Rayna?
You can tell me.

971
00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:17.561
I didn't plan
for this to happen.

972
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.198
And I'm kind of ashamed.

973
00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:26.237
I don't want you to hate me.

974
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:30.040
Hate you?
Rayna. why would I hate you?

975
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:34.044
You've done so much for me.
So. please. let me help you.

976
00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:35.813
Please don't judge me.

977
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.751
The father of my baby
is married.

978
00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:45.556
Married?

979
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:49.059
What is he saying
about the baby?

980
00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:51.762
What about his wife?

981
00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:55.699
He says he loves me
and he's gonna leave his wife.

982
00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:57.201
Oh.

983
00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:59.703
They haven't been happy
in years.

984
00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:01.138
He said that the passion died.

985
00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:04.742
but he hasn't left her yet.

986
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.545
Look. I'm sure everything
will work out for the best.

987
00:49:07.578 --> 00:49:10.080
You just take care of yourself
and you take care of that baby.

988
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:11.982
That's what's most important
right now.

989
00:49:12.016 --> 00:49:14.618
[clicks tongue]
You're such a good friend.

990
00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.821
-Oh.
-Thank you.

991
00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.926
Since moving to Chicago
I haven't met a lot of people.

992
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:25.229
so it's nice to have someone
to talk to.

993
00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:28.132
I'm here for you.
whatever you need.

994
00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:32.736
But what are you gonna do
about the father?

995
00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:36.841
He's given me no choice.

996
00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:43.180
I'm gonna tell him
that he needs to choose.

997
00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:44.815
It's between me...

998
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.151
or her.

999
00:49:50.221 --> 00:49:53.123
[thunder rumbling]

1000
00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:57.261
[siren wailing]

1001
00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:59.129
Hey. Malik.

1002
00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:00.764
Oh. we got an update?

1003
00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:03.701
-Check this out.
-What's this?

1004
00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.002
I stopped by the leasing company

1005
00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:07.338
Rayna's renting
the gallery space from.

1006
00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:10.074
Turns out she paid
for a full year up-front.

1007
00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:13.344
but this time with the cashier's
check from GDW Holdings

1008
00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.779
drawn from an account
with the Chicago Rivers Bank.

1009
00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:17.781
Okay. Okay.

1010
00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:20.718
So can we get access to the
bank records on that account?

1011
00:50:20.718 --> 00:50:22.286
That's my next stop tomorrow.

1012
00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.388
There has to be a name list
on the account somewhere.

1013
00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.357
so. hopefully.
we finally find out

1014
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:29.160
who's been making
all the payments.

1015
00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:30.728
Okay. That's great.
That's great. Maria.

1016
00:50:30.728 --> 00:50:31.896
Keep me posted. okay?

1017
00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:33.164
And don't take your foot
off the gas.

1018
00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:34.765
You got it. boss.

1019
00:50:43.808 --> 00:50:46.377
Babe. everything okay?

1020
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.880
[sighs] Malik. we need to talk.

1021
00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:52.149
Michelle. if you just
let me explain--

1022
00:50:52.183 --> 00:50:55.286
I am just so thankful
to have you.

1023
00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:57.221
You are?

1024
00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:59.824
I-I mean. I'm-I'm thankful. too.

1025
00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:04.028
So I had lunch with Rayna today
and she was telling me the story

1026
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.796
of how the father of her baby
is some

1027
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.399
unhappily married asshole.

1028
00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.768
She's having an affair
with a married man.

1029
00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:12.770
Oh. she-she told you that?
Married?

1030
00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.939
Yes. Malik.
It is a terrible situation.

1031
00:51:14.972 --> 00:51:16.707
She's waiting for him
to leave his wife

1032
00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:18.943
because he told her
that there's no passion anymore

1033
00:51:18.976 --> 00:51:20.778
and he wants to leave.

1034
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:23.013
I'm sure the wife has no idea.

1035
00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:25.182
I can't even imagine.

1036
00:51:25.216 --> 00:51:28.252
Uh. th-that sounds
like a terrible situation.

1037
00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:29.720
I just feel bad for the girl.

1038
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.056
I mean.
she clearly loves this man.

1039
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.757
Don't you think you're getting
a little too involved

1040
00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:35.392
in this woman's life?

1041
00:51:35.426 --> 00:51:37.728
I mean. you barely know her.

1042
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.030
Um. I don't want you
getting sucked into her drama

1043
00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:41.866
while you're trying
to re-launch your career.

1044
00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:44.969
[sighs] But. babe. she's been
so supportive of me.

1045
00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:48.105
And. look. look how my
social media following has grown

1046
00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:50.040
since I started working
with her.

1047
00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:52.476
And the Chicago Chef's Circle
is doing an interview with me.

1048
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:53.744
Look. that's wonderful. babe.

1049
00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:54.812
but this is all happening

1050
00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.014
because you're a great chef.

1051
00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:59.016
It's not 'cause of Rayna. okay?

1052
00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:01.118
You don't need her.

1053
00:52:01.152 --> 00:52:02.887
Well. I just signed
a contract with her

1054
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.421
for a series
of art and music mixers.

1055
00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:07.057
I can't just leave now.

1056
00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:09.493
Plus. Rayna really needs
this gallery to be successful

1057
00:52:09.527 --> 00:52:11.729
so she can take care
of her baby.

1058
00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:14.131
She doesn't have
an amazing husband like I do.

1059
00:52:14.165 --> 00:52:16.100
I just...

1060
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:18.002
She just doesn't seem
like the type of person

1061
00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:20.104
you want to be
in business with. babe.

1062
00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:21.839
much less be friends with.

1063
00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:24.074
Look. I just need
to get through these events

1064
00:52:24.108 --> 00:52:26.977
and. hopefully. that will lead
to some more catering clients.

1065
00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:31.015
Well. so. uh. did Rayna say

1066
00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:34.218
what she's gonna do
about the father of her baby?

1067
00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.921
She said she's gonna give him
an ultimatum.

1068
00:52:36.954 --> 00:52:40.057
It's either her and the baby.
or she's gonna tell his wife.

1069
00:52:42.793 --> 00:52:43.928
Huh.

1070
00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:48.165
[intense music]

1071
00:52:58.476 --> 00:53:01.212
Don't forget. Sterling told you
to let the mayor win.

1072
00:53:01.245 --> 00:53:03.180
You know how you get.

1073
00:53:03.214 --> 00:53:06.550
Well. look.
I will try my best to lose.

1074
00:53:06.584 --> 00:53:08.886
Oh. God. just saying the word.
that hurts.

1075
00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:11.522
[laughs] Do it for our family.

1076
00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.058
-And my restaurant.
-Okay.

1077
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:15.292
I'll be back tomorrow.
all right?

1078
00:53:15.326 --> 00:53:17.795
Hey. you be good
while I'm gone. okay?

1079
00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:19.964
[laughs] But don't have
too much fun. all right?

1080
00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:22.233
All right.
Wave goodbye to daddy.

1081
00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:32.209
{\an8}
[exhales] Look at the backyard
on this chick.

1082
00:53:32.243 --> 00:53:33.210
Malik...

1083
00:53:34.545 --> 00:53:35.880
Malik?

1084
00:53:37.148 --> 00:53:39.083
Uh. my fault. G.

1085
00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:42.520
I just. uh.
I got a lot on my mind. man.

1086
00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:46.924
Malik. mayor wanted to stop
and say hello.

1087
00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.659
-Good to see you. Malik.
-Hello again. mayor.

1088
00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:51.228
Thank you for inviting us
to your tournament.

1089
00:53:51.262 --> 00:53:53.464
You looked good
out on the links.

1090
00:53:53.497 --> 00:53:56.033
But not quite good enough
to beat me.

1091
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:58.969
[chuckles] No. sir. I just. uh.

1092
00:53:59.003 --> 00:54:00.204
I just couldn't quite
hit 'em straight.

1093
00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:02.673
Well. happens to the best of us.

1094
00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:04.074
Hm. this course is particularly

1095
00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:05.676
challenging.
that's why I like it.

1096
00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:07.545
[Sterling] Well. Richard.
like I told you.

1097
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:11.415
I think Malik Tucker will make
a fine district attorney.

1098
00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.184
I'm glad to hear that.

1099
00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:15.686
You've left some big shoes
to fill. Sterling.

1100
00:54:15.686 --> 00:54:17.888
I think Malik is more than up
for the challenge.

1101
00:54:17.922 --> 00:54:20.825
and I hope you'll consider
giving him your endorsement.

1102
00:54:23.894 --> 00:54:25.229
Keep your nose clean. son...

1103
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:28.299
-The job is yours.
-Thank you. sir.

1104
00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.900
[Sterling] I think you don't
have to worry about Malik.

1105
00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:32.336
He's a veritable Boy Scout.

1106
00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:36.340
Hm. That's what I like to hear.

1107
00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.175
Play your cards right
and the DA's office

1108
00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:41.245
will just be the first step
to the mayor's office.

1109
00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:44.415
It would be my pleasure to serve
the city of Chicago. sir.

1110
00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:46.484
Okay. mayor. we gotta go.

1111
00:54:47.485 --> 00:54:49.086
All right.

1112
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.354
Thanks again. sir.

1113
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.462
-Sounds like it's a done deal.
-Ah.

1114
00:54:58.496 --> 00:55:02.399
Here's to Chicago's next DA.

1115
00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:04.502
Well. it's not done
until it's done. Garrett.

1116
00:55:06.704 --> 00:55:09.173
But this was always the plan.
wasn't it?

1117
00:55:09.206 --> 00:55:12.543
[chuckles] Perfect life.
Perfect wife.

1118
00:55:14.211 --> 00:55:15.679
You got it all. man.

1119
00:55:17.982 --> 00:55:19.683
You know. you could have
the same thing. bro.

1120
00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:21.585
[scoffs] Yeah. right.

1121
00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.688
I mean. even though I was the
second chair to the Blake case.

1122
00:55:24.722 --> 00:55:26.690
Sterling and the king makers.

1123
00:55:26.724 --> 00:55:28.425
they don't see me
the way they see you.

1124
00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:30.928
Because you don't
play the game. bro.

1125
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:33.264
It's like you're not trying.

1126
00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:35.299
Look. I always play to win.
even if it means

1127
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:37.368
I have to lose to the mayor
to do it.

1128
00:55:40.271 --> 00:55:43.174
-Thank you.
-[Garrett] What is it?

1129
00:55:43.207 --> 00:55:47.077
Oh. speaking of the
perfect wife. Michelle's here.

1130
00:55:47.111 --> 00:55:48.979
Ah. See what I'm saying?

1131
00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:52.550
-Hey. I'll catch you later. Bye.
-Have fun.

1132
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.051
[laughs]

1133
00:55:55.052 --> 00:55:56.520
Back to Chicago's curvy.

1134
00:55:58.389 --> 00:55:59.390
Michelle?

1135
00:56:00.424 --> 00:56:02.993
What's going on. babe?

1136
00:56:03.027 --> 00:56:04.995
Hello. my love.

1137
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:06.363
Glad you got my notes.

1138
00:56:06.397 --> 00:56:08.165
Ho-how'd you get in here?

1139
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:11.101
As you know.
I can be very persuasive.

1140
00:56:11.135 --> 00:56:13.237
And the desk clerk
was only too happy

1141
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.306
to give your wife a key.

1142
00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:17.241
What are you doing here. Rayna?

1143
00:56:17.274 --> 00:56:19.677
[Rayna] I thought we could have
another fun weekend together.

1144
00:56:20.778 --> 00:56:22.346
Aren't you happy to see me?

1145
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:24.381
Well. happy to see...
No! Hell. no!

1146
00:56:24.415 --> 00:56:27.084
Wh... How did you even know
I was here?

1147
00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.553
Michelle told me you were going
to the mayor's golf tournament

1148
00:56:29.587 --> 00:56:32.256
and I figured this could be
the perfect getaway for us.

1149
00:56:32.289 --> 00:56:33.357
[scoffs]

1150
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:35.326
Shall we take more pictures?

1151
00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:37.461
You know
you're my favorite subject.

1152
00:56:37.495 --> 00:56:39.697
No. You need to leave.
all right?

1153
00:56:39.697 --> 00:56:41.232
Get out. Rayna!

1154
00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:43.033
-Malik?
-It's time for you to get out.

1155
00:56:43.067 --> 00:56:46.670
Malik. I didn't tell Michelle
about us. but I will.

1156
00:56:46.704 --> 00:56:50.040
I... You need to leave me alone.
Rayna! There is no us!

1157
00:56:50.074 --> 00:56:51.709
-No us?
-No!

1158
00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:55.212
How could you say that?
I'm carrying your baby. Malik!

1159
00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:57.281
-Oh. you need to stop that.
-We were meant to be together.

1160
00:56:57.314 --> 00:56:59.083
Stop it. Rayna!
You need to leave. all right?

1161
00:56:59.116 --> 00:57:01.352
Rayna. come on. It's time
for you to leave. all right?

1162
00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:03.621
-I have your baby--
-Rayna!

1163
00:57:03.654 --> 00:57:05.523
-Get out of my life!
-Aah!

1164
00:57:06.724 --> 00:57:08.225
[door shuts]

1165
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:12.763
Malik!

1166
00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:15.332
Malik. come on. let's talk
about this. Come on. Malik.

1167
00:57:15.366 --> 00:57:18.169
You're not gonna just
throw me out like I'm trash!

1168
00:57:19.103 --> 00:57:20.304
Malik!

1169
00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:25.042
Malik?

1170
00:57:28.646 --> 00:57:31.549
[instrumental music]

1171
00:57:53.704 --> 00:57:56.507
[breathing heavily]

1172
00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:00.411
This crazy bitch.

1173
00:58:11.288 --> 00:58:14.458
Maria. it's Malik. Please tell
me you got some news for me.

1174
00:58:14.492 --> 00:58:15.726
Call me back.

1175
00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:22.466
Shit.

1176
00:58:36.814 --> 00:58:39.350
[cell phone beeping]

1177
00:58:48.826 --> 00:58:50.427
Jesus.

1178
00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:58.343
Hi. honey. I'm glad you're home.

1179
00:58:58.376 --> 00:59:01.113
-Uh. where-where's Jordan?
-At a play date.

1180
00:59:01.146 --> 00:59:03.115
I knew you would be home
around this time.

1181
00:59:03.148 --> 00:59:05.317
so I thought
that mommy and daddy could have

1182
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:08.153
our own play date.

1183
00:59:08.186 --> 00:59:11.456
Hey. I-I love you. Michelle.
You know that. right?

1184
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.525
Of course. I love you. too.

1185
00:59:15.894 --> 00:59:18.797
-I need to talk.
-Mm-mm. We can talk later.

1186

00:59:23.735 --> 00:59:25.670
"Baby misses you?"

1189
00:59:25.704 --> 00:59:27.606
-Malik. who is this?
-Now. hold on. hold on. babe.

1190
00:59:27.639 --> 00:59:29.574
-Uh. this is--
-Oh. my God!

1191
00:59:29.608 --> 00:59:31.176
Are you having an affair. Malik?

1192
00:59:31.209 --> 00:59:33.645
-Michelle. I can explain. okay?
-Explain what?

1193
00:59:33.678 --> 00:59:35.347
That you're sleeping with this.
this trick-ass bitch?

1194
00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.915
-Okay. stop for a second--
-No!

1195
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.216
-Listen to me--
-No! No. you wait!

1196
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.318
-Now it all makes sense.
-Na...

1197
00:59:40.352 --> 00:59:42.287
The late-night phone calls
and texting in your office.

1198
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.423
-You must think that I'm stupid!
-No. I-I don't!

1199
00:59:44.456 --> 00:59:46.558
-That's what I'm trying to ex...
-How could you do this to me?

1200
00:59:46.591 --> 00:59:48.560
How could you do this
to Jordan?

1201
00:59:48.593 --> 00:59:50.662
-Just listen to me.
-No. I'm not listening to you!

1202
00:59:50.695 --> 00:59:53.298
I... Get out! I can't even
stand you right now.

1203
00:59:53.298 --> 00:59:54.766
-Get out! Get out!
-I just want to... Listen!

1204
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.934
-Listen to me!
-I don't wanna hear it!

1205
00:59:55.967 --> 00:59:58.336
Get out! Now!

1206
00:59:59.938 --> 01:00:01.740

[instrumental music]

1210
01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.413
I can't believe that psycho
befriended your wife.

1211
01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:43.548
Yeah.

1212
01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.555
What am I gonna do. G?

1213
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.926
I can't lose my family.

1214
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.862
What did Maria find out?

1215
01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.799
Just that Rayna was mixed up

1216
01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:03.769
in some pill-mill fraud
in Florida

1217
01:01:03.802 --> 01:01:06.505
and right when she was about
to face some serious time.

1218
01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:07.806
someone stepped in.

1219
01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:10.342
-Any idea who?
-No.

1220
01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.878
Uh. Maria's still digging.

1221
01:01:12.911 --> 01:01:14.379
but you know she's relentless.

1222
01:01:14.413 --> 01:01:15.680
so she'll get
to the bottom of it.

1223
01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.582
Yeah. Maria's like a pit bull.

1224
01:01:17.616 --> 01:01:19.885
[chuckles]
I'll reach out to her

1225
01:01:19.918 --> 01:01:21.853
to see if there's anything
I can do to help. too.

1226
01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:24.489
I'm not letting this bitch break
up my best friend's marriage.

1227
01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:28.827
Yo. I'm sorry
I didn't let you in sooner. bro.

1228

[call disconnects]

1241
01:02:07.632 --> 01:02:08.834
Are you going to try
to see Michelle today?

1242
01:02:08.867 --> 01:02:11.303
Yeah. well. I was trying.

1243
01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:13.305
I texted her this morning to see
if I could at least come by

1244
01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:15.073
for some fresh clothes.
but she said no.

1245
01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:17.342
Well. I can go by the house.

1246
01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:20.312
grab some of your clothes
and try to talk to her.

1247
01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:21.747

Yeah.

1250
01:02:27.419 --> 01:02:29.387
Is that water in there?

1251
01:02:29.421 --> 01:02:31.490
Don't judge me.

1252
01:02:31.523 --> 01:02:35.460
Cousin. you let me know
if you need anything. okay?

1253
01:02:35.494 --> 01:02:37.729
Look. 'cause you know
I'm only one text away

1254
01:02:37.763 --> 01:02:39.965
from busting a cap
in Malik's ass.

-I know. I'll be fine. T.
-Okay.

1256

Hey. you be a good boy
for Auntie Terri. okay?

01:02:46.438 --> 01:02:48.340
-Okay.
-All right. Mommy loves you.

How are you doing. Michelle?

I'm hanging in there.

1264
01:03:06.158 --> 01:03:07.692
Well. thank you for letting me
come by

1265
01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:09.094
and get some more clothes
for him.

1266
01:03:09.127 --> 01:03:11.596
Sure. It's no problem.

1267
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.465
Did you get any sleep
last night?

Not much.

but did you know

1270

that Malik was having
an affair. Garrett?

Michelle. no!

1272
01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.813
I had no idea.

1273
01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:30.082
Malik didn't say anything to me
about an affair.

1274
01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.786
I thought
we were so happy together.

1275
01:03:36.488 --> 01:03:38.557
Everything I thought we had
was a lie.

1276

Come on.

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.766
-So I'll just be a minute. okay?
-Okay.

which suits he wanted?

Nah. just grab a couple of 'em.

you came over when you did

everything in his closet.

trying to bail you out of jail.

You're a good friend. Garrett.

I'm your friend. too.

Call me. I've been trying
to reach you all day.

1298

Uh. excuse me. Sorry.

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:14.070
Hey. Michelle. we need to talk.

1306
01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:16.906
-Not now. Malik. I'm working.
-Well. just listen. I...

1307
01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:20.110
I am so sorry about.

1308
01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.679
about all of this. but y-you
need to know what's going on.

1309
01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:25.048
I can't do this right now. okay?
We can talk about this later.

1310
01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:27.117
But you don't understand
what's really going on.

1311
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.518
and it's not what you think.
baby.

Malik. I am at work.

1313
01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.788
I'm not doing this with you
right now.

1314
01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:35.125
Come to the house tomorrow
and we can talk.

1315

believe me. but I'm sorry.

what's going on. man?

-You didn't hear?
-No. What?

1329

over here.

Take her cell phone
over to Forensics.

I want to know where she's been.
I want to know

1336
01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:57.307
who she's been talking to. okay?

1337
01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.375
We're gonna catch the bastard

1338
01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.909
who did this to one of our own.

1339
01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:01.011
And I don't wanna see your faces

1340
01:08:01.044 --> 01:08:02.312
till we have a suspect.

1341
01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:10.053
[Rayna] Hi. Michelle.

1342
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.955
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1343
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.691
Here's your check.

1344
01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.259
Last night was a huge success.

1345
01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.962
-Thanks to you.
-Thanks.

1346
01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:22.666
I meant to ask you. what's going
on with the father of your baby?

1347
01:08:22.699 --> 01:08:25.335
-Is he gonna leave his wife?
-Funny you should ask.

1348
01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:28.138
Um. he's having second thoughts
about leaving.

1349
01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:31.775
so I may have to give him a bit
of an incentive to leave a wife

1350
01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:34.911
that he clearly
doesn't love anymore.

1351
01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.813
An incentive?

1352
01:08:36.913 --> 01:08:38.314
It's really not a good idea
to sleep

1353
01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:40.316
with a married man. Rayna.

1354
01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.686
You're hurting someone
you don't even know.

1355
01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:43.987
She'll have to get over it.

1356
01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.955
[scoffs]
"Get over it?"

1357
01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:51.861
I know he wants to be with me.

1358
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:55.432
What are you doing? Does
his wife even know about you?

1359
01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.167
Not yet.

1360
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.868
Don't you think
she'll be devastated to learn

1361
01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.204
that her husband's
been having an affair?

1362
01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.974
It's not my problem.
We're meant to be together.

1363
01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:07.777
I'm sure his wife thought they
were meant to be together. too.

1364
01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.315
I can't help it if he doesn't
love her anymore.

1365
01:09:15.919 --> 01:09:18.088
[Michelle] You know.
that's a hard thing for a woman

1366
01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:20.323
to hear about her husband.

1367
01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.892
that he doesn't love her
anymore.

1368
01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.794
that he's sleeping
with someone else.

1369
01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:28.331
He'll be much happier with me.

1370
01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:31.134
And when the baby comes.
he'll forget all about her.

1371
01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:37.007
Look. Rayna.

1372
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.975
I appreciate the opportunity
you've given me.

1373
01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:41.077
but I don't think
I can do this anymore.

1374
01:09:44.347 --> 01:09:46.216
I'm sorry to hear that.

1375
01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.052
Okay. then.

1376
01:09:51.221 --> 01:09:53.356
Michelle. wait.

1377
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:57.227
Before you go.
let me give you a little bonus.

1378
01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:14.477
-What's this?
-It's a print.

1379
01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:16.946
From the <i>Reunited</i> collection.

1380
01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.516
One that I haven't shared
with anyone.

1381
01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.886
I think you might be just
the person to appreciate it.

1382
01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:27.457
[gasps]

1383
01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:30.960
What? You don't like it?

1384
01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:39.135
You lying bitch!

1385
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:41.738
I'd beat your ass
if you weren't pregnant.

1386
01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:45.208
Triflin' ho.

1387
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.045
[laughs]

1388
01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:56.152
Hm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

1389
01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.190
[engine revving]

1390
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.950
Malik sleeping with Rayna.

1391
01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:32.321
Yeah. she's carrying his baby.

1392
01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:35.258
I'm sorry.
you don't deserve that.

1393
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.727
[chuckles] You know.
I'm wondering how you managed

1394
01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.763
to leave that gallery without
beating the hell out of her.

1395
01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.232
It took every fiber of strength

1396
01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:45.234
not to claw that bitch face off.

1397
01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:50.173
I just couldn't hit
a pregnant woman.

1398
01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:53.209
Hm. now Terri.
Terri would have beat her ass.

1399
01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:55.378
Yeah. Terri's about that life.

1400
01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:01.751
I gave him everything. Garrett.

1401
01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.955
I love him so much.

1402
01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.425
I know you do.

1403
01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.235
[jail door buzzes]

1404
01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.911
Malik Tucker.

1405
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.116
'Sup. convict?

1406
01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:39.956
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this surprise visit.

1407
01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:42.358
Mr. Assistant District Attorney?

1408
01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.527
You know why I'm here. Simion.

1409
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.362
Why don't you tell me?

1410
01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:47.563
I wanna hear the words
come out of that

1411
01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:50.266
smug bitch-ass mouth of yours.

1412
01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:54.971
What are you doing
with Rayna Parsons?

1413
01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:56.472
Rayna. Rayna...

1414
01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:59.008
Rayna?

1415
01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:01.944
-I don't know no Rayna.
-You lying...

1416
01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:03.379
You're lying.

1417
01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:11.254
You better stop bullshitting me.

1418
01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:12.989
You better stop bullshitting me.

1419
01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:16.025
I will find a way
to bury you under this prison.

1420
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.827
Tell me what's going on.

1421
01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.463
What's go...

1422
01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:24.867
What's going on is you're trying
to become DA off my ass.

1423
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.836
You took my life.

1424
01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.338
Now how does it feel to have
everything you care about...

1425
01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.440
gone?

1426
01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.481
Look. get the hell
out of my house. Gone!

1427
01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.361
Okay.

1428
01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.863
We're gonna need some more wine.

1429
01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:56.032
Mm-mm. No.

1430
01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:58.401
I need to get this place
cleaned up.

1431
01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:02.371
Jordan will be back
in the morning. My poor baby.

1432
01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:05.041
I guess I gotta let him know
what's going on.

1433
01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:07.944
You don't have to do anything
before you're ready. Michelle.

1434
01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:10.179
Just focus
on taking care of yourself.

1435
01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:13.649
Thanks. Garrett. You're always
looking out for me.

1436
01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:16.052
Although. technically.
this is all you fault.

1437
01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:17.653
You're the one who introduced me
to that fool.

1438
01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:19.989
[chuckles]

1439
01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:22.258
I'll take that.

1440
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.361
But I'm here.
Whatever you need. I got you.

1441
01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:28.097
I know. I appreciate it.

1442
01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.969
Um. you want me
to spend the night?

1443
01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:35.171
-You don't need to be alone.
-Oh. no. you don't have to stay.

1444
01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.039
I'll be fine.

1445
01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:39.408
You know. you've always been
a good friend. Garrett.

1446
01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:43.112
I could be so much more.

1447
01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.350
-What are you doing? Aah!
-Man. what is wrong with you?

1448
01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:49.118
-Ow! Get off of me!
-Huh. what's wrong with you?

1449
01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.686
-Get off of me!
-Get off of her!

1450
01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.922
-Hey! Hey! You okay? What?
-Malik! Malik!

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.461

I can't do this. Rayna.

[groans]

1454
01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.037
I'm pregnant.

1455
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.640
Stop it. Rayna!
You need to leave.

1456
01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.275
Are you having an affair. Malik?

1457
01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.076
[Malik] <i>Michelle. I can explain.</i>

1458

Hey. Sterling.
I can't talk right now. I--

Malik. be in my office in the
morning at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

1472

We are opening an investigation

1473
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.065
into your prosecution
of Simion Blake

1474
01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:12.368
due to your relationship with
his girlfriend. Rayna Parsons.

1475
01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:13.970
Don't be late.

1476
01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:15.638

1478

[Rayna] What the hell
were you thinking?

1487
01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:51.325
[Garrett] I have a plan.
okay? Relax.

1488
01:17:51.358 --> 01:17:52.626
Well. Simion wants details
on how you're

1489
01:17:52.659 --> 01:17:54.461
going to overturn his conviction

1490
01:17:54.494 --> 01:17:57.331
before he authorizes me
to wire you the money.

1491
01:17:57.364 --> 01:17:59.466
[Garrett] How many times
we're gonna go over this?

1492
01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:02.502
Okay. they have proof of the
both of you sleeping together.

1493
01:18:02.536 --> 01:18:05.138
When Sterling realizes
that Malik removed your name

1494
01:18:05.172 --> 01:18:06.607
from the list of targets
and used Miami DA

1495
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.141
to drop the charges.

1496
01:18:08.175 --> 01:18:09.776

will be overturned!

after all.

Let her go. Garrett.

01:18:15.716 --> 01:18:17.217
This doesn't have anything
to do with her.

1500
01:18:17.251 --> 01:18:19.720
Put the gun down
or I'll kill her right now.

1501
01:18:21.154 --> 01:18:22.556
No. you won't.

Hey. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

1505
01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:30.597
Okay.

1506
01:18:33.133 --> 01:18:34.368
Kick it over.

1507
01:18:38.805 --> 01:18:40.240
That's good. bitch.

1508
01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:47.281
Why are you holding her
hostage. Garrett?

1509
01:18:47.314 --> 01:18:48.582
Just put the gun down.
You don't...

1510
01:18:48.615 --> 01:18:49.816
You don't have to do this.

1511
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.451
You're not
calling the shots now.

1512
01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:53.287
-I am.
-Listen to me. Garrett.

1513
01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.455
We. we can get you out of this.

1514
01:18:55.455 --> 01:18:57.558
Okay? You don't. you don't ha...

1515
01:18:57.591 --> 01:18:59.092
But you don't have to hurt
Michelle.

1516
01:18:59.126 --> 01:19:00.661
You don't have to work
for Simion Blake.

1517
01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:03.297
You don't get to tell me
what to do anymore.

1518
01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:05.566
I decided to promote myself

1519
01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:08.769
by presenting Simion
with a offer he couldn't refuse.

1520
01:19:08.802 --> 01:19:10.337
I'm tired
of coming second to you.

1521
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.506
with Michelle. Sterling.

Wait. is that what
this is all about?

1523
01:19:14.274 --> 01:19:15.609
Are you jealous?

1524
01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.280
How long you been
setting this up?

1525
01:19:20.314 --> 01:19:22.616
When we began building
the case against Simion.

1526
01:19:22.649 --> 01:19:24.484
I came across Rayna's name
in the list

1527
01:19:24.484 --> 01:19:26.853
of girlfriends and crew members.

1528
01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:28.855
And as we know. she was
running his pill operation

1529
01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:31.258
in Florida and got picked up.

1530
01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:33.827
But her name just.
i-it kept ringing in my head

1531
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.730
until I realized

1532
01:19:36.763 --> 01:19:38.699
she was your ex-girlfriend.

1533
01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.567
And then I knew
she would be the perfect person

1534
01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:43.303
to use to set you up.

1535
01:19:43.337 --> 01:19:44.605
You bastard.

1536
01:19:46.173 --> 01:19:47.641
So then I just made a few calls.

1537
01:19:47.674 --> 01:19:49.910
Got her out
and I removed her name

1538
01:19:49.943 --> 01:19:51.545
from the list of targets.

1539
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:52.913
Then I just set everything up
with Simion.

1540
01:19:52.946 --> 01:19:55.849
<i>for a small fee. of course.</i>

1541
01:19:55.882 --> 01:19:57.751
[Garrett] <i>But I made it</i>
<i>look like you did.</i>

1542
01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:04.758
So tell me.

1543
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:06.493
how much
was destroying my family

1544
01:20:06.526 --> 01:20:08.362
worth to you?

1545
01:20:08.462 --> 01:20:10.364
Five million.

1546
01:20:10.464 --> 01:20:13.901
Seems fair being that I need to
upgrade from my little studio.

1547
01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:15.869
[Rayna laughs]

1548
01:20:15.903 --> 01:20:18.705
You were such an easy mark.

1549
01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:22.643
Like taking candy from a baby.

1550
01:20:25.512 --> 01:20:27.381
What-what about the baby?

1551
01:20:28.382 --> 01:20:30.584
[Rayna laughing]

1552
01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:34.621
You're so gullible. Malik.
You always were.

1553
01:20:34.655 --> 01:20:36.490
[Rayna] <i>I slipped a drug</i>
<i>in your drink</i>

1554
01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:40.460
when you went to go
take that call from wifey.

1555
01:20:40.494 --> 01:20:44.231
You blacked out as soon
as I got you into the hotel.

1556
01:20:44.264 --> 01:20:46.833
<i>Then me and Garrett</i>
<i>had our way with you.</i>

1557
01:20:48.702 --> 01:20:51.572
[camera clicking]

1558
01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:54.541
So-so there's no baby?
You're not pregnant?

1559
01:20:54.575 --> 01:20:56.577
No. stupid.

1560
01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:58.445
We never slept together.

1561
01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.682
You're not my type anymore.

1562
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:04.985
And what about Maria?

1563
01:21:05.018 --> 01:21:06.587
Why did you have to kill her.
Garrett?

1564
01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.722
You can blame yourself
for that one.

1565
01:21:08.755 --> 01:21:10.824
{\an8}
[Garrett] <i>Once she tied</i>
<i>Rayna and Simion together.</i>

1566
01:21:10.857 --> 01:21:13.560
{\an8}
I knew it was only a matter
of time before she got to me.

1567
01:21:13.594 --> 01:21:14.995
So her ass had to go.

1568
01:21:15.028 --> 01:21:16.930
But you already know that

1569
01:21:16.964 --> 01:21:19.466
because you're the one
that killed her!

1570
01:21:19.466 --> 01:21:21.335
-Wh-what are you talking about?
-[Rayna] I took your skin...

1571
01:21:21.368 --> 01:21:22.636
From when I scratched you

1572
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:23.837
and I placed it underneath

1573
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:25.472
Maria's fingernails.

1574
01:21:25.472 --> 01:21:26.940
Jesus Christ.

1575
01:21:26.974 --> 01:21:30.544
So your DNA is all over her.

1576
01:21:30.577 --> 01:21:33.580
So her murder
gets pinned on you.

1577
01:21:33.614 --> 01:21:35.616
Chicago's golden boy

1578
01:21:35.649 --> 01:21:38.518
will now be
a convicted murderer.

1579
01:21:38.552 --> 01:21:41.521
[applauding]

1580
01:21:41.555 --> 01:21:43.557
[Malik] Okay.

1581
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:46.860
Michelle doesn't have anything
to do with this.

1582
01:21:46.894 --> 01:21:48.862
Just let her go.

1583
01:21:48.896 --> 01:21:52.766
Please. just.
please. just let my wife go.

1584
01:21:52.799 --> 01:21:54.601
Uh. I don't think so.

1585
01:21:54.635 --> 01:21:55.903
[laughs]

1586
01:21:57.638 --> 01:21:59.740
-See?
-Hey. hey!

1587
01:21:59.773 --> 01:22:02.442
It's-it's gonna be okay. baby.
It is. it's gonna be fine.

1588
01:22:02.442 --> 01:22:05.012
See. I got plans for me
and this woman right here.

1589
01:22:07.681 --> 01:22:08.649
[grunts]

1590
01:22:09.816 --> 01:22:10.784
[grunts]

1591
01:22:15.989 --> 01:22:18.892
[intense music]

1592
01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:30.537
[coughing]

1593
01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:38.645
I told you. Your ass ain't
calling the shots no more. I am!

1594
01:22:38.679 --> 01:22:40.547
Look. Just. wait.

1595
01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:43.784
-Garrett. wait.
-Drop the gun. Garrett.

1596
01:22:43.817 --> 01:22:46.820
[chuckles] What. you gonna.
you gonna shoot me?

1597
01:22:46.853 --> 01:22:49.690
-Bitch. you ain't got the ba--
-[gunshot]

1598
01:22:49.723 --> 01:22:51.458
Oh. shit!

1599
01:22:53.827 --> 01:22:55.996
Nobody messes with my family.

1600
01:22:57.798 --> 01:22:59.433
-Oh. my God! Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1601
01:22:59.466 --> 01:23:01.435
-I'm-I'm so sorry. baby.
-No. no.

1602
01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:02.970
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry. I love you.

1603
01:23:03.003 --> 01:23:06.073
-I love you. too.
-I love you.

1604
01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.942
-Wait. where's Rayna?
-Oh. don't worry about her.

1605
01:23:08.976 --> 01:23:10.077
She's not gonna get far.

1606
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:12.112
[siren wailing]

1607
01:23:12.145 --> 01:23:14.848
But. but how did the police
get here?

1608
01:23:14.881 --> 01:23:17.117
I called them
right before I came in.

1609
01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:19.019
And then I went live
on the Gram.

1610
01:23:19.052 --> 01:23:22.522
So their entire confession
was live streamed.

1611
01:23:22.556 --> 01:23:24.958
It's over now. Okay?

1612
01:23:24.992 --> 01:23:26.793
-Oh.
-Hey. Come here. baby.

1613
01:23:26.827 --> 01:23:29.596
We're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1614
01:23:32.866 --> 01:23:34.835
[reporter] <i>Malik Tucker took</i>

-Malik!
-Malik! Malik!

1626
01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:00.661
[reporter] Malik Tucker.
will you be returning

1627
01:24:00.694 --> 01:24:03.163
to the prosecutor's office
and running for DA?

1628
01:24:03.196 --> 01:24:06.133
No. I decided
to leave the DA's office.

1629
01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:08.068
Why. Malik?

1630
01:24:08.101 --> 01:24:09.970
Well. when you go through
difficult times.

1631
01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:11.972
you realize
what's important in life.

1632
01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.541
And right now

1633
01:24:14.575 --> 01:24:17.444
it's important
that I'm with my family.

1634
01:24:17.477 --> 01:24:19.146
But don't worry. it's not
the last you've heard from me.

1635
01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:22.916
{\an8}
Mrs. Tucker. what do you have
to say about Rayna Persons?

1636
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:24.918
{\an8}
<i>I'm just glad that we're safe</i>

1637
01:24:24.952 --> 01:24:28.055

<i>and she's out of our lives</i>

1638
01:24:28.088 --> 01:24:30.691

-Thanks. y'all.
-Malik. one more question.

1641
01:24:34.561 --> 01:24:36.797
Tell us about your relationship
with Garrett Wrightly.

1642
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:37.798
Do you have anything to say?

1643
01:24:37.831 --> 01:24:38.999
Any comments at all about

1644
01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:41.735
Maria Gonzalez's death?

1645
01:24:41.768 --> 01:24:42.836
-[Terri] Parson.
-What?

1646
01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:44.838
You got visitors.

1647
01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.206
What are you talking about?

1648
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.908
Since you're gonna be here
for a while.

1649
01:24:47.941 --> 01:24:49.509
Michelle told me to make sure
you had some company

1650
01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:50.877
to pass the time away.

1651
01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:52.913
Wait. what?

1652

Enjoy your stay.
