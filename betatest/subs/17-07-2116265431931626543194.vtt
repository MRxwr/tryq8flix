4
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.255
- I was invited to a new show
at the Point Theater in Dublin

5
00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.724
and it turned out to be one of

6
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.394
the most memorable nights
I've spent in the theater.

7
00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:31.164
The force of the music. the
primal power of the dancing.

8
00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.968
the beautiful symmetry of
so many bodies in motion.

9
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.804
I think anybody who was in the
audience that night realized

10
00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:42.376
that they were watching
something unique and original.

11
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.445
The show of course was
Riverdance.

12
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.316
(dramatic instrumental music)

13
00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:16.777
(audience applauds and cheers)

14
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.145
- Well I suppose Riverdance the
show

15
00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.780
and then there was
Riverdance at the Eurovision

16
00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.215
so 25 years ago we had
already had Riverdance

17
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.252
at the Eurovision which happened
in 1994

18
00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:29.122
as a 6 minute and 40 second
piece that surprised people.

19
00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:33.427
- [Both] Ladies and gentlemen.
Riverdance.

20
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.130
(joyful instrumental music)

21
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.840
- The interval act at
Eurovision is normally

22
00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:50.177
something of cultural
value from that country.

23
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.111
they didn't know what it was.

24
00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.280
they're normally quite boring

25
00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.916
but when Riverdance came on the
stage

26
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.452
it was an electrifying moment.

27
00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.791
(audience applauds and cheers)

28
00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:08.962
- [Announcer] The audience
are on their feet.

29
00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.832
- The audience as one jumped to
their feet

30
00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.569
and for like a sustained
4 or 5 minutes applause

31
00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:19.005
that in my experience of
the business was unique.

32
00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.608
- At that moment I suppose
we knew that Irish dance

33
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.276
was never going to be the
same again and that maybe

34
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.247
Irish culture was never
going to be the same again.

35
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.585
(audience applauds and cheers)

36
00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:35.355
- When we had the initial
sort of tidal wave response

37
00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.157
that was the time that we all
thought.

38
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.160
wow Riverdance has really had an
effect.

39
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:44.364
we have a number one record.
we should make a show.

40
00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.899
- [Moya] Bill Whelan.
John McColgan and myself

41
00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.767
put our heads together round the
table

42
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:51.104
and we really worked out
what the shape. form.

43
00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:54.608
concept of the two hour
piece was going to be.

44
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.009
- Riverdance itself and I think
actually

45
00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.645
Maria will bring something
to it not only just with her

46
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.048
talent of her dancing but
also just her personality.

47
00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:03.750
She has that kind of warmth
which you know

48
00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.919
in a company context is really
important.

49
00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.387
- [Moya] Sure.

50
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.824
(enthusiastic music)

51
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.058
- The theme was immigration

52
00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:14.794
and the theme was multi-cultural
and the theme was changing.

53
00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:18.465
interchanging ideas and
being to work with each other

54
00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.235
so all of the dancers didn't
just sit in their own silo.

55
00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.037
they interacted with each other

56
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.742
and the choreography was
mixed up with each other.

57
00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.845
(enthusiastic music)

58
00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:37.450
One year later we had a full
show on in the same venue.

59
00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:40.487
- Please welcome Riverdance.

60
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.089
(lively music)

61
00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:59.072
(audience applauds and cheers)

62
00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.208
- What we're doing is
telling a lot of good will.

63
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.376
a lot of high energy and
we love what we're doing.

64
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.579
the best thing about our show
is that all of us would do it

65
00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.614
for nothing without any audience
there

66
00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.916
and I think when you have a show
like that

67
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.284
it will live for a while.

68
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.485
- It exploded.

69
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.190
We just dragged on.
held on by our knuckles

70
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:23.230
to the coat tails of Riverdance.
and traveled with it.

71
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.333
- So straight from there
we went to Hammersmith

72
00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.269
which is a 6.000 seater in
London

73
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:34.107
and we played Hammersmith
for a record number of weeks.

74
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.977
Then we went off and
started our American tours

75
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.713
in Radio City Music Hall
and we hold the record there

76
00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:43.283
for the longest run of any
single show.

77
00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.919
(lively music)

78
00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:50.023
- [Moya] These dance forms
were cultural dance forms

79
00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.759
that were used to express
through history

80
00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.529
life and death and
celebration and challenge.

81
00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.535
It's a river of emotions.

82
00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.206
pathos. sorrow. joy.
it brings us great joy.

83
00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.611
it brings the audience great
joy.

84
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:15.315
So bringing all of that
into a Broadway/mainstream

85
00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.784
entertainment stage is I think
what

86
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.053
caused the real excitement.

87
00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.858
(dramatic music)

88
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.630
- This was the show that
announced to the world

89
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.233
that Ireland was a cultural
force

90
00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:35.802
to be reckoned with in the
popular sense.

91
00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:40.273
It made Irish dancing
sexy and it made it cool.

92
00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.876
(lively music)

93
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.845
- [John] Irish dance.

94
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.681
or as they call it the
Riverdance

95
00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:52.018
is now recognized all over the
world as a genuine art form

96
00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.988
and it employs thousands of
people.

97
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.624
(lively music)

98
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:03.863
- I think we are so blessed
25 years later to be able to

99
00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:07.667
experiment with this and
to produce this new show.

100
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.905
- My hope and desire is that
now with this new treatment

101
00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.208
the show will be reinvigorated

102
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.844
and attractive to people
who have never seen it.

103
00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.781
younger people who weren't
born when it started

104
00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:26.319
and even more attractive topeople who have seen it before.

105
00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:30.924
they'll also be blown away
so it's the next generation.

106
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.462
it's Riverdance: the Next
Generation.

107
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.064
(lively music)

108
00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:06.226

Out of the night.

118
00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:46.793
The first of many mornings
in this new place.

119
00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:49.662
When the sun rolled back the
mist

120
00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.599
we rose like a strong wave on
land.

121
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.769
Now we were the people of this
place.

Our great Cuchulain.

163
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.672
He was the sun of morning.

164
00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:02.574
He was a fire at night.

165
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:05.177
He was a powerful story.

166
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.546
He was lightening in forest.

167
00:24:08.414 --> 00:24:10.249
A sudden storm.

168
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.350

(audience applauds and cheers)

171
00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.982
- [Man] Thunder and
lightning batter the rocks.

172
00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:42.020
The winds howl and great
storms break on the forest.

173
00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:44.456
Scatter the herds like grain.

174
00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:48.660
Fire leaps from dark to dark.

175
00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:51.263
Fear and anger leap to meet it.

176
00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.332
We will not go down.

177
00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:58.437
We will not be beaten down like
grain.

(audience applauds and cheers)

213
00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.450
- With the 25th Anniversary
production there

214
00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:36.487
is a significant change
in terms of the lighting.

215
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.022
in terms of the set. in terms
of the content on the screen.

216
00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:40.357
in terms of some of the
costumes.

217
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.793
in terms of the running order of
the show.

218
00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:45.829
in terms of the casting of the
show.

219
00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.901
And for everybody that
is part of Riverdance 25

220
00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.769
there is absolutely an
understanding

221
00:52:52.803 --> 00:52:55.372
and an opportunity and
also a responsibility

222
00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.207
on each and every single one of
us to

223
00:52:57.241 --> 00:52:59.943
make Riverdance be the
best it's ever been.

224
00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:02.412
In the same way as
Manchester City or Liverpool

225
00:53:02.446 --> 00:53:06.183
or any of these guys bring in
new players to help energize

226
00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:08.352
and fuel that next generation.

227
00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.587
the same way as the Lakers
or anybody out in America.

228
00:53:10.621 --> 00:53:12.122
those professional sports teams.

229
00:53:12.156 --> 00:53:13.290
that's the way we look at
ourselves.

230
00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:15.159
we look at ourselves as a
professional sports team

231
00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:18.529
trying to be the best team in
the world.

232
00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:22.733
You would have went around
and caught on to Peter.

233
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:25.402
For the most part it's
practicing it

234
00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.571
so much so that you can't get it
wrong.

235
00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:30.040
And its making sure that
the communication is clear

236
00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:32.976
between every single dancer
as to where they're moving.

237
00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.179
when they're moving. whatthey're supposed to be thinking.

238
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:36.647
what they should be visualizing.

239
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.115
what they should be feeling on
stage

240
00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:40.884
so that the audience feels
it in the auditorium.

241
00:53:40.918 --> 00:53:42.653
where their toes are
supposed to be placed.

242
00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:45.455
how high their legs come up.
how low their legs go down.

243
00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:50.427
There's so many aspects to make
it as perfect as it can be.

244
00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:55.098
- We've been Irish dance and
when we were four. five. six

245
00:53:55.132 --> 00:53:58.468
so we kind of grew up trying to
be

246
00:53:58.502 --> 00:54:01.171
this Riverdance style of dancer.

247
00:54:03.207 --> 00:54:04.942
In terms of the troupe coming
together

248
00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:08.879
and having to dance at exactly
the same speed every night.

249
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.316
that takes hours and hours of
rehearsals.

250
00:54:13.317 --> 00:54:15.986
(shoes tapping)

251
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.059
- When it comes down to
it the sheer speed of tap.

252
00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:25.596
it comes over years and years of
training.

253
00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:28.565
(shouts)

254
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:31.868
Some people have been measured
up to 40 taps per second.

255
00:54:31.902 --> 00:54:33.837
I know some of the solos
probably

256
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.773
range between 20 and 35 per
second.

257
00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:42.779
I mean I've been dancing
for. what. 24 years now.

258
00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:45.916
and even then I'm still
trying to get faster

259
00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:49.586
and speed is one thing.
there's execution as well.

260
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.656
So sometimes you'll see
when you do go really fast

261
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.424
you lose your technique.
but it's the uniqueness

262
00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:58.195
and the presentation of the
feet as well. at that speed.

263
00:54:58.228 --> 00:55:00.230
that's really difficult.

264
00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:05.502
Right now you're seeing in the
world

265
00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:07.604
there's such a huge thing about
inclusion

266
00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:10.240
and acceptance of
everyone for who they are.

267
00:55:10.274 --> 00:55:12.776
whether it's race. religion.
sexuality.

268
00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:17.147
and Riverdance is all about
the sharing of cultures.

269
00:55:20.017 --> 00:55:22.586
(group cheers)

270
00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:26.623
- Before the show starts
when we're warming up

271
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:30.460
the Irish boys come and jam
with us when we're tapping

272
00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:35.499
and we all kind of like mesh
our stuff together. it's good.

273
00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:40.370
Never thought I'd Irish
dance ever in my life but.

274
00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:44.941
- It's nerve-wracking because
not only is it a new style

275
00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:48.412
but you're also doing it next
to professional Irish dancers

276
00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:51.381
who are world champions andthey're the best at what they do

277
00:55:51.415 --> 00:55:52.983
&nbsp;
so the pressure is on.

278
00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:55.385
But saying that I absolutely
love it

279
00:55:55.419 --> 00:55:58.355
and I'm loving to learn new
styles.

280
00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:03.593
(shoes tapping)

281
00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:09.700
- We are like a big family.
and the energy we're getting

282
00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:13.337
on the stage is very
inspiring for dancing.

283
00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:16.740
Not only with Irish.

284
00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:22.446
we have different types ofdance and learn from each other.

285
00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:23.914
&nbsp;
and it's amazing.

286
00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:30.320
- It has always been
gratifying to me to see how

287
00:56:30.354 --> 00:56:33.957
Irish traditional musicians
and dancers in Riverdance

288
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:37.594
have embraced the fact
they they're in a show

289
00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.696
where you have flamenco dancers

290
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.031
and where you have Russian
dancers

291
00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:46.069
and jazz tappers and you have
that sort of coming together

292
00:56:46.737 --> 00:56:49.439
of different forms which has a
respect

293
00:56:49.473 --> 00:56:53.577
for its own form and a
curiosity about the other.

294
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:57.547
America has created an art form
with jazz

295
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:01.017
which combines something that
we do use in Riverdance too.

296
00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:06.056
which is that invitation tomusicians to actually improvise.

297
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:10.193
&nbsp;
(thoughtful music)

298
00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:32.282
- These are called the uillean
pipes.

299
00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:35.185
Uillean is the Irish word for
elbow.

300
00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:38.722
So you pump the air from
the bellows into the bag

301
00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:41.525
and then this here is called the
chanter.

302
00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:44.394
And then here you have the
drones.

303
00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:50.267
so the drones are kind
of like an accompaniment

304
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.334
and then you have the regulators

305
00:57:51.368 --> 00:57:53.503
that you play with your wrist.

306
00:57:53.537 --> 00:57:57.207
just to add something else into
the mix.

307
00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.644
(haunting uillean music)

308
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:11.154
I love playing slow airs as a
piper.

309
00:58:11.188 --> 00:58:14.424
Queen of Cuchulain especially
just always moves me.

310
00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:15.592
the way Bill wrote the air.

311
00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:18.295
it's just impossible not to feel

312
00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:20.997
anything when you're playing it.

313
00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:27.971
("Queen of Cuchulain")

314
00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:42.953
- A couple came up to me one
night

315
00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.554
after a performance in England

316
00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:48.592
and said that listening to
the pipes air in Riverdance

317
00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:51.528
had helped them to grieve for
their son.

318
00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:54.130
who had died the previous year.

319
00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:59.903
And for them to say that
and for the music to have

320
00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:04.808
reached people in that way
was something that none of us

321
00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:09.346
really ever expected. and
it was lovely to hear.

322
00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:12.616
("Queen of Cuchulain")

323
00:59:18.722 --> 00:59:21.892
So music as a non-verbal tool.

324
00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:24.294
it's extraordinarily powerful

325
00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:27.197
and it reaches into
parts of the human psyche

326
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.900
I think that we don't have
language for.

327
00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:33.270
and where language fails music
steps in.

328
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.189
- [Man] No life is forever.

329
00:59:53.223 --> 00:59:55.559
We found and fought here.

330
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:57.494
We loved and died here.

331
00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:04.467
We have seen smoke of warclimb from our fields of grain.

332
01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.269
&nbsp;
A stain over the sun.

333
01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.539
The crops wither.

334
01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:14.811
The bones of hunger walk the
sunken roads

335
01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:17.013
in the black rain of ruin.

336
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:24.120
Whole generations lift now to
depart.

337
01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.423
The land has failed us.

338
01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.459
The dark soldiers appear against
us.

339
01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:34.898
In dance and song we gift
and mourn our children.

340
01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:39.769
They carry us over the
ocean in dance and song.

341
