Lisa. please don't ask me
why I'm sending an email

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.130
instead of talking to you in person.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:11.820
I tried to muster up the
courage over the past few days.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.300
but just couldn't.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.730
I've been unhappy for a while now.

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:18.840
and I'm sure you noticed that pain

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.970
that I was feeling in my side?

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:25.740

But the world's not completely over.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.120
The good news is that they caught it early

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.713
and may be able to cut it out.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:53.480
This has just been so overwhelming for me.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.320
After my surgery. we're
gonna do what you said.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.330
I want to start eating healthy too.

01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.520
