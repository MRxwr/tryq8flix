﻿1
00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:14.765
An ancient tale foretells
that our planet

2
00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:19.228
and its future rest on a
turtle's back.

3
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.359
If we lose the turtle.

4
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.402
there would be no earth.

5
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.446
No US.

6
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:45.754
Today. the story of a sea turtle's
life is just as profound.

7
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.592
On Australia's Great
Barrier Reef.

8
00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.512
there's a tropical beach

9
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.765
where one tiny turtle's
big adventure

10
00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.726
is about to begin.

11
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:33.969
<i>This is Bun“.</i>

12
00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.147
She's a green sea turtle

13
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.112
and today is her birthday.

14
00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:59.161
Out of the hundred eggs she
shared a nest with.

15
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.540
She's the very last
hatchling to emerge.

16
00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.422
It will take Bunji a few days to
make it above ground.

17
00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.466
and join the other newborns

18
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.259
making their way to the water.

19
00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.264
And when Bunji
finally breaks free.

20
00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:27.272
she too has to make a
run for the ocean

21
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.815
Up where she comes from.

22
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:32.319
Bunji is an indigenous
Australian word for friend.

23
00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:33.904
And she needs one.

24
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.616
because the first thing a
baby turtle sees

25
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.120
is something that
wants to eat it.

26
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.501
Bunji's parents are
roaming the ocean.

27
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.755
meaning she'll have to
fend for herself.

28
00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:00.013
The odds are against her.

29
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.393
And as if the birds
weren't enough.

30
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:09.356
ghost crabs haunt the
water's edge.

31
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.864
Bunji's going to need all the
luck she can get.

32
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.564
But it's not much safer
in the water.

33
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.693
Just one in every
thousand hatchlings

34
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.778
will survive to maturity.

35
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.955
It will take all of Bunji's
turtle instincts

36
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.332
to make it through.
in one piece.

37
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.756
Sea turtles have an
amazing ability to...

38
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.052
Oh. Mm.

39
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:30.061
Phew. And all that in just
the first five minutes.

40
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.981
If Bunji makes it to adulthood.

41
00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:36.443
she could live to be over
100 years old.

42
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.780
And in that lifetime.

43
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:43.784
she will swim many
thousands of miles.

44
00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.036
meet incredible creatures.

45
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.956
and have some really
wild encounters.

46
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.130
<i>Welcome to Turtle Odyssey.</i>

47
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.501
It's Bunji's first night in
the vast ocean.

48
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.712
She is small and all alone.

49
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.968
It's all a bit spooky.

50
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.599
She must learn where
danger lurks.

51
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.815
Unlike this cuttlefish.

52
00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:00.235
Bunji isn't as easily
camouflaged.

53
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:07.409
She must discover who's friend.

54
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.081
who's foe.

55
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.297
and who's just passing through.

56
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.848
Let's hope she gets it right.

57
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.479
Bunji is following her instincts
to swim out to open water.

58
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:40.317
just like marine turtles have
for millions of years.

59
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.533
Sea turtle highways
criss cross the oceans.

60
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.538
Tracking the seven
different species reveals

61
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.749
it's a turtle planet.

62
00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.420
In their lifetime. some turtles.
like the leatherback.

63
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.465
will travel over half a
million miles.

64
00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:08.345
that's like swimming to
the moon and back.

65
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:15.977
Little Bunji is now 300 miles
off the east coast of Australia.

66
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.106
a long way from where
she was born.

67
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:27.906
For years.

68
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.617
no one knew where
baby turtles went

69
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.411
or how they travelled across
the great oceans

70
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.706
until now.

71
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:42.253
It turns out they were hitching
rides on rafts of seaweed

72
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.964
and Bunji's found one.

73
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.156
Below. reef sharks and other
large fish prowl.

74
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:14.160
All hungry for a tasty
turtle treat.

75
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.708
But Bunji is happy in her
floating fortress.

76
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.919
It's safe and warm.
and if she's hungry.

77
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.046
she can even take a bite.

78
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.220
Bunji will catch many of
these free rides.

79
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.100
As the years go by.

80
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.103
she'll be carried along by
the ocean currents.

81
00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.605
She'll get bigger.

82
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.274
and bigger.

83
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.483
and bigger.

84
00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.239
Until she's so big.

85
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.824
she's large enough

86
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.035
to leave her seaweed sanctuary

87
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:59.831
and continue her journey
swimming out across the open sea.

88
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:31.404
Bunji is now a teenager.
with attitude.

89
00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.991
Because of her bigger size.
and hard shell.

90
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.203
she's tough enough to head
back to the shallows.

91
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.957
Bunji is now over
600 miles south

92
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.501
from where she was born

93
00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:47.378
and has found a pacific
island paradise.

94
00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:02.519
This is the remote
Lord Howe island.

95
00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.204
Here. the rich East
Australian Current

96
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.748
lifts cool waters from
the sea floor

97
00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.625
packed with nutrients.

98
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.795
They mix and collect
in the lagoon.

99
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.714
it's teeming with life.

100
00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:50.024
Coral reefs support
millions of species.

101
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.822
This is one of the most
bio-diverse ecosystems

102
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.323
on the planet.

103
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.579
The perfect place for Bunji to
take a bit of a break.

104
00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.880
And have a snack.

105
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:20.180
Although she has no teeth.
her beak is perfect

106
00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:23.016
for pecking tiny algae
off the coral.

107
00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.227
Keeping the coral clean

108
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.022
makes turtles a keystone species

109
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.941
as countless other species
depend on healthy coral

110
00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:33.860
for their survival.

111
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.033
She also eats sea grass.

112
00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:43.912
lots of it.

113
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.582
Unlike some teenagers.

114
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.626
Bunji loves her greens.

115
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.425
She's got a big appetite.

116
00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.303
Luckily. all this
turtle trimming

117
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.639
allows fresh shoots to grow.

118
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.231
It's just another way she
keeps the ocean healthy

119
00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.274
and creates a perfect pasture

120
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.653
for one of the ocean's most
mysterious creatures.

121
00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:27.914
The lives of dugongs and turtles
are intimately linked.

122
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.667
part of a much larger ecosystem

123
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.753
where one species
depends on another.

124
00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:38.299
These dugongs. or sea cows.
are fortunate.

125
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:44.389
They love eating the
roots exposed

126
00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:46.391
by the turtle trimming.

127
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.626
As the years pass.

128
00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.878
Bunji loves to munch on
something else

129
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.964
in this pacific island lagoon.

130
00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.303
It's a sea salp.

131
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:28.141
Sea salps look like
blobs of jellyfish.

132
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:29.517
but they're not.

133
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.895
They're one of the oldest
creatures in the sea.

134
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:37.317
one of the first to develop a
central nervous system.

135
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.695
They're an ancient
ancestor of almost

136
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.364
all complex life on the earth.

137
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.616
including us.

138
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.828
and Bunji finds them
rather tasty.

139
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.623
Bunji has been feeding up

140
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.709
for her long journey ahead.

141
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.337
Now an adult.

142
00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.882
she's feeling the call to leave
her island paradise

143
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.176
and head toward the mainland

144
00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.553
across the vast open sea.

145
00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:17.648
It's an incredible journey
of over 500 miles.

146
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:28.701
The ocean covers over 70%
of our planet.

147
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.121
It's the world's
richest environment.

148
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.544
yet in places seems
completely devoid of life.

149
00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:47.178
Bunji will swim through these
watery deserts alone.

150
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.309
When she does meet
other creatures.

151
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.561
they'll be travelling in groups.

152
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:03.569
It's a smart evolutionary
survival strategy.

153
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.032
After all. there's
safety in numbers.

154
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.538
Traveling the ocean solo

155
00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:17.041
Is a risk she'll have to take.

156
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.485
An ancient instinct is
calling Bunji.

157
00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.577
There's still a long way to go.

158
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:58.958
but she is exquisitely evolved
for undersea travel.

159
00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:06.924
Her buoyancy is so fine-tuned.

160
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.760
she moves with the absolute
minimum effort.

161
00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:16.434
Perfectly balanced. she is
weightless in her water world.

162
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:31.532
Sea turtles cruised the
ancient oceans

163
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.035
over 100 million years ago.

164
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:41.417
Since then. they have remained
anatomically unchanged.

165
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:51.427
Bunji is prehistoric perfection.
on a mission.

166
00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.766
Strangely. for such an
ancient creature.

167
00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.060
the biggest threat to
her survival

168
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.187
is a relative newcomer.

169
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.861
Humans.

170
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.829
From traditional fishermen
catching them with their hands.

171
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.957
to commercial fishing vessels

172
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.417
often catching them
as unintended

173
00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.628
bycatch in their thousands.

174
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:30.383
a quick getaway speed is
her only defense.

175
00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.932
There's still much
work to be done

176
00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.767
to protect turtles from humans.

177
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.480
In the last four decades.

178
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.316
the number of turtles injured by
boats has tripled.

179
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:03.040
And one new threat is
looming ever larger.

180
00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:08.838
In the stomachs of half of
all sea turtles

181
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.508
is plastic waste. and it's
really hurting them.

182
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.177
Turtles have a problem
telling the difference

183
00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:19.056
between plastic and one of their
major food sources.

184
00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.017
jellyfish.

185
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.853
Don't eat it. Bunji.

186
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.316
If no action is taken.

187
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:33.237
soon there will more plastic in
the ocean than fish.

188
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.789
Thankfully. some people have
dedicated their lives

189
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.833
to protecting sea turtles.

190
00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:25.122
Dr. Ian Bell is a turtle hero.

191
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.792
He leads a special task force

192
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.460
for the Queensland government.

193
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.380
It's called the
Threatened Species Unit

194
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:36.258
and today. they're catching
and tagging turtles

195
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.094
to find out more about them.

196
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.889
Combining data from government
agencies and thousands

197
00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:44.266
of volunteers from
around the world.

198
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.853
they've discovered a
staggering fact.

199
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.612
There are now only half as
many sea turtles

200
00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:00.449
in the ocean as there
were 100 years ago.

201
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.955
This small tag will
be a big help.

202
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.166
providing data to
scientists and volunteers

203
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.335
trying to save her species.

204
00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:16.757
Dr. Bell has discovered
that as earth warms.

205
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.760
it's changing the
temperatures of the beaches

206
00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:24.223
where turtles nest. and that
has him concerned.

207
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.935
Because if turtle eggs are laid
in extra warm sand.

208
00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:30.938
all the hatchlings
will be girls.

209
00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:40.156
Less male partners puts the
entire turtle species at risk.

210
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.968
Bunji's ocean home is where
complex life began.

211
00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.054
and on which most life
still depends.

212
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:10.936
Now fully grown. this
truly is her world.

213
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.612
A world we have barely explored.

214
00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:24.033
Filled with wild creatures

215
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.410
that are both weird

216
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.581
and wonderful.

217
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:37.421
Whose complex
relationships to each other

218
00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:39.924
we're only beginning
to understand.

219
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:45.387
We know more about the
surface of Mars

220
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:48.808
than what's hiding out
on our ocean floors.

221
00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:55.356
Who knows what
biological wonders

222
00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.233
are yet to be discovered?

223
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:07.076
The ocean is our
greatest treasure

224
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.161
and our greatest responsibility.

225
00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:12.915
And the remarkable recovery
of one species

226
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:17.461
provides hope for the continued
survival of the turtle.

227
00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:26.345
From the deep. a
behemoth arises.

228
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.011
Migrating south. this humpback
whale mother and calf

229
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:09.346
cross Bunji's path.

230
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.643
They're heading to the rich
feeding grounds of the Antarctic.

231
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:41.253
This big baby weighs in at
over 3.000 pounds.

232
00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:45.257
so Bunji would be wise to
keep her distance.

233
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:50.679
These whales were once
critically endangered.

234
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:53.265
hunted almost to extinction.

235
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:56.560
But then humans heard
their cry for help.

236
00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:02.566
Along the east coast
of Australia.

237
00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:07.363
humpback whale populations have
made a full recovery.

238
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:17.790
If we did it for these whales.

239
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:21.418
maybe we can still do it for
the sea turtles.

240
00:24:23.671 --> 00:24:25.339
Let's hope so.

241
00:24:25.506 --> 00:24:29.301
because entire ecosystems rest
on a turtle's back.

242
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:32.680
and that means an ocean
without turtles

243
00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:35.516
would be a very empty place.

244
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:46.986
As the whales travel south.

245
00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:49.405
other animals like Bunji

246
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.949
are heading north to
warmer waters.

247
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.204
Dolphins. whales and turtles
have been travelling

248
00:24:57.371 --> 00:24:59.039
these water highways

249
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.501
long before humans
walked the earth.

250
00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.730
Catching her breath
at the surface

251
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.482
is where Bunji is in
most danger.

252
00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:35.826
From below.

253
00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.828
she stands out

254
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.372
like a turtle target.

255
00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:49.548
This could be a bad
day for Bunji.

256
00:25:51.258 --> 00:25:53.135
Sharks eat turtles.

257
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.483
This great white shark is
over 16 feet long

258
00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.069
and could easily make a meal

259
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.154
out of a fully grown turtle.

260
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.421
Bunji is in real danger

261
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.507
but she has a plan.

262
00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:38.138
She takes evasive action.

263
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:41.016
turning her tough shell
towards her attacker.

264
00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:47.356
diving deep to the sea bed.

265
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:53.320
Down here. she's camouflaged
against the coral.

266
00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:58.117
To limit their time
at the surface.

267
00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:00.327
turtles have evolved the ability

268
00:27:00.494 --> 00:27:03.288
to reduce the amount of
oxygen they need.

269
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:09.086
They do this by slowing
their heartbeat down

270
00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:12.172
to one beat every minute.

271
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:28.188
And that means a
green sea turtle

272
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:31.608
can stay underwater for
over six hours.

273
00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.095
But Bunji can't stay
here forever.

274
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.056
As a cold-blooded reptile.

275
00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:08.437
she needs to return to the
surface and warmer waters.

276
00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:25.829
It's time to catch some
early morning rays.

277
00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:37.090
Some turtles even leave the
water for a spot of sunbathing.

278
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.429
It's often the larger males that
are the sun loungers.

279
00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:47.684
This beach boy will catch
rays all daylong.

280
00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:53.273
He's not aware that
soon he'll play

281
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.735
an important part in
Bunji's epic odyssey.

282
00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:06.787
As for Bunji. time is ticking.

283
00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:09.581
She must get ready
for her big day.

284
00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:13.085
but first she has to
make a quick stop.

285
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:17.589
Over 100 different
species can be found

286
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.300
living on green sea turtles.

287
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:24.554
The parasites help keep
her camouflaged

288
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:28.850
but they also slow her down and
can be quite itchy.

289
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.979
It's time to get some off.

290
00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:36.066
but how do you do that with
flippers for fingers?

291
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.738
She's looking for
something special.

292
00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:45.284
The right spot with the
right sort of fish.

293
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.745
These parrotfish are too big.

294
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:52.916
and these chromis fish
are too small.

295
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:59.423
Ah. but these tangs
are just right.

296
00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:03.927
Bunji has found a
cleaning station.

297
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.015
It's a place where smaller fish
feed off the creatures

298
00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:10.684
living on larger animals.

299
00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:15.188
This is known as a
symbiotic relationship.

300
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:18.025
It's win-win.

301
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.236
The little fish get fed.

302
00:30:21.403 --> 00:30:24.114
and the larger animals like
Bunji get cleaned.

303
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:26.116
Everybody's happy.

304
00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:30.704
And with a shell as sensitive as
a human fingertip.

305
00:30:30.871 --> 00:30:33.373
she also likes a good scratch.

306
00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.876
and a scratch.

307
00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:39.046
and a scratch.

308
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:47.512
But Bunji's not the only one who
likes a good scrub.

309
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:52.267
A squadron of rays is about
to hit the station.

310
00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:59.691
These bad boys can
have a wingspan

311
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:00.901
of over twenty feet.

312
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:04.529
and weigh up to 3.000 pounds.

313
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:08.700
That's the same as an
average family car.

314
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:13.622
So when these guys arrive.

315
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:16.458
they go right to
the front of the line.

316
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.214
And that means smaller fish.
like this batfish.

317
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:24.174
get bumped to the back.

318
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.011
Because in nature.

319
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:31.223
size really does matter.

320
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.441
But Bunji doesn't have
time to wait.

321
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:44.069
As the currents pick up.

322
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:47.280
she's being called to her
final destination.

323
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:52.202
But forces of nature are
rising against her.

324
00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.556
Bunji struggles.

325
00:32:15.642 --> 00:32:20.063
Even below the waves. the
currents swirl around her.

326
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.149
With low visibility.

327
00:32:22.315 --> 00:32:24.609
Bunji is using an
invisible force

328
00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:27.279
to guide her to a very
special place.

329
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:40.125
Bunji's brain can
actually detect

330
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:43.128
the magnetic fields
of the earth.

331
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:51.803
Every place on the globe has a
unique magnetic fingerprint.

332
00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:56.349
Bunji uses this
information like a map.

333
00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.145
As she gets close. her
map matches that

334
00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:02.647
of her current location.

335
00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:04.649
At last.

336
00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.777
she's reached her destination.

337
00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:17.913
She's home.

338
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.752
After 25 years at sea.

339
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:27.297
she's come back to the very
beach she was born on.

340
00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:47.526
And she's not alone.

341
00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.497
The Great Barrier Reef is
host to the biggest

342
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:04.167
green sea turtle
rookery in the world.

343
00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:17.222
Bunji's big adventure
is one shared

344
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.307
by thousands of other turtles.

345
00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:22.477
All around the world.

346
00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:26.189
green sea turtles are making
similar great migrations

347
00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:28.775
to the beaches where
they were born.

348
00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:34.906
So. this family of turtles

349
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:37.325
may have been coming back to
this very beach.

350
00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:39.244
generation after generation.

351
00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:41.621
for thousands of years.

352
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:48.878
It's one of nature's most
astonishing family reunions.

353
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:52.799
Now it's Bunji's turn
to play her part

354
00:34:52.966 --> 00:34:55.552
in that larger turtle story.

355
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:00.390
It's time for Bunji
to find a boyfriend.

356
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.674
Once Bunji has mated.

357
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:38.386
she will remain close to shore
for over a month.

358
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.144
Then. when the time is right.

359
00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:48.938
she'll undertake her most
important task.

360
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.737
It's time for Bunji to leave
her water world.

361
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.453
It will be her toughest
turtle trial.

362
00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:07.624
After a lifetime of
weightlessness in the ocean.

363
00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.418
gravity really sucks.

364
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:15.632
Weighing in at 250 pounds.

365
00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:17.926
Bunji has to
struggle up the same

366
00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:20.261
strip of beach that.
decades before.

367
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:22.347
she scurried down.

368
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:30.438
She'll spend the next few hours

369
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.315
digging herself into the sand.

370
00:36:32.482 --> 00:36:34.776
and scooping out a
chamber for her eggs.

371
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.279
It's exhausting work for this
soon-to-be-mother.

372
00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:42.367
but her instinct is unflagging.

373
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:57.799
She'll bury her eggs in
the same sand

374
00:36:57.966 --> 00:37:01.302
her mother did over
25 years ago.

375
00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:14.065
The warm sand will
keep them safe

376
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.192
for the next two
or three months.

377
00:37:25.285 --> 00:37:29.122
Finally. she covers her nest
with the gentle care

378
00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:31.249
that only a mother can give.

379
00:37:39.048 --> 00:37:42.510
Laying five or so clutches
every few years.

380
00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:50.852
she will produce thousands of
offspring in her lifetime.

381
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:17.420
After along night.

382
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:20.215
she'll return to the
comfort of the sea.

383
00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:25.970
She'll be back.

384
00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.305
but for now.

385
00:38:29.682 --> 00:38:32.936
her odyssey is complete.

386
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:49.869
Three months later.
another chapter

387
00:38:50.036 --> 00:38:52.789
in the turtle tale begins.

388
00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:06.094
A new generation of tiny turtle
toddlers are popping up.

389
00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:13.309
It's time for Bunji's
little babies

390
00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:16.980
to take on the challenges of
the turtle odyssey.
