13
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.399
I know it's hard to believe what I'm saying.

14
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.300
How could one believe such nonsense?

15
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.209
But since it happened already. why don't you just believe me?

16
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.509
To put it bluntly. you and I can't die like this. am I not right?

17
00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.610
The hunting is over. They're going to kill us!

18
00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950
Are you going to do nothing even when you know what will happen?

19
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.149
You know you're going to die there.

20
00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.020
but you're still thinking of crawling in there?

21
00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:07.520
I sacrificed so much to get here.

22
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.360
I tolerated so much...

23
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.989
and did whatever I need to do to get myself here.

24
00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.629
In order for us to survive.

25
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.700
in order to avoid being a dog killed and eaten after the hunt is over...

26
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.369

So did you. my daughter.

35
00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.270
We need to bite first.

36
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.839
Before he makes a move.

37
00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.540
we need to cut his head off.

38
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.550
That's how we'll survive. That's how Korea will survive.

39
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.719

40
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420

58
00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:35.739
I think I need to revise the speech a little.

59
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.469
No. there's nothing wrong with it.

60
00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.510
I just want to say something more personal to them.

61
00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:44.209
The reporters are my juniors.

62
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.349
I should talk to them as a mentor. not just the President.

63
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.990

66
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.229
What happened?

67
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.099
Mr. President. they said there's been an accident on the way.

68
00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.700
- Really? - Yes.

69
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.099
Let the emergency vehicles go first then.

70
00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.870

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.820
Is that the accident?

73
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Yes. sir.

74
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.830
Any casualties?

75
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.000
They said there haven't been any. thankfully. because it was small.

76
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.830
but there has been a disruption in communications.

77
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.339
I request your understanding despite the inconvenience.

78
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.740
Goodness.

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.390
(Daughter)

80
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.820
Then I can't use my cell phone to call this one now?

81
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.690
Are you trying to get in touch with your daughter?

82
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.830
Yes. She's so busy these days.

83
00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:12.370
I feel like she's busier than the President. somehow.

84

Former President Baek. under investigation currently...

85
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.779
for his role in the creation of a 300 million dollar slush fund.

86
00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.180
was interrogated by the prosecutor's office this morning.

87
00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:27.820
During the interrogation process.

88
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.490
President Baek denied all personal involvement...

89
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.320
- in this crime. - He's coming out.

90
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.919
Please say something.

91
00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.620
Considering you've denied all the allegations...

92
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.630
How do you feel about these charges as the former President?

93
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.990
Why do you feel that this investigation is unfair?

94
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.599
I've heard...

95
00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.229
that you denied all allegations of personal involvement.

96
00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.799
How do you feel about being investigated like this?

97
00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:46.200
Please say something.

98
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.669
Seo Jung In. what are you doing in a place like this?

99
00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:55.909
I'm reporter Seo Jung In for DBS.

100
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.609
I'm here to cover this incident. just like the other reporters.

101
00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:01.820
The current President's daughter...

102
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.919
digging up dirt on the former President.

103
00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.120
What a joke.

104
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.419
Fine. what's your question?

105
00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.289
I'll answer all your questions.

106
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.899
I heard you've denied all the allegations against you.

107
00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:20.099
Because they're not true.

108
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.539
This all the work of those in power...

109
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.570
trying to dominate those who were formerly in power.

110
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.539
You're saying it's a political move?

111
00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:29.640
You made similar declarations many times in the past.

112
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.750
Do you remember them?

113
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.080
In 2011. during your term.

114
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.279
even when the illegal use of campaign funds came to light...

115
00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.890
This is simply a political move targeting me.

116
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.690
In 2014. when your son was involved in a bribery scandal...

117
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.789
This is simply political maneuvering.

118
00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.399
which negatively impacts our citizens.

119
00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.229
You always said the same thing.

120
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.570
Your sibling. Baek Jeong Min.

121
00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.000
already confessed to the bribe...

122
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.799
and even provided evidence.

123
00:07:56.799 --> 00:08:00.370
Even in that situation. you insisted there was political maneuvering.

124
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:03.310
Do you believe that all investigations...

125
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.080
into the former President's crimes are simply political ploys?

126
00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.750
Don't you think you're the one who's politicking now?

127
00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:14.359
Are your questions over?

128
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.589
Then let me respond.

129
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.870
- What's he saying? - What is it?

130
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.500
What is he saying?

131
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.609
- Just one word further. - One more question.

132
00:08:36.609 --> 00:08:40.549
- How do you feel? - Former President Baek.

133
00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.390
I believe Former President Baek knows the truth very well.

Here's the next piece of news.

139
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.470
Members of the ruling party have scoffed at the investigation.

140
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.010
calling it an investigation to "brush off the dust".

141
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.240
At a meeting with prominent leaders of the ruling party.

142
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.740
President Seo made a comment...

143
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.350
to add to that sentiment.

144
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.819
Let's listen to his remarks.

145
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.490
What did he say?

146
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.159
- What? - What did Baek Kyu Min say to you?

147
00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.929
Oh. that.

148
00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:25.559
Just...

149
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.600
You think your father will be any different?

150
00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:31.169
As soon as his term is over. he'll end up like me.

151
00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:32.899
That's what he said.

152
00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:36.439
Wow. that's strong.

153
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.370
Are you all right after hearing something like that?

154
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.980
Why wouldn't I be?

155
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.010
"She got her job at the broadcasting company because of her dad."

156
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.250
"She just praises the Seo Administration."

157
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.380
"and only got what she has because her dad has power."

158
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.919
I hear that kind of thing too.

159
00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.789
It's all right. I'm fine.

161
00:09:52.189 --> 00:09:55.289
Are you mentally strong. or do you just have no manners?

162
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.929
I get curious about that when I hear you talk.

163
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.199
To ignore lies. revere the truth.

164
00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.860
and uncover the facts. Isn't that what a reporter does?

165
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.199
As long as I have this.

Both myself and you. the legislators.

173

Two days ago. a fire broke out...

174

at a switchboard building in Jongpo whose cause remains unknown.

175
00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:38.799
Even now. wireless communications in the area are down.

182
00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:39.230
Now?

183
00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:15.899
Dad.

184
00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:18.470
Dad.

185
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.510
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

186
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.579
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

187
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.079
- Happy birthday dear Reporter Seo - Happy birthday dear Reporter Seo

188
00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:38.649
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

189
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.120
Happy birthday. my daughter.

190
00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:44.159
What is this?

191
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:46.390
You should blow out the candles. The wax will fall on the cake.

192
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.740
Here you go.

193
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.250
Did you make all of this since this morning?

194
00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:05.909
Yes. I did.

195
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.159
I thought you might be too busy to eat.

196
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.360
Please eat a lot.

197
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.630
You've lost so much weight.

198
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.529
What do you mean? I haven't lost any weight.

199
00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:24.630
It looks like that to me. you punk.

200
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.710
I saw the news yesterday.

201
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.510
What did that man. President Baek. say?

202
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.350
He just told me to do my best...

203
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.710
until the day I become a great reporter like you.

204
00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:42.980
Is that what he really said?

205
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:45.919
You're not lying to me. are you?

206
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.860
I only told you what's 100 percent true.

207
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.960
"Do your best. Then you'll become..."

208
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.500
"a great reporter like your father."

209
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.559
That's what I heard.

210
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.600
I'm telling the truth.

211
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.510
Who would lie to the president of South Korea?

212
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.140
Is that so? Okay. then.

213
00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:12.309
Why did you say that at the conference?

214
00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:14.079
A lot of people are saying that you provoked...

215
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.419
the members of the ruling party for no reason.

216
00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:18.049
I wanted to break their wrong ideas.

217
00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:20.590
I have nothing to say regarding Former President Baek's...

218
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.559
prosecution investigation.

219
00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:24.360
I can't do anything about it.

220
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.130
and I shouldn't tell them what to do either.

221
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.260
Let's talk about the bill for the dispatched work act.

222
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:31.699
There is nothing that the current president can do...

223
00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:33.829
for the sake of the former president's clemency.

224
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.140
I wanted to portray this message...

225
00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:38.770
to the members of my party and the citizens.

226
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.039
"This administration will not have the president..."

227
00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:43.480
"abuse his power under the notion..."

228
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.779
"of custom and practice like previous administrations."

229
00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:48.279
Is that the message?

230
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.779
Yes.

231
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.689
We must right what is wrong.

232
00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:55.220
Turning a blind eye to it won't make it go away.

233
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.390
Rather than ignoring it. we must face it and go head-on.

234
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:00.730
That's how the world will change.

235
00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:14.909
A report fell through for tomorrow. It's an emergency.

236
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.939
Dad. I need to go to work.

237
00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:18.779
Isn't today your day off?

238
00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:20.110
A report fell through. I need to go.

239
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.649
Have a bite first.

240
00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:23.980
- I have to go. - Have a bite before you go.

241
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.990
We'll take a look at the core values of our company.

242
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.059
Okay. Precision management.

243
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.490
We will be true to the fundamentals and principles.

244
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.590
and we always strive for precision.

245
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.929
Quality. We aim to be the first in the world for quality inspection.

246
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.039
and we create products in accordance with GNP and ISO regulations.

247
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:44.409
Trust. We respect our customers.

248
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.110
We put mutual trust between employees first.

249
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.010
I think this company is really nice.

250
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.649
- Pardon? - This company. It seems very nice.

251
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.380
I see. Right. It seems like a nice company.

252
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.490
If I'm being completely honest.

253
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.090
I thought I would never be able to get a job.

254
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.659
I've been preparing to get a job for over 10 years.

255
00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:06.829
and I've never been on a proper interview.

256
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:08.760
But I got hired here.

257
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.429
They said I had a good first impression.

258
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.699
They said I seemed warm and kind...

259
00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:14.199
and that I reminded them of a piggy bank.

260
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.169
Congratulations.

261
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.309
That's why I intend to do my best for this company.

262
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.779
- I'll... - I'm sorry.

263
00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:27.679
Can you please be quiet?

264
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:29.980
I can't hear what he's saying.

265
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.350
Oh. I'm sorry.

266
00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:34.559
I was being tactless. I was so excited to have gotten a job.

267
00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:37.289
I know how you feel. so please be quiet.

268
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.529
Please do that for me.

269
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.399
I'm sorry to have bothered you when we just met. I'm sorry.

270
00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:46.069
At the same time. We at Ark Communication...

271
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.340
have a PV system.

272
00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:52.140
PV system. It's an employee point system.

273
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.809
This PV system. the employee point system.

274
00:16:54.909 --> 00:16:58.210
is a revolutionary and creative system...

275
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.049
for a performance assessment that is unique to Ark Communication.

276
00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:03.449
- Excuse me. - Let's take a closer look.

277
00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:06.850
- The PV system... - I understand that...

278
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.460
it was hard for you to get employed.

279
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.020
but don't work for this company.

280
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.390
Pardon? Why would you say that?

281
00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:15.899
This company is an illegal pyramid scheme.

282
00:17:15.899 --> 00:17:18.669
They use employment as a way to bait naive people...

283
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:21.100
into selling weird products.

284
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.100
Gosh. no way.

285
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.809
I'm telling the truth.

286
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.480
That system was created so that those with low performance...

287
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.439
can bring in more people.

288
00:17:30.439 --> 00:17:33.149
They raise your status and your pay with that.

289
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.480
Then victims will bring in other victims.

290
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.650
This is a scam.

291
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.289
Don't fall for these things.

292
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:41.420
How do you know all of this?

293
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.990
To be honest. I'm...

294
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.000
- a reporter. - A reporter?

295
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.639
- Are you here to cover a story? - Yes.

296
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.700
How do you film or record?

297
00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:04.609
- That's incredible. - My gosh.

298
00:18:05.879 --> 00:18:08.119
That's so cool. Hold on.

299
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:10.279
You're so cool.

300
00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:12.190
- Hold on. - Where are you going?

301
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.990
A reporter.

302
00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:18.460
What? What is this?

303
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.200
Beat him up. okay?

304
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.369
Okay. I'll take care of it. Mr. Chairman.

305
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.369
Hey. Go grab that man.

306
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.170
Hold on. Hold on a second.

307
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.970
There must be a misunderstanding.

308
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.069
What are you doing? Get him!

309
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.119
Where are you going? Stop right there!

310
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:47.220
Get him!

311
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.319
My gosh.

312
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.660
- My gosh. - Gosh.

313
00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:59.500
- Move over. - My goodness.

314
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.670
We have to get him!

315
00:19:02.569 --> 00:19:03.970
What do you want for lunch?

316
00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:05.970
- What do you think about jjigae? - That sounds good.

317
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.010
Over there!

318
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.279
Hey. an article will come out tomorrow.

319
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.410
so tell that pig to sue me.

320
00:19:13.609 --> 00:19:15.079
I'm reporter Lee Jin Woo from Times.

321
00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:16.579
Get over here!

322
00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:18.150
- Bye! - Darn it.

323
00:19:19.049 --> 00:19:21.049
- Darn it. - My gosh!

324
00:19:26.829 --> 00:19:28.099
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:39.910
The recovery of the base station accident in Jongpo...

327
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.279
has been moved up.

328
00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:43.779
and it will be completely restored within an hour.

329

After the accident at the base station. there are various issues...

330
00:19:47.609 --> 00:19:49.420
such as failed credit card transactions.

331
00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:51.849
The Provisional Government Building Management Office...

332
00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:53.450
announced that they will create statues and historical recordings...

333
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.059

Hey. Seo Jeong In!

340
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.829
Why would you have ox knee soup?

341
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:33.960
Everyone had ox bone soup which is 8 dollars.

342
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.829
so why did you use the company card to eat a 15-dollar ox knee soup?

343
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.029
- Who are you? - What?

344
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.670
- What? - Who am I?

345
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.369
- Yes. - Who am I?

346
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.000
Yes. who are you?

347
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.839
Then who are you to sit at a desk in someone else's company...

348
00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:49.839
and have ox knee soup using the company card?

349
00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:54.210
- I did? - Yes. you did. You did that.

350
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.579
Did I say something wrong?

351
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.650
Do you know how much money we spend on your food?

352
00:20:59.889 --> 00:21:03.490
I don't even remember the last time I had ox knee soup.

353
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.889
Has it been 20 years?

354

- the dish I was excited about... - Enough.

357
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.329
was ox knee soup.

358
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.270
Stop getting mad over what someone ate.

359

537
00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:09.604
Did she leave?

538
00:35:11.504 --> 00:35:14.234
Gosh. she's psychic. I swear.

539
00:35:20.444 --> 00:35:21.613
Detective Yoon.

540
00:35:24.884 --> 00:35:26.214
Why are you avoiding me?

541
00:35:27.484 --> 00:35:29.384
Who. me? When? I didn't.

542
00:35:29.384 --> 00:35:31.484
What do you mean? You just hid from me.

543
00:35:31.484 --> 00:35:34.124
I wasn't hiding.

544
00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:37.223
I'm not a hider. I'm someone who catches people who hide.

545
00:35:39.734 --> 00:35:40.933
But why are you here?

546
00:35:41.263 --> 00:35:43.134
Same reason as always.

547
00:35:43.234 --> 00:35:44.803
Why are you being like this to me?

548
00:35:45.334 --> 00:35:48.404
When that happened to Mr. Seo. I was just the sole of that shoe.

549
00:35:48.404 --> 00:35:50.604
I'm still doing grunt work.

550
00:35:52.044 --> 00:35:53.473
I have no power to help you.

551
00:35:54.544 --> 00:35:57.084
I don't expect anything grand from you.

552
00:35:57.084 --> 00:35:59.113
I just want you to suggest reinvestigating the case.

553
00:35:59.553 --> 00:36:01.613
Just suggest it to the brass.

554
00:36:01.613 --> 00:36:04.124
I told you that's no easy thing to do.

555
00:36:04.124 --> 00:36:05.893
So just quit because it's not easy?

556
00:36:06.124 --> 00:36:08.553
Even if there's a problem with the investigation. it's over?

557
00:36:08.553 --> 00:36:10.493
What's the problem?

558
00:36:10.493 --> 00:36:11.993
That's just your opinion.

559
00:36:11.993 --> 00:36:14.493
I'm just saying the police report doesn't make any sense.

560
00:36:14.493 --> 00:36:17.734
On the day of the incident. the traffic flow makes no sense.

561
00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:24.303
Maybe I should stop being so patient.

562
00:36:24.303 --> 00:36:26.174
Maybe I should just throw myself in front of the station.

563
00:36:26.413 --> 00:36:27.913
I should do that.

564
00:36:28.343 --> 00:36:29.714
I should just lie on the ground even though it's cold.

565
00:36:30.084 --> 00:36:32.283
What are you talking about? It's cold outside.

566
00:36:32.283 --> 00:36:34.513
Last time. you only lasted because it was summer.

567
00:36:34.513 --> 00:36:37.424
People shouldn't just roll around wherever they want. Don't do that.

568
00:36:37.424 --> 00:36:41.493
I know. right. So just help me this one time.

569
00:36:42.424 --> 00:36:43.924
You're driving me crazy.

570
00:36:45.093 --> 00:36:46.263
Where was it again?

571
00:36:47.564 --> 00:36:50.933
This is my business card. which I picked up from the trash.

572
00:36:51.703 --> 00:36:54.203
Why do you keep throwing out my business card?

573
00:36:54.573 --> 00:36:57.004
I've given you so many now.

574
00:36:57.004 --> 00:36:59.113
- Why was that in the trash? - Because you threw it out.

575
00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:01.113
Because you threw it out. That's why it was in the trash.

576
00:37:04.084 --> 00:37:06.984
If you make any progress. please get in touch with me.

577
00:37:06.984 --> 00:37:07.984
I'm asking you as a favor.

578
00:37:07.984 --> 00:37:09.624
Okay. okay.

579
00:37:10.254 --> 00:37:11.754
I'll go now. Thanks.

580
00:37:16.323 --> 00:37:18.863
(Detective Division)

581
00:37:26.904 --> 00:37:28.904
Why would you even listen to her in the first place?

582
00:37:28.904 --> 00:37:31.774
How can I ignore her when she is talking in my face?

583
00:37:32.674 --> 00:37:33.674
Director Han.

584
00:37:35.913 --> 00:37:38.084
- Don't do it. - Director Han.

585
00:37:42.113 --> 00:37:44.953
Can't you just review this case to see if we can reopen it?

586
00:37:44.953 --> 00:37:47.953
I'm losing sleep over that woman.

587
00:37:48.124 --> 00:37:50.124
I even talk in my sleep.

588
00:37:50.223 --> 00:37:52.263
"Seo Jung In. don't do this. Go home and sleep."

589
00:37:52.263 --> 00:37:54.694
That's what I said when my wife was there.

590
00:37:54.694 --> 00:37:57.663
She's been asking me who the heck Seo Jung In is.

591
00:37:57.663 --> 00:38:00.174
Give it up already. What reinvestigation?

592
00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:01.374
Do you not have enough work?

593
00:38:01.774 --> 00:38:02.803
Director Han.

594
00:38:04.243 --> 00:38:05.274
Don't ever do it.

595
00:38:05.274 --> 00:38:08.343
If I just work hard...

596
00:38:08.343 --> 00:38:11.283
Seong Ho. just work hard at the cases you already have.

597
00:38:11.283 --> 00:38:13.354
Do you not have enough work?

598
00:38:13.354 --> 00:38:14.453
- I don't. - Why this little...

599
00:38:14.453 --> 00:38:15.953
Stop it. you two.

600
00:38:15.984 --> 00:38:19.124
You're all working hard today to preserve the peace in Korea.

601
00:38:20.254 --> 00:38:21.424
Please have one of these.

602
00:38:23.163 --> 00:38:24.363
Thank you.

603
00:38:24.363 --> 00:38:25.723
I have another one here.

604
00:38:27.294 --> 00:38:29.734
Anyway. let's just go eat.

605
00:38:29.734 --> 00:38:31.004
All right.

606
00:38:31.703 --> 00:38:35.134
Every time I meet Seo Jung In. I end up so drained.

607
00:38:36.274 --> 00:38:37.444
But...

608
00:38:38.904 --> 00:38:41.843
I just heard...

609
00:38:41.843 --> 00:38:44.584
about Seo Jung In. Does she come here that often?

610
00:38:44.584 --> 00:38:47.214
She's always here asking us to reopen a case.

611
00:38:47.214 --> 00:38:49.723
What does she expect us to do about a closed case?

612
00:38:50.553 --> 00:38:51.584
I see.

613
00:38:52.124 --> 00:38:53.553
It must be hard for you.

614
00:38:53.553 --> 00:38:56.524
So in other words. the daughter of Seo Ki Tae...

615
00:38:56.524 --> 00:38:58.294
comes to the station every single day.

616
00:38:58.294 --> 00:38:59.964
causing a scene and obstructing police work.

617
00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:01.794
Could I interpret it that way?

618
00:39:01.993 --> 00:39:03.904
It is sort of like that. I guess.

619
00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:06.104
But why are you asking me that?

620
00:39:06.803 --> 00:39:10.004
I think I might be able to relieve some of your worries.

621
00:39:13.613 --> 00:39:14.814
What are you talking about?

622
00:39:14.814 --> 00:39:16.413
The country's in trouble. and so is the economy.

623
00:39:16.413 --> 00:39:18.484
Let's give the people some entertainment.

624
00:39:19.453 --> 00:39:21.484
Isn't that the job of a reporter?

625
00:39:22.823 --> 00:39:23.823
(Seo Jung In)

626
00:39:23.823 --> 00:39:24.884
(Unlocked)

627
00:39:28.754 --> 00:39:30.064
Good morning.

628
00:39:30.093 --> 00:39:31.524
Are you out of your mind?

629
00:39:32.424 --> 00:39:34.064
Letters of resignation at this time?

630
00:39:34.064 --> 00:39:35.564
Not just for one of you. but both of you?

631
00:39:35.564 --> 00:39:36.863
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

632
00:39:36.863 --> 00:39:38.703
If you're sorry. don't quit.

633
00:39:38.703 --> 00:39:41.473
Even if you resign. just leave when you're not sorry.

634
00:39:43.343 --> 00:39:45.843
We're not that sorry. to be honest.

635
00:39:48.714 --> 00:39:50.743
Is a company a place you enter when you want.

636
00:39:50.743 --> 00:39:52.444
and leave when you want?

637
00:39:52.444 --> 00:39:54.183
Are you looking down on it because it's going bankrupt?

638
00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:55.484
No. that's not it.

639
00:39:55.484 --> 00:39:57.084
Of course. it is.

640
00:39:57.084 --> 00:39:59.694
Don't leave. You need my permission to leave.

641
00:40:00.093 --> 00:40:04.223
I thought Daily Search was a huge company. so I came.

642
00:40:04.223 --> 00:40:06.564
But yesterday.

643
00:40:06.564 --> 00:40:07.734
I translated an American drama.

644
00:40:07.734 --> 00:40:09.194
There's one that our CEO watches.

645
00:40:09.194 --> 00:40:11.964
but the subtitles weren't ready yet. so he asked me to do it.

646
00:40:11.964 --> 00:40:13.473
And I did.

647
00:40:13.634 --> 00:40:16.104
My life officially sucks. It sucks.

648
00:40:16.473 --> 00:40:17.504
Calm down.

649
00:40:17.544 --> 00:40:19.314
Just hold off on resigning for now.

650
00:40:19.314 --> 00:40:22.444
Just for a few months. Just a month or two.

651
00:40:22.743 --> 00:40:25.413
If we all leave. no one will be here for Young Jae.

652
00:40:25.843 --> 00:40:27.654
(Daily Search CEO)

653
00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:33.823
Yes. we're coming back now.

654
00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:37.163
What?

655
00:40:38.194 --> 00:40:39.593
Let's go.

656
00:40:40.663 --> 00:40:41.763
It's Seo Jung In.

657
00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:43.533
- There she is. - It's Seo Jung In.

658
00:40:43.533 --> 00:40:45.504
Are you really trying to get the police to reopen the case?

659
00:40:45.504 --> 00:40:48.004
We heard you're getting psychological treatment.

660
00:40:48.004 --> 00:40:50.143
Is it true you've asked the police to reinvestigate the case?

661
00:40:50.174 --> 00:40:52.104
Is this all true?

662
00:40:52.104 --> 00:40:54.274
We heard you're still going to visit the police station.

663
00:40:54.274 --> 00:40:55.343
What is this?

664
00:40:55.343 --> 00:40:56.884
What's the reason you've asked for a reinvestigation?

665
00:40:58.413 --> 00:41:00.754
What do you think you're doing in front of my company?

666
00:41:01.354 --> 00:41:02.783
Seo Jung In. get back to work.

667
00:41:03.183 --> 00:41:04.453
- Hold on! - My gosh.

668
00:41:04.453 --> 00:41:06.254
- Say a word! - My goodness. Move over.

669
00:41:06.254 --> 00:41:08.093
Don't take a photograph!

670
00:41:08.093 --> 00:41:10.464
Don't take a photograph. It's over. Go.

671
00:41:10.464 --> 00:41:12.124
- My gosh. - My goodness.

672
00:41:12.124 --> 00:41:14.093
- Go. I said go! - I waited for an hour.

673
00:41:14.093 --> 00:41:15.294
- Go back. - She's over there!

674
00:41:15.294 --> 00:41:16.564
- What? - What are you doing?

675
00:41:17.004 --> 00:41:18.303
Hey! Lower the blinds!

676
00:41:18.303 --> 00:41:20.504
- Get a photograph! - Don't take a photograph!

677
00:41:20.504 --> 00:41:22.843
- My gosh. - Don't take a photograph!

678
00:41:22.843 --> 00:41:24.674
- Don't do it. - Don't take a photograph.

679
00:41:24.674 --> 00:41:27.113
Gosh. Move.

680
00:41:27.743 --> 00:41:29.743
My goodness. Don't take any photographs!

681
00:41:30.384 --> 00:41:31.643
I'm going to call the police.

682
00:41:31.643 --> 00:41:33.314
This is why you guys get criticized.

683
00:41:33.314 --> 00:41:34.814
- What. you punk? - "What. you punk?"

684
00:41:34.814 --> 00:41:35.884
Yes. "What. you punk?"

685
00:41:35.884 --> 00:41:37.584
You little...

686
00:41:38.924 --> 00:41:41.294
Don't take any photographs.

687
00:41:43.823 --> 00:41:44.893
Gosh. you punk.

(Daily Search)

689
00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:51.964
My stomach!

690
00:41:52.263 --> 00:41:54.234
Seo Jeong In. the daughter of the late Seo Ki Tae.

691
00:41:54.234 --> 00:41:56.243
has raised suspicions regarding her father's death.

692
00:41:56.643 --> 00:41:59.274
She said the police are at fault for failing to reveal the truth...

693
00:41:59.274 --> 00:42:01.044
and has requested a complete reinvestigation on the case.

694
00:42:01.044 --> 00:42:02.944
Let's meet a detective who was in charge of the case..

695
00:42:02.944 --> 00:42:04.613
and hear what he has to say.

696
00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:06.754
Why did Ms. Seo Jeong In request a reinvestigation?

697
00:42:06.754 --> 00:42:07.814
("What Is the Truth Behind the Hanguk University Assassination?")

698
00:42:07.814 --> 00:42:10.683
Well. I suppose it's paranoia.

699
00:42:10.683 --> 00:42:14.294
Furthermore. I was told that at first...

700
00:42:14.294 --> 00:42:16.424
she claimed that her father.

701
00:42:16.424 --> 00:42:19.363
the late Assemblyman Seo Ki Tae. was still alive.

702
00:42:19.893 --> 00:42:23.163
She kept coming and demanding that we reinvestigate the case.

703
00:42:23.163 --> 00:42:25.663
- Detective Yoon. that jerk. - One day...

704
00:42:26.473 --> 00:42:29.134
What they're saying is untrue.

705
00:42:29.134 --> 00:42:31.044
It's been edited maliciously.

706
00:42:31.044 --> 00:42:32.504
I don't have paranoia.

707
00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:34.674
and I didn't obstruct justice.

708
00:42:34.674 --> 00:42:35.874
Do you want to stay. or do you want to leave?

709
00:42:37.413 --> 00:42:38.783
Do you want to stay. or do you want to leave?

710
00:42:38.783 --> 00:42:39.884
You can decide.

711
00:42:41.154 --> 00:42:43.254
- Young Jae. - I want to fire you.

712
00:42:43.254 --> 00:42:45.683
but I'm worried about your severance pay. so I can't do that.

713
00:42:45.683 --> 00:42:48.223
I'll give you a chance to write a letter of resignation.

714
00:42:48.223 --> 00:42:49.524
Or if you're going to stay...

715
00:42:50.564 --> 00:42:52.363
My gosh. Seriously.

716
00:42:55.334 --> 00:42:58.763
How many times must I tell you to empty the trash can?

717
00:42:58.763 --> 00:42:59.904
Please!

718
00:42:59.904 --> 00:43:01.104
Who's in charge of it today?

719
00:43:01.104 --> 00:43:03.073
- It's you. - It's you.

720
00:43:03.243 --> 00:43:04.274
Is it me?

721
00:43:07.513 --> 00:43:09.683
I'm your CEO. Do you see me as such a pushover?

722
00:43:09.884 --> 00:43:11.044
My gosh!

723
00:43:14.984 --> 00:43:17.654
Gosh. What's going on?

724
00:43:17.823 --> 00:43:20.294
Why is he acting like that again? Why is making such a fuss?

725
00:43:23.524 --> 00:43:24.964
Are we late on the rent again?

726
00:43:26.634 --> 00:43:27.763
My goodness.

727
00:43:42.643 --> 00:43:43.643
Jeong In!

728
00:43:45.084 --> 00:43:46.314
- Goodness. - Thank you.

Don't think about it too much.

Do Young Jae is a jerk all the time.

731
00:43:55.453 --> 00:43:57.024
Do Young Jae needs to change everything...

732
00:43:57.024 --> 00:43:59.993
from his face to his personality.

733
00:43:59.993 --> 00:44:01.593
He can't say anything at home.

734
00:44:01.593 --> 00:44:03.634
so why does he act like that when he's outside?

735
00:44:03.634 --> 00:44:05.634
It's understandable that he'd be mad.

736
00:44:05.634 --> 00:44:08.604
Even if that's the case. he shouldn't have said that.

737
00:44:08.604 --> 00:44:10.444
Why would he do that? In front of everyone at that.

738
00:44:11.044 --> 00:44:14.044
Whenever he acts like that. I want to punch him in the face.

739
00:44:15.044 --> 00:44:16.314
You should be careful.

740
00:44:16.314 --> 00:44:17.783
Won Dong is kicking.

741
00:44:20.613 --> 00:44:24.884
You understand why he's acting like that. right?

742
00:44:25.254 --> 00:44:26.453
Yes. I do.

743
00:44:26.854 --> 00:44:30.263
You told me about his friend a couple of times.

744
00:44:31.163 --> 00:44:33.263
You said I remind him of his friend.

745
00:44:33.263 --> 00:44:36.433
That's right. He was very similar to you.

746
00:44:37.303 --> 00:44:40.134
After his brother died. he pretty much lived at the police station...

747
00:44:40.674 --> 00:44:42.203
to reveal the truth.

748
00:44:43.874 --> 00:44:46.814
I felt really bad for him. just like you.

749
00:44:48.473 --> 00:44:52.314
But now that I think about it. do you know what's really sad?

750
00:44:53.613 --> 00:44:55.884
I don't remember his life.

751
00:44:55.984 --> 00:44:58.223
He was an older brother who was hung up on his brother's case.

752
00:44:58.223 --> 00:45:00.654
He was a reporter who had a strong sense of vocation for his work.

753
00:45:01.254 --> 00:45:03.124
I remember those things about him.

754
00:45:05.064 --> 00:45:07.393
but I don't remember what kind of person he was.

755
00:45:09.194 --> 00:45:11.604
He gave up on everything he wanted to do.

756
00:45:16.134 --> 00:45:17.343
So Jeong In.

757
00:45:18.743 --> 00:45:21.573
don't make that your entire life.

758
00:45:22.613 --> 00:45:26.143
Don't live life while holding on to the past like him.

759
00:45:29.413 --> 00:45:30.484

No. I'm not waiting for anyone. Who do I have to wait for?

What's so good about this morning? Come to work on time!

766

Are you saying it doesn't matter since we're practically bankrupt?

767
00:46:56.274 --> 00:46:57.843
You're so rude. How dare you write a letter of resignation?

890
00:54:03.918 --> 00:54:06.177
What do you mean? This is Lee Jin Woo from Times.

891
00:54:06.177 --> 00:54:07.418
We talked over the phone yesterday.

892
00:54:08.287 --> 00:54:11.217
Excuse me. I definitely told you it's not the case yesterday.

893
00:54:11.217 --> 00:54:12.787
You're still doing this?

894
00:54:12.787 --> 00:54:13.988
What's wrong with you? You're making me frustrated.

895
00:54:13.988 --> 00:54:16.358
You agreed to do an interview and you suddenly pretend not to know.

896
00:54:16.358 --> 00:54:18.898
I'm not pretending.

897
00:54:18.898 --> 00:54:21.228
I think you're seriously mistaken.

898
00:54:21.228 --> 00:54:23.938
- I'm not mistaken at all. - You called a wrong person. Bye.

899
00:54:24.997 --> 00:54:27.367
How many times do I have to tell him he got the wrong number?

900
00:54:27.367 --> 00:54:28.438
Hello?

901
00:54:34.177 --> 00:54:35.278
What should I do?

902
00:54:42.347 --> 00:54:44.758
Young Jun. the hotspot...

903
00:54:46.858 --> 00:54:47.958
Come on.

904
00:54:49.588 --> 00:54:50.628
You're going to do this?

905
00:54:50.858 --> 00:54:52.628
I'm not answering.

906
00:55:05.037 --> 00:55:09.048
Why. just why? I said you got the wrong number!

907
00:55:09.048 --> 00:55:11.577
What do you mean I got the wrong number? I called the right person.

908
00:55:11.577 --> 00:55:13.488
You said you wanted to help your father.

909
00:55:13.847 --> 00:55:15.847
- Sorry? - You said you'll do an interview...

910
00:55:15.847 --> 00:55:17.258
if that helps Seo Ki Tae.

911
00:55:17.258 --> 00:55:18.488
That's what you said.

912
00:55:18.488 --> 00:55:20.387
Why are you doing this to me out of the blue?

913
00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:21.827
I can't understand it at all.

914
00:55:25.028 --> 00:55:26.697
Why are you doing this to me?

915
00:55:26.697 --> 00:55:28.028
What do you think?

916
00:55:28.028 --> 00:55:30.028
I've been telling you why until now.

917
00:55:30.028 --> 00:55:31.798
I want to interview you. Ms. Seo Jung In.

918
00:55:31.798 --> 00:55:33.197
You said you'll do it.

919
00:55:33.197 --> 00:55:34.708
I'm the one that should ask you why!

920
00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:36.068
Where are you?

921
00:55:36.068 --> 00:55:37.878
Why? You want to do it now?

922
00:55:37.878 --> 00:55:40.208
- Come to the War Memorial of Korea. - The War Memorial of Korea?

923
00:55:40.378 --> 00:55:41.478
You're really there?

924
00:55:41.677 --> 00:55:43.108
Wait for me right there.

925
00:55:44.978 --> 00:55:47.688
She's a lunatic.

926
00:55:48.017 --> 00:55:50.048
He's crazy.

927
00:55:52.488 --> 00:55:53.688
Taxi.

928
00:55:59.157 --> 00:56:00.197
Hi.

929
00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:08.307
You're dead.

930
00:56:27.858 --> 00:56:29.827
- Where are you? - You're already here?

931
00:56:30.298 --> 00:56:31.798
I guess you were near here.

932
00:56:33.697 --> 00:56:35.097
Just tell me where you are.

933
00:56:39.238 --> 00:56:41.637
So short. so efficient.

934
00:56:41.867 --> 00:56:42.967
Excuse me.

935
00:56:43.938 --> 00:56:46.508
What do you mean where I am? I'm at the campaign rally.

936
00:56:46.978 --> 00:56:48.907
- Excuse me. - At the campaign rally?

937
00:56:48.907 --> 00:56:50.418
Are you at the War Memorial of Korea?

938
00:56:50.418 --> 00:56:53.077
Do you think I'm at the Independence Hall Of Korea then?

939
00:56:54.117 --> 00:56:55.387
It's so loud.

940
00:56:55.947 --> 00:56:57.017
Listen.

941
00:56:58.088 --> 00:57:00.458
You can heart the sound. right? Come to find me.

942
00:57:00.927 --> 00:57:02.128
What are you talking about?

943
00:57:02.128 --> 00:57:04.298
There's no one around here.

944
00:57:05.898 --> 00:57:08.898
- Seo Ki Tae! Seo Ki Tae! - Seo Ki Tae! Seo Ki Tae!

945
00:57:08.898 --> 00:57:10.738
It's your father's campaign rally today.

946
00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:12.338
Are you not with him here?

947
00:57:12.997 --> 00:57:16.108

00:57:52.077 --> 00:57:53.338
You still can't find it?

958
00:57:53.338 --> 00:57:54.878
Let's do an interview quickly.

959
00:57:55.307 --> 00:57:57.247
Why is it so hard to see your face?

960
00:57:58.717 --> 00:58:00.077

(Times)

966
00:58:51.097 --> 00:58:53.238
The voice I'm hearing now... Whose is it?

967
00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:54.967
That's right. He died five years ago.

968
00:58:54.967 --> 00:58:57.608
She said she isn't stupid to be fooled by a guy like me.

969
00:58:57.608 --> 00:58:59.238
It's 2020 here.

970
00:58:59.238 --> 00:59:01.648
Are you trying to say this is connected with the future?

971
00:59:01.648 --> 00:59:05.117
If you promised not to be obsessed with the past. keep your word!

972
00:59:05.117 --> 00:59:06.447
What on earth are you doing?

973
00:59:06.447 --> 00:59:08.648
My father will die tomorrow.

974
00:59:08.717 --> 00:59:10.387
Mr. Seo will die?

975
00:59:10.458 --> 00:59:12.117
Please save my father. Jin Woo.

976
00:59:12.117 --> 00:59:13.458
What should I do?

977
00:59:13.458 --> 00:59:14.728
To save Mr. Seo.

978
00:59:14.858 --> 00:59:17.298
If you do this right. both can live.

979
00:59:17.298 --> 00:59:19.157
My father and you.

980
00:59:23.867 --> 00:59:27.068
It's 2020 here. You're in 2015.

981
00:59:27.168 --> 00:59:28.907
My father will die tomorrow.

982
00:59:28.938 --> 00:59:30.708
Mr. Seo will die?

The daughter of the president prying into the former president.

984
00:59:35.148 --> 00:59:37.177
Someone tried to kill my father.

985
00:59:37.478 --> 00:59:39.347
There are people who fabricated the incident.

986
00:59:40.217 --> 00:59:42.287
If we can't find the truth about it.

987
00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:44.318
- the same thing will happen again. - You punk!

988
00:59:44.318 --> 00:59:45.787
It was you.

989
00:59:45.787 --> 00:59:46.918
We should ask them first.

990
00:59:46.918 --> 00:59:48.387
That's the only way we can save Korea.

991
00:59:48.628 --> 00:59:51.028
Let's do it. Let's save Mr. Seo.
