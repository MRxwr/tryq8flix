THE OUTSIDER

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.846
DRUGS: PARIS SENDS
COMMISSIONER JORDAN TO MARSEILLE

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:05.434
If they put that kind of cop on our trail.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:12.233
it's pretty clear that we can kiss
our peace and quiet good-bye.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:16.779
I'd like to hear what my lawyer thinks.

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:22.243
If Paris has sent this kind
of commissioner to Marseille.

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:24.787
it's a game-changer.

00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:29.208
We'll have to adapt. like it or not.

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:32.586
And if we don't like it?
We can also stand in his way.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.798
It's easy to stand in his way.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:45.141
We imagine that the world is filled
with things we consider easy.

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:50.271
and then this...

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.653
I'd like to have this commissioner
on my payroll.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.572
For a while. anyway.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:04.285
<i>Dominique. I want you and Cappa
to head to Marseille.</i>

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:07.997
Once there. you'll keep an eye
on the commissioner.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.415
day and night.

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:13.085
- After that. we'll see.
- Very well. sir.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.100
Police! Hands on your head!

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.520
I said. "Hands on your head!"

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:43.657
<i>Didn't I say. "Hands on your head?"</i>

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:46.577
You're the new cop on the block.
Mr. Gung-ho?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.078
Just passing through.

00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:51.791
Empty your pockets.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.459
The pig's an ace cop.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.420
Wasn't he in that crime show on TV?

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:06.055
<i>I said. "Hands on your head."
Face the wall.</i>

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.145
Search all you want.
I'm clean as a virgin.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.649
Keep going like that
and you'll die a virgin.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:23.113
Hey. big guy. shying away from us?

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:24.865
Empty your pockets.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:27.493
Hurry up.

00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:17.561
So. Tonio.
why do you make me run like this?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.271
You want to hurt my heart?

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:22.483
<i>I been looking for you for days.</i>

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:24.068
- Aren't we friends anymore?
- Of course.

00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:25.986
Good. you had me worried.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.283
When is it for?

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.660
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.120
I'm asking you. "When is it for?"

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:38.499
Three. four days. at the most.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:41.835
Three or four?

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:44.046
Three.

00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:48.342
What boat is carrying the drugs?

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:50.928
Tell me the name of the boat.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.768
Mister Nicolas.

00:07:58.435 --> 00:07:59.937
Now we're sailing.

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:22.751
They can't catch up with us.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.972
Calling control.
This is Delta Fox Thirty.

00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:36.515
Dumas. here. I'm listening.

00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:40.060
The Mister Nicolas is about
to leave French territorial waters.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.563
- What do we do?
- Catch up with it. damn it!

00:08:42.646 --> 00:08:44.982
- At full throttle!
- We are at full throttle!

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.152
Doesn't look too good. does it?

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:54.241
The Mister Nicolas is heading
at 200 degrees. Abandoning pursuit.

00:08:54.324 --> 00:08:55.826
Shit!

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.161
<i>What can I do?</i>

00:08:58.078 --> 00:08:59.955
Their boat is 15 knots faster than ours.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:04.126
Besides. we only located Mister Nicolas
three miles within territorial waters.

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.336
Much too late.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:26.982
Hello. Marignane?
Get me Louis.

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:32.321
Hey. Jordan here.
We're going on a little sea excursion.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.157
What's going on?

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:19.076
Drugs being smuggled out.

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:21.495
They're heading out at 200 degrees.

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.432
They're gone.

00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:54.254
Stop the engine!

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.258
Act smart and you're in luck.

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:01.428
Act stupid and you're in for it.
The merchandise.

00:12:12.439 --> 00:12:14.316
You. step inside.

00:13:38.108 --> 00:13:41.445
I'm baffled!
200 kilos of drugs!

00:13:41.528 --> 00:13:43.405
And you're being casual about it.

00:13:44.072 --> 00:13:46.366
You're breaking all the rules. Jordan.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:49.786
You're acting like an outsider.

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:52.706
not like a cop.

00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:55.208
And that look of yours...

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:59.755
Honestly. think you look
like a commissioner?

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:01.631
What's gotten into you!

00:14:02.382 --> 00:14:05.302
<i>I wanted those drugs seized!</i>

00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:06.928
We had everyone on our side.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.847
The press. the authorities.
public opinion.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:09.973
And Meccacci's?

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.602
The opinion I'm interested in
is Meccacci's.

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:16.688
DRUG LAB UNCOVERED
IN QUIET VILLA NEAR SAINT-MAXIMIN

00:14:42.589 --> 00:14:44.466
<i>Where should I start?</i>

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:45.759
From the end.

00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:49.471
Mr. Meccacci is upset with me. right?

00:14:49.554 --> 00:14:51.473
You're wrong. Commissioner.

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:54.476
French police. the Americans are wrong.

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:56.478
Everybody's wrong about him.

00:14:56.561 --> 00:14:59.689
Admittedly.
Mr. Meccacci had a stormy youth.

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:03.276
Cigarette smuggling in Tangier.
gambling wars in Paris and Nice...

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.363
<i>- He took a hit. believe me.
- I believe you.</i>

00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:08.615
and of course. he never dealt any drugs.

00:15:08.698 --> 00:15:10.867
Check his record.

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:14.663
So it'd be wise to ensure that errors.
such as the one that occurred lately.

00:15:14.746 --> 00:15:16.748
don't happen again.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.626
Otherwise. a certain commissioner

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.379
could become just another beat cop

00:15:22.462 --> 00:15:24.673
arresting petty thieves and prostitutes.

00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:27.968
- Or not even a cop at all.
- Or not even a cop at all.

00:15:28.051 --> 00:15:31.304
Dear Counselor. I'm not wrong.

00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:34.474
The French police are not wrong.
and neither are the Americans.

00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:37.936
Your client's a bastard.
It's on the record!

00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:41.731
Since he had such a stormy youth.

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:45.986
<i>I promise him a peaceful retirement.
twenty years behind bars.</i>

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:49.489
I'll pass along your warm regards.

00:15:49.573 --> 00:15:50.866
Please do.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.552
Hi.

00:16:11.094 --> 00:16:12.888
How's everything?

00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:14.598
Hi.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.439
Yes?

00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:08.109
Okay. we're on our way.

00:17:12.113 --> 00:17:13.615
Good evening.

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:19.204
- Gentlemen.
- Commissioner Jordan. What brings you?

00:17:19.287 --> 00:17:21.790
<i>I heard you were holding a seminar.</i>

00:17:21.873 --> 00:17:25.126
<i>I thought I might run into
Alfred the Chemist.</i>

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.378
I'm still looking for him.

00:17:26.461 --> 00:17:29.548
He's in Paris. but we don't know where.

00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:32.217
You're getting on my nerves
with Alfred. Commissioner.

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.804
Stop nosing around.
or you'll end up in Châteauroux.

00:17:35.887 --> 00:17:37.806
arresting petty thieves and prostitutes.

00:17:37.889 --> 00:17:40.141
<i>Funny. I heard that line before.</i>

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.935
Mr. Meccacci's. maybe?

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:43.353
Precisely.

00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:50.902
<i>Every time I hear Meccacci's name.
1 get edagy.</i>

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:54.406
Take the edge off. Commissioner.
and join us for a glass of champagne.

00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:56.074
You. and your colleague of course.

00:17:56.157 --> 00:18:00.495
Claude. two glasses please.
for the Commissioner and his colleague.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.920
Here we are.

00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:11.923
Make yourself at home.

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.681
What are you drinking?
I've got cognac. scotch...

00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:21.766
even orange juice.

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:37.157
Party's over.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.075
It was nice meeting you.

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.966
Wait for me outside.

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:58.178
Where is he?

00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:02.390
We were tipped off by a phone call.

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:04.476
Anonymous. of course.

00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:18.365
So. who did it? You. her?

00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:22.535
What do we say?
we'll have to come up with something.

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:25.497
- What about telling the truth?
- Please. spare me.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.624
Just kidding.

00:19:28.249 --> 00:19:30.835
We could just say nothing.
and throw him in the dumpster.

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:35.674
Go take a walk. have some fresh air.

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:43.598
What do you think will happen?

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.225
Nothing.

00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:46.935
Nothing will happen.

00:19:47.018 --> 00:19:49.437
Not even an official reprimand.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:52.023
I'll be transferred. that's all.

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.317
It's called being sidelined.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.779
or being put in a locker.

00:19:57.862 --> 00:20:00.532
And what will the Minister do?

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.575
<i>I thought he was your friend.</i>

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:04.786
I've known him for 20 years.

00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:07.205
but five minutes ago.

00:20:07.288 --> 00:20:09.916
<i>I became a total stranger to him.
That. I guarantee.</i>

00:20:27.183 --> 00:20:29.102
<i>I certainly hope so.</i>

00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:33.606
Guy. please.
Take care of Mr. Meccacci.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.943
Thank you very much.

00:20:37.026 --> 00:20:39.404
It's a great day.

00:20:39.487 --> 00:20:41.656
We're celebrating a retirement.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.908
The city of Marseille lost someone.

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:46.536
Let's call him a schmuck!

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:48.955
A police officer. friend of Mr. Meccacci.

00:20:49.038 --> 00:20:50.749
Champagne!

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.554
Big fish. that Meccacci.

00:21:04.637 --> 00:21:07.766
<i>Two years ago. I almost nailed him.
Not even on drug charges.</i>

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:09.434
<i>I had him by the balls.</i>

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.104
<i>Then. I got screwed like a layman.</i>

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.232
<i>They even said I took bribes.</i>

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:20.153
An envelope in your drawer.
or a corpse in your living room...

00:21:20.236 --> 00:21:21.571
Same difference.

00:21:21.654 --> 00:21:23.740
As long as virtue triumphs.

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.758
I hear you like doing things
cowboy style.

00:21:41.841 --> 00:21:44.385
Here. our methods are more subdued.

00:21:45.386 --> 00:21:48.932
Helicopter chases are less frequent.

00:21:49.015 --> 00:21:51.643
between Faubourg Montmartre.
and rue des Martyrs.

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:55.146
POLICE PRECINCT

00:22:06.699 --> 00:22:10.453
It's only petty crime.
but someone's gotta do it.

00:22:10.537 --> 00:22:12.622
Three thousand cases a month.

00:22:12.705 --> 00:22:15.667
This isn't a police precinct.
it's a factory.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.294
Maybe so. but you'll see...

00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:21.130
We do good police work.

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:23.049
and we do it as a team.

00:22:23.132 --> 00:22:25.718
<i>Teamwork is important. I insist on that.</i>

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.303
Good men working as a team.

00:22:27.387 --> 00:22:28.805
Simon.

00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:30.765
Cablier.

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:34.018
Rosberg.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.729
and Rojinski. whom you've already met.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.398
and you.

00:22:38.481 --> 00:22:41.609
Not marshals working for a sheriff.
but men united around a boss.

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.236
- You.
- Me.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:46.072
Hello. Pat. How are you?

00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:58.751
Here's your desk.

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.175
And my locker.

00:23:10.471 --> 00:23:13.057
Count your blessings. Commissioner.

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.726
You're lucky to be alive.

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:17.186
Especially after that helicopter stunt
in Marseille.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.731
Meccacci could've had you killed.

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:23.902
Why pull a trigger.
when you can just dial a number.

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:26.362
<i>I don't get calls like that. Commissioner.</i>

00:23:26.446 --> 00:23:28.281
<i>I didn't say it was you.</i>

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.091
<i>I don't like to be taken for an idiot!</i>

00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:50.386
Then. you chose the wrong job. sweetie.

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:55.058
Christian Rigaux.

00:23:55.141 --> 00:23:57.810
born April 4. 1955.

00:23:57.894 --> 00:24:00.355
Entered French territory in 1981.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.400
You ID card's no longer valid.

00:24:04.484 --> 00:24:05.526
That's bad news.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.987
It's only been three days.
You can't lock me up for that!

00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:09.906
<i>I don't give a damn!</i>

00:24:09.989 --> 00:24:12.367
Twenty-four hours in custody.
That'll teach you!

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:14.953
Moron. Jerk off!

00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.455
I'll have you locked up
for public indecency!

00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:23.127
Forged ID. and we'll sprinkle in
solicitation in a public place.

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:32.345
You heard about the mules from Istanbul?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.556
And Madame Kemal. you know about her?

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:38.768
I'm no longer a narcotics agent.
I don't give a damn.

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:42.730
Too bad. because three Turks
showed up this morning from Istanbul.

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:46.192
As we speak. they're taking a shit
at Madame Kemal's. in Cité Bergére.

00:24:46.275 --> 00:24:48.194
<i>I told you. I don't give a damn.</i>

00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:52.949
The Turks work for Selim Bey.
Madame Kemal works for Meccacci.

00:24:57.578 --> 00:24:59.414
Our dear friend. Savior Meccacci?

00:25:00.164 --> 00:25:03.418
Yes. the very same
piece of trash scumbag.

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:06.462
Just making sure we're talking
about the same guy.

00:25:32.321 --> 00:25:33.531
Police!

00:25:39.662 --> 00:25:40.872
Get up!

00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:43.958
Felling a little jet-lagged?

00:25:45.251 --> 00:25:47.754
<i>- Where's the dope?
- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:58.806
Paris calling!
Come over here.

00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.352
<i>- Where's the dope?
- I don't know.</i>

00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:05.855
I'll tell you where it is.
It's in there!

00:26:05.938 --> 00:26:10.193
Before boarding.
you swallowed plastic bags. you mule!

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:14.030
You're filled with dope!

00:26:14.113 --> 00:26:17.658
For the past three days.
you've been dumping your load!

00:26:29.003 --> 00:26:32.256
And what do you guys have to say?
Shitting in your pants?

00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:36.761
If I punch you.
a small bag could burst in your belly.

00:26:36.844 --> 00:26:40.139
Hold it. Jordan.
If you hit him. he bursts.

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:44.811
What about "syringe lady". here?

00:26:44.894 --> 00:26:48.272
<i>If I hit her. will she tell me
where the dope is?</i>

00:26:49.315 --> 00:26:51.067
Not much of a blabbermouth. uh?

00:26:56.322 --> 00:26:58.407
It's your report on Madame Kemal's?

00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:00.451
Don't bother to type it up.

00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:03.329
The case opened and shut at Cité Bergère.

00:27:04.664 --> 00:27:06.749
You mean.
you're letting off these three...

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.000
Diplomats. that's right.

00:27:08.084 --> 00:27:09.585
They'll be back in Istanbul by tonight.

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:11.712
- But...
- No buts. Rojinski!

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:14.340
We have no evidence against them.

00:27:14.423 --> 00:27:16.425
It's in the diplomats' stomachs.

00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:20.471
You want to cut them up
to see what's inside?

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:21.931
Who's that clown?

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:28.146
That "clown" is Mr. Mensour.
cultural attaché at the Turkish embassy.

00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:33.025
What's the purpose of your visit?

00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:37.488
I'm here to garner your apologies.
and pass them along to the ambassador.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.325
or at least your sincere regrets.

00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:43.202
Well. that's the general idea.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.337
What do you think?

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:54.422
You agree?

00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:00.928
Then pass them along.

00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:04.098
It's an old Foreign Service tradition
to drop your drawers.

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.184
so pass that along.

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:39.091
You've had me here two hours already.
I'm out of here! Enough of your questions!

00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:42.511
Let go of me!

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:43.596
THE BIG HUBBUB

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.681
Name. address and profession!

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:48.517
I'm talking to you. bitch!

00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.811
Name. address and profession.

00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:54.523
Answer me.
or I'll lock you up for 48 hours.

00:28:57.443 --> 00:28:59.403
One last time.
Name. address. profession?

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.786
These methods will get you nowhere.

00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:08.037
It's the wrong approach.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.665
With a dumb broad like her.
there's no other approach.

00:29:10.748 --> 00:29:11.916
Of course. there is.

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:13.751
Let me explain.

00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:16.128
Sit down. my friend.

00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:22.176
Where were you last night?

00:29:23.052 --> 00:29:24.595
Are you crazy or what!

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:27.306
See? You forgot.

00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:29.350
You're all knotted up.

00:29:29.433 --> 00:29:32.186
Let's do this again. calmly.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.231
Simon. where were you last night?

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.483
This guy's crazy!

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.779
Sit down. we're just talking.

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.448
<i>Like I told you.</i>

00:29:44.865 --> 00:29:48.202
You hit the guy. he's not happy.

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.704
He can't talk.

00:29:50.454 --> 00:29:52.123
You hit him again...

00:29:52.206 --> 00:29:53.624
He knots up again.

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:55.543
Leave me the fuck alone!

00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:57.628
You'll get anything you want.
with the right method.

00:29:58.629 --> 00:30:00.089
It's all about method.

00:30:00.172 --> 00:30:03.050
Livia Dolores. Maria Monteblanco.

00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:05.136
10. rue Saint-Jacques.

00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:06.345
Hooker.

00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:08.306
See?

00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.877
Look who's here.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.128
Hop in.

00:30:39.712 --> 00:30:42.631
- It's been a while.
- I had pressing affairs.

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.451
SAINT-MARTIN BOXING CLUB
TRAINERS

00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:19.919
How's Janine doing?

00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:22.546
She's doing okay.

00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:24.507
She split.

00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:26.884
Is that so?

00:31:28.427 --> 00:31:30.054
<i>I thought you were treating her well.</i>

00:31:30.137 --> 00:31:34.016
You bet. an apartment in the 20th.
sports car. fancy shoes and all.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.477
What got into her head?

00:31:37.561 --> 00:31:38.562
Maybe she just got tired.

00:31:40.272 --> 00:31:43.442
Jogging in the morning.
cycling in the afternoon. boxing at night.

00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:44.735
Gets tiring after a while.

00:31:48.531 --> 00:31:52.993
- You talking about me or yourself?
- Go figure. Maybe both.

00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:56.288
Too bad about Janine.
She had a nice ass.

00:32:02.878 --> 00:32:04.171
Your gym is pretty quiet.

00:32:05.589 --> 00:32:08.008
<i>I know. I should get more involved.</i>

00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:12.596
<i>I think you should.
because your apartment in the 20th.</i>

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.433
the sports car. fancy shoes and all...

00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:17.393
This place can't bring in
enough to cover that.

00:32:19.061 --> 00:32:20.646
Maybe it's just a front.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.154
Fifty machines in Barbès. fifty in Clichy.

00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:30.072
The whole northern district.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.536
- Just stay on your turf and it's fine.
- Until the day it isn't.

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:38.164
It's legal.
Even. the state takes its share.

00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:40.624
The state also took its share
in whorehouses.

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:42.751
Until one fine day...

00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:48.674
Payoff is better with machines
than with hookers.

00:32:48.757 --> 00:32:51.093
Your hookers are great.

00:32:51.177 --> 00:32:52.678
They don't talk much.

00:32:53.345 --> 00:32:55.848
They never call in sick.

00:32:55.931 --> 00:32:57.224
Never get jealous.

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:07.776
Most important. they don't talk to cops.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.279
What if they could?

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:16.243
Maybe they'd drop the name
of the guy who financed all this.

00:33:17.578 --> 00:33:20.122
<i>Get off my back.
Do I bring up your blunder in Marseille.</i>

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.832
or the corpse in your living room?

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.044
That's enough. kiddo.
You'll dig yourself into a hole.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.797
Two years ago. when I left the force.
you had shady deals going on.

00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:31.258
Stolen auto parts. petty stuff...

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.551
No problem.

00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:35.179
<i>I come back. and here's what I find.</i>

00:33:36.263 --> 00:33:40.809
And that. I know who benefits from it.
and who finances it.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.895
Your slot machines reek of heroin!

00:33:42.978 --> 00:33:45.231
- First of all...
- Nobody's on first.

00:33:45.314 --> 00:33:46.899
Nobody's on second.

00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:49.318
Wake up. Francis.

00:33:50.277 --> 00:33:52.404
<i>For all your petty crap.
1 looked the other way.</i>

00:33:52.488 --> 00:33:55.616
<i>but soon I won't be able to.</i>

00:33:56.283 --> 00:33:57.952
<i>I won't even want to.</i>

00:34:03.415 --> 00:34:05.751
Don't go down that road.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.964
It's well traveled by the ill-advised.

00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.676
and you get an even chance of dying.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.847
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah. got it.

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:23.394
- Let's talk about something else.
- Like what?

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.729
We covered sex. boxing...

00:34:26.272 --> 00:34:30.276
Work-related issues are making us edgy.

00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:33.612
- What's left?
- Not much. you're right.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.286
There might be something...

00:34:58.637 --> 00:35:02.641
<i>I had three-of-a-kind. he had two sevens.
Left this as collateral. A real wacko.</i>

00:35:03.142 --> 00:35:05.436
- It's totally bulletproof.
- Really?

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:14.236
Damn. you're right!

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.905
Is it fast?

00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:19.325
250 horsepower under the hood.

00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:22.286
I'm thinking of letting it go.

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:25.122
so if you know anybody anxious.
in need of protection...

00:35:25.205 --> 00:35:26.206
<i>I just might.</i>

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.541
The Pope.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.815
Looking for a good time. hon'?

00:35:55.027 --> 00:35:56.528
Want a ride?

00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:02.326
- Hi there.
- Hello.

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:04.036
Interested?

00:36:08.582 --> 00:36:10.084
See him?

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:12.044
<i>I would've given him a free one.</i>

00:36:19.718 --> 00:36:21.220
FOUR ACES

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:12.271
Something to drink
or waiting for someone?

00:37:12.354 --> 00:37:13.355
Orange juice.

00:37:14.356 --> 00:37:17.234
Then again. I'm in a gay mood.
Make that a strawberry soda.

00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.616
I'm looking for a friend.

00:37:25.117 --> 00:37:28.328
In fact. it's his brother from Marseille
who'd like to see him.

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:29.997
Alfred.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.165
Alfred...

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:33.500
First or last name?

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:37.755
He's got a nickname: the Chemist.
Freddy the Chemist.

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:42.634
The guy you're looking for
no longer comes here.

00:37:42.718 --> 00:37:44.928
Otherwise. you would've seen him.

00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:46.930
He's always lying by the front door.

00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.640
Customers wipe their feet on him.

00:37:49.391 --> 00:37:51.268
Want to replace him?

00:37:51.351 --> 00:37:54.104
I'd love to wipe my feet on your face.

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.857
That's amusing.

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:02.029
If you guys want to brawl. go outside.

00:38:03.947 --> 00:38:07.993
Say. it's not Mardi Gras.
You should put on a shawl or a cape.

00:38:08.076 --> 00:38:09.578
I'd prefer that.

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:13.832
- I'm behind you.
- Okay. but not too close.

00:38:33.852 --> 00:38:35.938
- Ladies first.
- You fucking with me?

00:38:36.021 --> 00:38:38.148
Just kidding. big guy.

00:38:38.232 --> 00:38:39.399
Let's go!

00:38:49.368 --> 00:38:50.869
Have a nice one.

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.038
Fucking shit!

00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:12.224
Hey. handsome!

00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:16.854
Recognize me?

00:39:18.146 --> 00:39:20.148
Livia Maria Dolores.

00:39:34.496 --> 00:39:36.582
- Where are you going?
- Who knows.

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.895
This way.

00:40:07.654 --> 00:40:10.490
Scotch. scotch. or scotch?

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.457
- Isn't it a bit cramped in here?
- Indeed. it is.

00:40:27.799 --> 00:40:29.426
Who's this?

00:40:29.509 --> 00:40:31.345
My grandma. on my mother's side.

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.679
A remarkable woman.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.264
There you go.

00:40:41.063 --> 00:40:46.068
Funny. I didn't imagine you
living in a place like this.

00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:47.402
What did you imagine?

00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:50.822
Something more contemporary.

00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:53.408
- You mean. plastic and neon?
- Why not?

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:04.336
It's funny.
It's like living with your parents.

00:41:04.419 --> 00:41:06.546
Pretty good assumption.

00:41:07.673 --> 00:41:10.217
<i>I used to live in an apartment. nearby.</i>

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.678
but when my parents died.

00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:17.265
<i>I didn't want to part with the furniture.</i>

00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:20.477
<i>So. I left everything as it was.</i>

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.231
like I knew it as a kid.
and kept the apartment.

00:41:24.314 --> 00:41:25.148
Simple as that.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.652
You enjoy it here?

00:41:29.152 --> 00:41:31.613
Did Louis XVI enjoy Versailles?

00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:33.490
Not sure.

00:41:33.573 --> 00:41:35.409
but he lived in his father's house.

00:41:36.034 --> 00:41:38.495
I'm a man of tradition.

00:41:40.163 --> 00:41:41.164
Why are you smiling?

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:45.502
You really don't talk like a cop.
not at all.

00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:50.090
<i>You don't ask the usual questions.
Where am I from? Why do I do this job?</i>

00:41:50.173 --> 00:41:53.176
Because you're going to tell me
that you were born in a favela.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.137
you have loads of brothers and sisters.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.597
your father molested your mom
and drank like a hole.

00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:01.101
Then. at age twelve. you started wondering
what men thought when staring at your ass.

00:42:05.272 --> 00:42:06.982
Certainly not about Louis XVI.

00:42:29.629 --> 00:42:32.007
Fifty-fifty.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.134
Whenever is suitable to you. my friend.

00:42:38.096 --> 00:42:41.641
Of course. the slot machines are yours.

00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:45.896
But aren't you afraid
you'll make people jealous?

00:42:45.979 --> 00:42:49.399
That someone malevolent
might trash your brand-new machines?

00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:52.652
Or even trash you?

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.407
So far. nobody dared. because they knew
Mr. Meccacci was covering you.

00:42:58.992 --> 00:43:00.577
but when you're on your own...

00:43:04.372 --> 00:43:06.416
I'll make a deal with you.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.502
A decent. friendly proposition.

00:43:09.294 --> 00:43:11.088
Three grand a month.

00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:13.298
and you stay at the helm.

00:43:13.381 --> 00:43:16.885
In the eyes of everyone. you're the boss.

00:43:17.719 --> 00:43:19.054
To everyone's eyes. except mine.

00:43:20.263 --> 00:43:22.724
No offense. Francis.

00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:25.018
but who gives a damn about your views?

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:12.399
What's wrong. Tonton?

00:44:13.692 --> 00:44:16.278
You ask me to come visit.
and you greet me with a sour face.

00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:20.115
<i>Last time we met.
1 ended up in prison.</i>

00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:22.701
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:25.036
For me. nothing.

00:44:25.787 --> 00:44:27.622
<i>I expect nothing from no one.</i>

00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.793
I'll serve my 20 years to the end.

00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:39.176
You cops have no idea.

00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:43.722
One hundred and fifty square feet.
for 20 years.

00:44:43.805 --> 00:44:45.432
Do the math!

00:44:47.642 --> 00:44:50.270
<i>I wouldn't give a damn either.
if I had no one else.</i>

00:44:51.521 --> 00:44:55.609
Except when you nailed me.
I left a twelve-year old daughter behind.

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:57.569
Should've thought of that before.

00:45:04.701 --> 00:45:07.037
Catherine's 16 now.

00:45:09.122 --> 00:45:12.125
If you don't get her out
of the hell she's in. she's doomed.

00:45:13.376 --> 00:45:16.129
You hear me. Commissioner?
She's doomed.

00:45:17.088 --> 00:45:18.465
Doomed at 16.

00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:22.219
Some real wack-jobs have abducted her.

00:45:22.302 --> 00:45:24.930
She's held prisoner in a squat.
on rue de Lyon.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.641
<i>"The Hard Drugs Cafe"...</i>

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:32.229
The assholes shoot her up
with junk and fuck her!

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.525
One day. they'll just kill her.

00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:41.112
Say. drugs have become
a real issue to you.

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:47.160
Back then. when sixth graders took drugs.
you had no qualms about it.

00:45:47.577 --> 00:45:49.371
You were cool with it.

00:45:49.996 --> 00:45:52.165
Now. you're asking me
to go see those wackos

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:56.419
and get my throat slit with a razor blade.
so your kid can breathe some fresh air?

00:45:56.503 --> 00:45:58.838
Are you being serious. Tonton?

00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:03.009
Why are you asking a cop
to confront these bastards?

00:46:05.053 --> 00:46:06.763
<i>I didn't ask a cop.</i>

00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:09.849
<i>I asked a bastard.</i>

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:12.560
How appropriate.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.315
<i>I happen 10 have a bastard deal.
tailor-made for you.</i>

00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:22.946
Alfred. Does the name ring an old bell?

00:46:23.738 --> 00:46:24.739
Freddy the Chemist.

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.994
Go fuck yourself!

00:46:29.494 --> 00:46:30.996
There you go again.

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:33.790
You'll never be a good father.
nor a good friend.

00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:38.378
<i>Because if I don't find Alfred.
before Meccacci does.</i>

00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:41.756
French chemistry itself will be
in mourning. as it was for Pasteur.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.010
except there won't be
a boulevard named after Alfred.

00:46:48.346 --> 00:46:49.347
Commissioner...

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.650
Simon.

00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:03.486
my all-knowing friend.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.073
Got any tips about the squat.
on rue de Lyon?

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:08.992
<i>None. and I don't want any.</i>

00:47:09.075 --> 00:47:11.661
The Caribbean squat's not our business.
It's a political hot potato.

00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:14.080
The upper office told us not to get near.

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.457
<i>I see.</i>

00:47:16.082 --> 00:47:17.542
Don't touch Turkish diplomats.

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:20.086
Chinese restaurant owners.
or Caribbean musicians.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.006
Thank you. Inspector.

00:47:30.972 --> 00:47:33.183
What do you make of Simon?

00:47:33.266 --> 00:47:37.312
Schmuck. corrupt. or puppet?

00:47:37.395 --> 00:47:40.106
He's in cahoots with Garnier.
the new chief.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.067
And Garnier is in cahoots with whom?

00:47:42.817 --> 00:47:44.778
Maybe with Garnier. after all.

00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:48.823
Say. golden boy. why'd you bring up
the squat on rue de Lyon?

00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:52.285
Getting in there is easy enough.
but getting out...

00:47:52.827 --> 00:47:55.246
I'm just warning you.
in case you had any plans to visit.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.373
Me?

00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:59.459
<i>Why would I visit such a pigsty?</i>

00:48:24.317 --> 00:48:27.737
Catherine Serutti. age 16. blonde.
Her daddy misses her very much.

00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:29.489
<i>Why should I care?</i>

00:48:29.572 --> 00:48:31.866
<i>She's in there. I want to know where.</i>

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.160
What floor... Some details.

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:47.465
What do you want?

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:12.842
Her name's Yasmina.
and my rate is one hundred francs.

00:50:13.426 --> 00:50:14.469
I'm looking for Catherine.

00:50:14.552 --> 00:50:17.180
Catherine won't cost you a penny.
She's everyone's free ride.

00:50:17.263 --> 00:50:19.307
She's the doormat. in the backroom.

00:50:47.168 --> 00:50:48.962
Is that Catherine?

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.255
Yes.

00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:53.800
My name's Speed.
She's been like this for two days.

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.684
Your father sent me.

00:51:02.767 --> 00:51:04.727
I'm taking you with me.
You give me a hand.

00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:56.821
Where you going?
Leaving just like that?

00:51:57.363 --> 00:51:59.407
Looks like you're in a hurry.
Let's have a talk.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.826
I'm taking the girl
and leaving just like that.

00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:06.039
Speed. my car's a Renault station wagon.
parked 50 meters away.

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.624
Take her to the car.

00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:13.338
Speed! Don't move!

00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:17.300
<i>Speed. I said a Renault station wagon.</i>

00:52:17.383 --> 00:52:20.178
<i>I can't believe it
The guy's giving orders!</i>

00:52:21.429 --> 00:52:23.306
Hitting me was a bad idea.

00:52:23.389 --> 00:52:25.308
I might've let you go. who knows...

00:52:25.391 --> 00:52:28.436
Whether the girl croaks
here or elsewhere. I don't care!

00:52:28.519 --> 00:52:30.313
You fucked with me.

00:52:30.396 --> 00:52:31.898
and now you're going to die.

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:49.874
Renault station wagon.
50 meters away.

00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:54.379
See.

00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:55.922
There was no need to argue.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.535
Keep on sewing!

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:37.880
What are you doing here?

00:53:37.964 --> 00:53:40.341
- I'm looking for Alfred. "Freddy".
- He's upstairs.

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.231
Looks yummy!

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:08.870
- Who is it?
- Commissioner Jordan.

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:18.838
Commissioner Jordan.

00:54:29.891 --> 00:54:32.143
Not in Marseille anymore?

00:54:32.226 --> 00:54:33.853
Not in Marseille anymore.

00:54:33.936 --> 00:54:36.355
You're not in Marseille.
Tonton's not in Marseille.

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:38.733
Pretty soon. there'll be
no one left in Marseille.

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:41.110
Tonton...

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.202
Why bring him up?

00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:52.079
He the one who ratted on me?

00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:55.750
It's not ratting. it's informing.

00:54:55.833 --> 00:54:58.211
Ever hear of that. Alfred?

00:55:00.129 --> 00:55:02.173
You were right to bring up Marseille.

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:04.842
The good old days.

00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:08.596
Pinstripe suits. two-tone shoes.

00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:11.140
fancy cars.

00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:13.142
hotels overlooking the old port.

00:55:13.935 --> 00:55:17.188
The stuff you produced
was 90 percent pure.

00:55:17.271 --> 00:55:19.482
You were the best in your craft.

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:22.944
Now. you're hiding in this slum.

00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:26.113
You came looking for me
to give me that rant?

00:55:26.864 --> 00:55:29.200
You've been looking
for quite a while. right?

00:55:29.283 --> 00:55:31.118
I'm not the only one looking.

00:55:32.161 --> 00:55:34.038
Meccacci's looking for you. too.

00:55:34.121 --> 00:55:35.122
Why?

00:55:36.123 --> 00:55:37.542
Any idea?

00:55:38.209 --> 00:55:42.004
Meccacci hates addicts and queers.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.007
Two reasons to go after me.

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:56.644
Gabriel. sweetie.

00:55:56.727 --> 00:55:58.729
go wait outside.

00:56:11.158 --> 00:56:14.203
Don't waste your time
telling me about Meccacci.

00:56:14.287 --> 00:56:15.746
I'm ready to rat on him.

00:56:16.998 --> 00:56:19.083
- For cash.
- A lot?

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.420
<i>With the face I have.
the condition I'm in.</i>

00:56:23.838 --> 00:56:26.966
and the honeymoon I'm planning.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:30.469
<i>I need a ton of cash. believe me.</i>

00:56:31.178 --> 00:56:32.805
A ton is not an amount.

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:33.890
How much?

00:56:34.932 --> 00:56:35.933
A hundred grand.

00:56:40.771 --> 00:56:43.107
Third race. official results.
The winner: number nine.

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:47.069
Place: number eleven. Show: number three.

00:57:12.345 --> 00:57:14.388
Where do you expect me
to find that kind of money?

00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:17.642
A hundred grand...

00:57:18.517 --> 00:57:20.728
Fuck it!
I don't have to lend you that money.

00:57:21.145 --> 00:57:23.272
Of course you don't have to. Antoine.

00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:27.318
<i>Just as I don't have to tell anyone
about the shenanigans in La Courneuve.</i>

00:57:27.985 --> 00:57:29.320
For that matter.

00:57:29.403 --> 00:57:33.157
the Arabs don't have
to slit your throat. either.

00:57:34.575 --> 00:57:36.452
Don't lose any sleep over it.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.371
Well...

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.081
You have work to do. so do 1.

00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:42.708
The first of us to get nervous
calls the other.

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.168
Come on. son.

00:57:45.127 --> 00:57:46.253
Can't we talk?

00:57:48.172 --> 00:57:50.257
We'll look into your problem.

00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:53.719
Now. it looks more like your problem.

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:20.848
Train number 203.
departing for Luxembourg.

00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:23.809
Mind the automatic doors.

00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:26.812
Imminent departure.

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.565
We wish you a good trip.

01:01:32.479 --> 01:01:34.690
If I were you. I'd put the gun down.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.987
Face the railing.

01:01:43.073 --> 01:01:44.992
Spread 'em!

01:01:49.788 --> 01:01:52.833
Move.

01:01:58.255 --> 01:02:01.342
Mr. Meccacci.
Angelo wants to talk to you personally.

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:05.888
Angelo?

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:07.932
Mr. Meccacci?

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:10.100
Alfred had a grave accident.

01:02:29.411 --> 01:02:32.998
What happened with the Commissioner?
You talked back to him?

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.125
He's crazy.

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.169
In Marseille. he once ironed out a guy.

01:02:44.843 --> 01:02:48.264
If it's about drugs. better tell the boss.
because he's not gonna like it.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:52.351
- Especially coming from you.
- It's murder-related.

01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:56.563
Alfred Gonet. "Freddy the Chemist."

01:02:56.647 --> 01:03:00.526
Freddy's dead? How sad.

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:02.236
He really had us running.

01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:04.697
Why was he killed?

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.408
This guy should know.
He pulled the trigger.

01:03:07.491 --> 01:03:09.994
<i>You must be kidding. I don't even know
who you're talking about.</i>

01:03:10.077 --> 01:03:12.204
Because you're not paying attention.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.039
We're talking about "Freddy the Chemist".

01:03:15.582 --> 01:03:16.667
Never heard of him.

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.377
<i>You've ever heard of Gare de l'Est?</i>

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.171
I know the name.
but not the location.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:23.674
And you never heard of Meccacci's?

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.218
Never heard the name. either.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.887
And the guy you were with?
Never heard of him either?

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.472
Nobody ever hangs with me.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.810
I'm the solitary type.

01:03:34.893 --> 01:03:36.478
<i>I live alone with my cat.</i>

01:03:37.896 --> 01:03:39.898
Inspector!

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:44.570
Our friend has a memory lapse.
but it's only fleeting. I'm sure.

01:03:44.653 --> 01:03:46.447
- This is not legal.
- And this...

01:03:47.072 --> 01:03:48.282
Is that legal?

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:56.206
Within 48 hours. our friend will have
revealed the sponsor's name.

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.292
the name of his acolyte.

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:00.919
and even the name of the cat.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.629
We might not wait that long.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:06.842
<i>Watch your methods.
1 could collapse on you.</i>

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:10.721
Who cares?
I'm no doctor. I'm a cop.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.767
But if you're going to collapse.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.269
I'd prefer that you give
your deposition first.

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:20.773
Inspector Rojinski will type it up.
and we're all done.

01:04:21.732 --> 01:04:22.858
Go fuck yourself!

01:04:27.112 --> 01:04:29.615
Lock him up.

01:04:30.324 --> 01:04:33.911
And if he feels talkative.
call me before he collapses.

01:04:33.994 --> 01:04:38.082
Well. gentlemen. It's after 8:00.
I've got a private life to attend to.

01:04:38.582 --> 01:04:40.876
A dame's waiting. I'll be on my way.

01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:43.670
Cheers.

01:04:50.719 --> 01:04:52.137
Hi there.

01:04:57.726 --> 01:04:58.936
Commissioner!

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:06.110
Here's the shirt you ordered.

01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:10.739
- You like it?
- Do you?

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:12.533
<i>I bought it to have lunch with you.</i>

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.910
You look better in a sweater.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.371
And I'd rather have dinner than lunch.

01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:21.333
This is getting overly complicated.

01:05:27.756 --> 01:05:30.717
- What are you doing there?
- Me? Waiting for my mommy.

01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:40.727
You can have dinner with him.

01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:42.646
He's free.

01:05:50.737 --> 01:05:53.073
Sorry. you can't stay there.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.201
Drive off.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.494
This ain't valet parking!

01:05:57.578 --> 01:05:59.997
Don't worry. I'll be five minutes.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.707
Shit.

01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:10.466
Hey. handsome.

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:11.967
I'm not your type?

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:18.474
SOS DOCTORS

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.949
Hi. Is Livia here?

01:06:41.121 --> 01:06:43.624
- What's wrong with you?
- This is.

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.460
Why'd they do that?

01:06:46.543 --> 01:06:49.171
<i>Because I sleep with a cop.</i>

01:06:49.254 --> 01:06:51.215
Next time. they'll cut up my face.

01:06:51.298 --> 01:06:53.634
Is that so?

01:06:54.718 --> 01:06:57.054
As a bonus.
they want to fuck you up.

01:06:58.972 --> 01:07:01.850
Do you know these moralists?

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.144
They're the Tourian brothers.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.272
What they usually up to
at this time of night?

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.982
They love gambling.

01:07:09.066 --> 01:07:12.694
The Shanghai. the Paradise.
or the Winner's Garden.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.747
Hi. I'm looking for
the Tourian Brothers.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:09.751
<i>I haven't seen them tonight.
Watch out. those guys are nasty.</i>

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.239
Hello.

01:08:55.422 --> 01:08:57.174
No more bets.

01:08:57.257 --> 01:08:59.926
- Evening.
- Evening. Commissioner.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:06.642
- Seen the Tourian brothers?
- Right in front of you. second row.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.371
Yellow four wins.

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:01.363
Why are you laughing?

01:10:01.446 --> 01:10:05.242
<i>I was thinking about the cop's face
when he lays his eyes on the chick.</i>

01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:06.993
You know him?

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:12.457
No. but he seems like a lightweight.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.420
Jerk-off kind of guy.

01:10:44.906 --> 01:10:45.907
THE STREET URCHIN

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:23.153
Gentlemen.

01:11:23.236 --> 01:11:24.237
Yeah?

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:28.241
- I'm hungry and in a hurry. waiter.
- The name's George.

01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:30.619
Well. then. George.
it'll be steak and fries.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:52.057
With a pinch of salt.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:07.489
- George!
- Look what you did!

01:12:07.572 --> 01:12:09.407
I'm so clumsy. I'm sorry.

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:10.909
Don't you have enough room?

01:12:10.992 --> 01:12:13.662
George. my man.
Serve them another round.

01:12:13.745 --> 01:12:15.580
- It's on me.
- Enough already!

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.082
Don't get jumpy.

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:19.000
Let's take it easy.

01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:23.088
Let me introduce myself.
Jordan. Commissioner Jordan.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:26.258
You're the Tourian brothers. right?

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:30.095
Cut-up artists
with a liking for pretty women.

01:12:30.178 --> 01:12:34.224
<i>So. I heard you want to fuck me up?</i>

01:12:34.307 --> 01:12:35.934
I'm consenting.

01:12:36.017 --> 01:12:37.644
Who's first?

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.349
So. George...

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.059
Where's my steak?

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:18.411
<i>After your call. I looked at the clock.</i>

01:14:18.495 --> 01:14:20.372
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.290
Not your style to get up at 6:007

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:23.917
Sleeping in is more my style.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.420
- So. coffee or coffee?
- Tea.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:29.506
- Coffee!
- No. tea.

01:14:29.589 --> 01:14:31.091
Tea. then.

01:14:31.925 --> 01:14:34.678
These bastards. I'll never forget.

01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:37.263
They won't either.

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:47.816
This place isn't as chic as Maxim's.
And there's no music.

01:14:48.316 --> 01:14:49.526
You've been to Maxim's?

01:14:49.609 --> 01:14:51.695
Of course. I went with Mario.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:53.405
Mario the dancer.

01:14:54.197 --> 01:14:55.865
He's just a friend.

01:14:57.617 --> 01:15:00.203
- Maxim's is the place with a band. right?
- Yes.

01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:02.580
- And a dance floor?
- Yes.

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.583
- And the river boats?
- Not really.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:08.920
Are you sure Mario
didn't take you to Chez Gégène?

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:12.090
<i>Yes. that's it.
1 always get names mixed up.</i>

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:15.010
You know my name isn't Gustave. right?

01:15:15.593 --> 01:15:17.095
- You know that. right?
- Of course.

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:18.388
What's my name?

01:15:18.471 --> 01:15:22.434
<i>Francis?
1 got tied up. but I'm on my way.</i>

01:15:22.934 --> 01:15:24.728
No problem. I'll wait for you.

01:15:24.811 --> 01:15:28.940
We're having lunch at the Cyclops.
in Meudon. All right? Bye.

01:15:59.971 --> 01:16:01.431
What a small world.

01:16:01.514 --> 01:16:06.352
<i>Ilook in my rearview mirror.
and who do I see? Inspector Simon.</i>

01:16:06.436 --> 01:16:07.645
Don't move.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:10.899
<i>- I just want to check your dog collar.
- Jordan. I'm warning you...</i>

01:16:10.982 --> 01:16:12.650
<i>Just what I thought.</i>

01:16:13.526 --> 01:16:17.197
"If found. please return
to Commissioner Garnier."

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.531
<i>Shut up! I have a right to...</i>

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:20.992
Back to the kennel!

01:16:21.826 --> 01:16:26.081
Good boy. Simon.
Back to your kennel.

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:44.140
Relax. my car just broke down!

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:06.830
BOXING

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:36.234
Assholes!

01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:32.256
A high-speed car chase
across the 18th arrondissement.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:35.176
that ends with two guys
crushed to death. at Barbès!

01:23:35.259 --> 01:23:38.179
And before Barbès. Gare de I'Est!

01:23:38.262 --> 01:23:40.181
A shoot-out at high noon!

01:23:40.264 --> 01:23:42.099
It could've ended with ten deaths.

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.559
When Jordan got here.

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.646
<i>I told him that helicopter chases
were less frequent around here.</i>

01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:49.649
between Faubourg Montmartre
and rue des Martyrs.

01:23:49.732 --> 01:23:52.235
<i>but I underestimated him!</i>

01:23:52.318 --> 01:23:55.738
He doesn't need a chopper
to bust my balls!

01:23:55.821 --> 01:24:00.034
The Jordan case is closed.
and I'm sending it upstairs.

01:24:00.117 --> 01:24:02.537
You can pass that along
if you ever catch up with him.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.747
<i>I think he tried calling you. but...</i>

01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:06.624
The line was busy. right?

01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:10.336
You're starting to get
on my nerves too. Rojinski.

01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:03.973
Good to see you.

01:25:04.056 --> 01:25:07.602
The boss just made it clear he's had
enough of us. and it goes way back.

01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:11.480
- All the way back to the Turks?
- No. but at least to Gare de I'Est.

01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:14.692
<i>I don't care about what he says.</i>

01:25:14.775 --> 01:25:19.280
<i>What I care about
is our friend Marc Villa.</i>

01:25:19.363 --> 01:25:22.325
How's he making out?
Does he miss drugs?

01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:25.119
Less so. since he hasn't been getting any.

01:25:25.202 --> 01:25:27.413
The guy's overjoyed.

01:25:27.496 --> 01:25:29.624
You'll be too when you see this.

01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:45.806
"Answer. 'No. he asked me
to come in from Turin.

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:49.185
They needed an unfamiliar face
to trail Commissioner Jordan.'

01:25:49.268 --> 01:25:53.064
Question. 'To kill him?'
Answer. 'No. just to trail him.'

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:55.441
He was supposed to lead me
to Alfred Gonet.'

01:25:55.524 --> 01:25:59.487
Question. 'To trail him too?'
Answer. 'No. to kill him.'

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:04.575
<i>Question. "Who did you contact?
Answer. 'Someone called Baldi.</i>

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.494
That's all I know of him.

01:26:07.119 --> 01:26:08.371
I know Baldi.

01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:11.040
Meccacci knows him too.

01:26:11.123 --> 01:26:14.126
Baldi. Antonio. king of "case dismissed."

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.711
Antonio's not here.

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:18.339
<i>- AX this hour. I thought he'd be sleeping.
- He doesn't always sleep.</i>

01:26:37.024 --> 01:26:40.111
Tell him Commissioner Jordan
is looking for him.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:27:01.882
My dear Baldi. you ever hear
of Commissioner Philippe Jordan?

01:27:01.966 --> 01:27:03.718
Yes.

01:27:10.349 --> 01:27:13.018
<i>I don't want to hear of him again.</i>

01:27:21.485 --> 01:27:23.362
He's a cop.

01:27:23.446 --> 01:27:25.030
You can't just mow down a cop.

01:27:27.074 --> 01:27:30.244
Seems your ideas are a bit outdated.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:43.340
Francis always got in trouble
with his bicycles and his cars.

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.426
but he had a clean record.

01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:50.097
<i>so I got him into the force
while his record was still clean.</i>

01:27:51.515 --> 01:27:53.142
He wasn't such a good cop.

01:27:53.225 --> 01:27:55.978
He'd never arrest anyone.
He found it depressing.

01:27:56.061 --> 01:28:00.065
Said it was a waste of time.
because the next day. we'd let them out.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.735
He had a point.

01:28:02.818 --> 01:28:04.487
Did you know him for long?

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:07.907
Sixteen years.

01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:11.118
I knew him when he was playing soccer
with the Red Devils. in Malakoff.

01:28:11.202 --> 01:28:13.496
In the locker-room. he was a nice guy.

01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:15.706
but on the field.
he was as tough as they come.

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:18.334
What about you?
Weren't you tough. at his age?

01:28:18.417 --> 01:28:20.544
Let's say I was a late bloomer.

01:28:21.545 --> 01:28:23.297
Did you have brothers or sisters?

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:27.176
<i>I had Francis.</i>

01:28:44.735 --> 01:28:50.324
See. if I can connect the dots
between Meccacci. and the slot machines.

01:28:50.407 --> 01:28:53.285
we link the machines to the crime.

01:28:53.369 --> 01:28:55.955
and the crime to Meccacci.

01:28:56.038 --> 01:28:58.999
Then he crumbles on his own.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.593
I'm going to stir up memories.
and empty the drawers.

01:29:10.135 --> 01:29:13.222
<i>- And me. what do I do?
- You stay here.</i>

01:29:14.181 --> 01:29:17.142
- With Livia?
- Of course. with Livia!

01:29:17.226 --> 01:29:19.270
What? She scares you?

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:41.709
- He left?
- Yes.

01:29:42.334 --> 01:29:43.335
He didn't say anything?

01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:46.088
He told me to stay here.

01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:49.675
<i>I said. "With Livia?"
He said. "She scares you?"</i>

01:29:52.177 --> 01:29:53.721
That's an odd thing to say.

01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:01.395
Since the death of Francis.
he hasn't been the same.

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:55.115
<i>My name's Antonio Baldi.
I heard you we're looking for me.</i>

01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:57.117
Yes.

01:30:57.201 --> 01:30:59.453
I'm downstairs.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.036
Why are you looking for me. Commissioner?

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.288
Someone told me about you.

01:31:43.372 --> 01:31:44.832
Who's that?

01:31:44.915 --> 01:31:46.834
Marc Villa.

01:31:50.212 --> 01:31:51.422
Don't know him.

01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:53.090
He's a junkie.

01:31:53.173 --> 01:31:56.927
He told me you brought him from Turin
to take out Freddy the Chemist.

01:31:59.096 --> 01:32:02.016
Mere junk pouring from a junkie's mouth.

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:06.020
I'm not here because you want to see me.

01:32:07.104 --> 01:32:09.440
but because Mr. Meccacci wants to see you.

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:10.941
I'm only a messenger.

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.235
You should've said so in the first place.

01:32:13.318 --> 01:32:17.072
<i>because if I want to see Mr. Meccaci.
all I have to do is summon him.</i>

01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:21.994
Maybe he shows up. or he don't.

01:32:22.077 --> 01:32:26.832
Last time you tried to play smart.
you were caught with your pants down.

01:32:27.666 --> 01:32:29.585
So. what do we do now?

01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:34.298
Let's go meet Mr. Meccacci.

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:54.860
Where are we heading?
To play a round of pool in Clichy?

01:32:56.862 --> 01:32:58.822
No. we're going to the head office.

01:33:00.115 --> 01:33:02.910
That's where serious issues are settled.

01:33:33.398 --> 01:33:34.650
Here we are.

01:33:34.733 --> 01:33:37.027
Wait for me.
I'll tell him we're here.

01:33:37.653 --> 01:33:39.238
What the hell!

01:33:39.321 --> 01:33:40.364
You wait for me.

01:33:41.365 --> 01:33:43.075
You're nuts.

01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:47.496
Come on. let me go.
What's this about?

01:33:48.664 --> 01:33:50.582
<i>I don't believe in your meeting.</i>

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.335
It's a trap.

01:33:55.462 --> 01:33:58.632
We'll both wait it out.
but not together.

01:33:59.258 --> 01:34:02.803
Don't leave me here. Commissioner!
Let me out!

01:34:02.886 --> 01:34:04.930
You have no right.

01:34:05.013 --> 01:34:06.890
They're coming! Don't leave me like this!

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:12.020
Let me loose! Don't leave me like this!

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:11.914
Baldi? Is that you?

01:35:13.123 --> 01:35:14.458
Baldi is dead.

01:35:29.139 --> 01:35:30.849
What are you doing here?

01:35:31.475 --> 01:35:33.268
<i>I can't be here. because I'm dead.</i>

01:35:34.353 --> 01:35:37.189
You'll miss me. because we had a ball.

01:35:38.273 --> 01:35:43.278
Remember the old days?
I'd show up. pull out my badge.

01:35:43.362 --> 01:35:45.989
and shout. "Police! You're under arrest.”

01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:50.202
Then Counselor Cappa would show up.
and the farce would commence.

01:35:51.161 --> 01:35:56.291
Arraignment. trial. case dismissed.

01:35:57.292 --> 01:36:00.712
Then Mr. Meccacci would get mad.

01:36:00.796 --> 01:36:02.798
and the schmuck would be transferred.

01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:05.008
The schmuck was me.

01:36:06.718 --> 01:36:10.889
What are you getting at. Mr. Jordan?

01:36:11.723 --> 01:36:13.225
Take a guess.

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:17.646
<i>I can only speculate.</i>

01:36:17.729 --> 01:36:19.564
No arrest.

01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:21.400
no lawyer.

01:36:21.483 --> 01:36:23.110
no trial.

01:36:25.696 --> 01:36:27.197
Yeah...

01:36:28.365 --> 01:36:32.744
but it's totally... crazy.

01:36:33.078 --> 01:36:37.624
What's totally crazy
is selling dope to kids

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:40.294
so that a few dirty old men
can pay for a 12-year-old hooker.

01:36:40.377 --> 01:36:42.754
What about you?

01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:45.674
You have an age preference for hookers?

01:36:45.757 --> 01:36:48.427
<i>I was starting to wonder
if it would ever happen.</i>

01:36:49.594 --> 01:36:50.595
What?

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.056
Getting to see you croak.

01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:58.312
But then your theory falls apart.

01:36:58.854 --> 01:37:02.065
There will be a trial. but not mine.

01:37:03.191 --> 01:37:05.068
Yours.

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:07.904
For it to be my trial.

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:10.907
it has to be my gun.

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:13.118
And this one belonged to Baldi.

01:38:32.114 --> 01:38:34.074
You're Commissioner Jordan?

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:37.494
- Yes.
- Everyone's looking for you. Commissioner.

01:38:37.577 --> 01:38:39.830
Please come with us.

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:06.940
Yes. TV-7 here.
Get me Inspector Rojinski. on 2902.

01:39:07.524 --> 01:39:10.652
Tell him Commissioner Jordan is with me.

01:39:12.487 --> 01:39:14.489
Inspector Rojinski.

01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:21.788
Meccacci was murdered. in his club.

01:39:21.872 --> 01:39:24.875
- Tonight?
- Yes. two hours ago.

01:39:25.792 --> 01:39:28.962
I'm on the night shift.
The information just came in.

01:39:29.045 --> 01:39:32.048
I wanted you to be the first to know.
I sent out for you.

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:35.969
Who would want to get rid of Meccacci?

01:39:36.928 --> 01:39:40.098
- Got any idea?
- Not in the slightest.

01:39:40.682 --> 01:39:44.644
Looks like we're heading for a war
over who takes his place.

01:39:44.728 --> 01:39:47.147
To me. it's politics.

01:39:47.230 --> 01:39:49.399
Now. everything's about politics.

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.109
Maybe so.

01:39:51.193 --> 01:39:53.570
See you soon.

01:39:53.653 --> 01:39:55.822
Thanks.

01:39:55.906 --> 01:39:58.325
Need a ride back?
