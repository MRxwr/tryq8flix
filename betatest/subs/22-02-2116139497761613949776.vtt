181
00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:18.889
I heard that's what you said.

182
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:21.228
Jin Woo was badly hurt by what you said.

183
00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:25.358
But I said that a few hours ago.

184
00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.129
What are you talking about?

185
00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:31.838
I only said that a few hours ago.

186
00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.639

Putting up with the disapproving look from the people...

197
00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:00.728
regarding their desperation is harder than the hunger strike.

198
00:10:00.728 --> 00:10:04.439
A blunt remark from their neighbors...

199
00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:07.639
pains them as they continue to fight for their right.

200

212
00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:32.698

Hey. Mr. Han. Han Do Kyung.

240
00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:31.988
- You... - What?

241
00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.629
Were you trying to run away from me?

242
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:36.728
No. that's not it.

243
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:47.608
Did you ask them to reopen the case yet?

244
00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:49.838
- Jin Woo. that's... - Stop.

245
00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.039
I can tell you're about to say the same thing as always.

246
00:11:53.238 --> 00:11:55.848
"I can't. The case is closed."

247
00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.649
"It's too hard to do internally." That's what you're saying. right?

248
00:11:57.649 --> 00:11:59.549
Right. you know it so well already.

249
00:12:00.748 --> 00:12:02.248
So why are you keep coming back?

250
00:12:02.248 --> 00:12:03.488
Because I know the truth.

251
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.059
If I don't do this. that case will remain closed forever.

252
00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:09.759
If you don't have any news for me within the year.

253
00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:11.228
I'm going to lie down and squat in the Chief's office.

254
00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:13.029
You take care of it before I do anything crazy.

255
00:12:13.228 --> 00:12:15.299
Jin Woo. I already said all I can to my superiors.

256
00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:16.629
Then say more.

257
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:17.838
What more can I say?

258
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.769
Don't put in a request to your superiors. just reinvestigate.

259
00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:21.738
You're the detective in charge of the case. Who else can do it?

260
00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:24.139
It's not something I can do on my own.

261
00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:25.578
I don't have enough staff...

262
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.179
and too many cases as it is.

263
00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.809
It's hard to reinvestigate a case like that.

264
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.818
- Just let it go. - Let it go?

265
00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:35.649
How am I suppose to let go of this?

266
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.559
Do Kyung. I thought about it a lot at first too.

267
00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.689
Am I hanging on to this case because I'm a reporter.

268
00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:44.559
or because I'm upset as a bereaved family member.

269
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:46.059
I thought a lot about why...

270
00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:47.559
I've been so obsessed with my brother's case.

271
00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:50.998
I understand. I totally understand.

272
00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:55.338
The conclusion I came to is that it was both.

273
00:12:55.338 --> 00:12:57.208
As a reporter. there are far too many suspicious points.

274
00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.708
and as a family member. it's unjust to let this slide in this way.

275
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:03.108
If there's something wrong. we need to set it right.

276
00:13:03.108 --> 00:13:04.978
whether that takes 10 years or 100.

Geun Woo didn't commit suicide.

278
00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:11.588
As a reporter. and as his brother. I know this.

279
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.059
I'm sure of it.

280
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.868

281
00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:25.539

and brag about your eldest a lot more.

Your eldest is the CEO of a company.

No. Why would I write you one when I don't write one to my girlfriend?

But if I miss this opportunity now.

690
00:37:20.675 --> 00:37:22.135

I still have to try.

702

Before we go to the scene of the crime.

703
00:38:06.285 --> 00:38:07.515
we just have to grab the evidence and give it to the police.

00:38:51.164 --> 00:38:53.195
and starting tomorrow. let's live on again.

714
00:38:53.334 --> 00:38:55.365
I'm sure that's what he wants.

715
00:38:56.265 --> 00:38:58.064
You should become an excellent reporter.

716
00:39:01.475 --> 00:39:04.204
I heard that's what you promised to Geun Woo.

717
00:39:07.874 --> 00:39:09.115
Thank you.

718
00:39:22.325 --> 00:39:24.925
Since the day before yesterday.

719
00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:27.334
the citizens continue to pay their respects to Seo Ki Tae.

720
00:39:28.164 --> 00:39:30.234
It's already been five years.

721
00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:32.035
but it seems like it just happened yesterday.

722
00:39:32.265 --> 00:39:33.805
I still can't believe it.

723
00:39:34.434 --> 00:39:36.575
He was going to be President.

724
00:39:38.405 --> 00:39:39.814
I still...

725
00:39:39.845 --> 00:39:41.445
(The sniped assassination of presidential candidate Seo Ki Tae)

726
00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:45.414
don't think there was any politician quite like Seo Ki Tae.

727
00:39:48.055 --> 00:39:49.785
When this time of year comes around.

728
00:39:50.425 --> 00:39:53.195
I think of him a lot.

729
00:39:54.294 --> 00:39:57.365
Citizens in front of Seo Ki Tae's grave...

730
00:39:57.365 --> 00:40:01.265
mourn his passing five years ago. in front of Hangook University.

731
00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:03.865
They remain in shock from the assassination.

732
00:40:03.865 --> 00:40:05.064
Yes?

733
00:40:05.265 --> 00:40:06.334
Let's do it.

734
00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:08.805
Let's give it a shot.

735
00:40:11.204 --> 00:40:12.305
Thank you so much.

736
00:40:17.544 --> 00:40:19.015
I'm really grateful. Jin Woo.

737
00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:21.754
Save those words for after I've saved your father.

738
00:40:22.285 --> 00:40:23.325
What should we start with?

739
00:40:23.524 --> 00:40:24.954
What do I need to do.

740
00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:26.325
to save Seo Ki Tae's life?

741
00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.925
This is the path that Kim Jin Chul followed. according to the police.

742
00:40:36.604 --> 00:40:39.405
At 12:30pm. he left his home at Gimpo.

743
00:40:41.475 --> 00:40:43.805
(Incheon Container Terminal)

744
00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:46.274
At 1:00pm. he received the sniper rifle he purchased...

745
00:40:46.274 --> 00:40:48.345
from a black market arms dealer he'd investigated as police.

746
00:40:48.675 --> 00:40:51.644
At 1:50pm. he entered Daesung Inn.

747
00:40:51.644 --> 00:40:52.954
in the vicinity of Seo Ki Tae's campaign headquarters.

748
00:41:03.564 --> 00:41:05.495
He waited for my father for over an hour.

749
00:41:05.495 --> 00:41:07.434
then followed him to the rally at Hangook University.

750
00:41:08.064 --> 00:41:10.104
He avoided notice by 20 guards.

751
00:41:10.104 --> 00:41:11.635
and entered a building that was under construction.

752
00:41:11.865 --> 00:41:14.204
From there. he sniped and killed Seo Ki Tae.

753
00:41:15.635 --> 00:41:16.745
But he made it to the Container Terminal for the rifle...

754
00:41:17.004 --> 00:41:20.345
in just 30 minutes from Gimpo?

755
00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:23.945
Then he immediately made it to an inn by the headquarters?

756
00:41:24.544 --> 00:41:25.715
Does that make any sense?

757
00:41:25.715 --> 00:41:27.115
Why would he go to the inn?

758
00:41:27.115 --> 00:41:28.314
He has no reason to go there.

759
00:41:28.314 --> 00:41:29.854
I know it doesn't make sense.

760
00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:32.754
I kept looking into it.

761
00:41:32.754 --> 00:41:35.024
but since five years have passed. there's not a shred of evidence.

762
00:41:35.595 --> 00:41:38.865
Anyway. this is information that wasn't in the first police report.

763
00:41:39.535 --> 00:41:40.794
It was the owner of the inn who came forward.

764
00:41:40.794 --> 00:41:42.704
I saw Kim Jin Chul.

765
00:41:42.704 --> 00:41:44.704
On the day of the assassination.

766
00:41:44.704 --> 00:41:46.374
he stayed at my inn.

767
00:41:46.374 --> 00:41:49.745
"On the day of Seo Ki Tae's assassination. he stayed here."

768
00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:51.104
She gave an interview like that.

769
00:41:51.104 --> 00:41:52.814
So they hastily made it all fit at the last minute?

770
00:41:53.515 --> 00:41:55.945
No wonder his trail is so all over the place.

771
00:41:56.015 --> 00:41:59.144
You need to catch Kim Jin Chul before he gets to the University.

772
00:41:59.144 --> 00:42:00.885
So before Kim Jin Chul manages to assassinate Seo Ki Tae.

773
00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.725
we need to obtain evidence and turn it over to the police.

774
00:42:02.725 --> 00:42:03.984
Is that what you're saying?

775
00:42:05.684 --> 00:42:08.954
All right. Let's give it a shot.

776
00:42:09.595 --> 00:42:10.894
I'll leave it to you.

777
00:42:11.995 --> 00:42:13.535
As soon as this is over.

778
00:42:15.164 --> 00:42:16.265
you'll both live.

779
00:42:16.635 --> 00:42:17.934
Both my father.

780
00:42:18.934 --> 00:42:20.135
and you. Jin Woo.

781
00:42:25.704 --> 00:42:28.644
President Nam will now pay his respects.

782
00:42:39.394 --> 00:42:40.754
(Seo Ki Tae. born June 6. 1956. deceased October 12. 2015)

783
00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:49.535
(5th Death Anniversary of Seo Ki Tae)

784
00:43:24.765 --> 00:43:26.475
Assembly members. thank you for attending.

785
00:43:26.475 --> 00:43:28.805
- Of course. - I'll see you next time.

786
00:43:29.644 --> 00:43:31.144
- Thank you. - See you next time.

787
00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:34.575
Jung In. it's your birthday. right?

788
00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:36.345
Should we grab lunch?

789
00:43:36.644 --> 00:43:38.445
I'm sorry. I have plans.

790
00:43:40.314 --> 00:43:41.454
That's too bad then.

791
00:43:41.454 --> 00:43:43.155
Let's have lunch another time. Assemblywoman.

792
00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:45.854
(Times Lee Jin Woo)

793
00:43:47.394 --> 00:43:49.825
- I'll call you. - Sure. You should go.

794
00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.035
Yes. Lee Jin Woo?

795
00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:01.175
Where are you? Did you find him?

796
00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:04.305
How could I find him that fast? I'm no detective.

797
00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:07.945
I'm looking for him based on the information I have. don't worry.

798
00:44:08.515 --> 00:44:09.644
What does that mean?

799
00:44:09.684 --> 00:44:12.245
I went to his house in Gimpo in the morning.

800
00:44:12.245 --> 00:44:13.584
but he never came out. so I asked the landlord.

801
00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.314
Is Kim Jin Chul inside?

802
00:44:16.024 --> 00:44:18.425
- He hasn't been here for a month. - A month?

803
00:44:18.425 --> 00:44:20.325
He said it's been over a month since he came back.

804
00:44:30.805 --> 00:44:33.075
He didn't make it to the container terminal at all.

805
00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:35.305
I was worried about losing him if I waited for him there.

806
00:44:35.535 --> 00:44:37.544
so now I'm in front of Daesung Inn.

807
00:44:37.544 --> 00:44:39.414
There was that interview with the owner of the inn.

808
00:44:39.414 --> 00:44:40.544
so I thought he might be here.

809
00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:43.215
He definitely followed my father from the inn. so I'm sure...

810
00:44:43.215 --> 00:44:44.385
Wait a minute.

811
00:44:46.084 --> 00:44:47.314
Dark facial hair.

812
00:44:47.314 --> 00:44:49.624
navy blue hat. padded jacket. dark clothes.

813
00:44:50.325 --> 00:44:52.484
- That's Kim Jin Chul. right? - Yes. that's him.

814
00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:54.825
So he was here after all.

815
00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:56.124
(Daesung Inn)

816
00:45:12.104 --> 00:45:14.874
We can call the police if we get any definitive evidence. right?

817
00:45:14.975 --> 00:45:16.245
Yes. that's true. but...

818
00:45:16.245 --> 00:45:18.115
He was carrying something suspicious.

819
00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.245
What was it?

820
00:45:19.245 --> 00:45:20.954
I need to confirm it first.

821
00:45:21.314 --> 00:45:23.084
What room is he in?

822
00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:25.684
- 302. - 302.

823
00:45:26.655 --> 00:45:28.225
1. 2. 3.

824
00:45:48.914 --> 00:45:50.144
(Daesung Inn)

825
00:45:52.285 --> 00:45:54.615
(Daesung Inn)

826
00:46:20.414 --> 00:46:22.175
(The memory card is missing.)

827
00:46:22.175 --> 00:46:23.184
Darn it.

828
00:46:42.267 --> 00:46:44.243
Do Kyung. Where are you right now?

829
00:46:53.798 --> 00:46:56.068
- Do Kyung. - Are you sure about what you saw?

830
00:46:56.068 --> 00:46:58.738
Yes. I'm telling you. I checked it from up there too.

831
00:46:58.738 --> 00:47:01.639
He even put up photos of Seo Ki Tae. and it seemed weird.

832
00:47:01.639 --> 00:47:02.948
I'll go check it out.

833
00:47:02.948 --> 00:47:04.179
- You should stay here. - Okay.

834
00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:05.479
- Let's go. - Yes. sir.

835
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:09.218
Hey. It's room 302.

836
00:47:09.818 --> 00:47:12.789
So you're saying it was a premeditated murder.

837
00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:15.588
and it wasn't the gun he got from the container?

838
00:47:15.588 --> 00:47:17.429
Yes. that's right.

839
00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:20.829
Now I understand why the research didn't make sense.

840
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:24.128
Right. That's all because the police didn't do their jobs properly.

841
00:47:24.128 --> 00:47:26.198
They did such a poor job considering they're law enforcement agents.

842
00:47:29.269 --> 00:47:31.838
What kind of person is the police officer you called?

843
00:47:31.838 --> 00:47:33.479
He's my friend of 30 years.

844
00:47:33.479 --> 00:47:35.479
He's the team leader of the Serious Crimes Team at Ma Un Police Station.

845
00:47:35.479 --> 00:47:37.179
He's rude. but he's smart.

846
00:47:38.249 --> 00:47:39.979
I'm sure he caught Kim Jin Chul by now.

847
00:47:39.979 --> 00:47:41.019
He's not in there.

848
00:47:41.519 --> 00:47:42.619
What are you talking about?

849
00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:43.849
How could someone who was just there disappear suddenly?

850
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:44.988
Are you sure you looked properly?

851
00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:46.758
It's not that someone who was there disappeared. Jin Woo.

852
00:47:46.758 --> 00:47:48.519
- He was never there... - Forget it.

853
00:47:48.519 --> 00:47:49.659
My gosh. that punk.

854
00:47:56.229 --> 00:47:57.499
(Daesung Inn)

855
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:12.548
You made a mistake.

856
00:48:12.948 --> 00:48:15.249
I didn't make a mistake! I'm sure I saw him!

857
00:48:15.249 --> 00:48:17.548
We took a look at the other rooms just in case.

858
00:48:17.548 --> 00:48:20.019
There were no rooms where a man stayed alone.

859
00:48:21.718 --> 00:48:23.258
What about the area around the inn? Did you look around?

860
00:48:23.258 --> 00:48:24.889
Stop it already.

861
00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:27.628
I'm busy too. I have a lot to do at the station.

862
00:48:34.269 --> 00:48:36.369
Do Kyung.

863
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:41.139
I don't know how Kim Jin Chul ran away from here.

864
00:48:41.139 --> 00:48:43.079
but that jerk is going to kill Seo Ki Tae today.

865
00:48:43.079 --> 00:48:45.179
Right. but why would he do that?

866
00:48:45.179 --> 00:48:46.878
The reason isn't important right now.

867
00:48:46.878 --> 00:48:48.579
Assemblyman Seo Ki Tae will die in an hour...

868
00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:49.948
at the campaign rally at the Hangook University.

869
00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:52.318
What are you talking about?

870
00:48:54.488 --> 00:48:56.659
I'll explain that later.

871
00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:00.229
We don't have time. so let's ask for backup.

872
00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:02.398
There's a building undergoing construction near the rally.

873
00:49:02.858 --> 00:49:04.968
Kim Jin Chul will be hiding there with a gun.

874
00:49:04.968 --> 00:49:07.668
- No. - Why? Why not?

875
00:49:07.668 --> 00:49:10.539
Isn't it harder to find a reason why I can in this situation?

876
00:49:10.709 --> 00:49:12.068
It's not like he did something.

877
00:49:12.068 --> 00:49:13.479
so how can I send police officers?

878
00:49:13.479 --> 00:49:14.709
I can't believe you.

879
00:49:14.709 --> 00:49:16.579
Will you catch him after he kills someone?

880
00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:18.909
I'm saying the circumstances don't suggest that.

881
00:49:19.479 --> 00:49:21.818
You should stop and go back to work.

882
00:49:23.448 --> 00:49:24.488
You're right.

883
00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:28.159
You can wait patiently...

884
00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:29.829
until the circumstances occur.

885
00:49:31.588 --> 00:49:32.829
I'll go stop him myself.

886
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:34.459
