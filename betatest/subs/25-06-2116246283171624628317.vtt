00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:52.379
Oh. some people
really don't care. Violet.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.480
They don't.

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:54.782
I know that.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:56.551
They just let stuff happen
up there

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:58.352
- and they roll with it.
- Yeah. I know.

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:01.421
Content with whatever random
chance delivers to them.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.491
But that's not me. Violet.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.293
- Really?
- Sorry.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.261
I'm talking about control.
Violet.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.297
- I know.
- Carefully exercised.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.802
meticulous control.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.738
- Oh. I got a call coming in.
- Mhm.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.674
- Do not hang up.
- Ugh.

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:21.542
Hi. hi. hi. hi.

00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:25.379
Hi. hi. hi. sorry. yes. yes.

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:29.316
Would it help if I told you
that I'm on mushrooms?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.719
No. okay. they're waiting
for you inside.

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:34.622
- Who are you talking to?
- Sorry. nothing. Bob.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:36.557
Because life is too short.
Violet.

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.258
Hey. David.
this is coming off your time.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.794
Well. you...
You know what I mean.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.294
- Uh-huh.
- I think the expression

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:45.733
- still applies here.
- Welcome to the Death of Comedy!

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:46.801
Yeah!

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.335
How's everybody doing?

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.237
Hello. how's everybody
doing tonight?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.972
Fair.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:52.339
I respect that.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.241
How's everybody else doing?

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.910
So when you come
to the show with a sack

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:59.346
of bottom-shelf booze
it makes a difference.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.214
Not just to the talent
of the show

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:04.284
but to the prestige
of the show itself.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.753
Top-shelf for now on. all right?

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:08.288
I don't want us
to look like assholes.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.526
Oh. and uh. the... the dark
of the moon is coming up.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:16.296
- So uh. I... you know.
- Yep. I know.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.510
Life's too short. Violet.

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:31.846
That's how racism works.
right. you know?

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.413
I don't mean like you know.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:40.387
muttered. in-traffic.
casual. weekend racism.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.789
Okay. alright!

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.992
With... and with that
searing social insight.

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:49.329
methinks this crowd has been
sufficiently warmed up.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:52.900
You may know our
first performer from college.

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.269
That's how I know him.
Give it up for Andy Jocelyn!

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:02.009
Uh. hi. I'm Andy Jocelyn.

00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:04.979
Um. tell you all a bit...
a little bit about myself.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:10.618
Uh. when I was 6 years old.
I was first diagnosed as a hunk.

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.720
And it's been tough.
it's been tough ever since...

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:14.387
- Hey. you're Violet. right?
- Yeah.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.456
Hi. I'm uh. Dax Hanlan.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.925
- Hi.
- ...every girl I go home with

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.695
- has a body pillow.
- I'm from Boston.

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:22.697
And why are they all named
Idris Elba?

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.866
Explain that to
me. Explain that.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.635
- Is this your show?
- The one you're talking through?

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:30.437
- Yeah. it's my show.
- Cool.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.339
Well. I was a uh.
regular at the Comedy Pit.

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.542
back in Boston. and then
Dave's Douchebag of Comedy

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.611
- I did a few times. so...
- That's really... okay just...

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:38.478
yeah. you can message
the show page

00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.615
and I'll throw you up
if we have a spot for you.

00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:43.050
- Awesome. thank you. um.
- That was all I could remember.

00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:45.418
Oh. no. hold on.
This is true.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.722
I was uh. I was driving home
last night

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:51.391
and uh. I went through
a DUI checkpoint. totally sober.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:52.660
Have you ever done this?

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:54.829
Oh my God.
it's the greatest feeling.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:57.632
I've never been
so confident in my life.

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.332
I've never been so confident.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.735
I'm like. "Oh yeah.
I'm turning the radio up.

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:03.037
You'll have to ask
for me to turn it down."

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.437
Wait. can you get...
I was wearing a Polo.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.007
So you book Too Late. right?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.643
And he pulled me out
of the car in a Polo shirt.

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:12.880
- No. I don't book Too Late.
- Aren't you... you're Bob Devore's

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:14.982
- assistant. right?
- Sorry what was it? Dax?

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:17.084
- Yeah. that's it.
- Yeah. I am Bob's assistant.

00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:19.654
but I don't book that show.
I've never booked that show.

00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:21.122
No one will ever book
the show other than Bob.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.623
because according to him.
basically

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:25.760
nobody's good enough to do it.
Okay?

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:27.895
And I don't really know
how things worked at whatever

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:30.430
you know. piss-stained wing hut
you came up in.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.867
but around here.
generally speaking.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.368
the way to get on a show
isn't harassing the booker

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:37.437
of the show during the show.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.973
Got it?

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:41.943
So just message the show page.

00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:44.444
- Okay.
- Right. okay.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.379
These other local hangout
yokels. they're like...

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:49.416
- Fuckin' stuck-up bitch.
- "How do you know my dog?"

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.054
I was like. "I am too high to
be at the bar." This is crazy.

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:54.454
They didn't know my dog.
they just heard me

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.723
talking to my dog.

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:57.925
And then I was like.
"What. what. what. what?

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:00.828
Wh... why are you
talking to my dog?

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.463
Sir. this is a dognapping
in progress.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.533
I'm not having any of it.
Are you kidding?

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:08.603
You're gonna steal
my dog under my watch? No.

00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:10.171
But that's how
human trafficking starts.

00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.589
If you had any idea
how tired I was. you would

00:06:28.623 --> 00:06:30.691
not be making bacon right now.

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:32.927
Hmm. you are a great friend
and roommate. Vi.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.096
but between you and bacon.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.429
bacon wins every time.

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:37.531
Wow.

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:39.600
That is so nice.

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:41.702
Oh. how did TDOC go last night?

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:44.005
Aside from David being
on mushrooms the entire time.

00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:45.606
- it was really good.
- Are you serious?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.908
- Yeah. whole time.
- Is there anything

00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.076
- he won't do on mushrooms?
- No.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.647
God. that lady from TelaVid.
she show up?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.181
- Oh. Donna Rudinsky?
- Yes.

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:57.618
No. she did not come.
but uh. I have sent her office

00:06:57.652 --> 00:06:59.887
so many invites that they
probably think I'm a stalker.

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:03.090
Oh. well. answer me this.

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:05.760
Why do you think people
go to a show?

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:07.995
- To laugh.
- No.

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:10.164
They come to a show because
there's something there.

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:12.733
- What's that?
- They come because you've

00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:14.835
created something of value.

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:16.938
Will you tell that to uh.
the woman who runs Coffee Lust.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:18.706
because she threatens
to shut down my show

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:25.579
- like every other week.
- Yeah. but she hasn't. because?

00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:26.847
- Value.
- Yes!

00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:28.516
- Yes!
- She gets it!

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.885
- Look at that.
- Okay. yes. so value yourself

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.853
- Vi.
- Alright. well. it's not

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.989
- as easy as that. Belinda.
- Mm-mm. no. no. no. no.

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:36.657
Mm-mm. get my name
out of your mouth

00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:38.491
if you're gonna say stuff
like that. okay.

00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:42.495
It's not easy.
but that's how it's done.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.965
Value yourself.

00:07:43.998 --> 00:07:47.735
- Okay. Thank you.
- Mhmm.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.080
- You jumped.
- Uh. the water sloshed.

00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:01.115
You jumped like a gun went off.
Vi.

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.819
- I'm... I'm tired.
- No. No. I'm tired.

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:07.021
I am tired of watching you
slave for this guy

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:08.723
thinking it's gonna
lead anywhere.

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.524
- I don't slave!
- Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:11.892
Do not lie to me today.

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:13.828
Today is bacon day.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.896
Do not ruin it with your lies.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.867
- It's not so bad.
- He's never gonna let you go.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.071
I feel like I'm on an island.

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.140
There's like... there's like
a million bridges off it

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:31.245
you know. but every single one
burns the second I try to leave.

00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:33.948
That job is your whole life.

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:35.583
I can't even remember
the last time

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:39.153
there was any Vi-oriented
penis in this house.

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.855
Oh. well. it...

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:42.757
- It's a drought. okay?
- Okay. easy.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.925
- Yeah.
- There's more to life than...

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.994
Oh. than a boss that only lets
you peek in the party

00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:50.197
but never invites you in?

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:51.732
- Touché. Belinda.
- Yeah.

00:08:51.766 --> 00:08:53.567
- Touché.
- Okay. go.

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:54.869
- I'm going. I'm gone.
- Go scurry off to your phone.

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.837
- Okay.
- Oh. and you're welcome

00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:59.707
- for the bacon. by the way!
- Oh my...

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.176
Alright. cue one.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:06.013
Cue two.

00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:08.983
Next.

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:14.088
What the fuck... Fredo?

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:16.791
- Huh?
- What the fuck is this?

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:18.159
Cue three.

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:20.261
No. the... the blue.
what gel is this?

00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:21.762
Hmm?

00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:23.931
The blue. what gel did you use?

00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:26.033
It's a 60.

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:28.736
No this... mist blue.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:30.805
I asked for a mist blue.

00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:32.706
Yeah. mist blue. this is 60.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.343
No. 61 is mist blue.
60 is no color blue.

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:39.080
You want me to look like
a corpse up here?

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:40.281
My bad. sorry.

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:42.016
Alright. well. switch it out.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:43.717
Corpse anyway.

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:46.987
Oh. I'm glad you could make it.

00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:55.396
Is this what you got?

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:58.132
- Yeah. that's what they had.
- Ugh.

00:09:58.165 --> 00:09:59.867
Alright. look.
if Gina gets upset.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.402
it's your head. not mine.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.304
You got Gina Obispo?

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:04.939
Yeah. she was in town.

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:06.340
Nice get.

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.942
What do you think I do all day?

00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:10.177
Set this up backstage.

00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:12.713
- Fredo.
- Yeah?

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.648
Let's run it again.
uh. this time I'll pretend

00:10:14.682 --> 00:10:16.784
that I don't know
the blues are all fucked up.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:19.353
Yeah. I'll pretend I care.

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:23.124
Oh. and uh.
Violet. don't forget.

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:26.227
dark of the moon.

00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:30.731
I don't know why
but I feel so cosmo tonight.

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:31.999
Cosmopolitan pink.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:33.734
Just add vodka
and I'm ready to drink.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.936
Aw. listen to me going on
about pink martinis with

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.838
and without cherries. here
I am supposed to be watching

00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:39.807
my figure and I tell you I have.
I've been watching it for years

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.908
and I still can't figure out
where it went.

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.343
I know it's inside me somewhere.

00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:43.878
Come out. come out.
wherever you are.

00:10:47.348 --> 00:10:48.849
Hello? Oh. hi.

00:10:48.883 --> 00:10:51.819
- Do you have any ice back here?
- Hm?

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:54.288
I mean I like warm well whiskey
as much as the next lady.

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.389
- I just thought...
- Right.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:57.391
Get lucky
and live like a princess.

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:59.827
You a comic?

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.729
I saw you writing
in that notebook.

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:03.197
No. no. I just... I work for Bob.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.366
- Is he making you take notes?
- No. no. no. no.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.368
this is just something
I'm working on.

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:10.771
Hmm. aren't we all
working on something?

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.306
He's a cocksucker. right?

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.375
I don't...

00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:16.043
It's okay. I won't tell.

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.745
You can admit it. Say it.

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.880
I think it's more like
he just like loves

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:21.482
for the show to be perfect.

00:11:21.516 --> 00:11:24.752
So he's a cocksucker.

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:25.786
Yeah.

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:28.155
Don't worry. uh...

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:30.758
- Violet.
- Violet!

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.293
They all are.

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:34.395
- And you're a comic. so...
- Here she is...

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:35.829
- I gotta go.
- ...Gina Obispo. everybody!

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:39.800
- Be professional.
- Yep. to you.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:45.439
Hey. did you guys know
you can do a bunch of yoga

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:47.241
and still be an asshole?

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:52.746
My husband told me that.
random fact. I know.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.781
And then he said.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:54.949
"It's not a random fact.

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:58.819
I'm telling you to your face.

00:11:58.852 --> 00:11:59.920
You're an asshole."

00:12:02.323 --> 00:12:04.158
- Very intimate.
- Pretty great.

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:05.527
You hear the laughs immediately.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.329
Yeah. this is a treat.

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:10.130
- Thanks for having me.
- Next time better bourbon.

00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:13.100
- Hey. it's the comedian.
- Hey. nice act.

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:15.336
The comedian?

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:16.770
Yeah. we met backstage earlier.

00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:18.939
No. no. this is Violet.
my assistant.

00:12:18.973 --> 00:12:21.842
Oh. are you... you have something
against women comedians?

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:23.877
Me? Never!

00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.513
I had two on the show.
you one of them.

00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:27.281
- Yeah. you're counting them.
- Right? Come on.

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:28.349
On one hand.

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:29.883
He's afraid of the competition.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:31.418
Oh. knock it off.

00:12:31.452 --> 00:12:33.320
Do you need something?

00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:35.089
I was just hoping
maybe I could hang with Gina...

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:37.791
Hey. Bob. be careful
how you treat your assistants.

00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.494
cause they know
where the bodies are buried.

00:12:40.528 --> 00:12:43.497
Well. Violet would never
leave me. would you. Violet?

00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:50.404
No. no. no. in fact. I think you
would probably die without me.

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.443
- Ah. Fredo!
- Uh. sorry.

00:12:56.477 --> 00:12:59.313
I forgot to ask um.
are you going to David's?

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.848
- Oh. right. the cult thing?
- Yeah.

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.317
- Yeah.
- Can I maybe ride with you?

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.052
Sure. yeah. I could use a drink.

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:06.320
- Let's go.
- Oh.

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:07.921
Well. not all the way
to the party.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:10.424
- my apartment's on the way. so.
- So you wanted a...

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.960
- so you wanted a ride home?
- Mhm yeah. but you should go.

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:14.161
- I should?
- Yes.

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:15.829
- Why?
- Because you seem tense.

00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:17.298
No.

00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:19.567
Yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes!

00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.503
Drink. my children!

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:26.073
Drink and become one
with the cosmos!

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:28.242
Ey. Vi's here!

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:31.345
The prophecy has been fulfilled!

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:33.247
Yes.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.349
So your party
is mass suicide-themed?

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:36.850
There's no comedy police. Vi.

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.218
- Only censors.
- Oh.

00:13:38.252 --> 00:13:39.453
Oh shit. that's really good.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:40.854
I gotta... I gotta write that
down.

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:42.289
- Well...
- No. that's good.

00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:44.925
I don't know
if it's writing-down good.

00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:58.506
Ah.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.447
Oh yeah.
look at all that value. Vi.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.454
Ugh!

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:16.457
Ugh.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.460
Oh. congratulations. Violet.
you found a closet.

00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:22.029
- Slash my bedroom.
- Oh. sweet fancy cock.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:25.132
- Hi.
- Hi. Jimmy Rhodes.

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:28.402
- Okay. hi.
- Hi. I rent David's closet.

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:31.271
- Violet.
- Hello.

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:35.677
Uh. it... I know it's small.
but it's also super pathetic.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.446
- So...
- That tickles.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.215
Well. I think we're trapped.

00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:42.983
What? Like existential...

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:45.185
Uh. okay.

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:49.123
- Right.
- Naughty like that.

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:54.228
So um. what do you do
when you're not in your closet?

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:57.097
I uh. I'm a dog walker.

00:14:57.131 --> 00:14:58.932
You're a comedian?

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:01.168
- Yes.
- Uh. okay.

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.170
Now. well.
you're in good company.

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:04.371
Oh. do you do stand-up?

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:06.473
No. but I'm a booker.

00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:07.509
I know.

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:09.309
Then why'd you ask?

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.111
I don't wanna seem desperate.

00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:13.113
Mhm. all right.

00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:14.516
Well. this is where you ask for
a spot

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:17.484
and I tell you
to just message the show page.

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.019
Why would I do that?

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.088
I mean you've never even
seen me perform.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.456
I could be terrible.

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.392
Jimmy Rhodes. thank you.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.729
You're welcome. For what?

00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:29.597
Well. for being
the least desperate person

00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:32.132
I've met in years.

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:37.004
Well. give me a few minutes.

00:15:44.512 --> 00:15:47.147
Uh. just not much further
you can go in Columbus.

00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:48.550
- Ooh.
- Comedy-wise.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:50.184
- Yeah.
- There are like a few clubs

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.554
in the city. but you know.

00:15:52.587 --> 00:15:55.523
mostly you're going up
in between trivia nights

00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:58.492
and music open mics.

00:15:58.526 --> 00:16:00.294
It's pretty much
the same as here.

00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:02.697
Except here you get paid.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.632
- So uh. where are you from?
- Here.

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:06.333
Oh. you saved yourself the trip.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:07.769
- You know. that's why I did it.
- Smart.

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:09.303
Yeah. I came out
and I was just like.

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:11.573
Let's just... yeah.
save on gas for the family.

00:16:11.606 --> 00:16:13.340
Yeah. not a lot of babies
worry about that.

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:14.341
Well. those babies are dumb.

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:16.343
Okay.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:17.444
No.

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:18.613
No.

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:21.148
No. no.

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:24.117
Oh.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.787
I think they're done.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.388
Should probably make your escape

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:29.724
in case they get a second wind.

00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:31.058
Oh. yes.

00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:32.459
Yeah. a third wind.

00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:37.699
Can I uh. can I give you uh.
my number?

00:16:37.732 --> 00:16:40.668
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:47.207
It's R-H-O-D-E-S.

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:48.776
just in case you forget.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.412
Forget all this?

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:54.348
Nuh-uh.

00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:56.049
You know where to find me.

00:16:56.083 --> 00:17:00.588
Goodnight. Jimmy R-H-O-D-E-S.

00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:02.557
Um. goodnight. Violet.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.092
My friends call me "Vi".

00:17:25.547 --> 00:17:28.750
- Hey.
- Jesus!

00:17:28.783 --> 00:17:30.117
People should wear
fucking bells.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.620
What's your problem?

00:17:32.654 --> 00:17:35.557
You don't remember me?

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.257
Lance something?

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:39.326
Dax!

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.295
- Dax from Boston.
- Okay.

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.162
Alright. Dax.

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:43.263
Good night. Dax.

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:45.499
Hey. where are you going?

00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.200
I'm going home. it's late.

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:49.303
No. it's not.

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:50.337
Yes. it is.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.139
- No.
- Okay. stop.

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.609
- Look. it's early.
- Okay.

00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:57.812
You don't think I'm good enough
for your show. hmm?

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.882
- Stop. give me the keys.
- Mm-mm.

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:03.417
I'm gonna show you
how good I am.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.451
You don't want this.

00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:05.520
No.

00:18:05.553 --> 00:18:06.453
You really don't.

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:07.589
I really do.

00:18:07.622 --> 00:18:08.590
Please stop.

00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:10.290
Please. okay. please. stop.

00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:11.258
I want it.

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.493
- Too Late.
- Hm?

00:18:13.528 --> 00:18:17.397
I can... I can book you
on Too Late.

00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.733
Are you fuckin' with me?

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:21.134
Come on!
That's what I'm talking about.

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:25.238
Okay. just come
to the next show.

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:26.406
You'll be ready for me?

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.344
Oh yeah. I'll be ready.

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:31.345
I'll see you then.

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.715
Okay.

00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:34.882
Too Late.

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:37.685
- Too Late.
- Hm?

00:18:51.666 --> 00:18:53.534
This... uh. I read this
really interesting fact today.

00:18:53.568 --> 00:18:56.904
I read that. uh.
more soldiers in the Civil War

00:18:56.938 --> 00:18:59.306
died from diarrhea

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:01.208
than from actual war wounds.

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.443
That's true.
Isn't that interesting?

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:05.312
Yeah. I was reading about it.

00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:10.217
because I am
a huge diarrhea buff.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.587
You ever seen
Ken Burn's diarrhea?

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.788
18 hours...

00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:15.890
- The iPhone started...
- Boo.

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:17.792
- Ah!
- What is this?

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:19.694
No. give it back. Dax.
those are mine.

00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:21.261
I said give it back!

00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:22.597
- Are these your jokes?
- Dax. stop.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.332
- I said give it back!
- Sh!

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.300
You're Bob Devore.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:30.805
I'm Dax Hanlan from Boston.

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:34.341
This is the comic I was.
uh. telling you about.

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:38.646
The new talent
you wanted me to find.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.451
Well. enjoy the show. Dax.

00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:46.554
Knock 'em dead. pops.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.554
Hey. Bob?

00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:20.588
Come in.

00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:23.925
Hey.

00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.860
Bob. you remember Dax?

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:29.296
Right.

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:31.431
See you in a couple of days.
Bob.

00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:33.467
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.004
You wanna stay
and uh. party with us?

00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:43.644
Ah. I wouldn't wanna
keep Bob waiting.

00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:45.613
Thanks. babe.

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:53.654
It's a pretty good show.

00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:55.556
I mean I thought the juggler
was a little bit faggy.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:01.394
- but it's your shit. right?
- It's not for everybody.

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.641
Dude.

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:17.377
I cannot believe
I'm about to rail lines

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.446
with Bob fucking Devore.

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:22.315
It's unbelievable.

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:27.688
You know. not to tell you how
to do your business or anything.

00:21:27.722 --> 00:21:31.092
but you gotta get yourself
a new assistant. dude.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.627
I mean she's a hot piece of ass
and everything.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.363
but she is way too stuck up.

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:37.698
What the fuck?

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:38.666
What the hell?

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:39.534
Come on. man!

00:21:39.567 --> 00:21:40.968
What the hell?

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.939
You keep the cocaine.
You can keep the cocaine.

00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:48.042
- I don't care!
- Goodbye. Dax.

00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:49.476
No!

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.344
No!

00:21:51.378 --> 00:21:52.345
No!

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:03.958
Fredo. I got soda!

00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:05.458
They didn't have
that cactus thing you like.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.094
but I got a Japanese one.

00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:10.430
Looked it up and it stands
for happy pineapple.

00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:13.668
How fun is that?

00:22:16.904 --> 00:22:18.940
Okay. Fredo?

00:22:18.973 --> 00:22:21.441
Fredo. popcorn machine is down.

00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:24.011
Above my pay grade.

00:22:24.045 --> 00:22:27.548
Hey. Fredo.
can you help me with this?

00:22:27.582 --> 00:22:28.649
I don't know
what any of it means.

00:22:28.683 --> 00:22:30.084
- Fredo!
- He's out.

00:22:30.117 --> 00:22:34.121
Ah! Bob. I thought
you were still recovering.

00:22:34.155 --> 00:22:37.390
Dax wasn't much of a meal.

00:22:37.424 --> 00:22:39.459
It's been like three days.

00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:42.462
It was like eating air.

00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:43.931
You're making me nervous.
Violet.

00:22:43.965 --> 00:22:45.766
Oh. I'm making you nervous?

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.467
I can make things happen
for you.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.971
- but only if you do your job.
- I am doing my job!

00:22:50.004 --> 00:22:52.840
I drove all the way to Ontario
last week to scout talent.

00:22:52.874 --> 00:22:56.110
- And what did you find?
- It was Ontario.

00:22:56.143 --> 00:22:58.846
You went into this
with open eyes. Violet.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.582
We could have ended it
right there. but you agreed.

00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:04.619
You've got four weeks
till the dark of the moon.

00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:06.687
I've been patient with you.
Violet.

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:08.990
Don't test me.

00:23:24.138 --> 00:23:30.978
Listen. when you get inside.
please do me a favor...

00:23:31.012 --> 00:23:36.050
Wait. is that Violet Fields?

00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:49.664
Hey. Vi.

00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:50.865
Jimmy.

00:23:50.898 --> 00:23:53.801
Rhodes. R-H-O-D-E-S.

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:55.002
Uh. how is the show going?

00:23:55.036 --> 00:23:56.237
Oh. it's about to start. so...

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.772
Right. yeah.

00:23:57.805 --> 00:23:59.807
So you come to beg for a spot?

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.175
Yep. I'm the worst.

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:02.810
Hey. are you coming in or what?

00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:04.512
Hey. yeah. give me one sec.

00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:05.947
Oh no. I... if you're busy.
I can just go away.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.716
No. no. Violet's never too busy
for her friends.

00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:10.217
- This is Jimmy.
- Hello. Jimmy.

00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:12.653
We met at David's. you know.
mass suicide party.

00:24:12.687 --> 00:24:15.957
- Oh. that's nice.
- Um. sorry.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.527
So I just give them
the one-minute light.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.895
- What?
- When I'm running the show

00:24:20.928 --> 00:24:26.100
tonight.
so you can have a break.

00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:28.069
God damn it.

00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:29.937
I'm sorry I... I gotta get that.

00:24:29.971 --> 00:24:33.507
- No. I've got it.
- Violet!

00:24:33.541 --> 00:24:35.609
Hi. this is Violet.
please leave a message.

00:24:35.643 --> 00:24:38.646
- Pick up the phone!
- He hung up.

00:24:38.679 --> 00:24:42.283
Well. you have the night off.
do you wanna go get food?

00:24:42.316 --> 00:24:45.286
Yeah. Vi. do you?

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:48.556
I...

00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:57.932
You know what? Fuck Bob.

00:24:57.965 --> 00:24:59.133
- Yeah. yeah!
- Yeah!

00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:00.868
Fuck Bob.

00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:02.903
Is fuck Bob a "yes"?

00:25:02.937 --> 00:25:04.205
- Yeah.
- Cool.

00:25:04.238 --> 00:25:06.073
- Okay. yeah.
- Cool.

00:25:06.107 --> 00:25:07.808
Yeah. yeah. okay. go.
Get out of here.

00:25:07.842 --> 00:25:08.943
Get out of here.

00:25:08.976 --> 00:25:10.211
- He'll call.
- Bye. bye.

00:25:10.244 --> 00:25:14.281
- Thank you.
- Have fun!

00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:16.317
God. I hope she remembers
how to use that thing.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.019
Yeah. are we ready to start?
Where's Vi?

00:25:18.052 --> 00:25:22.757
Mm. she's not coming.
she is on a date.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.293
- Really?
- Yes. really.

00:25:26.327 --> 00:25:29.296
Are you on shrooms right now?

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.965
No.

00:25:30.998 --> 00:25:33.868
Not as far as you know.

00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:35.903
It's good enough.

00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:40.775
Fuck it.

00:25:40.808 --> 00:25:42.276
So uh. how's the old closet?

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:45.279
All right. it keeps me
off the streets. okay?

00:25:45.312 --> 00:25:48.215
Uh. I am looking for
like a nicer place.

00:25:48.249 --> 00:25:52.887
but uh. I don't know. you know?

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.022
No. I do not know. What?

00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:58.225
Right. um. my friend got me
this writing job uh.

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:02.163
in New York on an award show
and once that was over.

00:26:02.196 --> 00:26:04.832
I was like.
"Well. I have this one sort of

00:26:04.865 --> 00:26:07.134
tenuous connection
to this place.

00:26:07.168 --> 00:26:09.203
What I should probably do
is move

00:26:09.236 --> 00:26:11.172
to the other side
of the country

00:26:11.205 --> 00:26:12.907
where I have no connections

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.241
and know absolutely no one."

00:26:14.275 --> 00:26:15.910
That's a great plan.

00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:19.213
People often say.
"You can plan real well."

00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:21.215
Okay. but you know. David.

00:26:21.248 --> 00:26:22.917
Does anyone really know David?

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.819
- Mm.
- Yeah.

00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:26.987
You know me.

00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:30.057
That I do.

00:26:30.091 --> 00:26:31.692
- Thanks for dinner.
- Oh.

00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.860
I really should have paid.

00:26:32.893 --> 00:26:34.228
I was the one who invited you.

00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:36.397
Jimmy. you live in a closet.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.698
You're funny. Violet.

00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:39.166
Mm.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.835
I wasn't being
like condescending.

00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:44.138
It... that was
like an admission of envy.

00:26:44.171 --> 00:26:47.675
- Envy?
- I've just never really met

00:26:47.708 --> 00:26:52.046
anybody like you before.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:00.888
So why are you booking
but not performing?

00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:06.260
Uh. why am I...
I mean you know. life costs.

00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:08.095
I needed a job. and Bob offered.

00:27:08.129 --> 00:27:11.765
and I couldn't say no.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:14.001
Right. but not even
on your own show?

00:27:14.034 --> 00:27:16.170
Well. it'd be a conflict
of interest.

00:27:16.203 --> 00:27:18.305
The entire reason
people start shows

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:20.908
is so they can book themselves
on said show.

00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:23.277
- Okay. well...
- So. it's a real racket.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.449
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:31.051
Mm. you know. I think...

00:27:31.085 --> 00:27:33.254
I think we all like start out

00:27:33.287 --> 00:27:37.358
with this idea of like
what we think we wanna be.

00:27:37.391 --> 00:27:42.830
but we end up
just being what we are.

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:48.169
- Do you like ice cream?
- I like ice cream.

00:27:48.202 --> 00:27:50.204
Okay. great. I'm just loaded...

00:27:50.237 --> 00:27:52.039
- You are...
- With dog-walking money.

00:27:52.072 --> 00:27:55.276
And it's absolutely
burning a hole in my pocket.

00:27:55.309 --> 00:27:56.844
Good show. man. that was fun.

00:27:56.877 --> 00:27:58.479
- Uh. yeah. yeah.
- You did great!

00:27:58.513 --> 00:27:59.914
Well. thank you so much
for helping.

00:27:59.947 --> 00:28:01.148
I'll see you later.

00:28:01.182 --> 00:28:04.185
Bye!

00:28:17.798 --> 00:28:18.899
No.

00:28:18.933 --> 00:28:22.436
No. no. no. no.

00:28:29.109 --> 00:28:31.946
Oh shit.

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:33.447
This is me.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.481
Yep.

00:28:34.516 --> 00:28:36.984
Scene of the crime.

00:28:37.017 --> 00:28:38.052
What?

00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:38.953
I don't know.

00:28:38.986 --> 00:28:41.288
I just said it.

00:28:41.322 --> 00:28:45.960
Okay.

00:28:45.993 --> 00:28:48.162
Uh.

00:28:50.364 --> 00:28:52.199
- Thank you for dinner.
- Thank you for ice cream.

00:28:52.233 --> 00:28:55.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:28:55.836 --> 00:28:57.071
Why don't you just go do it?

00:28:57.104 --> 00:29:00.074
Hey. Jimmy.

00:29:11.952 --> 00:29:14.154
Can I tell you something
I've never told anyone

00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:16.090
this soon after meeting them?

00:29:16.123 --> 00:29:18.459
Okay.

00:29:18.492 --> 00:29:22.930
I wanna book you on my show.

00:29:22.963 --> 00:29:25.332
And you just tell me like that?

00:29:25.366 --> 00:29:26.800
- I'm so...
- I just thought

00:29:26.834 --> 00:29:28.202
- it would be special.
- I know.

00:29:28.235 --> 00:29:29.970
- The first time with...
- Right.

00:29:30.004 --> 00:29:32.139
- ...candles or music or...
- I... yeah. I thought lots of

00:29:32.172 --> 00:29:35.442
like harps and doves. but it's
just it's happening so fast.

00:29:35.476 --> 00:29:37.378
- Okay. Yes. I...
- You wanna do it?

00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:38.479
- Yes. I'd like to do it.
- You wanna do it?

00:29:38.513 --> 00:29:43.884
Yes. thank you. I'm flattered.

00:29:43.917 --> 00:29:46.820
Okay.

00:29:46.854 --> 00:29:48.055
Oh God.

00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:49.957
Brace yourself!

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.125
Andy!

00:29:51.158 --> 00:29:52.860
I'm so sorry.

00:29:52.893 --> 00:29:54.495
- I'm sorry. I just...
- You almost got a face full

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:57.064
- of key. dude.
- Oh. I... hey.

00:29:57.097 --> 00:30:00.434
- I didn't mean to uh...
- What do you want?

00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:03.137
Is uh. Death of Comedy
still going on?

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.005
No. it ended.

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:08.075
Damn it.

00:30:08.108 --> 00:30:10.277
What are you doing right now?

00:30:10.311 --> 00:30:12.212
I'm going to bed.

00:30:12.246 --> 00:30:13.380
Okay.

00:30:13.414 --> 00:30:15.482
Alright. I just... can I...

00:30:15.517 --> 00:30:18.886
can I ask you...

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:21.288
Yeah. can I... a word.

00:30:21.322 --> 00:30:22.624
Just a word.

00:30:22.657 --> 00:30:25.359
Um. just in the spirit
of trying harder

00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:28.095
can um... Did Violet ever say

00:30:28.128 --> 00:30:29.229
- they were putting on Too Late?
- Good night. Andy.

00:30:29.263 --> 00:30:31.465
I just...

00:30:34.168 --> 00:30:35.903
Okay. cool.

00:30:35.936 --> 00:30:37.938
- This is a sweet ride.
- Good night.

00:30:37.971 --> 00:30:39.406
- Oh. okay. all right.
- Bye.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.143
Okay. okay!

00:30:43.177 --> 00:30:46.313
Fuck it.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.040
Good morning.

00:31:47.074 --> 00:31:48.543
Morning.

00:31:48.576 --> 00:31:51.078
I'm just gonna borrow a bag.

00:31:51.111 --> 00:31:55.315
You owe me for last night.

00:31:55.349 --> 00:31:58.553
Oh!

00:31:58.586 --> 00:32:02.990
Oh. I basically quit my job!

00:32:03.023 --> 00:32:05.392
But was he nice?

00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:11.265
Oh my God. you are
blushing right now. Violet!

00:32:11.298 --> 00:32:13.300
- He is nice!
- Stop!

00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:15.703
- Yes.
- Go away.

00:32:15.737 --> 00:32:19.306
Someone got some last night!

00:32:19.339 --> 00:32:20.307
Oh my God.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.976
Oh um. excuse me. Mrs. Rhodes...

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.512
- You're... what are we 12?
- I'm just gonna borrow

00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:26.648
- this bag real quick.
- All right. take the bag.

00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:28.115
- Get out.
- Did he have soft lips?

00:32:28.148 --> 00:32:30.350
I'm done.

00:32:32.386 --> 00:32:34.054
Hey. Bob?

00:32:41.128 --> 00:32:42.764
Bob?

00:32:47.602 --> 00:32:49.303
Hey Bob?

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.242
Bob.

00:32:57.177 --> 00:32:59.614
It's Violet.

00:33:39.787 --> 00:33:43.825
Ah!

00:33:58.238 --> 00:34:00.775
I know I look terrible.

00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:03.410
I've just never seen you
this soon after eating.

00:34:03.443 --> 00:34:05.647
Where were you?

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.381
I'm sorry. I should have called.

00:34:07.414 --> 00:34:08.516
- I just...
- Look. don't apologize.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.552
it turns my stomach.

00:34:10.585 --> 00:34:16.189
Bob. who'd you eat?

00:34:16.223 --> 00:34:19.326
Some open-miker
in Glassell Park.

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.729
No talent at all. but a lot
of well bourbon and nicotine.

00:34:21.763 --> 00:34:23.363
and my head's killing me.

00:34:23.397 --> 00:34:25.132
No.
there's got to be another way.

00:34:25.165 --> 00:34:26.300
There's no other way.

00:34:26.333 --> 00:34:27.702
Look. you have resources!

00:34:27.735 --> 00:34:29.604
We can figure it out!

00:34:29.637 --> 00:34:30.838
No. I'm not good with money.

00:34:30.872 --> 00:34:32.272
Uh. after all
the years of performing.

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:34.441
- you haven't saved up anything?
- No.

00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:36.343
Uh. how old are you?

00:34:36.376 --> 00:34:37.411
What do you want from me?

00:34:37.444 --> 00:34:38.646
I'm an entertainer.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.147
You know what?
Here's what I think.

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.249
Look.
you're not supposed to think!

00:34:42.282 --> 00:34:45.252
You're supposed to feed me!
That's it!

00:34:45.285 --> 00:34:50.257
I told you a million times.
it's all about trust.

00:34:57.732 --> 00:35:01.201
Look. just... just do your job.

00:35:06.306 --> 00:35:08.676
I'm looking for comfortable
shoes that won't make me look

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.712
like a biblical character.

00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:13.715
I went shoe shopping
and I told the sales person.

00:35:13.748 --> 00:35:15.917
I was like. "I'm looking
for some comfortable shoes."

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.385
This lady brought out
the most hideous-looking shoes.

00:35:18.418 --> 00:35:21.689
I was like. "Oh. hell no."
I am not trying to be

00:35:21.723 --> 00:35:25.192
one of Tracy Chapman's
backup dancers.

00:35:25.225 --> 00:35:26.794
Those are birth-control shoes.

00:35:26.828 --> 00:35:29.631
I'll never get laid
in those shoes.

00:35:29.664 --> 00:35:31.566
Someone will ask me.
"Girl. are you on the pill?"

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:32.700
I'll be like. "Nope.

00:35:32.734 --> 00:35:35.737
but I got on some Birkenstocks!"

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.272
No sperm can penetrate these.

00:35:39.306 --> 00:35:40.808
Hey. here he is.

00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:42.510
Finally fucked
his way to the top.

00:35:42.543 --> 00:35:44.545
Oh. it's too late
to turn back now.

00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:46.279
Yeah. you just remember whose
closet it all started in.

00:35:46.313 --> 00:35:48.248
- you little skank!
- Sh!

00:35:48.281 --> 00:35:49.483
I was just calling him a skank.

00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:50.484
- I know.
- It wasn't heckling.

00:35:50.518 --> 00:35:51.519
- I know.
- I was like.

00:35:51.552 --> 00:35:53.286
"It's only been two years."

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.889
How much wear
and tear did you think

00:35:54.922 --> 00:35:58.626
I was gonna go through in
a two-year period. you know?

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.394
And I had to think you know.
when I was at a party

00:36:00.427 --> 00:36:02.462
and I saw her. did she turn
to her friends. and say.

00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:03.731
"You know what?
In two years. that bitch

00:36:03.765 --> 00:36:06.934
is gonna look like Yoda."

00:36:06.968 --> 00:36:09.436
"In two years. she's gonna look
like a Forever-21 dress

00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:11.806
after the first washing."

00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:13.407
Nothing but threads and rags.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.710
that's all she's gonna be
in the end.

00:36:15.743 --> 00:36:16.711
That's my time.

00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:19.647
Thank you.

00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:21.314
Uh. what can I say
about your next performer?

00:36:21.348 --> 00:36:22.917
He's hilarious uh.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.820
and I can also say as his
roommate. he's very tidy.

00:36:25.853 --> 00:36:28.422
So please give a warm
Death of Comedy welcome

00:36:28.455 --> 00:36:30.591
to Jimmy Rhodes.
ladies and gents.

00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:38.666
I like going to uh. 7-Eleven
at like 2 in the morning.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.868
cause you get to see
things there

00:36:40.902 --> 00:36:43.370
you don't get to see
anywhere else.

00:36:43.403 --> 00:36:46.841
Like I was at 7-Eleven.
2 in the morning.

00:36:46.874 --> 00:36:51.746
Also. there was a woman
who was very. very obese.

00:36:51.779 --> 00:36:54.247
Now. I am not including

00:36:54.281 --> 00:36:56.818
that detail to make fun of her.

00:36:56.851 --> 00:36:58.820
I am including that detail.

00:36:58.853 --> 00:37:01.656
because she was also
wearing a t-shirt

00:37:01.689 --> 00:37:04.959
that said on it "No fat chicks".

00:37:04.992 --> 00:37:07.294
This lady fucking rules. man.

00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:10.363
This is the best lady.
because she is going out

00:37:10.397 --> 00:37:14.468
at a time of night when people
are most likely to be stoned

00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:16.738
and she is blowing their minds.

00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:18.806
- He's good. he's good.
- Because she's gonna be there

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.374
- and like they're gonna look...
- Yeah. he is.

00:37:21.408 --> 00:37:22.643
...and then they'll look up.
and she'll be like...

00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:24.277
- I hate him.
- "And yet here I am."

00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:26.346
Not like you know.
not like as a person. but.

00:37:26.379 --> 00:37:28.049
- Ooh. I hate him.
- Also. when she wears

00:37:28.082 --> 00:37:30.551
that shirt.
it becomes empowering.

00:37:30.585 --> 00:37:32.319
Like it should have
a comma on it.

00:37:32.352 --> 00:37:34.021
Like no comma.

00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:36.323
Fat chicks.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.595
- Uh. I uh...
- Hey. how are you?

00:37:40.628 --> 00:37:42.897
I get super... I get super nervous

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.033
to have sex
with like a new lady.

00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:47.935
Not... the sex sounds good.
I'm just afraid

00:37:47.969 --> 00:37:49.937
- of like being made a fool.
- What are you doing here?

00:37:49.971 --> 00:37:52.305
- Like I'm worried...
- Your show is so great

00:37:52.339 --> 00:37:54.675
that you're turning away
paying customers?

00:37:54.709 --> 00:37:56.611
- It's free.
- And I'll be like. "Yeah!"

00:37:56.644 --> 00:37:58.345
- Do you need something?
- "Look at me go."

00:37:58.378 --> 00:37:59.580
No. I've never seen
your show before.

00:37:59.614 --> 00:38:03.350
so I thought I'd check it out.

00:38:03.383 --> 00:38:06.721
Yeah. but this is like just kind
of like my thing.

00:38:06.754 --> 00:38:09.557
Yeah. don't worry.
I'll keep a low profile.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.060
It turns out though.
it's actually super easy to tell

00:38:13.094 --> 00:38:15.696
if a woman is faking her orgasm.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:22.103
If during her orgasm a woman
is sexy. she is faking it.

00:38:22.136 --> 00:38:25.706
That is not what
that looks like.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.376
If she's like. "Oh. Jesus.
baby." Get out of here.

00:38:29.409 --> 00:38:32.513
What am I. 12.
I'm gonna fall for that?

00:38:32.547 --> 00:38:34.916
But if she's like. "Blah".

00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:37.985
Then it's like. "Yes! Yes!

00:38:38.019 --> 00:38:41.923
Call my therapist.
I'm not coming in this week.

00:38:41.956 --> 00:38:43.558
Alright. I'm done.
Thanks a lot. guys.

00:38:47.494 --> 00:38:49.096
Jimmy Rhodes.
killing it like a pro

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.998
on his first TDOC appearance.
Good act!

00:38:51.032 --> 00:38:53.568
- Hey. great set.
- Oh. Bob Devore.

00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:56.504
- Oh. thank you.
- It was great.

00:38:56.537 --> 00:38:58.039
How come you haven't told me
about Jimmy before?

00:38:58.072 --> 00:39:00.074
We gotta get him on the show.

00:39:00.107 --> 00:39:02.375
Um. I...

00:39:02.409 --> 00:39:03.644
We're booked for months out...

00:39:03.678 --> 00:39:04.779
Nah. we'll make room.

00:39:04.812 --> 00:39:05.580
Yeah. we've got
to snatch him up

00:39:05.613 --> 00:39:08.415
before somebody else does.
right?

00:39:08.448 --> 00:39:09.482
Ah. you're in luck. folks.

00:39:09.517 --> 00:39:10.450
You came on a good night.

00:39:10.483 --> 00:39:13.020
We got a special guest
dropping in tonight.

00:39:13.054 --> 00:39:17.725
Give a big. warm. TDOC welcome
to Mr. Bob Devore.

00:39:17.758 --> 00:39:18.759
Yeah!

00:39:20.828 --> 00:39:22.096
Holy shit.

00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:24.866
Bob Devore just booked me
on his show.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.602
Holy shit.

00:39:27.635 --> 00:39:29.737
Well. nobody can accuse you
of nepotism.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.639
I was driving home last night
and I went...

00:39:31.672 --> 00:39:32.439
Good job. man.

00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:33.406
Hey. what the fuck
are you doing?

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.109
- What? He had a good set.
- You put Bob up.

00:39:35.142 --> 00:39:36.611
you didn't even ask me.
it's my show. David...

00:39:36.644 --> 00:39:37.745
Well. what did you want me
to tell him?

00:39:37.778 --> 00:39:38.746
Message the show page?

00:39:38.779 --> 00:39:41.716
- Hey. what's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

00:39:41.749 --> 00:39:45.019
I was like. "Yeah.
I'll turn the radio up."

00:39:46.621 --> 00:39:48.856
Ah. come on.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:50.091
Anyway. it's great to be here

00:39:50.124 --> 00:39:53.127
in this. um. tiny little place.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.695
Haven't been on stage
in a place like this

00:39:54.729 --> 00:39:55.763
in a long time. but...

00:39:55.796 --> 00:39:57.698
Hey. Jimmy. this is Violet.

00:39:57.732 --> 00:39:59.634
About Bob's show.
I'm so sorry.

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:01.836
I just was... we're...

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:03.504
We're just not gonna be able
to fit you in.

00:40:03.537 --> 00:40:05.740
Bob wants what he wants
when he wants.

00:40:05.773 --> 00:40:07.508
but then reality sets in

00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:12.546
and I got
to come be the bad guy.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.049
I'm so sorry.
We'll keep trying. though.

00:40:15.082 --> 00:40:18.119
I promise.
We'll get you on eventually.

00:40:18.152 --> 00:40:19.921
Okay. I'm really sorry. Jimmy.

00:40:19.954 --> 00:40:21.155
- Hi. need some help?
- No. I'm good.

00:40:21.188 --> 00:40:22.790
but I got your pudding cups.

00:40:22.823 --> 00:40:24.825
- Right there.
- Oh. sweet!

00:40:24.859 --> 00:40:26.661
Yes. I got you chocolate.

00:40:26.694 --> 00:40:28.229
- Thank you. Vi.
- You're welcome.

00:40:28.262 --> 00:40:31.132
I swear. you are doing
God's work.

00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:33.668
Wow. you're just a little ray
of sunshine today.

00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:34.902
- Got my pudding.
- Yeah.

00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:37.470
- Bob's in a good mood.
- Bob's never in a good mood.

00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:40.841
- Well. Donna's coming tonight.
- Donna Rudinsky from TelVid?

00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:42.176
Like. not her assistant?

00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:43.811
Like the actual
Vice President of Production

00:40:43.844 --> 00:40:45.846
from the network
is coming to our show tonight?

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.014
- Tonight.
- I've been trying

00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:48.616
to meet with her for years.

00:40:48.649 --> 00:40:49.684
Please don't make him mad. Vi.

00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:52.119
I mean. if Bob's not happy.
nobody's happy.

00:40:58.926 --> 00:41:00.861
Hey. Donna's coming tonight?

00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:02.596
Oh. yeah. yeah.
I meant to tell you.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.932
I'll introduce you
if I get a chance.

00:41:04.966 --> 00:41:06.867
Bob?

00:41:06.901 --> 00:41:08.736
- Hey. Vi.
- Yeah. I asked Jimmy to come by

00:41:08.769 --> 00:41:10.738
a little early
so I can show him around.

00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:12.573
There's a lot of history here.

00:41:12.606 --> 00:41:16.243
A lot of things have gone on
behind these walls. right?

00:41:16.277 --> 00:41:18.612
Yeah. I'm gonna put
Jimmy up tonight.

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:20.681
I'll make room between acts.

00:41:20.715 --> 00:41:23.250
- Can I help you with those?
- Oh. no. no. She's okay.

00:41:23.284 --> 00:41:25.086
Aren't you. Vi?

00:41:27.188 --> 00:41:28.155
Oh. yeah.

00:41:28.189 --> 00:41:30.558
I actually love spending money
I do not have

00:41:30.591 --> 00:41:31.759
on things that I do not need.
though.

00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:33.861
I love. uh. when you go
to a coffee shop

00:41:33.894 --> 00:41:36.797
and the coffee
is seven dollars.

00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:38.532
I'm like. "Okay.
ta. ta. ta. ta. ta.

00:41:38.566 --> 00:41:39.567
Oh. a latte is seven dollars.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.868
Okay. ta. ta. ta. ta. ta."

00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:42.603
"Oh. hi. Donna Rudinsky.

00:41:42.636 --> 00:41:43.537
Violet Fields.

00:41:43.571 --> 00:41:44.538
Great to meet you."

00:41:44.572 --> 00:41:46.207
Why not make it nine?

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.975
Why not make it nine?
How about...

00:41:48.009 --> 00:41:51.212
- Thanks for the intro. Bob.
- ...I exchange my life

00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:54.715
for this hot. darkened water

00:41:54.749 --> 00:41:57.685
because. you know. uh.
existence is a liability

00:41:57.718 --> 00:41:59.253
and being is profitless
in the first place.

00:41:59.286 --> 00:42:01.555
am I right. millennials?

00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:03.057
- Oh!
- Hey.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.626
Just watching the audience?

00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:07.028
Yep.

00:42:08.229 --> 00:42:11.098
I love seeing their faces.

00:42:11.132 --> 00:42:13.801
Like. when you're up there.

00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:17.138
it's like looking over
the edge of a cliff

00:42:17.171 --> 00:42:18.873
with laughs coming out of it.

00:42:18.906 --> 00:42:22.076
...anymore.
I'm not calling you.

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:23.811
Okay. all right. all right.

00:42:23.844 --> 00:42:27.114
You know it's all
because of you. Vi.

00:42:27.148 --> 00:42:29.817
I'm only here because of you.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:33.187
I saw your next act perform
in a small little coffee shop.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.089
but you're really gonna love him

00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:36.957
because this kid
is going places.

00:42:36.991 --> 00:42:39.827
Ladies and gentlemen.
here's Jimmy Rhodes!

00:42:46.033 --> 00:42:48.102
I have. like.
a very specific haircut.

00:42:48.135 --> 00:42:49.837
and the first time
I told the lady

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.973
who cuts my hair
what I wanted.

00:42:53.007 --> 00:42:55.342
she was like. "Oh. yeah.
yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

00:42:55.376 --> 00:42:58.112
Uh. you mean the young Hitler?"

00:42:58.145 --> 00:43:01.348
And I was like.
"I don't think I do.

00:43:01.382 --> 00:43:04.285
I don't think
I'm ever going to mean

00:43:04.318 --> 00:43:06.253
the young Hitler."

00:43:06.287 --> 00:43:09.023
As if my problem with Hitler
was his age.

00:43:09.056 --> 00:43:10.891
Like. oh. I don't want
to look like

00:43:10.925 --> 00:43:12.860
some old. busted Hitler.

00:43:12.893 --> 00:43:14.028
No. no. no.

00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:16.297
Like a young Hitler. yeah.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.934
Like a hip. fresh. cool Hitler.

00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:22.002
Back when he was
still painting all the time

00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:26.140
and he was like... just like
mixed on the Jews. you know?

00:43:26.173 --> 00:43:30.644
Uh. I like to go to 7-Eleven
late at night

00:43:30.678 --> 00:43:33.714
because it is
a singular experience.

00:43:35.015 --> 00:43:36.684
- Great show. Fredo.
- Thanks.

00:43:36.717 --> 00:43:38.052
Hope Donna liked it.

00:43:38.085 --> 00:43:40.154
- Did you get to meet her?
- Nah.

00:43:40.187 --> 00:43:41.255
Oh. that's a drag.

00:43:41.288 --> 00:43:42.957
Next time. right?

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.959
Next time.

00:43:44.992 --> 00:43:47.294
- Night. Fredo.
- Goodnight.

00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:54.268
Hey. Jimmy?

00:44:04.311 --> 00:44:06.814
Jimmy?

00:44:06.847 --> 00:44:08.082
Jimmy?

00:44:15.322 --> 00:44:17.024
Jimmy?

00:44:18.125 --> 00:44:19.927
Jimmy! Jimmy!

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.428
Jimmy!

00:44:21.462 --> 00:44:22.863
Okay.

00:44:24.098 --> 00:44:25.466
Jimmy!

00:44:25.499 --> 00:44:26.734
Violet?

00:44:26.767 --> 00:44:28.302
Hey. here she is.

00:44:29.837 --> 00:44:31.906
- Donna. this is Violet.
- Oh. hi.

00:44:31.939 --> 00:44:33.340
Violet. Donna Rudinsky.

00:44:33.374 --> 00:44:34.808
Were you on the show?

00:44:34.842 --> 00:44:36.243
I feel like we've met.

00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:38.112
No. no. no.
Violet is my assistant.

00:44:38.145 --> 00:44:39.813
Oh. you and your assistants.

00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:42.249
Oh. whatever happened to. uh.
what was her name?

00:44:42.283 --> 00:44:44.318
- Uh. Erica?
- No.

00:44:44.351 --> 00:44:45.953
Uh. Lorrie?

00:44:45.986 --> 00:44:47.888
- Corrie?
- Ah. that's it. that's it.

00:44:47.922 --> 00:44:49.256
You remind me so much of her.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.892
- Oh. really?
- Whatever happened to Corrie?

00:44:51.926 --> 00:44:53.360
Well. don't look at me.

00:44:53.394 --> 00:44:57.364
In this town. people come.
people go.

00:44:57.398 --> 00:45:00.734
Well. you know. actually.
Violet is a producer. too.

00:45:00.768 --> 00:45:02.136
Oh. you produce Too Late?

00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:03.938
No. No. no. no.

00:45:03.971 --> 00:45:06.807
No. I produce. like.
I have a show at a coffee shop.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.410
Well. the variety format
is ripe for a reboot

00:45:09.443 --> 00:45:12.179
- and Too Late is going to slay.
- Oh. right.

00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:17.184
Wait. you're making Too Late
into a TV show?

00:45:17.218 --> 00:45:19.286
A pilot. for development.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.323
And Bob wants me
to be one of the writers.

00:45:23.991 --> 00:45:26.026
Isn't that great?

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.530
- Look at her. she's in shock.
- I'm sorry.

00:45:28.563 --> 00:45:30.064
She's been working on the show
for so many years.

00:45:30.097 --> 00:45:30.931
she forgot what it's like

00:45:30.965 --> 00:45:33.100
to be where the action is.
you know?

00:45:33.133 --> 00:45:34.501
Don't worry. you'll be
right by my side.

00:45:34.536 --> 00:45:37.438
assisting me
every step of the way.

00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:41.775
- Yeah.
- Every step.

00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:43.844
We're all gonna be rich.

00:45:43.877 --> 00:45:45.379
David. you're already rich.

00:45:45.412 --> 00:45:47.381
Yeah. but now you guys
are gonna be rich too.

00:45:47.414 --> 00:45:49.116
- It's been lonely.
- To the immediate

00:45:49.149 --> 00:45:51.852
and lasting wealth
we will all get

00:45:51.885 --> 00:45:53.787
from this one single pilot.

00:45:53.821 --> 00:45:54.922
Hear! hear!

00:45:54.955 --> 00:45:56.023
Yes!

00:45:56.056 --> 00:45:56.857
What's the matter. Vi?

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.359
You're not excited
to ride your...

00:45:58.392 --> 00:46:01.061
your soon-to-be-rich-and-famous
man's coattails?

00:46:01.095 --> 00:46:02.429
Rich and famous.

00:46:02.463 --> 00:46:05.132
Rich and famous!

00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:06.400
You guys want another round?

00:46:06.433 --> 00:46:08.369
- Mm-hm.
- You'll help me carry?

00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.271
I'm your man.

00:46:11.272 --> 00:46:13.941
That's fun. right?

00:46:13.974 --> 00:46:16.277
What the fuck is he doing here?

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.278
Oh. damn it.

00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:18.580
- No.
- Fuck him.

00:46:18.613 --> 00:46:21.448
Everything okay?

00:46:21.482 --> 00:46:23.417
You just don't seem
too excited.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:24.852
Excited on the inside.

00:46:24.885 --> 00:46:27.187
Hmm. that real thing.

00:46:28.489 --> 00:46:30.157
You're Bob's assistant.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.293
If the show does well.
you're gonna do well.

00:46:32.326 --> 00:46:35.362
- In theory.
- In practice. In science.

00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:38.566
No. you have not worked here
long enough to know that.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.535
Money messes
with people's heads. okay.

00:46:40.568 --> 00:46:42.537
so just be careful.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.571
Is that Chase Morrow?

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.208
- David...
- I'm just. uh...

00:46:48.242 --> 00:46:49.209
Did you see his live special?

00:46:49.243 --> 00:46:50.978
It was hilarious.

00:46:51.011 --> 00:46:52.980
Yeah.

00:46:53.013 --> 00:46:54.549
Wait. why do you look like
he killed your dog?

00:46:54.582 --> 00:46:56.884
- You didn't know Melissa.
- Who's Melissa?

00:46:56.917 --> 00:46:59.286
Chase used to date Melissa.
and let's just say

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.221
if Chase worried more
about Melissa ODing

00:47:01.255 --> 00:47:03.324
on his living room rug
and less about how the story

00:47:03.357 --> 00:47:06.860
would damage his brand.
she might still be alive.

00:47:06.894 --> 00:47:08.262
- David. don't...
- I'm just...

00:47:08.295 --> 00:47:10.130
It's fine. it's fine.

00:47:10.164 --> 00:47:11.899
Okay. now David is talking
to Chase. Okay.

00:47:11.932 --> 00:47:12.866
Wait. how does David
know Chase?

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.501
He used to date Melissa.

00:47:14.536 --> 00:47:15.469
- Hey. leave us alone.
- David!

00:47:15.502 --> 00:47:17.204
- Oh!
- Oh my God!

00:47:17.237 --> 00:47:18.205
Oh my God. David!

00:47:18.238 --> 00:47:19.273
Fuck you. dude!

00:47:19.306 --> 00:47:21.141
Oh my God.

00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:23.010
Wow. whoa.

00:47:23.043 --> 00:47:24.579
That was cute.

00:47:24.612 --> 00:47:26.080
Let's go. let's go.

00:47:26.113 --> 00:47:27.314
Okay.

00:47:27.348 --> 00:47:28.982
Congrats
on actually being funny

00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:31.385
for the first time
in your life.

00:47:31.418 --> 00:47:34.054
We're leaving. we're leaving.

00:47:34.088 --> 00:47:35.923
Jesus. David.

00:47:35.956 --> 00:47:36.791
Did you break your nose?

00:47:36.825 --> 00:47:38.192
It's not broken.
it's just blood.

00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:39.527
Okay. well. let's go.

00:47:39.561 --> 00:47:42.096
Yeah. let's go drink some more
where we don't have to drink

00:47:42.129 --> 00:47:44.264
with a fucking murderer!

00:47:44.298 --> 00:47:45.600
Oh. David!

00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:48.502
David. okay. come on.
come on. come on.

00:47:48.536 --> 00:47:49.937
Well. listen.
you guys are awesome.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.071
and I think you're ready.

00:47:51.105 --> 00:47:52.306
Remember. folks. the key

00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:54.375
is to have as much fun
as possible.

00:47:54.408 --> 00:47:55.677
We want to let
the network folks know

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.145
that this show is great.

00:47:58.178 --> 00:48:00.582
and we want everybody
to get paid. and you all?

00:48:00.615 --> 00:48:02.416
You all get to say
you were in the audience

00:48:02.449 --> 00:48:04.652
for the first episode ever!

00:48:04.686 --> 00:48:06.220
Make some noise!

00:48:08.122 --> 00:48:10.625
- Well. it worked in rehearsal.
- The paper bag thing is weak.

00:48:10.658 --> 00:48:12.092
I don't know. I thought
it was sort of classic.

00:48:12.126 --> 00:48:13.394
Well. I'm cutting it.

00:48:13.427 --> 00:48:15.929
Okay. well.
maybe the next episode.

00:48:15.963 --> 00:48:17.599
Let's get through today first.

00:48:17.632 --> 00:48:20.167
Right. Uh...

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.537
Okay. uh. break a leg.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.304
Hey.

00:48:24.338 --> 00:48:26.940
- See you on the other side.
- Got it.

00:48:26.974 --> 00:48:29.042
All right. so how do I look?

00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:32.146
Like the famous Bob Devore.

00:48:33.748 --> 00:48:36.083
Well. you could be happy
for Jimmy at least.

00:48:36.116 --> 00:48:38.352
You're a monster. Bob.

00:48:38.385 --> 00:48:39.987
At least Jimmy gets it.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.090
In fact. I think
I might bring him on.

00:48:43.123 --> 00:48:45.527
He's the head writer.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.095
No. I had something else
in mind.

00:48:48.128 --> 00:48:50.497
I'm not going to live forever.

00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:53.233
At least. I don't think I am.

00:48:53.267 --> 00:48:56.103
I'd like to impart what I have
to someone else.

00:48:56.136 --> 00:48:58.338
You can do that?

00:48:58.372 --> 00:48:59.641
You thought I was the first?

00:48:59.674 --> 00:49:01.442
Please. Bob.

00:49:02.476 --> 00:49:04.178
Showtime.

00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:19.561
Violet?

00:49:19.594 --> 00:49:20.994
Mm-hm.

00:49:21.028 --> 00:49:23.197
Hey.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.632
What are you doing?

00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:27.267
I was drinking alone.

00:49:29.169 --> 00:49:30.772
Everybody loved the show.

00:49:30.805 --> 00:49:34.408
Donna said it went
really organically.

00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:36.511
What does that mean?

00:49:36.544 --> 00:49:40.180
I don't know.
but she kept saying it.

00:49:44.652 --> 00:49:45.753
Come here. you.

00:49:45.787 --> 00:49:48.523
Come here. come here. come here.

00:49:50.257 --> 00:49:51.358
You ever get laid at work?

00:49:51.391 --> 00:49:53.293
Okay. mm. mm. mm. mm.

00:49:53.327 --> 00:49:54.662
Mm. mm. mm. mm. mm.

00:49:54.696 --> 00:49:56.798
Hey. hey. hey. okay.
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey.

00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:58.700
What. are you trying
to get me fired

00:49:58.733 --> 00:50:01.068
after literally
my first episode?

00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:05.272
Silly me. I totally forgot
you're like a big TV guy now.

00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:07.575
Hey. what is wrong with you?

00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:09.644
Nothing is wrong with me.

00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:12.045
I'm certainly not some farm boy
from Ohio

00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:14.749
who's in way over his head.

00:50:14.782 --> 00:50:16.651
- What?
- You have no idea

00:50:16.684 --> 00:50:18.820
what you're getting
yourself into.

00:50:18.853 --> 00:50:20.755
This is gross. I'm gonna go.

00:50:20.788 --> 00:50:22.055
No. no. no! Please. please.
please. don't go.

00:50:22.089 --> 00:50:23.525
Just...

00:50:23.558 --> 00:50:25.359
You have to quit.

00:50:25.392 --> 00:50:27.160
Just listen to me.
He's gonna get inside of you.

00:50:27.194 --> 00:50:28.028
he's gonna twist you up.

00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:29.496
and he's gonna
turn you into him.

00:50:29.531 --> 00:50:30.698
I don't think you know
what you're saying.

00:50:30.732 --> 00:50:33.735
- No. please!
- I think you wish it was you

00:50:33.768 --> 00:50:35.202
instead of me.

00:50:39.106 --> 00:50:40.642
Yeah.

00:50:40.675 --> 00:50:42.844
You're probably right.

00:50:42.877 --> 00:50:44.044
So we should just stop.

00:50:46.814 --> 00:50:48.081
What?

00:50:48.115 --> 00:50:49.216
You're right.

00:50:49.249 --> 00:50:50.818
This is fucking things up
between us.

00:50:50.852 --> 00:50:53.220
so why don't we just stop?

00:50:58.425 --> 00:51:00.260
If you think...

00:51:00.294 --> 00:51:02.229
I do.

00:51:02.262 --> 00:51:04.799
That is what I think. so...

00:51:09.837 --> 00:51:12.674
What the fuck?

00:51:24.586 --> 00:51:26.286
Ah...

00:51:27.421 --> 00:51:29.423
Fuck!

00:51:29.456 --> 00:51:32.225
Come on! Fuck!

00:52:02.389 --> 00:52:03.791
Oh. man.

00:52:11.331 --> 00:52:13.433
Okay.

00:52:13.467 --> 00:52:15.268
Okay.

00:52:19.473 --> 00:52:21.909
Life's too short.

00:52:29.617 --> 00:52:32.252
- Hey. Vi.
- Sup?

00:52:35.757 --> 00:52:38.593
Is it Halloween already?

00:52:38.626 --> 00:52:40.595
You're gonna feel very badly
about that once you find out

00:52:40.628 --> 00:52:42.195
who I booked for the show
tonight.

00:52:42.229 --> 00:52:43.430
What?

00:52:43.463 --> 00:52:45.667
Chase Morrow in the house.
bitches!

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:46.801
- Oh. you booked him?
- Mm-hm.

00:52:46.834 --> 00:52:48.502
I thought he only does movies.

00:52:48.536 --> 00:52:50.672
I do do movies. but I got
to get back to my roots.

00:52:50.705 --> 00:52:52.372
so when shy little Violet here
hit me up

00:52:52.406 --> 00:52:54.241
to work with Bob Devore.

00:52:54.274 --> 00:52:56.811
I said. "Fuckin' when
and where?"

00:52:56.844 --> 00:52:58.713
Well. it's good to have you.
Chase.

00:52:58.746 --> 00:53:00.581
Bring it up!

00:53:00.615 --> 00:53:01.749
It's gonna be fuckin' lit.

00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:11.859
Yo! Uh. when the fuck am I on?

00:53:11.893 --> 00:53:13.961
- Hey. soon.
- Cool.

00:53:13.995 --> 00:53:15.295
Don't have anybody light me.
all right?

00:53:15.328 --> 00:53:16.130
I'll do as much time as I want.

00:53:16.164 --> 00:53:17.665
- I fuckin' hate that shit.
- Okay.

00:53:17.699 --> 00:53:18.766
- What are you doing?
- Want some?

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.868
Everybody. welcome to Too Late.

00:53:20.902 --> 00:53:22.003
After. What are you doing?
I got to go on.

00:53:22.036 --> 00:53:23.604
Fuckin' pussy.

00:53:25.907 --> 00:53:27.274
Fuck you.

00:53:27.307 --> 00:53:29.276
And if you want a good seat...

00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:30.878
Let's fuckin' do this.

00:53:30.912 --> 00:53:33.280
All right. well. we're ready
for your first act. uh.

00:53:33.313 --> 00:53:36.951
this guy is super funny.
movies. he's in one right now.

00:53:36.984 --> 00:53:38.619
Chase Morrow. everybody!

00:53:38.653 --> 00:53:40.688
Chase Morrow!

00:53:44.391 --> 00:53:47.360
Keep it going for
that creepy old fuck. everybody.

00:53:47.394 --> 00:53:48.596
Wow!

00:53:48.629 --> 00:53:49.897
Where are you from. ponytail?

00:53:49.931 --> 00:53:51.431
- Is that not a ponytail?
- No.

00:53:51.465 --> 00:53:52.299
Oh. what are you doing?

00:53:52.332 --> 00:53:54.301
Get a ponytail. man.

00:53:54.334 --> 00:53:56.403
If I can grow a ponytail.
I'm fuckin' using a ponytail.

00:53:56.436 --> 00:53:58.338
What are you thinking?
Come on. where are you from?

00:53:58.371 --> 00:54:00.307
- Augusta. Georgia.
- Augusta. Georgia?

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.977
You guys got golf. right?

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:07.280
And. uh. the Civil War
was bad for you. um...

00:54:07.314 --> 00:54:07.982
I'm so good at crowd work.

00:54:08.015 --> 00:54:09.684
Where are you from. sir?

00:54:09.717 --> 00:54:11.052
Denver? Okay. I've heard of it.

00:54:11.085 --> 00:54:14.989
Um. I don't have
any material on that.

00:54:15.022 --> 00:54:16.423
So that's not ideal.

00:54:16.456 --> 00:54:18.693
Is anybody from. um. my dad?

00:54:23.631 --> 00:54:25.733
Oh. fuck. Um...

00:54:27.969 --> 00:54:30.905
Jesus Christ. Bob. I'm gonna
fuckin' eat shit up here. man.

00:54:30.938 --> 00:54:33.473
Like. fix the stage. dude.

00:54:33.508 --> 00:54:34.976
Oh. fuck. Um...

00:54:35.009 --> 00:54:36.944
Does the city know
that this is happening?

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.313
'Cause they should. It's bad.

00:54:40.347 --> 00:54:42.583
Um. it's not up to code.

00:54:44.786 --> 00:54:46.621
Uh. you guys have been...

00:54:46.654 --> 00:54:49.924
you guys have been here
for that.

00:54:49.957 --> 00:54:51.491
Um...

00:54:52.994 --> 00:54:55.863
Thanks a lot.
I've been Chase Morrow. guys.

00:54:59.432 --> 00:55:01.501
Chase Morrow. everybody.
the first act.

00:55:01.536 --> 00:55:03.070
Come on. let's hear it for...

00:55:04.639 --> 00:55:05.973
What's up. boys?

00:55:06.007 --> 00:55:07.108
There he is.

00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:09.510
- You!
- Violet.

00:55:09.544 --> 00:55:10.812
Right. sure. sure. yeah.

00:55:10.845 --> 00:55:13.380
Dude. those pills
are no joke. right?

00:55:13.413 --> 00:55:14.481
I'm feelin' fuckin' loose.

00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:17.118
Good. yeah.

00:55:17.151 --> 00:55:19.620
I know why you booked me.
by the way.

00:55:19.654 --> 00:55:21.488
You do?

00:55:21.522 --> 00:55:23.423
You always lookin' at me
all these years.

00:55:23.456 --> 00:55:26.027
It's cool. let's just do it.

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.865
- Oh.
- Whoa.

00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:32.667
Somebody moves fast.

00:55:34.068 --> 00:55:35.603
Hey. Chase!

00:55:35.636 --> 00:55:37.004
Yo. you want to meet
this friend of mine?

00:55:37.038 --> 00:55:38.873
You got to. Come on.
we'll keep hanging.

00:55:38.906 --> 00:55:41.509
Let me buy you one.

00:55:58.993 --> 00:56:02.763
Um. why don't you guys
get out of here?

00:56:05.432 --> 00:56:08.169
Fucking go!

00:56:08.202 --> 00:56:11.706
Not everything I say
is a goddamn joke.

00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:17.945
Hey. what's up?

00:56:17.979 --> 00:56:19.881
Good to see you.

00:56:19.914 --> 00:56:24.552
Actually. I was thinking
why don't we re-up?

00:56:24.585 --> 00:56:26.153
I mean. I don't know. man.
I feel pretty good.

00:56:26.187 --> 00:56:28.522
- That shit's no joke.
- This?

00:56:28.556 --> 00:56:31.058
I pour this shit
on my cereal.

00:56:33.561 --> 00:56:35.796
Fuck. all right.

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.531
I'll party.

00:56:37.565 --> 00:56:39.600
Oh my God.

00:56:41.969 --> 00:56:44.939
- Let's fuckin' do it. right?
- Mm-hm.

00:56:48.075 --> 00:56:50.945
Um. yeah. Okay. all right.

00:56:50.978 --> 00:56:53.881
I've been waiting
a whole hour...

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:57.785
This shit is not joke.

00:56:57.818 --> 00:56:59.186
Um...

00:57:06.861 --> 00:57:08.930
Fuck.

00:57:10.264 --> 00:57:11.766
Come and get it!

00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:18.005
What the fuck are you doing?

00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:19.840
Din-din!

00:57:19.874 --> 00:57:22.510
Who's hungry. huh?

00:57:22.543 --> 00:57:24.245
- Is that Chase?
- Yep.

00:57:24.278 --> 00:57:26.580
Is he dead?

00:57:26.614 --> 00:57:28.849
- No.
- What were you thinking?

00:57:28.883 --> 00:57:31.585
The dark of the moon
isn't for days.

00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:35.156
It's called "initiative." Bob.
and I took it.

00:57:35.189 --> 00:57:36.657
But he's a huge star.

00:57:36.691 --> 00:57:38.125
People are gonna
come looking for him.

00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:39.694
He's a fucking mess.
people will just think

00:57:39.727 --> 00:57:42.063
he drank too much
and fell in a river.

00:57:45.199 --> 00:57:47.535
Hmm. hmm.

00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:48.703
You know. you were the one
that said

00:57:48.736 --> 00:57:49.603
the other guy had no talent.

00:57:49.637 --> 00:57:51.906
I mean. say what you will
about Chase.

00:57:51.939 --> 00:57:54.542
but he's very talented.

00:57:54.575 --> 00:57:57.912
Uh. I could eat.

00:57:57.945 --> 00:57:59.747
Be my guest.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.622
I can't do it
if you're watching.

00:58:08.656 --> 00:58:10.658
By all means.

00:59:02.176 --> 00:59:04.678
What did this guy eat?

00:59:04.712 --> 00:59:07.648
Oh. about a dozen sedatives.

00:59:07.681 --> 00:59:08.849
What?

00:59:08.883 --> 00:59:10.117
He...

00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:12.053
You...

00:59:12.086 --> 00:59:14.188
- You said it first. Bob.
- Oh. no.

00:59:14.221 --> 00:59:15.956
Life's too short.

00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:17.124
Mine is anyway.

00:59:17.158 --> 00:59:18.292
Well. I don't have
another half decade

00:59:18.325 --> 00:59:19.193
to give to you. so what?

00:59:19.226 --> 00:59:21.896
That you'll give me
maybe a leg up?

00:59:21.929 --> 00:59:23.931
Or worse. I'll end up
like your little...

00:59:23.964 --> 00:59:25.232
What was her name? Corrie?

00:59:25.266 --> 00:59:26.667
Is that right?

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.736
Not me. Bob.

00:59:28.769 --> 00:59:30.271
I'll...

00:59:48.756 --> 00:59:51.859
Fine. drama.

01:00:04.305 --> 01:00:07.141
Your boss ate Chase Morrow.

01:00:07.174 --> 01:00:09.076
- Yes.
- The movie star?

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.112
He does movies now. yes.

01:00:11.145 --> 01:00:14.682
Because he's a monster.

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:17.051
- Yes.
- What? Like a vampire?

01:00:17.084 --> 01:00:18.152
I don't know.
Do you believe me. Belinda?

01:00:18.185 --> 01:00:19.186
No!

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.155
Like. maybe because it's like
some metaphor.

01:00:21.188 --> 01:00:23.991
Or like a really bad prank.
then maybe I'd believe you.

01:00:24.024 --> 01:00:25.292
but this is just another reason

01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:26.961
why you have to quit
this stupid fuck...

01:00:26.994 --> 01:00:29.930
Oh. fuck!

01:00:29.964 --> 01:00:32.066
- Oh my. I'm gonna throw up!
- Don't be sick for me. please.

01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:33.434
Okay. I know. It's okay.

01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:34.869
- You made me an accessory!
- I wouldn't have done it

01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:35.903
if there was any other way.

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:37.371
Please. Belinda. please.

01:00:37.404 --> 01:00:39.406
Fuck. fuck. fuck.

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.148
What are we gonna do?

01:00:50.251 --> 01:00:51.819
We're gonna get rid of it.

01:00:51.852 --> 01:00:53.154
Ow!

01:00:53.187 --> 01:00:54.688
- You know what you're doing?
- What?

01:00:54.722 --> 01:00:57.024
Every Tuesday.
you're moving my car.

01:00:57.057 --> 01:00:58.225
- Alternate parking.
- You bet.

01:00:58.259 --> 01:01:01.262
- I'm sleeping in.
- I'll come back with a coffee.

01:01:01.295 --> 01:01:03.264
Yeah. fuckin' latte.

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:07.902
Okay. You know what else?

01:01:07.935 --> 01:01:09.303
- What?
- I want to...

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:10.771
- What?
- I want to use your deodorant.

01:01:10.804 --> 01:01:12.206
What? You want to use
my deodorant?

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.207
Yeah. I do.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.909
You're a freak.

01:01:14.942 --> 01:01:16.110
You know what?
I just want to do it.

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:17.878
Okay. well. you can do it. okay?

01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:20.147
Okay.

01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:21.749
So it doesn't.

01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:30.124
That's probably just the road.

01:01:30.157 --> 01:01:31.859
No. I don't want to do this.

01:01:31.892 --> 01:01:33.394
Yep.

01:01:39.033 --> 01:01:40.434
Okay. okay.

01:01:40.467 --> 01:01:41.869
- Oh my God.
- What?

01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:44.138
- Sink.
- Sink. Bob. sink. please.

01:01:44.171 --> 01:01:45.906
Sink. come on!

01:01:47.441 --> 01:01:49.243
Maybe if I just...

01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:53.113
- You got me?
- I got you. I got you.

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:55.282
- Careful. careful.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:01:55.316 --> 01:01:57.251
That's smart.
Yeah. that's probably smart.

01:01:57.284 --> 01:01:58.819
Okay.

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:03.424
Sink! Come on!

01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:05.826
Please. just fucking sink!

01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:08.229
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:09.396
Oh my God. it's sinking!

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.031
It's sinking!

01:02:14.935 --> 01:02:17.805
Okay. we've done it.

01:02:17.838 --> 01:02:19.106
Thank you.

01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:20.241
Wait. wait. no. no. no.

01:02:20.274 --> 01:02:21.308
No. no. No. no. no.

01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:22.476
No. we are not there yet.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:23.410
- No. nuh-uh.
- Okay. I get that.

01:02:23.444 --> 01:02:24.878
This is the last time
I do this for you.

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:27.047
Whenever you're ready.

01:02:34.488 --> 01:02:37.925
Hey. I haven't seen you at all
and I was hoping

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:39.927
you were gonna come
to the show tonight.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.963
Still no sign of Bob.
but. uh. we're doing it anyway.

01:02:42.997 --> 01:02:45.366
Well. I'm doing it. actually.

01:02:45.399 --> 01:02:48.936
Um. so. yeah.
I just thought it'd be cool

01:02:48.969 --> 01:02:52.139
to have you here. um.

01:02:52.172 --> 01:02:55.075
because I miss you.

01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:57.444
Um. yeah. So. there. I said it.

01:02:57.478 --> 01:02:59.213
You officially have
the upper hand.

01:02:59.246 --> 01:03:00.548
Okay. uh. your move.

01:03:00.582 --> 01:03:02.182
- Bye. Jimmy.
- Still no sign of Bob. huh?

01:03:02.216 --> 01:03:03.817
Uh. yeah. no.

01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:06.420
You want to choose
one of these gels?

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:09.123
- What?
- Gels.

01:03:09.156 --> 01:03:13.027
Bob was very particular
about his blues. so...

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.262
Oh. No. I trust you.

01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:17.331
Whatever you think is right.

01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:19.366
No. You choose.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.336
Choose a blue.

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:24.938
No. I... do you like the one
you're holding?

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:26.840
Do you like it?

01:03:26.874 --> 01:03:28.275
Yeah. it looks blue.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.245
Can you please pick a gel?

01:03:31.278 --> 01:03:33.213
How about we do the one
in your hand?

01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:36.250
- Great. thank you.
- Okay. cool. Great choice.

01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:38.185
Thank you.

01:04:27.669 --> 01:04:32.039
Just gonna walk backwards

You've seen it

01:04:56.397 --> 01:04:58.298
Hi. my name is Violet.

01:04:58.332 --> 01:05:00.200
Hi. my name... huh...

01:05:00.234 --> 01:05:01.669
Welcome to Too Late.

01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:10.678
Hello. Good evening.

01:05:10.712 --> 01:05:13.147
Welcome to Too Late.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.616
I'm. um...

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:17.017
Uh. Bob Devore is not...

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.586
he's not gonna be
hosting tonight.

01:05:23.991 --> 01:05:26.059
Sorry. I had a little...

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:27.494
It's like
one of those salt cra...

01:05:27.529 --> 01:05:28.996
I just had a little...

01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:30.964
Pita is the word.
A pita cracker.

01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:34.468
- Um. my name is Violet.
- Fuck yeah. it is!

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:36.136
Yeah!

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.607
Those are my friends.

01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.609
Um. yeah. my name is Violet
and. actually.

01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:44.311
I'm gonna be hosting
the show tonight.

01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:46.346
I am at a point
in my gender transition

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.382
where a trace amount of sexism

01:05:48.415 --> 01:05:51.084
is also really validating
for me.

01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:52.119
I was walking
through a neighborhood.

01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:54.154
there was a guy on a stoop.
he saw me walk by.

01:05:54.188 --> 01:05:55.757
he goes.
"Hey. girl. you like music?"

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:57.191
And I do like music.

01:05:57.224 --> 01:05:58.459
And then I heard his buddy go.

01:05:58.492 --> 01:05:59.527
"Hey. man. that's not a girl."

01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:01.195
and I'm like. "Oh no.
I'm gonna get stabbed.

01:06:01.228 --> 01:06:03.330
this is gonna be a sad story."

01:06:03.363 --> 01:06:05.466
And then he added.
"That's a woman."

01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:06.634
Woo!

01:06:06.668 --> 01:06:08.469
Yeah. it's pretty awesome.

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:09.704
The only thing I think to do

01:06:09.737 --> 01:06:11.539
with. like.
an affirming cat call

01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:13.407
was to. like. stop.
and flip my hair.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.576
and name a product.

01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:19.446
Right? "Hey. man. that's not
a girl. that's a woman."

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.350
and I'm like.
"Feria by L'Oréal.

01:06:23.383 --> 01:06:25.018
Maybe she's born with it

01:06:25.052 --> 01:06:27.020
or maybe she did go
to a series of doctors."

01:06:31.492 --> 01:06:34.696
Does anybody...
who likes Shakespeare?

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:36.129
Ah!

01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:38.198
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:38.232 --> 01:06:41.502
Um. so. Bob's gone. huh?

01:06:41.536 --> 01:06:43.136
Mm-hm.

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.471
- You wouldn't know.
- Thanks.

01:06:44.506 --> 01:06:47.407
Yes. I just wanted to...

01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:48.141
- You go.
- Okay.

01:06:48.175 --> 01:06:49.142
I didn't want to kiss Chase.

01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:53.180
He just grabbed my face
and had his way with it.

01:06:53.213 --> 01:06:56.083
- I kind of wanted to kill him.
- Me too.

01:06:56.116 --> 01:06:57.384
You were right about the pilot.

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:58.553
I shouldn't have taken the job.

01:06:58.586 --> 01:06:59.687
Bob should've offered it to you.

01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:03.323
and I never should've
jumped ahead of you for it.

01:07:03.357 --> 01:07:04.759
Uh. I have to tell you
something.

01:07:04.792 --> 01:07:06.728
If you... do you have any...
can you just stay here?

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.730
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:37.224
Phew.

01:07:48.736 --> 01:07:51.238
- Bob fuckin' who?
- Oh. thank you.

01:07:51.271 --> 01:07:52.674
Just promise me you won't
start doing stand-up. okay?

01:07:52.707 --> 01:07:53.675
I don't want
to have to hate you. too.

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:55.442
- Okay.
- Hello.

01:07:55.475 --> 01:08:00.147
Hey. speaking of incredibly
talented people I despise.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.148
What's up? What's up?

01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:02.584
Are we fighting still?

01:08:02.617 --> 01:08:05.352
Okay. All right.
you guys are good?

01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:06.688
Come on. just kiss and make up.

01:08:06.721 --> 01:08:08.322
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:09.891
Thank you. that's very helpful.

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:17.497
You really were great tonight.

01:08:17.532 --> 01:08:19.601
Thanks.

01:08:19.634 --> 01:08:22.670
So what did you want to...

01:08:22.704 --> 01:08:23.605
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:25.205
Okay.

01:08:25.238 --> 01:08:26.841
Here we go.

01:08:26.874 --> 01:08:28.910
Okay.

01:08:37.619 --> 01:08:39.419
- Bob?
- Uh-huh.

01:08:39.453 --> 01:08:43.524
Not like a metaphorical monster?

01:08:50.965 --> 01:08:53.668
Wait. Chase?

01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:55.737
- Like the movie...
- Shh.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.739
- The movie star Chase?
- Yeah. that's the one.

01:08:57.772 --> 01:09:00.374
You and Belinda...

01:09:02.275 --> 01:09:06.213
Fuck you.

01:09:06.246 --> 01:09:07.815
Everything I've told you
is the truth

01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:09.817
and you're the only person
in the world who knows it.

01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:11.284
Mm-hm.

01:09:11.318 --> 01:09:13.387
- Me and Belinda.
- You and Belinda.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.356
Mm-hm. I don't get it.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:17.324
It's the truth.

01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:18.860
I don't believe you.

01:09:18.893 --> 01:09:22.697
That's the only thing
I'm asking you to do.

01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:24.632
I'll talk to you soon.

01:09:25.967 --> 01:09:28.402
You really were great tonight.

01:09:46.688 --> 01:09:48.623
Come back for you.

01:10:06.473 --> 01:10:07.675
How was the show?

01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:09.977
Did you make me proud?

01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:11.879
I'm sorry. Bob.

01:10:11.913 --> 01:10:14.448
You will be.

01:10:14.481 --> 01:10:16.918
I had to do it.

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.351
Of course you did.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:20.621
It was a clever trick
you played.

01:10:20.655 --> 01:10:22.957
Maybe you're funnier
than I thought.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.028
Get away from me.

01:10:27.061 --> 01:10:29.831
You're in my home. Violet.

01:10:29.864 --> 01:10:31.331
You know. we didn't have much.

01:10:31.364 --> 01:10:33.568
but we did have trust.
didn't we?

01:10:33.601 --> 01:10:35.703
You don't have to do this. Bob.

01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:38.271
- I can go away.
- You and I both know

01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:41.576
there is only one way
this can end.

01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:52.486
You know what
I had to go through

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.321
to get here tonight?

01:10:54.354 --> 01:10:58.325
Chase did not agree with me.

01:10:58.358 --> 01:11:02.496
And. now. I'm starving.

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:07.568
Go ahead.

01:11:09.837 --> 01:11:12.339
I'm just as guilty
as you are. Bob.

01:11:12.372 --> 01:11:15.710
Every single thing
you asked for. I did.

01:11:15.743 --> 01:11:18.378
Every single task.

01:11:18.411 --> 01:11:20.848
every single chore.

01:11:20.882 --> 01:11:23.017
every single person.

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:25.987
All for what?

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:29.356
So that I could avoid obscurity.

01:11:29.389 --> 01:11:31.358
maybe death.

01:11:31.391 --> 01:11:32.860
or getting a real job.

01:11:32.894 --> 01:11:35.897
You were nothing
when I found you.

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:37.832
You could've been so much more.

01:11:37.865 --> 01:11:39.834
You're right. Bob.

01:11:39.867 --> 01:11:42.603
I'm nothing.

01:11:42.637 --> 01:11:45.840
I died the day I met you.

01:11:45.873 --> 01:11:47.642
So go ahead.

01:11:47.675 --> 01:11:50.111
Do what you do best.

01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:09.630
Violet?

01:12:09.664 --> 01:12:11.799
Violet. are you in here?

01:12:13.968 --> 01:12:15.368
Bob?

01:12:16.604 --> 01:12:17.939
Jimmy.

01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:19.439
Jimmy!

01:12:19.472 --> 01:12:20.708
Hey.

01:12:20.741 --> 01:12:23.511
What are you do...

01:12:23.544 --> 01:12:25.079
Oh my God.

01:12:25.112 --> 01:12:28.716
You are a monster.

01:12:28.749 --> 01:12:31.619
I was going to tell you.

01:12:31.652 --> 01:12:32.954
- About this?
- Well. yeah.

01:12:32.987 --> 01:12:34.622
we're gonna be
working closely together

01:12:34.655 --> 01:12:37.091
for several months.
so I think you should know.

01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:39.727
That you eat people.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.394
Jimmy. both you and I know

01:12:41.428 --> 01:12:44.599
that comedians
aren't really people.

01:12:44.632 --> 01:12:45.766
Oh my God.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.702
People come and people go.

01:12:47.735 --> 01:12:50.470
Nobody knows why
and nobody really cares.

01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:51.873
Think of how many people
have gone in

01:12:51.906 --> 01:12:53.473
and out of your life

01:12:53.507 --> 01:12:54.976
and you don't even remember
their faces.

01:12:55.009 --> 01:12:56.944
let alone their names.

01:12:56.978 --> 01:13:00.581
Am I really that bad
when you come to think of it?

01:13:00.615 --> 01:13:04.118
You eat people.

01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:07.021
Yeah. but none of them
had a career.

01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:08.823
None of them had a name.

01:13:08.856 --> 01:13:11.759
Well. Chase. but I think
we can all agree

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:13.594
that he had it coming.

01:13:13.628 --> 01:13:16.097
Wait...

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:17.798
Where's Violet?

01:13:17.832 --> 01:13:20.001
I need help sometimes.
and she just couldn't

01:13:20.034 --> 01:13:21.602
help me anymore.
you understand?

01:13:21.636 --> 01:13:22.670
What did you do?

01:13:22.703 --> 01:13:24.739
I do what I will!

01:13:26.607 --> 01:13:27.942
All right.
here's what's gonna happen.

01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:29.677
You're going to go home.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.946
you're going to tell no one
what you saw.

01:13:31.979 --> 01:13:34.081
and when I need you.
I'll call.

01:13:34.115 --> 01:13:35.850
- You're insane.
- Look. there are two kinds

01:13:35.883 --> 01:13:39.120
of people in this world.
the eaters and the eaten.

01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:42.590
To survive. you're going
to have to learn how to eat.

01:13:42.623 --> 01:13:44.091
And I can show you
if you'll let me.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:45.626
Someone will stop you.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.460
Look around you. kid.

01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:49.597
You'll do
what everyone else does.

01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:54.001
You'll shut your mouth
and you'll play the game.

01:13:54.035 --> 01:13:55.102
No one will stop me!

01:13:55.136 --> 01:13:58.739
Not you. not Violet.

01:14:11.953 --> 01:14:13.888
Ah!

01:14:13.921 --> 01:14:17.758
You can't do this!

01:14:25.066 --> 01:14:27.835
I don't work for you
anymore. Bob.

01:14:39.981 --> 01:14:42.783
- I came back to tell you...
- It doesn't matter.

01:14:42.817 --> 01:14:46.887
The impulse to be all. like.
coy and removed and meta.

01:14:46.921 --> 01:14:49.190
but. like.
I love to see you shine.

01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:51.192
Even if that means I don't win

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:54.662
because I love to see you shine
so. so much more

01:14:54.695 --> 01:14:58.199
than I love to win
because I love you.

01:14:58.232 --> 01:14:59.934
Please stop talking. okay?

01:14:59.967 --> 01:15:01.902
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:04.772 --> 01:15:05.973
Oh.

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:08.776
Okay. yeah. that's disgusting.

01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:11.645
- I don't care.
- Okay. me neither.

01:15:17.818 --> 01:15:19.687
The rent is more
than we had budgeted.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.589
but I think we should take it

01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:23.290
because we're not
gonna do any better

01:15:23.324 --> 01:15:24.959
and I'm excited
to move in with you

01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:27.228
because I love you.
which is a thing we say now

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:28.696
without feeling weird.

01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:31.032
- We sure do.
- Have fun tonight.

01:15:31.065 --> 01:15:33.134
Crazier things have happened.

01:15:33.167 --> 01:15:35.002
Bye.

01:15:38.272 --> 01:15:40.141
- Hey. aren't you Violet?
- I am.

01:15:40.174 --> 01:15:41.909
Used to work
for Bob Devore. right?

01:15:41.942 --> 01:15:43.210
- I did. yeah.
- Oh.

01:15:43.244 --> 01:15:45.212
Whatever happened to that guy?

01:15:45.246 --> 01:15:47.181
People come. people go.

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:48.816
He was one of a kind.

01:15:48.849 --> 01:15:50.017
God. I hope so.

01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:51.886
- Are you still booking?
- No.

01:15:51.919 --> 01:15:53.120
So what do you do now?

01:15:55.389 --> 01:15:58.793
So I was like. "Hey. officer.
I'm not wearing pants."

01:16:01.162 --> 01:16:02.730
Okay. you guys have been
so awesome.

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:04.698
Are you ready
for your next comedian? Yeah?

01:16:04.732 --> 01:16:06.967
Okay. yes. please
put your hands together

01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:09.637
for the very funny
Violet Fields.

01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:12.573
Thanks. girl.
