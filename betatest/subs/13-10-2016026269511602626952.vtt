It's...

205
00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:50.511
[laughs awkwardly]

206
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:51.929
Break a leg.it's a theatre term.

207
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.181
It just means "good luck."

208
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.724
Why do they say that?

209
00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:56.058
I don't know.

210
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.810
I'll call you aboutthat dinner meeting.

211
00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:58.478
Yes.

212
00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.187
Okay.

213
00:07:59.187 --> 00:07:59.896

214
00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:00.605

Yeah. absolutely.

219
00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:10.114
♪

220
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.407
Hey. I got your text.

221
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.411

223
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.457
No. no. you're notgetting fired.

224
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.001
Um...

225
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.212
Claire's okay. butshe's in the hospital.

226
00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:27.089
She walked in on a burglaryand got jumped by the thief.

227
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:28.299
but she's stable.

228
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.426
Um. okay. uh. um. I'm goingto go to the hospital.

229
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.221

Hey. you.

232
00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.363
Hey. Dad!

233
00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:51.239
What are you doing here?

234
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.365
I thought you'd be home in bed.

235
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:53.616
Ah. I'm feeling great.

236
00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.409
And I'm just picking upmy ticket for opening night.

237
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.704
So I'm guessing you do not needthat cold medication?

238
00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.915
Nope. you were right.

239
00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:01.916
Again.

240
00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:02.750
[laughs]

241
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.751
Come on.

242
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.919
So. Bella.

243
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.587
How is it that a film starwinds up headlining a play

244
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:09.590
at the community theatre?

245
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.801
Well. uh. my husbandDuncan and I

246
00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:15.179
have had a country home herefor a couple of years.

247
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:19.976
and we love being in Garrisonwhen I'm not off on a shoot.

248
00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:21.394
And I love theatre.

249
00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.854
So. I joined the boardto support.

250
00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:27.441
But Vincent Cuddahy.the artistic director.

251
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:31.612
has been trying to get meto support on the stage.

252
00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:35.032
So. he gave me the play.which I adored.

253
00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:38.369
and it worked withmy schedule. so.

254
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.578
Beautiful.

255
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.706
Can you tell us a little bitabout Shadow of Death?

256
00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:46.335
It's an old-fashioned drawingroom murder mystery.

257
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.005
with a little romance thrown infor good measure.

258
00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:51.132
A romance with your character?

259
00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:54.427
Yes. um. she fallsfor the local vicar.

260
00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:58.472
played by that handsome manover there. Elliot Quirk.

261
00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:00.808
Quirk as in Quirk Construction.the new condos?

262
00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:01.767
Mmhmm.

263
00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:03.644
When he donated lumberfor the set.

264
00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.730
he got bit by the acting bug.

265
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.898
And. by Bella Brightman.

266
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.983
[laughs]

267
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:09.984
It's understandable.

268
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.652
How's her husbandfeel about that?

269
00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:15.114
Well. let's just say he's beencoming to a lot of rehearsals.

270
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.907
Uh-huh.

271
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.578
Hey Chief. how's your daughter?

272
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.413
She's awake. and smiling.

273
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.456
Bud's there.

274
00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:24.498
Okay. That's good.

275
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:26.250
And she's still fuzzyon what happened.

276
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.376
The doctor said give hersome time.

277
00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:28.502
and it'll all come back.

278
00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:29.378
All right.

279
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.421
You got any leads?

280
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.589
No.

281
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.841
There's so many fingerprintsin a place like that.

282
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:36.635
I don't know. maybe we geta hit on one?

283
00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:38.304
Yeah. Okay. good.

284
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:41.932
Hey.

285
00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.267
Hey.

286
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.560
You made it.

287
00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.853
Yeah. visiting hours ended.

288
00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:47.355
Look. are... are you gonna beable to help Travis

289
00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:49.148
figure out who did thisto Claire?

290
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.191
Well. if he asks me to.

291
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.859
but I'm not going to holdmy breath.

292
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.902
You know how he is.

293
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:53.986
Hey Karl.

294
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.363
What... what happened?

295
00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:56.530
What does it look like?

296
00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:59.367
Chair broke. Gotta fix it.

297
00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.534
You need a hand with that.Karl?

298
00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:02.745
From you. the star's husband?No.

299
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.248
Amy? Uh. questionfor you onstage?

300
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.124
Yeah. Sure.

301
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:07.958
I'll talk to you later.

302
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.210
Okay.

303
00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:12.046
[whispering] I just need youto back me up on this. Okay?

304
00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.881
Elliot.

305
00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:19.387
Elliot has a thought aboutthe vicar confessing his love.

306
00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:23.474
So. I was thinkingI should kiss her.

307
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.394
No.

308
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.354
No. absolutely not.

309
00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.232
[stutters] But. I'm in lovewith her. Amy.

310
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.067
And we're finallyalone together.

311
00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.777
Okay. but you're a vicar.

312
00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.404
You're a man of propriety.you know.

313
00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:39.573
You respect the rulesof courtship.

314
00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.450
I mean. and bottom line.

315
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:43.077
this script doesn't indicatea kiss.

316
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:46.163
I'm... I'm sorry. Elliot.

317
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:49.583
Oh. darling. you tried.

318
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.918
All right everyone.

319
00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:53.754
This is our last run-throughbefore we have an audience.

320
00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:55.715
so let's get ready.

321
00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:56.674
Poor Elliot.

322
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.343
Mm. I met his girlfriend today.

323
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.386
Poor girlfriend.

324
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.679
[laughs]

325
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.431
I know. it's pretty obvioushe's smitten with Bella. right?

326
00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:04.557
Yeah.

327
00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:05.266
[sighs]

328
00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.684
I think her husband knows.

329
00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:10.604
I mean. this is the third nightDuncan's been here this week.

330
00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.984
Once the show is over.I'm sure he'll move on.

331
00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:17.361
Bella certainly will.

332
00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.450
(Travis) There she is.

333
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:23.951
Hi. partner.

334
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:24.660
Hey. you.

335
00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:25.494
Thank you.

336
00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:26.579
How you feeling?

337
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.997
Like a rookie.

338
00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.081
I should've called for backup

339
00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:30.958
as soon as I sawthe glass was broken.

340
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.126
You will next time.

341
00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.170
Hey. I'm sorry it took meso long to get here.

342
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.963
You're working a case.I understand.

343
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:36.839
Any headway?

344
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.591
No. not yet.

345
00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:39.800
In fact. I was hoping

346
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.304
that you were startingto remember some things.

347
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.722
Yeah. actually.

348
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:45.473
Yeah?

349
00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:47.057
There was this.this sound.

350
00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:50.436
like this steady rhythm comingfrom the back of the store.

351
00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:53.355
I went toward it. and...

352
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:55.232
it was one of those littletoy monkeys

353
00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.775
that plays the cymbals.

354
00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:57.777
That's weird.

355
00:12:57.818 --> 00:12:58.694
Yeah.

356
00:12:58.736 --> 00:12:59.403
Huh.

357
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.322
Anything else?

358
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.574
No. sorry.

359
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.742
It's all right.

360
00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:08.788
Uh. enjoy the flowersand I'll see you tomorrow.

361
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:09.580
Sounds good.

362
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.416
All right. Heal up. get better.

363
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.084
Vicar.

364
00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.462
Whatever can this mean?

365
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:21.509
I suppose it means I love you.Lady Purcell.

366
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.844
Vicar!

367
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:24.803
[screams]

368
00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:26.972
Lacy. that's your cue.

369
00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:28.641

Do you know who this guy is?

392
00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.390
He's Bella's ex.

393
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:10.391
How'd you know that?

394
00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.560
Yeah. how did you know that?

395
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.563
Well. I meanit's pretty obvious.

396
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:18.440
He called her "Bells" andhe brought her her favourites

397
00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:21.652
from a bakery that only existsin Manhattan.

398
00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.237
and I'm sure they're fresh.right?

399
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.446
Mmhmm.

400
00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.073
So you just arrived. andby the look on your face.

401
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.741
I could tell there was someunfinished business

402
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:28.826
between you two.

403
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.245
and it's obvious that Bellais not happy.

404
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:32.246
[clapping]

405
00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.456
Well done. Detective WhoeverYou Are.

406
00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:35.332
She is good.

407
00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.125
Amy Winslow.

408
00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.167
Ah.

409
00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:40.087
Sebastian Dusquenes.

410
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:42.423
Bella's first husband.

411
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.302
[clears throat]

412
00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:49.263
Let me guess. you came hereto win her back.

413
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.974
No. I'm just a fan of her work.

414
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.267
[chuckles]Okay.

415
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.269

Love what I saw tonight. Bells.Can't wait for more.

418
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.443
Okay.

419
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.402
[clears throat]

420
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:06.530
Goodnight. Sebastian.

421
00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:12.453
Okay.

422
00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:16.332
Now that our unwanted guestis gone.

423
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:17.791
let's gather for notes.

424
00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:20.419
Yes. yes. notes.

425
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:33.766
[suspenseful music]♪

426
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.772
(Bella) There's no need to get upset. Karl.

427
00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:40.606
I'm not a fool.

428
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:41.857
I know why he's here.

429
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:46.612
He has no idea. but he will.if you don't handle it.

430
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.031
So handle it.

431
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:53.243
[suspenseful music]♪

432
00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.371
[screams]Ahhhhh!!!!!

433
00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:57.164
Shh! Are you okay?

434
00:15:57.164 --> 00:15:57.915
What's wrong?

435
00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.291
Sorry. Professor Winslow.

436
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.170
I... I was just eavesdropping.I guess. on Karl and Bella.

437
00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:07.508
and their conversationsounded... strange.

438
00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:09.176
Strange how?

439
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.637
He was upset that someonewas there. but she said

440
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:15.683
"he has no idea. but he willif you don't handle this."

441
00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:18.727
And then she paused. like reallydramatically. and said

442
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.146
"so handle it."

443
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:24.108
And then I kind of gasped.and Karl heard me.

444
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.693
so I scooted away in here.

445
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:28.487
"Handle it." Hmm.

446
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:32.741
Do you think Karl was talkingabout her ex-husband showing up?

447
00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.077
I think he was talking abouther current husband.

448
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.954
I don't think he's happyDuncan's here.

449
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:40.207
So what does Karl not wantDuncan to find out about?

450
00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:41.542
I don't know.

451
00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:43.252
Okay. but what's going on?

452
00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:45.379
It does remind me ofA Study in Scarlet.

453
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.715
That great line that Holmes has?

454
00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:50.509
"There's nothing likefirsthand evidence."

455
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:52.386
Which we have none of.right now.

456
00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:53.887
It's just a bunch ofguess work.

457
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:54.722
[sighs]

458
00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:56.306
No. you're right.

459
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:57.516
Sorry for screaming.

460
00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:58.225
[laughs]

461
00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.394
That's okay.

462
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:02.062
Hey. do you need a ride home?

463
00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:02.938
That would be great.

464
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.523
Okay. come on.

465
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:05.733
What a rehearsal. huh?

466
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:09.111

467
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.071

488
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.695
What are you doing here?

489
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.656

Good night.

494
00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:15.636
Um. professor. do you thinkHolmes would say

495
00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:18.263
that's firsthand evidencethat there's trouble

496
00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:20.432
between Elliot and Josie?

497
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.518
Hmm.

498
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:26.647
Yeah. Lacy. I believe he would.

499
00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:38.659

500
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.577
Hey! This is a nice surprise.

501
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:44.498
Well. I had to do somethingto make up for all those dinnersI missed so...

502
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.668
Ta-da! I brought youGarrison bagels.

503
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:49.169

Ah!

And you too.

509
00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:58.887
[chuckles]

510
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.183
-Oh. boy!-So good aren't they?

511
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.893
They're hot. oh. boy!

512
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.607
So. uh. how was your finaldress rehearsal?

513
00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:11.483
Oh. Dad.

514
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:12.693
What? What?

515
00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:14.278
[laughs]Ugh. oh.

516
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:19.366
Let's just say there was a lotof drama around the drama.

517
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:20.951
Such as?

518
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.369
Well. you remember I told you

519
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:25.038
I thought that Elliot Quirk hada crush on Bella Brightman?

520
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.956
Yeah.

521
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.291
Well. there was a reasonfor that.

522
00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:28.208
Yeah?

523
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.209
Yeah.

524
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:33.172
Because. I found thisin the seat.

525
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:36.258
-Oh.-Oh.

526
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.634
Interesting. huh?

527
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:43.182
So. uh. "you know who"is Bella's husband?

528
00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:44.224
Maybe.

529
00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:47.895
But also. her ex-husbandshows up last night.

530
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.063
and then Duncan and him almostget into it.

531
00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:51.231
Did Elliot try too?

532
00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:52.983
Well. he didn't look too happyabout it.

533
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.736
but then Elliot's girlfriendshows up.

534
00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:56.987
and then they get into it.

535
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.238
[laughs]

536
00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:03.035
Oh. oh. uh. thank you.and thank you.

537
00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:06.747
Oh man. was the play as excitingas all of this?

538
00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:08.916
Well. exactly. I mean.that's my issue.

539
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.250
I'm afraid all ofthese distractions

540
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.252
are going to hurt the show.

541
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.795
Well.

542
00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:18.717
Maybe you should considerdoing something about it.

543
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:27.017
Hi. excuse me. sir.

544
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.727

550
00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:37.778
Yeah.

551
00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:38.779
It's not to help build condos?

552
00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.656
No. Elliot's got that covered.

553

I'm all ears.

830
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:04.511
Well. I found this wherethe actors take notes.

831
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:05.386
Mmhmm.

832
00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:06.679
I think it's fromElliot to Bella.

833
00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:08.097
and I think Josieknows about it.

834
00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.808
and I think Bella's husbandknows about it.

835
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:11.726
Huh.

836
00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:13.061
Will... will you hold onto thisfor me?

837
00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:13.770
Absolutely.

838
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:14.562
Anything else?

839
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:15.897
Yes. there is something else.

840
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:19.692
So. earlier tonight. this stagelight came crashing down

841
00:30:19.734 --> 00:30:21.194
just a few feet awayfrom Bella.

842
00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:23.029
I mean. it almost hit her.

843
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:26.783
So. I looked up. and I....

844
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.826
I thought I saw someoneon the catwalk.

845
00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:32.330
so I went up there.but there was no one.

846
00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:33.665
I mean. I did see Karlup there.

847
00:30:33.706 --> 00:30:35.375
but he was checking itout too. so.

848
00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:36.167
Show me.

849
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:37.502

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.894
Hey. um. get me a glove.

853
00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:06.739
Hmm-mmm.

854
00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:08.241
Look at this.

855
00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:12.537
It looks like somebodycut the safety cable.

856
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:14.080
So. it wasn't an accident.

857
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:18.626
No. this plan failed.somebody loaded the gun.

858
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:20.128
Gentlemen.

859
00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:23.715

You want to stay?

876
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:53.453
Yeah.

877
00:31:53.494 --> 00:31:54.954
All right.

878
00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:56.414
Just. why don't you sit here?

879
00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:57.540

882
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:06.299
So.

883
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:07.425
What do you want to know?

884
00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:09.510
So. the gun was new. right?

885
00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:10.553
That's right.

886
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.138
The old one wasn'tworking consistently.

887
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.848
so Karl offered to bringin the new one.

888
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:14.974
Who loaded the gun?

889
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:15.808
Karl.

890
00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:16.809
I gave it to Lacy.

891
00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:18.478
And the gun was with youthe whole time?

892
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:22.148
No. Bud picked it upat the 15-minute call.

893
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.899
Okay.

894
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.317
So. Lacy handed it to you.

895
00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:27.362
It was sitting on the dressingroom table so I picked it up.

896
00:32:27.403 --> 00:32:29.989
I took it to the booth where itstayed until she grabbed it

897
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:30.907
for the show.

898
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.325
Do you rememberanybody else. uh.

899
00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:33.868
who might've been inthe dressing room with you?

900
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.496
Bella and her ex-husbandstopped by.

901
00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:37.830
He brought me flowers.

902
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.749
Two dozen long stem.

903
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.668
We chatted for a minute.

904
00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:45.213
then the stage managerkicked me out.

905
00:32:45.254 --> 00:32:46.547
I didn't see any gun.

906
00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:48.841
Is there any reason whyhe would want to hurt you?

907
00:32:48.841 --> 00:32:51.803

908
00:32:51.844 --> 00:32:52.762

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.305
No. we're pals.

910
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.765
How about anybody else?

911
00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.768
No. I... I... I can't thinkof anyone

912
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.061
who would want to hurt me.

913
00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:02.021
Can you think of anybodywho would want to hurt Bella?

914
00:33:02.021 --> 00:33:02.689
No.

915
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.648
No way.

916
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.942
Not really. no.

917
00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.402
Absolutely not.

918
00:33:07.443 --> 00:33:08.820
Are you kidding?

919
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:10.279
Everybody loves Bella.

920
00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.615
How about this?

921
00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.574

That's cute.

924
00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.453
No.

925
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:18.371
[scoffs]

926
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:19.205
Is that my wife's?

927
00:33:19.247 --> 00:33:20.707
Why would you ask that?

928
00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:23.376
Oh. she does goofy stuffall the time

929
00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:24.877
to motivate the other actors.

930
00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:27.088
Do I like to motivatemy fellow players?

931
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.214
Yes!

932
00:33:28.214 --> 00:33:30.425
Did I create that?

933
00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:31.634
No.

934
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.011
So. you're telling me thatthere is nothing going on

935
00:33:34.053 --> 00:33:36.139
between Bella and Elliot?

936
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:36.973
Ask Bella.

937
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.350
Oh. he's sweet.

938
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:40.351
But that's all.

939
00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:42.103
But Josie thinks otherwise.

940
00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:47.984
Like I told Amy.Josie is just emotional.

941
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.486
What about the light thatalmost hit you?

942
00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:51.863
That was an accident.

943
00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:52.822
No.

944
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.532
Somebody cut the safety cable.

945
00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:57.285
So. you think thatsomeone is....

946
00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:59.746
Is trying to hurt you. yes.

947
00:33:59.746 --> 00:34:04.208
All right. um.well. I will trust

954
00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:19.974
Well. they failed.

955
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:21.768
All the more reasonto celebrate.

956
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:24.270
[laughs weakly]

957
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.022

With a score of other officers.

I need you all to stay reachableand local.

964
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.919
What do you think?

965
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.630
I think someone in this roomtried to commit a murder.

966
00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:53.341
and they're not going to quituntil they do.

967
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:08.981
Wow. this is... this issome house.

968

Apparently. and an apartmentin New York. yeah.

971
00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:18.282
But she says this is herfavourite place to be.

972
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:19.700
Huh?

973
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:26.833

978
00:35:35.174 --> 00:35:36.676

in my own home?

985
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.897
It sounds a lot easierthan doing it on the stage.

986
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:51.524
and they tried that already.

987
00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:52.942
Mmhmm.

988
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.402

Well. I could use one.

991
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.656

You're a hit.

995
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.290
Trying to prevent a hit.

996
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:11.127
[metal detector squeals]

997
00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:12.420
[sighs]

998
00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:17.425
Officer. the only damage thatthis will do is to my liver.

999
00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:19.051

Go get some rest.

1007
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.439
Okay. See you guys.

1008
00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:35.234
So. you making any headwayon the Main Street burglaries?

1009
00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:37.486
I got friends who're crosschecking all the fingerprints

1010
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:40.197
from the first three storesthat were hit.

1011
00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:42.658
Hoping we find a matchbefore there's a fourth.

1012
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.576
Hmm.

1013
00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:44.285

1017
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:58.925
Well. I'm eating.and you're eating.

1018

And you know. we are inthe same room together. so...

1020
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.847
[laughs]

1021
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:08.100
My conclusion would be...

1022
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.186
[heated arguing]

1023
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.562
What are you doing in my house?

1024
00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:13.105

What is going on here?

1029
00:37:18.444 --> 00:37:19.612
He attacked my son.

1030
00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:21.197
Your son's tryingto steal my wife.

1031
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.531

He's very familiar with people.

1056
00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:26.971
It's just that theatre thing.

1057
00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.686
What are those twotalking about?

1058
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.271

1065
00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:52.621

[tearing up]I'm okay.

1071
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.681
Why are the police here?

1072
00:39:10.723 --> 00:39:12.266
Oh. um. at the play tonight.

1073
00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:14.310
someone loaded the gunwith a real bullet

1074
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:16.812
and it almost hitthe hostess.

1075
00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:17.897
Bella?

1076
00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:21.734
Josie...

1077
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:25.529
Elliot said that you didn't wantto come to the play tonight.

1078
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:27.323
So why come here?

1079
00:39:27.364 --> 00:39:32.495
I... I'm sorry.

1080
00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.121
No. no. no. It's...it's okay.

1081
00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:35.164
What is it?

1082
00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:39.835
I. um... Elliot. he's beenso different.

1083
00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:44.423
and last night. I mean.I think you saw us?

1084
00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:46.592
I told him he had to tell methe truth.

1085
00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:49.595
About Bella?

1086
00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:52.515
And he said nothingwas going on?

1087
00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:56.268
Yeah. but...

1088
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.771
Okay.

1089
00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:01.565
I know his email passwordand tonight I signed in.

1090
00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:09.615
and I found a secret folder fullof love letters to him from her.

1091
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:13.327
I came here to tell himthat it's over between us.

1092
00:40:18.707 --> 00:40:21.961
I'm keeping an officer parkedout front.

1093
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:24.380

1094
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:28.551

1095
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:31.929
uh. less than gracious earlier.

1096
00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:37.017
[tearfully] It's just.been quite a day.

1097
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:38.519
Understood.

1098
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:40.646
Uh. tomorrow we'll getthe forensics back

1099
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:41.730
from the crime scene

1100
00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.315
and hopefully they'lltell us more about

1101
00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:45.693
who loaded that gunwith an actual bullet.

1102
00:40:45.734 --> 00:40:47.736
Yeah. Okay.

1103
00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.155

00:49:50.862 --> 00:49:52.197
You have the right to remain silent.

1289
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:53.532
Anything you say can and will be

1290
00:49:53.573 --> 00:49:55.784
used against you in a court of law.

1291
00:49:56.743 --> 00:49:58.912
Why did you run. Karl?

1292
00:49:58.954 --> 00:49:59.788
I didn't kill her.

1293
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.207
How did you know she was dead?

1294
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:03.834
Vincent called me.

1295
00:50:03.875 --> 00:50:06.837
I saw the luxury vehiclesin your barn.

1296
00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:10.382
The ones that aren'tregistered to you.

1297
00:50:10.382 --> 00:50:12.217
So you're choppingstolen cars.

1298
00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:15.429
and you still can'tpay back Bella?

1299
00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:20.726
How much gambling debtdo you owe?

1300
00:50:20.726 --> 00:50:21.810
Hmm.

1301
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.564
You know. here's the thing.

1302
00:50:25.605 --> 00:50:27.983
You thought that Bella broughtDuncan to the theater

1303
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:33.447
the other night to put pressureon you. but she didn't.

1304
00:50:33.488 --> 00:50:36.032
She hadn't told Duncanhow much you owed.

1305
00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:39.911
She actually just gave youa chance to handle it.

1306
00:50:39.911 --> 00:50:44.583
What if you decided to handle itin a more permanent way. Karl?

1307
00:50:44.624 --> 00:50:48.795
What if you let themuse your gun

1308
00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:51.757
so that you could slipa live round in?

1309
00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:53.759
Look.

1310
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.764
You're right about the cars.and I owe my bookie a lot.

1311
00:50:58.805 --> 00:50:59.514
Yeah.

1312
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:01.349
How much do you owe Bella?

1313
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:03.602
[sighs]

1314
00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:05.395
$100.000.

1315
00:51:05.437 --> 00:51:09.775
Sounds like 100.000 reasonsto commit a murder to me.

1316
00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:10.817
[sighs]

1317
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:12.277
You know what. I am gladthat we got this guy.

1318
00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:15.113
but I am not happy with the wayit went down.

1319
00:51:15.113 --> 00:51:15.822
Hi.

1320
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:18.617
Processing. Thank you.

1321
00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:20.285
You should've let me pursue it.

1322
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.829
Yeah. you're right.

1323
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:24.289
Wait. come on. you're not goingto argue with me?

1324
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:26.708
Well. I could point out thatif I hadn't done what I did.

1325
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.126
then he'd be halfwayinto Canada by now.

1326
00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:31.296
Amy. you just didpoint it out.

1327
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:32.547
I did?

1328
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:34.341
Oh. Well. anyway. I think whatwe should be focusing on

1329
00:51:34.382 --> 00:51:37.260
is how to induce a heart attackin a healthy person.

1330
00:51:37.302 --> 00:51:40.514
There's this great mysteryseries by Edith Pargeter.

1331
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:43.350
I mean. well. she wrote undera pseudonym. Ellis Peters.

1332
00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:45.602
All right. you gotta. you gottajust push through the...

1333
00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:46.436
the backstory.

1334
00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:47.103
It's interesting!

1335
00:51:47.145 --> 00:51:48.313
I have no doubt. but...

1336
00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:50.607
Okay. anyway. my point is.is the main character

1337
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:52.234
is this medieval monk.

1338
00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:53.568
Brother Cadfael. right?

1339
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.320
He's like this amateur sleuth.

1340
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:57.280
And in the book.Monk's Hood.

1341
00:51:57.322 --> 00:51:58.490
there's this healthy man

1342
00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.492
who just drops dead froma heart attack.

1343
00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:02.327
and Brother Cadfaelfigures out

1344
00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:08.166
that it's this oil namedMonkshood that causes the death.

1345
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.501
What do you think?

1346
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:12.963
I think we should go checkthat autopsy that I ordered.

1347
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:16.341
[knocks at door]

1348
00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:17.509
Russ.

1349
00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:19.678
Did we get the autopsy resultsof Bella Brightman yet?

1350
00:52:19.719 --> 00:52:21.888
Not yet. Detective. but I wasjust going to call you.

1351
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.515
We pulled that bulletout of the mirror.

1352
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:24.850
The trajectory was wrong.

1353
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:27.352
The bullet arced downwardat a 45 degree angle.

1354
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:28.186
Which means that...

1355
00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:29.312
It was fired from the catwalk.

1356
00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:31.773
The same time the onstage gunwas fired.

1357
00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.191
Any prints off the bullet?

1358
00:52:33.191 --> 00:52:35.569
A partial that matched printswe found on the catwalk. too.

1359
00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.195
One of the peoplewe printed last night.

1360
00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.613
Who?

1361
00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:42.659
Sebastian Dusquenes.

1363
00:52:51.376 --> 00:52:52.544
I need to see this guy.

1364
00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:53.545
I want to see him too.

1365
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:54.921
I think we should mayberide together?

1366
00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:55.922
[impatiently]Amy.

1367
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:58.300
Or. I could just breakthe speed limit

trying to rush to get tothe hotel in front of you.

1369
00:53:02.971 --> 00:53:06.349
You can askall the questions.

I'm with the Garrison PD.

1379

and I need to talkto one of your guests.

1380
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.453
Sebastian Dusquenes.

1381
00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:30.999
Well. well. well.Isn't this a surprise?

1382
00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:33.710
The policemanand the professor.

1383
00:53:33.752 --> 00:53:35.837
We need to sit down and havea conversation.

1384
00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.088
Oh.

1385
00:53:37.088 --> 00:53:39.549
Well. that sounds ominous.Do I need to call my lawyer?

1386
00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:42.510
You need to sit down.

1387
00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:43.511
Watch my bags?

1388
00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:45.055
Of course.

1389
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:49.017
Here's the thing. Sebastian.we found the bullet

1390
00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.102
that was fired throughthe mirror on stage.

1391
00:53:51.102 --> 00:53:52.938
and we know that it was firedfrom the catwalk

1392
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:55.106
at the same time that Lacyfired her shot.

1393
00:53:55.106 --> 00:53:56.441
and we know thatit's your bullet.

1394
00:53:56.441 --> 00:53:58.693
because we foundyour fingerprints on it.

1395
00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.612
We also found your fingerprintson the catwalk

1396
00:54:00.612 --> 00:54:02.322
where the stage light fell.

1397
00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:08.954
Okay. okay. I dropped the light.

1398
00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:11.748
But it was... it was six feetaway from her.

1399
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.625
And yeah. I fired the gun.but it was...

1400
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:15.460
it was nowhere near her.

1401
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.338
I wasn't trying to kill Bella.

1402
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.257
I was... I was just tryingto frighten her.

1403
00:54:20.298 --> 00:54:22.175
-Why?-Why?

1404
00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:24.970
Well you know. you...you called it.

1405
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:26.846
I was trying to win her back.

1406
00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:28.640
By dropping a lampon her head?

1407
00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:34.145
I. I thought that if Bella wasafraid that someone in Garrison

1408
00:54:34.187 --> 00:54:37.273
was trying to...to harm her.

1409
00:54:37.315 --> 00:54:39.651
I mean. I could convinceher to...

1410
00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:41.486
to retreat back to New York.

1411
00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:46.157
But she told me at the partyshe wasn't going anywhere.

1412
00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:49.035
She had fallen in love.

1413
00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:54.332
She said this timeit was the real thing.

1414
00:54:54.374 --> 00:54:56.626
I mean. look. guys. if you justlet me talk to Bella.

1415
00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:58.670
I can explain everything.

1416
00:55:00.672 --> 00:55:02.924
[melancholy music]♪

1417
00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:06.511
What?

1418
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:10.348
Sebastian... Bella's dead.

1419
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:17.063
So he confessed to droppingthe light and shooting the gun.

1420
00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:19.232
but he claims not to knowthat Bella was dead.

1421
00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:20.900
You buy it?

1422
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:22.360
I wish I had more evidence.

1423
00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:24.070
Well. here's the autopsy report.

1424
00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:26.239
Bella had ingested aconite.

1425
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:28.742
It's a homeopathic compoundused to treat the flu.

1426
00:55:28.783 --> 00:55:31.911
but in larger doses can inducea heart attack.

What are you talking about?

Uh. Amy here.

1431
00:55:35.582 --> 00:55:37.751
She had a suspicionthat Bella's heart attack

1432
00:55:37.792 --> 00:55:40.503
was caused by a drug.

1433
00:55:40.545 --> 00:55:41.796
You were right.

1434
00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:44.591
Uh. how long does it takefor this drug to start working?

1435
00:55:44.632 --> 00:55:46.551
Under an hour.

1436
00:55:46.551 --> 00:55:49.429
Well then. I need to figure outwhat Bella had for breakfast.

1437
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.722
You know whereyou can get aconite?

1438

1439
00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:52.640
Yeah.

1440
00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:53.892
You know I got a whole listof medications

1441
00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:56.227
that were stolen fromour local drug store?

1442
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.232
All right. let's seewhat we got in here.

1443
00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:03.109

Ah. Aconite.

1448
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.288
Here's what I don't understand.though.

1449
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:19.084
I mean. if the killer was tryingto conceal the theft of aconite.

1450
00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:21.127
why make you pay attentionto that burglary

1451
00:56:21.169 --> 00:56:23.254
by ambushing Claire?

1452
00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:24.589
It just doesn't make any sense.

1453
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:27.926
No. It doesn't.

1454
00:56:27.967 --> 00:56:31.763
It's a really good question.Amy.

1455
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:35.308
But it's one that I'm goingto have to answer by myself.

1456
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.477
Oh.

1457
00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:40.271

How do you?...

1902
01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:20.612
And that their kids nameswere Jocelyn and Duncan.

1903
01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:24.032
Your parents were killed dueto George Quirk's negligence.

1904

when his kid moved here.

1906

to you at Elliot's computer.

two of which you wantedthe police to notice.

1921
01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.867
which was good.because Claire did notice.

1922
01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:11.663
She started running Main Street.and then you lured her in.

1923
01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.081

1929
01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:23.967
And then. you plantall the evidence for us

1930
01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:25.719
to find in Elliot's shed.

1931
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.472
Mmhmm. and then you come hereto report to Duncan.

1932
01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:31.141
but while you were at it.you told us about the affair.

1933
01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:32.642
and it was... it wasalso brilliant

1934
01:19:32.642 --> 01:19:36.646
because we were your shouldersto cry on.

1935
01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:39.316
And then the next morningyou made that shake for Bella.

1936
01:19:39.357 --> 01:19:41.276
didn't you Duncan?

1937
01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.653
You just had to getyour reward.

1938

your sister tells Amy

1940
01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.662
that Elliot knew aboutthe security being out.

1941
01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:55.540
so we would blame himfor trying to kill you

1942
01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:57.667
but accidentally killing Bella.

1943
01:19:57.667 --> 01:20:01.171
And you would get your revengeon George Quirk.

1944
01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:02.964

"The people who lie the most

2008

"are nearly always the clumsiest at it.

2009
01:23:02.852 --> 01:23:04.229
"and they're easier to foolwith lies

2010
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.064
"than most people. too.

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.692
"You'd think they'd beon the look-out for lies.

2012

"but they seem to be the veryones that will believe

2013
01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.363
"almost anything at all."
