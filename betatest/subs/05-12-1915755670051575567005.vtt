- Could I get a
Whiskey knee please?

15
00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:19.445
Thank you.

16
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:21.880
Anyone sitting here?

17
00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.452
- No.

18
00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:27.352
- Great.

19
00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:30.956
Thank you sir.

20
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:33.058
What's your name?

21
00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:35.127
- Katie.

22
00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:36.728
- Nice to meet you. I'm Johnny.

23
00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:39.815
What's the matter?

24
00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:41.599
You worried Santa didn't
get your letter this year?

25
00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:45.337
Oh no. you just
found out you're on the

26
00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.606
naughty list. didn't you?

27
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:48.974
Don't worry. you get used to it.

28
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:51.310
That's better. a little smile.

29
00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:53.979
So. what seems to
be the real problem?

30
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.616
- My boyfriend is
planning to leave me.

31
00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:59.485
- [Johnny] Oh. and
he told you this?

32
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:01.153
- No.

33
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.721
- So. how do you know?

34
00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.390
- [Katie] Because
he's done it before.

35
00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:06.859
- [Johnny] And you
took him back?

36
00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:08.861
- Every time.

37
00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:10.562
- So he's done it
more than once?

38
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.732
Three times?

39
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.217
Wow!

40
00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.701
And you're still
with this guy. huh?

41
00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:17.803
- Yup.

42
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.371
- Katie. Katie. Katie.
do you not know

43
00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:20.539
how beautiful you are?

44
00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.084
- Have you ever loved someone

45
00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:37.823
so much that it felt like
you loved them before?

46
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:39.024
Been with them before?

47
00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.860
Like in another life.

48
00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:44.596
I have never loved anyone
the way that I love this guy.

49
00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:46.899
It's completely debilitating.

50
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:48.167
- Wow.

51
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.434
So how long have you
two been together?

52
00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.137
- Well if you take all the
time that we've been together

53
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.740
and you subtract all the time
that we've been broken up.

54
00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:56.542
about three years.

55
00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:57.376
- Oh.

56
00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:58.544
That's pretty serious huh?

57
00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:01.580
- I thought so.

58
00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:02.948
- Well look. any guy
who would break up

59
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.950
with his girl this
close to Christmas

60
00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:07.219
is a complete douche.

61
00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.923
But you should forget
about this guy

62
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.859
and just come dance with me.

63
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:14.760
What do you say?

64
00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:19.431
- I can't.

65
00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:22.601
- Oh come on. I'll help
you forget all about him.

66
00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.269
- Sorry.

67
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.170
- Okay.

68
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.606
Have a good night.

69
00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:40.619
(slow paced music)

70
00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:42.821
- What are you doing?

71
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.924
- You're not gonna like this.

72
00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:54.166
I'm leaving.

73
00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:56.802
- Now?

74
00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:58.604
- Yeah.

75
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.374
- You know Michael.
someone just told me

76
00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:03.709
that only a real
douche would break up

77
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.410
with someone this
close to Christmas.

78
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.679
- Yeah. I know. and I'm sorry.

79
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.414
- You know what.
it doesn't even matter.

80
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.282
It's not like you
were planning to come

81
00:04:10.284 --> 00:04:12.184
home with me
for Christmas anyway.

82
00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:13.819
- Katie. I just...

83
00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:15.487
It doesn't feel right anymore.

84
00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.022
We don't feel right.

85
00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:19.524
- That's because you
never really committed.

86
00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:20.759
How can it feel
right when you always

87
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.861
have one foot out the door!

88
00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:23.929
- Look. I'm sorry.

89
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:25.597
I do love you. okay?

90
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.599
- So what?

91
00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:32.971
Your love comes and
goes like the weather!

92
00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:35.307
It can't withstand even
the smallest discomfort!

93
00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.276
What good is love like that!

94
00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:38.810
- Look. I'm sorry okay!

95
00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:40.045
I really do love you.

96
00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.146
but I can't.

97
00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.082
- I don't care.

98
00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:45.884
You know what. just go.

99
00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:46.718
Go!

100
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.487
And don't you ever come back!

101
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.023
Don't call me. don't text me.

102
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:53.959
don't email me.
don't run into me.

103
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:55.961
don't even think about me!

104
00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.430
Just go and don't
come back ever!

105
00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.839
(Katie sobbing)

106
00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:14.046
- Hello!

107
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:16.748
Katie!

108
00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:18.784
Are you here?

109
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.719
Katie!

110
00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:22.888
Hello!

111
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.427
Ooh.

112
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.897
(light music)

113
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:35.567
Boy.

114
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.170
Hey.

115
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.505
How's ya doing?

116
00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:44.176
- Awesome.

117
00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:45.077
- Yeah?

118
00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:47.646
It looks like it.

119
00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.118
Is there anything I can do?

120
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.220
- No.

121
00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.790
- Do you want me
to scratch his car

122
00:05:58.792 --> 00:05:59.791
or his eyes out?

123
00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:02.694
- Yes please.

124
00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:04.830
- Done.

125
00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:08.667
- Valerie. when did I become
one of those pathetic girls?

126
00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:12.037
You know. the ones
who cry over a guy

127
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.640
who's dumped them over
and over and over again?

128
00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:17.342
- It's only been a week.

129
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:18.610
Give yourself some time.

130
00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:22.180
- It's the fourth time!

131
00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.281
- So?

132
00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:24.516
What. it shouldn't hurt?

133
00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:26.485
- No. it shouldn't hurt.

134
00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:28.253
I mean. what did I expect?

135
00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:29.321
That time would be different?

136
00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:31.857
That this time he'd
be there for me?

137
00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.558
And I keep telling myself.
"Katie.

138
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.193
"you deserve someone
who loves you

139
00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.294
"and who wants to be with you.

140
00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:37.796
"This guys has
done you a favor."

141
00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:39.664
And you know what.
I know I'm right.

142
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.700
But it doesn't matter.

143
00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:45.837
Because I still miss him.

144
00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:49.508
I miss the way that
he would roll over

145
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.277
and tell me that he loved me
in the middle of the night.

146
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.080
And I miss his arms around me

147
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.482
and the way he smelled.

148
00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:03.021
My whole body hurts
with missing him.

149
00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:03.922
- I know.

150
00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:06.024
I'm so sorry.

151
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:09.528
- And it's not just him.

152
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.531
You know. it's the whole life
that we had planned together.

153
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:14.733
You know. the house.
and the kids.

154
00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:16.935
and the places that we would go.

155
00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:20.005
And now I have to start over.

156
00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:21.840
I have to date.

157
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:22.974
(Katie crying)

158
00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:26.144
- At least you can go
home for the holidays.

159
00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:28.213
You've got your family.

160
00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:29.514
- Oh yeah. those people.

161
00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:31.917
Won't that be lovely?

162
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.654
I get to go home
all alone. again.

163
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.056
Another failed relationship
under my belt.

164
00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:40.792
- Your family doesn't
care about that.

165
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:41.693
- No.

166
00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:43.662
No they don't.

167
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.732
Those people with
their perfect houses

168
00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:50.936
and spouses and cars and kids.

169
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.505
They make me feel bad about
myself

170
00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:55.907
just by being who they are.

171
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.742
- What are you talking about?

172
00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.644
Katie. your life is perfect!

173
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.012
- No.

174
00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:02.379
- You're successful.
you've got a great place.

175
00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:03.381
you got the greatest best friend

176
00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:04.883
anyone could ask for. I mean.

177
00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.552
your family should be jealous
of your life for that alone.

178
00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:09.955
- That's true.

179
00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:10.856
- Thank you.

180
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.297
- How can a man tell
you that he loves you

181
00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:21.333
and then leave?

182
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.870
- I don't know.

183
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.908
I won't leave.
I'll stay with you.

184
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:35.747
(festive bells ringing)

185
00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:46.124
("Away In A Manger"
instrumental)

186
00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:18.123
- Good morning Charlie.

187
00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:24.596
(Katie chuckling)

188
00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:25.997
Oh. how are you?

189
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:32.771
Hi baby.

190
00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.143
How are you?

191
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.880
Sorry I haven't been
here for a few days.

192
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:45.250
Did you miss me?

193
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.521
No. you were fed so you're fine?

194
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:58.630
Water looks good.

195
00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:02.500
All dirty.

196
00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.539
You'll be happy to know
Michael and I broke up again.

197
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.679
So. you are the
only man in my life.

198
00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:15.714
Once again.

199
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:20.785
(light solemn music)

200
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:29.594
Gonna be gone for a few days.

201
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:33.331
I have to go home.

202
00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:37.435
Because the only thing worse

203
00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.571
than going home
for Christmas alone.

204
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.240
would be not going
home at all. so.

205
00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:45.677
But Cindy's gonna be here.

206
00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.612
She's gonna walk
you every day. okay?

207
00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:50.382
Okay?

208
00:10:50.384 --> 00:10:51.916
So don't worry.

209
00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.018
You're taken care of.

210
00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.658
Love you.

211
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:02.093
(door thudding)

212
00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:03.328
Oh. I'm sorry.

213
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.714
(airplane whirring)

214
00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:02.654
It's okay Katie.

215
00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.191
This is the last time.

216
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.728
This is the last time you ever

217
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.197
come home alone
for Christmas ever again.

218
00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:26.077
(light upbeat music)

219
00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:32.617
- So nothing?

220
00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:34.619
- No.

221
00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.889
- Michael didn't text
you on Christmas day?

222
00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:38.923
- Nope.

223
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.359
- And you didn't
text him either?

224
00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:42.260
- No.

225
00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:44.496
- Well good.

226
00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:47.132
It's a new year.
time to move on.

227
00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:49.734
- Han didn't call or text
me over Christmas either.

228
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.071
- Han doesn't even know
you're interested in him.

229
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.776
- Actually. as annoying
as you are.

230
00:12:58.745 --> 00:12:59.911
I agree.

231
00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.580
I do deserve better and
I'm ready to move on.

232
00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.132
- Excellent!

233
00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:05.683
I know the perfect
place for you guys.

234
00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:07.819
What are you doing Saturday?

235
00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:10.188
- Well. actually.
I have already--

236
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.023
- [Waiter] Are you
guys ready to order?

237
00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:15.126
- Oh. hi Han.

238
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.027
How are you?

239
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.829
- Good.

240
00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.167
- Keiko. it's Han.

241
00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:27.372
- Hi Han.

242
00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:28.273
- Hi.

243
00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.312
- Han. why don't you
just give us a second.

244
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.647
We're not quite ready.

245
00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:36.614
Thank you
- Sure.

246
00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:43.755
- [Valerie] Anyway.
you were saying?

247
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:46.157
- I'm now on Binder.

248
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.426
- The hook-up app?

249
00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:49.360
- It's a dating app.

250
00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:50.261
- Oh no!

251
00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:54.098
- You don't need Binder.
I've got you covered.

252
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.334
- Valerie. I cannot go
clubbing every weekend

253
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.236
in the hopes that there will be

254
00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.137
a single attractive male.
in the right age range.

255
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.473
who happens to be looking
for a relationship.

256
00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:04.609
At least with Binder
I can set age limits.

257
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:08.213
look at pictures. and reasonably
expect them to be single.

258
00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:09.981
- But Binder?

259
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.716
- Aren't you on Binder?

260
00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.284
- Yes!

261
00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.619
- It can't be that bad.

262
00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:16.821
- It is.

263
00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.440
- Okay. whatever.

264
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.058
This is how people
our age meet now.

265
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.193
I already have a
dinner date on Thursday.

266
00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.795
And my goal is two a week.

267
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:26.164
- Two what?

268
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.832
- Two

269
00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.335
meets. dates.

270
00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:31.436
meetings?

271
00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:32.971
- You set goals?

272
00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:35.673
- Yes.

273
00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:39.143
And I'm already meeting
and exceeding those goals.

274
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.180
- Okay.

275
00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:44.315
The consummate
professional dater.

276
00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:45.316
- Yes I am.

277
00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:47.485
- Good luck.

278
00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:53.291
(light upbeat jazz music)

279
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:03.534
- How do I find you?

280
00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:15.046
Hi.

281
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.180
- [Male Blonde] Hi.

282
00:15:16.182 --> 00:15:17.015
- Katie.

283
00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:17.916
- Matthew.

284
00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:19.684
You look great.

285
00:15:19.686 --> 00:15:22.220
- Oh. thank you.

286
00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:24.289
- So tell me all about yourself.

287
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.790
- Oh.

288
00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:28.893
Okay. I design websites.

289
00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:32.664
So I do brands. logos.
all of that kind of stuff.

290
00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:34.599
I live in NoHo.

291
00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:35.433
- NoHo?

292
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.268
I rehearse there all the time.

293
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.504
- Oh. you're a dancer?

294
00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:41.839
- Singer in a band.

295
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:43.107
Razor Blade Kiss.

296
00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.010
I'm quite popular overseas.

297
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.081
My band and I are
cutting a new album soon.

298
00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.482
You should look me
up on YouTube.

299
00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:53.251
I have over a million
subscribers.

300
00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:55.720
You never heard of me?

301
00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:57.722
Matthew Hagen of
Razor Blade Kiss?

302
00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.625
- No. sorry.

303
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.660
- We're kind of like a modern U2

304
00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.395
with a touch of punk.

305
00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:06.564
I just got back from Germany

306
00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.732
and we're heading for
Sweden in a couple weeks.

307
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.902
Touring makes it
hard to meet people.

308
00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:12.370
Well. not to meet girls.

309
00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:13.805
There are plenty of girls.

310
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.607
But it's hard to find
a quality relationship.

311
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.509
As in yourself.

312
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.311
And then when you find her.

313
00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.146
you gotta make sure
that she's confident.

314
00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:23.581
I'm always on tour
and girls are always

315
00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:24.849
throwing themselves at me.

316
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:28.419
And she has to understand that
that's just the way it is.

317
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:29.887
That's just life.

318
00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:34.425
(upbeat jazz music)

319
00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:35.693
And we get divorced

320
00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:37.962
and she takes half
of everything.

321
00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:39.797
Including intellectual property.

322
00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:41.366
The best part of my marriage

323
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:42.500
was the divorce.

324
00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:46.304
My songs. my lyrics. my music.

325
00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:48.039
I don't know what
was wrong with her.

326
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:50.541
She would just like.
throw bottles at me.

327
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:54.946
Just didn't wanna be
with her anymore.

328
00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:56.481
She was so clingy.

329
00:16:56.483 --> 00:16:58.016
It was a relief for me.
you know?

330
00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.350
Like a burden off my shoulder.

331
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.786
She just couldn't get used to
me being gone all the time.

332
00:17:02.722 --> 00:17:04.455
You don't have
that problem. right?

333
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.925
- I have an early morning

334
00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:08.760
tomorrow.
- Really?

335
00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:09.594
- [Katie] Yeah.

336
00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:10.528
Sorry. I have to go.

337
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.396
- Okay.

338
00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:12.897
I'll take care of this.

339
00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:13.731
- Are you sure?

340
00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:14.599
I'm totally happy
to pay my half.

341
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:15.867
- No. no. it's my pleasure.

342
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.802
It's nice to find someone

343
00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:20.872
that's not interested in
me for the fame. you know?

344
00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:24.475
- Yeah.

345
00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:27.078
Okay. goodnight.

346
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.252
- That's crazy.

347
00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:35.503
So he said that?

348
00:17:35.504 --> 00:17:36.753
That it was nice to
spend time with somebody

349
00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:40.091
who wasn't in interested
in just for his fame?

350
00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:40.925
- Yes.
(Valerie laughs)

351
00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:42.093
- That's funny.

352
00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:43.161
So. what did you say?

353
00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.730
- I said. "Well. I've never
heard of you.

354
00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:46.931
"Check please."

355
00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:49.333
- Okay. well.
could've been worse.

356
00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:51.102
At least you got that
out of your system.

357
00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:52.370
- What do you mean?

358
00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:54.672
- Dating on Binder. ugh.

359
00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:55.473
- Are you crazy?

360
00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.442
I am just getting started.

361
00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:59.777
Yes it was a mistake
to do dinner. right?

362
00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:03.181
From now on. meets will be
limited to lunch and coffee.

363
00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:05.016
- What's a meet?

364
00:18:05.018 --> 00:18:06.150
- That's what I'm calling it.

365
00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:07.485
A meet.

366
00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:08.986
- [Keiko] Not a date?

367
00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:11.155
- No. a date is when
two people have met

368
00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:12.123
and they know that they like
each other

369
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:14.058
and they wanna see
each other again.

370
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.160
- Okay. so like a blind date.

371
00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:18.729
- A blind date is when
other people in your life

372
00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:20.631
have set you up and you
know absolutely nothing

373
00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.150
about the person.

374
00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:23.668
With Binder.
you've seen pictures.

375
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.871
you've communicated. you just
haven't met face to face.

376
00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:30.875
- Meet is a verb not a noun.

377
00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:32.443
- [Valerie] English lesson. yes.

378
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.046
- Yes. well.
I'm making it a thing.

379
00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:39.383
From now on a meet is
a previously arranged.

380
00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:42.920
face-to-face meeting for people
who've only ever met online.

381
00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:43.855
- Okay.

382
00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:44.689
- [Katie] Okay.

383
00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:46.724
- Okay.

384
00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:48.758
So. any prospective
meets in the near future?

385
00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:51.129
- Actually. yes.

386
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.614
Lunch tomorrow.

387
00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:54.098
And I've been talking
to this really cute guy

388
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.433
every night this week.

389
00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:56.334
- Uh-oh.

390
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.103
- What?
- What do you mean uh-oh?

391
00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:02.073
- [Keiko] Sounds like an
N-S-T-T-T-A-N.

392
00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:03.674
- What's.

393
00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:04.942
what is that?

394
00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:07.778
- N-S-T-T-T-A-N stands for.

395
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.248
needs someone to
talk to at night.

396
00:19:11.184 --> 00:19:13.718
- Okay. I'm pretty sure
that's not a thing.

397
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.319
- Maybe it is. I mean--

398
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.587
- You guys don't know?

399
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.093
N-S-T-T-T-A-N's have never
seen the light of day.

400
00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:25.696
In fact. no one has
actually ever met one.

401
00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:28.466
But he'll text you
every single night

402
00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:29.667
and you'll think to yourself.

403
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.869
"Hm. he likes me."

404
00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:35.173
And maybe he does. but
when daylight comes.

405
00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.808
he will not dare
venture outside.

406
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.344
He is much safer
inside the phone.

407
00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:43.781
Trust me. you don't
wanna waste your time.

408
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.418
- Okay. I seriously doubt that.

409
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.220
- He could be an
- No. he's not a

410
00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:51.022
- [Everyone] N-S-T-T-T-A-N.

411
00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.158
- Okay. whatever.
- Totally is.

412
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.159
- [Katie] Whatever.

413
00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:56.160
- It sounds like it's
going really great.

414
00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:57.995
- Uh-huh. you know
what you guys--

415
00:19:57.997 --> 00:19:59.030
- She has no clue.

416
00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.432
- I have an N-S-T. right now.

417
00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:02.767
He didn't show up.

418
00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:03.701
True story.

419
00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.770
- You guys. you'll see.

420
00:20:05.772 --> 00:20:09.840
("Deck The Halls" instrumental)

421
00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:14.212
Hey handsome. you wanna
take me for a ride?

422
00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:17.515
(Katie gasps)

423
00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:18.416
You scared me.

424
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.220
What are you doing in there?

425
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.021
- The leak in his faucet.
(tense music)

426
00:20:24.023 --> 00:20:24.922
- Oh.

427
00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:29.393
(light music)

428
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.498
Hi baby.

429
00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:38.436
Well you're very clean today.

430
00:21:10.837 --> 00:21:11.736
Thank you.

431
00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:31.689
Thanks Han.

432
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.795
Can I help you?

433
00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.598
- Is Keiko coming?

434
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.200
- No. I'm supposed to be meeting
someone from Binder here.

435
00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:46.370
You know. like a blind date.
but I guess he's not coming.

436
00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:48.205
Can I get a chicken sandwich?

437
00:21:48.207 --> 00:21:50.174
- So. she's not coming?

438
00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:52.743
- No.

439
00:21:58.384 --> 00:22:00.051
Was that a yes on the sandwich?

440
00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.491
- Sorry I'm late.

441
00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:10.828
Totally slept in. Cody.

442
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.896
- Oh. Katie.

443
00:22:12.732 --> 00:22:15.032
You slept in til one
in the afternoon?

444
00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:16.200
(Cody chuckles)

445
00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:17.501
- Yeah.

446
00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:18.602
- Really?

447
00:22:18.604 --> 00:22:20.388
You don't have to work today?

448
00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:22.173
- No. I'm kind of
between jobs right now.

449
00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:24.108
Yeah. I came out here
to be an actor.

450
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.309
so I've been living
off my savings.

451
00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:27.778
but it hasn't happened as
fast as I hoped it would.

452
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.314
Looks like I may have to
get that job after all.

453
00:22:30.316 --> 00:22:33.184
- [Katie] Yeah. I've heard that
that acting gig can be hard.

454
00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.852
- Yeah.

455
00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.519
It's all right. my friends been
letting me stay at his place.

456
00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:40.024
but I think he's getting tired
of me being on the couch. so--

457
00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:41.926
- How long have you been
sleeping on his couch?

458
00:22:41.928 --> 00:22:42.993
- Two years.

459
00:22:44.764 --> 00:22:45.830
I know. I know.

460
00:22:45.832 --> 00:22:47.131
I just keep thinking
the next auditions

461
00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:48.733
gonna be the one. you know?

462
00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:52.236
(Katie laughing)

463
00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:53.204
- Yeah.

464
00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:54.338
Oh. thanks Han.

465
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.506
- Hey man.

466
00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:56.941
Nothing for me man. thanks.

467
00:23:08.855 --> 00:23:10.020
- You don't wanna eat anything?

468
00:23:10.022 --> 00:23:12.323
- No. I really can't
afford anything right now.

469
00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:13.624
So go right ahead.

470
00:23:13.626 --> 00:23:15.493
- Oh. I'm sorry.
you were 20 minutes late

471
00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:16.460
so I thought you weren't coming.

472
00:23:16.462 --> 00:23:17.528
I just went ahead and ordered.

473
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.497
- Perfect. no problem.

474
00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:20.998
- Do you want something
to drink at least?

475
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.567
- No man. I can't afford it.

476
00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:26.237
- Well. I'll buy it for you.
no problem.

477
00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:28.105
- Are you sure?

478
00:23:28.107 --> 00:23:29.440
- [Katie] Yeah. please.

479
00:23:29.442 --> 00:23:30.341
- Okay.

480
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.246
- I'll take a mocha frappe whip

481
00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:38.449
with a splash of cinnamon
in a to-go cup. please.

482
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:42.753
Thank you.

483
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:44.288
- Mm-hm. no problem.

484
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.689
- [Cody] What do you do?

485
00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:47.458
- Oh. I design websites--

486
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.726
(phone blaring music)

487
00:23:48.728 --> 00:23:50.127
- I'm so sorry.

488
00:23:50.129 --> 00:23:51.829
I gotta get this.

489
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.830
- No problem.

490
00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:54.598
Yeah.

491
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:05.242
(slow paced music)

492
00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:27.431
- Awe man.

493
00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:30.868
That's gonna be cold.

494
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.403
Okay. where were we?

495
00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:35.439
- Well--
(phone blaring music)

496
00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:36.407
- Son of a!

497
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.009
I'm so sorry.

498
00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:40.478
I gotta go.

499
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.946
But I really
wanna see you again.

500
00:24:41.948 --> 00:24:43.180
Can I call you?

501
00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:47.351
- Sure.

502
00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:48.419
- Awesome.

503
00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:49.553
You're beautiful.

504
00:25:04.437 --> 00:25:07.171
- You've gotta be freaking
kidding me.

505
00:25:11.611 --> 00:25:14.645
And then he said. "You're
beautiful" and left.

506
00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:16.247
- Wait. wait. whoa.

507
00:25:16.249 --> 00:25:18.983
He said. "You're beautiful?"

508
00:25:18.985 --> 00:25:20.384
Really?

509
00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:21.784
- That's the part of that
story that upsets you?

510
00:25:21.787 --> 00:25:24.822
Not that he took
his latte and left?

511
00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:26.090
- That's not--

512
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:27.357
- I mean. I'm pretty
sure that Binder

513
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.059
is how this guy eats.

514
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:30.160
If I'd bought him lunch.

515
00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:31.495
he probably would have stayed.

516
00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:32.663
And if he'd been on time.

517
00:25:32.665 --> 00:25:34.398
I probably would have
bought him lunch.

518
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.634
- Yeah. you probably
should stop doing that.

519
00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:37.968
- That's nothing.

520
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.737
Last week this guy
invited me over

521
00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:42.873
and as I was driving. he
texted me to pick up a pizza.

522
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:45.442
And I went over there and I
didn't wanna have sex with him

523
00:25:45.444 --> 00:25:48.279
and he got all mad
and kicked me out

524
00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:50.781
and still kept the pizza!

525
00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:52.716
- Keiko!
- Keiko. that's. why?

526
00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:53.918
- [Keiko] It's okay.
I punctured a couple

527
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.152
of his tires on the way out.

528
00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:58.339
- Good girl.

529
00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.790
- Keiko. why would
you go to his house?

530
00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:01.509
- What do you mean?

531
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.227
- I mean. if you're gonna
get up off the couch.

532
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:05.896
get dressed. get in your
car and drive somewhere.

533
00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:07.164
the very least you can expect

534
00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.933
is this guy to do the same.

535
00:26:08.935 --> 00:26:10.801
Honey. you're worth
getting off the couch for.

536
00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:12.670
- And he could have
been a serial killer.

537
00:26:12.672 --> 00:26:15.239
- Yes. and that.

538
00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:16.840
And. if this guys
upset that you're

539
00:26:16.842 --> 00:26:19.176
not putting out on
the very first meet.

540
00:26:19.178 --> 00:26:21.912
he is not interested in who
you are as an individual.

541
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:22.746
- He's not?

542
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:23.614
- No!

543
00:26:23.616 --> 00:26:26.083
You could be the most amazing.

544
00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:28.452
wonderful. funny
person in the world.

545
00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:29.920
but to him you're just a sex toy

546
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.289
that's delivered
itself to his house.

547
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:34.124
Of course he's upset
when you're broken.

548
00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:37.995
- Unless of course you're
just there for the sex.

549
00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:39.613
- Yes. of course.

550
00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:41.230
If you're just there to meet
your own needs. no problem.

551
00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:43.367
But don't get pressured
into meeting his.

552
00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:47.438
- Maybe if I meet
his needs. he'll--

553
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.272
- What?

554
00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:49.206
Fall in love with you?

555
00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:51.108
- Yes.

556
00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:53.009
- Keiko. were you even
attracted to this guy?

557
00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:55.813
- Well I don't know.

558
00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:56.714
- Wow.

559
00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:59.750
- Keiko. if you're
not attracted to him.

560
00:26:59.752 --> 00:27:02.353
you don't need him to be
attracted to you.

561
00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:05.289
- But he should be
attracted to me!

562
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:06.924
- Of course Keiko.
- Yes!

563
00:27:06.926 --> 00:27:08.592
- [Katie] Obviously he
should be attracted to you.

564
00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:11.629
but these aren't
self-actualized individuals

565
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:14.098
who are making appropriate
assessments of our worth.

566
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.101
They're insecure jerks.

567
00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:18.969
Honey. you are amazing.

568
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:20.738
Any guy who can't
see that is an idiot.

569
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.773
That is about him.
it's not about you.

570
00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:25.075
- Okay.

571
00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:26.477
- [Katie] Yeah.

572
00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:27.778
- Wow. this was a really.

573
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.546
this was a great workout.

574
00:27:29.548 --> 00:27:30.547
(Katie laughing)

575
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:31.582
Let's go eat!

576
00:27:31.584 --> 00:27:32.783
- I can't.

577
00:27:32.785 --> 00:27:33.617
- Why?

578
00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:34.451
- I have a meet.

579
00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:36.754
- [Keiko] Oh. the meet.

580
00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:39.056
- Oh. trust me. that is
exactly how I feel about it.

581
00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:47.931
(door closing)

582
00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:48.832
Hi.

583
00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:52.670
I am so sorry that I'm late.

584
00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:54.772
- No worries.

585
00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:03.280
Wow. I love the
fact that you are tall!

586
00:28:03.282 --> 00:28:04.815
It's gonna be
great for the kids.

587
00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:07.618
- What kids?

588
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.452
- Oh. our kids.

589
00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:10.120
I want three of them by the way.

590
00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:12.122
Hey. what are you
doing tomorrow night?

591
00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:14.825
- I don't know.

592
00:28:14.827 --> 00:28:16.393
- We should go see a movie.

593
00:28:17.296 --> 00:28:18.195
- Oh.

594
00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:22.099
I don't think that I'm
available tomorrow night.

595
00:28:22.101 --> 00:28:23.133
- Oh. really?

596
00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:23.967
- [Katie] Yeah.

597
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.102
- Okay.

598
00:28:25.104 --> 00:28:26.937
Well how about Thursday then?

599
00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:30.207
- Should we order?

600
00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:32.776
- Yes. yes. we should order.

601
00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:36.914
And we should also go out to
a movie on Thursday night.

602
00:28:39.652 --> 00:28:40.551
- Yeah. I.

603
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:43.887
I just don't think I'm
interested.

604
00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:46.256
- Interested?

605
00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:47.758
What. in me?

606
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.625
How can you even say that?

607
00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:49.460
You don't even know me.

608
00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:51.462
We barely just met.

609
00:28:51.464 --> 00:28:54.098
- Yeah. and you're already
asking me out on another date.

610
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.065
- Yeah.

611
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.667
So what's the problem?

612
00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:01.238
Oh. oh. oh. oh really?

613
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.607
Oh god. you're one of those huh?

614
00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:04.908
- One of what?

615
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.345
- Would you be more attracted
to me if I was tall?

616
00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:12.049
- I don't know. would you be
attracted to me if I was fat?

617
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:12.883
- What?

618
00:29:12.885 --> 00:29:14.051
Ew. no. ugh. gross!

619
00:29:14.053 --> 00:29:15.886
- Oh my god.
- No. no. I knew it.

620
00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:16.820
- [Male] All these women.

621
00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:19.189
You give this whole
thing a bad name.

622
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:20.975
- What are you talking about?

623
00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:22.760
- You know exactly what I'm
talking about!

624
00:29:22.762 --> 00:29:26.330
Judging a man by the
size of his penis!

625
00:29:26.332 --> 00:29:27.831
- And would that
be anything like

626
00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:30.067
judging a woman
by her bra size?

627
00:29:30.069 --> 00:29:31.502
- No. and even if it was.

628
00:29:31.504 --> 00:29:33.470
I would clearly win that one.

629
00:29:33.472 --> 00:29:35.105
- Oh my gosh. okay.

630
00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:39.076
I guess we'll never know
because you could have stuffed.

631
00:29:40.546 --> 00:29:41.779
- You could have too.

632
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:46.049
- Okay. you know what. I'm out.

633
00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:47.484
Have a nice day.

634
00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:48.385
And.

635
00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:51.321
don't worry about tall you are.

636
00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:52.222
the chip on your shoulder.

637
00:29:52.224 --> 00:29:53.891
it's big enough for both of you.

638
00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:57.828
- Wow.

639
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.729
Okay.

640
00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:02.266
Tall women. am I right?

641
00:30:02.268 --> 00:30:03.600
Yeah. I'll say.

642
00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:11.241
- It can only get better.

643
00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:14.611
Only get better.

644
00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:22.386
(upbeat music)

645
00:30:30.229 --> 00:30:31.628
Hi.

646
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.163
- Hi.

647
00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:34.064
- Hello.

648
00:30:37.136 --> 00:30:38.202
- This is awkward.

649
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.940
- You're so beautiful.

650
00:30:42.942 --> 00:30:44.041
- The food here any good?

651
00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:45.375
- What can I get you to eat?

652
00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:46.476
- Do you work?

653
00:30:47.947 --> 00:30:48.779
- So what is that?

654
00:30:48.781 --> 00:30:51.014
Like websites and stuff?

655
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:52.449
- I'm a teacher.

656
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.084
- I do not like my
women to work.

657
00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:55.385
- I love kids.

658
00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:56.653
- You want kids?

659
00:30:56.655 --> 00:30:58.205
- Do you cook?

660
00:30:58.206 --> 00:30:59.756
- My real passion
is collecting stamps.

661
00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:02.292
- If you can't cook. how do
you expect to keep a man?

662
00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:03.761
- Don't you think
you're a little old

663
00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:05.229
for the whole starting
a family thing?

664
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:07.698
- You have good childbearing
hips. I like hip.

665
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.033
- I mean. that ship has sailed.

666
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.203
- You should see
my collection. it's.

667
00:31:15.174 --> 00:31:16.440
it's quite impressive.

668
00:31:17.576 --> 00:31:19.943
- You better be good in
bed if you can't cook.

669
00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:22.713
- You know. your chances of
having a down syndrome baby

670
00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:25.048
increase significantly
after 35 right?

671
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.217
- I put those hips to good use.

672
00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:28.151
- I mean. what are you?

673
00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:29.019
36?

674
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:30.220
39?

675
00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:32.522
- I keep you
barefoot and pregnant.

676
00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:34.524
- I even have a
Washington three set

677
00:31:34.526 --> 00:31:36.226
inauguration first president.

678
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:38.362
- I love horses.

679
00:31:38.364 --> 00:31:40.030
We need to go on a ride
together.

680
00:31:40.032 --> 00:31:41.231
- You know. it never
occurred to me

681
00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:44.868
that you would still wanna
have a family at your age.

682
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:45.702
- It could be really fun.

683
00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:47.437
I know some great trails.

684
00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:49.239
- There's only so much
you can do as a teacher

685
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:50.574
and that's why I love stamp
collecting

686
00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:54.177
because the options are endless.

687
00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:55.846
- Well. this was a
total waste of time.

688
00:31:55.848 --> 00:31:58.215
- Let's go for a ride.
what do ya say?

689
00:31:58.217 --> 00:32:02.719
- So. with your drink
you owe 23.43.

690
00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:03.921
Plus tip and tax.

691
00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:15.165
(phone ringing)

692
00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:16.450
- Hey.

693
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:17.734
- [Valerie] Hi. what are you
doing?

694
00:32:18.804 --> 00:32:20.804
- About to go riding
with that guy. remember?

695
00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:21.672
- Oh yeah.

696
00:32:21.674 --> 00:32:22.906
Date number two right?

697
00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:25.876
- Well. technically it's
a meet and now a date.

698
00:32:25.878 --> 00:32:27.811
but sure.

699
00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:29.113
- [Valerie] Well good.

700
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:30.414
I think you've only
gone on five or six

701
00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:32.983
second dates in the
past almost year.

702
00:32:32.985 --> 00:32:33.951
- Four.

703
00:32:33.953 --> 00:32:36.386
- [Valerie] What?
(solemn music)

704
00:32:36.388 --> 00:32:38.221
- This is my fourth.

705
00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:39.890
- [Valerie] This is only the
fourth time

706
00:32:39.892 --> 00:32:43.160
you've agreed to go out with
a guy again in all this time?

707
00:32:43.162 --> 00:32:44.361
- [Katie] Yup.

708
00:32:44.363 --> 00:32:46.330
- [Valerie] Are you
interested in this guy?

709
00:32:46.332 --> 00:32:47.748
- [Katie] Not really.

710
00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:49.165
- [Valerie] Well then why
are you going out with him?

711
00:32:49.168 --> 00:32:52.569
- Because I'm trying
to be more open minded.

712
00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:54.671
- [Valerie] Well. at least he
rides.

713
00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:55.639
- [Katie] Yeah.

714
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:57.741
- [Valerie] You sound so
enthusiastic.

715
00:32:57.743 --> 00:33:00.744
- [Katie] I know. I am trying.

716
00:33:00.746 --> 00:33:02.746
- [Valerie] Maybe that's the
problem.

717
00:33:02.748 --> 00:33:04.715
- You know what.
it doesn't even matter.

718
00:33:04.717 --> 00:33:05.582
- [Valerie] What does that mean?

719
00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:07.050
- It's too late.

720
00:33:07.052 --> 00:33:08.018
- [Valerie] Too late for what?

721
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.553
- Too late to meet someone.

722
00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:12.122
It's November. even if I met
the love of my life tomorrow.

723
00:33:12.124 --> 00:33:14.491
it'd be too soon to invite
him home for Christmas.

724
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:15.592
- [Valerie] That's true.

725
00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:17.394
Unless you were
trying to scare him off.

726
00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:18.395
- Exactly.

727
00:33:18.397 --> 00:33:19.997
- Michael and I
dated for three years

728
00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:22.666
and he still wouldn't come
home with me for Christmas.

729
00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:26.236
- [Valerie] Yeah. but he was
the ultimate commitment-phobe.

730
00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:29.473
- So. looks like
I'm going home alone

731
00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:31.375
for Christmas again this year.

732
00:33:32.711 --> 00:33:34.678
- [Valerie] Better than
going home with Michael.

733
00:33:38.584 --> 00:33:40.417
- After the breakup last year.

734
00:33:43.555 --> 00:33:45.889
I promised myself that

735
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:47.357
I would never have to go home

736
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.060
for Christmas alone ever again.

737
00:33:50.062 --> 00:33:51.728
That I would finally
find the right guy

738
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.130
and that this year
we'd be celebrating

739
00:33:53.132 --> 00:33:54.131
the holidays together.

740
00:33:54.133 --> 00:33:56.366
- [Valerie] Okay.
well that was a lot of

741
00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.001
pressure to put on yourself.

742
00:33:58.003 --> 00:34:00.504
No wonder you've been
acting like a total maniac.

743
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.706
- Good boy.

744
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:04.307
- [Valerie] You might
have to go home alone.

745
00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:07.244
but you could still find the
right guy before Christmas.

746
00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:11.281
- I have to go. he's here.

747
00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.150
- Excuse me. could you
get the gate?

748
00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:19.956
Or not.

749
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.292
Take your time.

750
00:34:42.514 --> 00:34:43.513
- Good boy.

751
00:34:44.683 --> 00:34:45.649
All right. let's back up a
little bit.

752
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.217
- Hi. sorry.
- Hey.

753
00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:52.556
(gate screeching)

754
00:34:53.392 --> 00:34:54.624
- [Date] Good boy.

755
00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:55.859
Let's back up.

756
00:34:56.995 --> 00:34:57.894
Thank you.

757
00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:01.731
Let's go. come on.

758
00:35:05.104 --> 00:35:06.236
Don't worry about it.

759
00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:09.106
Catch you on the next one.

760
00:35:09.108 --> 00:35:10.207
God. what a jerk.

761
00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:14.611
- I think he's
just a little weird.

762
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:16.313
- [Date] I don't know. if
he worked my boy Damnit.

763
00:35:16.315 --> 00:35:18.315
I'd have him fired in a
heartbeat.

764
00:35:18.317 --> 00:35:19.749
- Yeah.

765
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:21.184
Your horses name is Damnit?

766
00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:22.552
- Absolutely.

767
00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:24.321
So I can go "Whoa Damnit!"

768
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.389
Shall we head out?

769
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:27.524
- [Katie] Yup.

770
00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.658
- All right. come on boy.
let's go.

771
00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:32.662
(light upbeat music)

772
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.407
- This N-S-T-T-T-A
insight. mister big deal

773
00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:18.392
and all that stuff.

774
00:36:18.393 --> 00:36:19.376
So it's like it's just not a
possible

775
00:36:19.378 --> 00:36:20.710
thing to like go out in public.

776
00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:21.578
Oh hey!

777
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.646
- Hi.

778
00:36:22.648 --> 00:36:23.647
- [Keiko] Oh dear. you look...

779
00:36:23.649 --> 00:36:24.548
- Oh.

780
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.918
I think we need to get a new
place to eat.

781
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.121
- Because you defiled this
one with your Binder craze?

782
00:36:31.123 --> 00:36:32.155
- Yes.

783
00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:34.291
- But we always come here.

784
00:36:34.293 --> 00:36:35.859
- Yeah. if you hadn't
brought all your dates here

785
00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:37.260
that would have been awesome.

786
00:36:37.262 --> 00:36:38.795
Oh hey!

787
00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:40.931
- Hi Han. thank you.

788
00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:44.201
(perky music)

789
00:36:44.203 --> 00:36:46.102
- Hi Keiko.

790
00:36:46.104 --> 00:36:47.170
- Oh hi Han.

791
00:36:49.308 --> 00:36:52.509
- I was wondering if you eat.

792
00:36:52.511 --> 00:36:55.512
I mean. if you'd like to eat
with me?

793
00:36:55.514 --> 00:36:56.413
Dinner?

794
00:36:57.916 --> 00:36:58.815
- I would.

795
00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:01.818
- Tomorrow?

796
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.953
- Yes.

797
00:37:02.955 --> 00:37:03.853
- [Han] Okay.

798
00:37:08.293 --> 00:37:10.627
- Wow. did you guys see that?

799
00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:12.629
- Yes. it was more
painful than I ever

800
00:37:12.631 --> 00:37:13.597
could have imagined.

801
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:16.800
- He was so forthright.
so direct.

802
00:37:17.703 --> 00:37:18.969
- Well it's about time.

803
00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:22.639
- Some people like to do
things on their own time.

804
00:37:22.641 --> 00:37:23.740
When it's right!

805
00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:25.675
Not everybody
wants to force things

806
00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:28.378
to fit into their certain
timeframe.

807
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.080
- So you obviously told Keiko.

808
00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:32.015
- Oh. was it a secret?

809
00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:34.084
- Oh. I'm so sorry. I'm so
sorry.

810
00:37:34.086 --> 00:37:36.620
Han. just asked me out on a date

811
00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:39.155
and I just forgot about
the hoes before bros rule.

812
00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:41.458
- Why are we
calling ourselves hos?

813
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.193
Why is it that women have
endless names

814
00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:44.794
of shaming them for their
sexuality

815
00:37:44.796 --> 00:37:46.263
but there isn't one for men?

816
00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:48.732
- What?

817
00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:49.833
- Really?

818
00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:52.369
Ho. whore. tart. tramp.

819
00:37:52.371 --> 00:37:54.371
slut. skank. hussy. floozy.

820
00:37:54.373 --> 00:37:56.806
not one for men.

821
00:37:56.808 --> 00:37:57.774
- What about player?

822
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:58.908
- Yeah. but that's
always said like.

823
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.678
"Yeah player." like it's
a compliment or something.

824
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.512
- Yeah.

825
00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:03.346
- Pimp!

826
00:38:03.348 --> 00:38:04.381
- Oh yeah. like. "He be
pimping."

827
00:38:04.383 --> 00:38:06.750
or like "He's all
pimped out. uh."

828
00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:08.885
You can never shame a
guy for his sexuality.

829
00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:11.154
While it's amazing
women have sex at all

830
00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:14.090
the way we've been
beaten and killed for it.

831
00:38:14.092 --> 00:38:15.425
- You seem to do okay.

832
00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:17.327
- Yeah. that's 'cause
I'm a vigilante

833
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:21.298
fighting social injustice one
one night stand at a time.

834
00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:24.167
- Just like a regular superhero.

835
00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:25.068
- [Valerie] That's right.

836
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.537
- Sex with strangers?

837
00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:29.372
That's how you
fight the slut stigma?

838
00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:32.142
- Yes.

839
00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:34.911
By proudly and unashamedly
having sex with
whoever you want.

840
00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:36.479
You can't shame a
guy for having sex.

841
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:37.781
not even if you tried.

842
00:38:37.783 --> 00:38:40.050
If anything. there's a
congratulatory handshake.

843
00:38:40.052 --> 00:38:43.453
but women. we have let them
shame us throughout history.

844
00:38:44.923 --> 00:38:46.156
- That's actually true.

845
00:38:46.158 --> 00:38:47.691
- Mm-hm.

846
00:38:47.693 --> 00:38:49.359
- You're very philosophical
today.

847
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:50.193
- [Valerie] Thanks.

848
00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:52.228
- But I hate sex with strangers.

849
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.030
- You have to do it for you.

850
00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:55.332
- Well for me to really like it.

851
00:38:55.334 --> 00:38:57.934
I have to feel safe and open.

852
00:38:57.936 --> 00:38:59.736
- You only have to
feel safe and open

853
00:38:59.738 --> 00:39:01.404
if you wanna have an orgasm.

854
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.378
- Anything else?

855
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.113
- Nope. we're good. thanks.

856
00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:15.118
Gosh. all these Binder dates

857
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.954
and you haven't had sex with any
of them?

858
00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:19.089
- No.

859
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:20.390
I'm looking for Mr. Right so
I've been

860
00:39:20.392 --> 00:39:22.192
obeying all of the rules.

861
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:24.761
You know. no contacting
them until they contact you.

862
00:39:24.763 --> 00:39:26.496
No sex for a certain period of
time.

863
00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:28.531
and they open all the doors.

864
00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:32.202
- Wow. well no wonder
it hasn't been working.

865
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:33.436
- Well I don't know.

866
00:39:33.438 --> 00:39:35.739
I'm talking to all of these
guys that I've never met

867
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:38.007
and after a few conversations
I'm saying. "Let's meet."

868
00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:40.643
But sometimes that works
and sometimes it backfires.

869
00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:41.911
I mean. there's no way to know

870
00:39:41.913 --> 00:39:43.146
that if I had just waited.

871
00:39:43.148 --> 00:39:44.581
if they eventually
would have said.

872
00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:45.882
"Let's meet" on their own

873
00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.917
or if they were just a
N-S-T-T-T-A-N all along.

874
00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:50.253
- Oh gosh. I'm so glad
I don't have to deal

875
00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:51.788
with that anymore.

876
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.240
- What do you mean?

877
00:39:53.241 --> 00:39:54.691
- Well now that Han and I are
dating.

878
00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:59.262
- You haven't gone
on a single date yet.

879
00:39:59.264 --> 00:40:01.531
- Yeah. but we're soulmates.

880
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:03.767
- Soul. really?

881
00:40:03.769 --> 00:40:05.118
Soulmates?

882
00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:06.468
- When you know. you know.
- Soulmates?

883
00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:09.005
- [Keiko] Yes. someday you'll
understand.

884
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.944
- You know what Keiko.
I hope you're right.

885
00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:15.845
Oh.

886
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:19.149
Hm. it's a penny.

887
00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:22.752
I hope that when I find the one

888
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:25.722
that I am absolutely certain
that he is my soulmate.

889
00:40:25.724 --> 00:40:28.925
But right now. what I really
need is a holiday boyfriend.

890
00:40:30.796 --> 00:40:34.898
(penny shimmering)
(light upbeat music)

891
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.099
- What's a holiday boyfriend?

892
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:37.700
- Exactly what it sounds like.

893
00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:39.869
A temporary someone
to go see the lights

894
00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:41.771
and drink hot chocolate with

895
00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:45.141
or cuddle by the fire. and
decorate the tree with.

896
00:40:45.143 --> 00:40:46.643
- You don't have a fireplace.

897
00:40:46.645 --> 00:40:48.311
- [Keiko] Yeah.

898
00:40:48.313 --> 00:40:50.013
- Someone to provide some relief

899
00:40:50.015 --> 00:40:52.382
from the ever present
awareness that I am utterly

900
00:40:52.384 --> 00:40:53.616
and completely alone
at a time of year

901
00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:56.186
that is all about being
with the one you love.

902
00:40:57.689 --> 00:40:59.155
- We're here.

903
00:40:59.157 --> 00:41:00.323
- Yeah.
- Hello.

904
00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:01.157
- [Valerie] You know.
it's a good thing

905
00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:02.358
you're not being dramatic.

906
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.259
- Not her.

907
00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:09.332
- [Valerie] Not dramatic at all.

908
00:41:12.571 --> 00:41:15.572
- Some day. you'll find true
happiness.

909
00:41:15.574 --> 00:41:16.940
just like me and Han.

910
00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:21.444
- Okay. thank you so much Keiko.

911
00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:22.278
See you later.

912
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.112
Bye.

913
00:41:23.114 --> 00:41:24.514
- Okay. bye bye.

914
00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:28.117
- You know. this isn't
about Keiko right?

915
00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.018
- You think?

916
00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:31.788
Obviously I need to get a grip.

917
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.257
- [Valerie] And probably
apologize.

918
00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:35.091
- You think?

919
00:41:35.093 --> 00:41:36.626
I don't think she even--

920
00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:38.928
- Yeah. you're probably right.

921
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.464
- I don't know what's
wrong with me Val.

922
00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:43.266
I've been a failure at
my romantic relationships

923
00:41:43.268 --> 00:41:44.701
my whole life.

924
00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:46.436
I should be used to it.

925
00:41:46.438 --> 00:41:51.140
But this thing. this
promise that I made myself.

926
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:53.409
I believed me.

927
00:41:54.713 --> 00:41:57.380
And I really thought

928
00:41:57.382 --> 00:41:59.015
that I was never gonna have to

929
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:02.519
go through what I was
going through ever again.

930
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:04.854
That I would finally
find the one

931
00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:07.824
and that the next time I
went home for Christmas.

932
00:42:07.826 --> 00:42:09.325
he'd be with me.

933
00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:10.894
- I know. I'm so sorry.

934
00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:14.864
- And I've done everything
I can think of. you know?

935
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:15.698
- I know.

936
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.699
- [Katie] And nothing has
worked.

937
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:17.534
- I know.

938
00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:19.435
- And what is Keiko doing?

939
00:42:19.437 --> 00:42:21.070
- I don't know.

940
00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:23.640
(car beeping)

941
00:42:26.344 --> 00:42:29.345
(slow paced music)

942
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.390
- Just kill me.

943
00:43:09.387 --> 00:43:12.221
(chimes chiming)

944
00:43:37.382 --> 00:43:40.516
(light upbeat music)

945
00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:41.644
Are you limping?

946
00:44:43.982 --> 00:44:45.281
Whoa. whoa?

947
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.929
Crap.

948
00:45:03.468 --> 00:45:04.367
Let's go.

949
00:45:10.842 --> 00:45:12.508
You picked quite the day.

950
00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:16.145
Oh. hi!

951
00:45:16.915 --> 00:45:18.648
You're a long way out.

952
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.749
- [Horse Handler]
You walked him.

953
00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:22.485
- Yeah. he threw a shoe.

954
00:45:22.487 --> 00:45:24.454
- Yeah. I can see that.

955
00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:29.358
- Can I help you?

956
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.259
- Can I help you?

957
00:45:31.863 --> 00:45:34.330
- Not unless you got a
horseshoe in your pocket.

958
00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:38.101
- Nah.

959
00:45:38.103 --> 00:45:38.935
- No. we're okay.

960
00:45:38.937 --> 00:45:40.236
You can just go ahead.

961
00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:42.538
- Yeah I could. but then
I'd just worry about you

962
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.372
until you finally got back

963
00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:45.441
and my whole day
would be ruined.

964
00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:47.610
- Oh. well I would
hate to ruin your day.

965
00:45:47.612 --> 00:45:49.445
I mean. mine is going so well.

966
00:45:50.448 --> 00:45:53.483
(male chuckles)

967
00:45:53.485 --> 00:45:55.051
- Come on.

968
00:45:55.053 --> 00:45:58.287
(light festive music)

969
00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:06.696
A little rain never hurt nobody.

970
00:46:06.698 --> 00:46:08.131
Should clear up.

971
00:46:08.133 --> 00:46:09.499
- You think?

972
00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:10.967
- Yeah.

973
00:46:10.969 --> 00:46:12.001
- I hope so.

974
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:17.140
- So. who's that guy you went
riding with the other day?

975
00:46:17.142 --> 00:46:18.040
- What guy?

976
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.710
Oh. nobody.
(male chuckles)

977
00:46:20.712 --> 00:46:22.612
- That guy was a
real piece of work.

978
00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:23.947
- Yeah?

979
00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:25.281
He wasn't very
impressed with you either.

980
00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:27.950
Said if you worked at his
ranch. you'd be fired by now.

981
00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:29.485
- Ha!

982
00:46:29.487 --> 00:46:31.053
How'd he manage that?

983
00:46:31.055 --> 00:46:32.955
- By complaining to your boss?

984
00:46:34.559 --> 00:46:35.942
What?

985
00:46:35.943 --> 00:46:37.326
You're so indispensable
you can't be fired?

986
00:46:37.328 --> 00:46:38.861
- Something like that.

987
00:46:38.863 --> 00:46:39.762
- Wow.

988
00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:41.697
Sure think a lot of yourself

989
00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:44.167
for someone who shovels
manure for a living.

990
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.570
- What do you think of me?

991
00:46:47.572 --> 00:46:48.404
- What do you mean?

992
00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:49.472
I don't think of you.

993
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:51.774
- Really?

994
00:46:51.776 --> 00:46:52.608
- Yeah.

995
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.810
- I think about you.

996
00:46:56.114 --> 00:46:58.014
- Is it relevant if I'm fat?

997
00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:00.817
Even if it wasn't relevant

998
00:47:00.819 --> 00:47:03.052
they act like I'm asking
some deeply personal

999
00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:05.221
and private question
instead of something

1000
00:47:05.223 --> 00:47:08.291
that anyone's who's ever laid
eyes on them already knows.

1001
00:47:08.293 --> 00:47:11.227
- Maybe they don't wanna
be judged on looks.

1002
00:47:11.229 --> 00:47:13.329
- You're joking. right?

1003
00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:16.933
I mean. the whole
thing is based on looks.

1004
00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:18.701
Not just online. but if we met
at a bar

1005
00:47:18.703 --> 00:47:19.869
at a grocery store.

1006
00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:22.171
The only reason they
would talk to me

1007
00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:24.440
is because they liked
the way that I looked.

1008
00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:29.412
- Can't you tell how tall
someone is in their pictures?

1009
00:47:29.414 --> 00:47:31.480
- You actually cannot.

1010
00:47:31.482 --> 00:47:32.782
Even if they're standing next to
somebody

1011
00:47:32.784 --> 00:47:35.218
you cannot tell how tall
somebody is from a photograph.

1012
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.052
(male chuckles)

1013
00:47:36.054 --> 00:47:37.086
Yeah.

1014
00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:38.721
- All right. let's go.

1015
00:47:40.692 --> 00:47:42.191
- No. I can walk faster.

1016
00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:43.793
- I'm sure you can.

1017
00:47:43.795 --> 00:47:45.962
- No. you should ride.

1018
00:47:45.964 --> 00:47:47.663
- I'm not gonna ride
while you walk.

1019
00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:48.831
- I.

1020
00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:50.867
Really. it's okay.

1021
00:47:50.869 --> 00:47:54.036
(light gentle music)

1022
00:48:09.487 --> 00:48:10.319
Are you sure?

1023
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:11.220
- Yep.

1024
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.289
- Okay.

1025
00:48:24.736 --> 00:48:25.868
Come on. get.

1026
00:48:47.158 --> 00:48:48.190
They were tired.

1027
00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:49.992
- Yeah.

1028
00:48:54.866 --> 00:48:57.867
- Well. I for one
need a shower. so.

1029
00:48:57.869 --> 00:48:59.936
I'm just gonna go head in.

1030
00:48:59.938 --> 00:49:01.470
- Okay.

1031
00:49:01.472 --> 00:49:02.538
- [Katie] Okay what?

1032
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:04.807
- Okay you can go.

1033
00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:07.610
- Thank you?

1034
00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:18.321
Thank you for saving me today.

1035
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:20.489
- Any time.

1036
00:49:29.968 --> 00:49:32.535
Time to hit the showers.

1037
00:49:32.537 --> 00:49:33.436
- [Katie] Okay.

1038
00:49:41.646 --> 00:49:43.512
- Awfully hard letting you
leave.

1039
00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:48.417
- Well. if only
there was some way

1040
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:51.420
that you could let me know that
you wanted to see me again.

1041
00:49:51.422 --> 00:49:54.657
Some contraption you could use--

1042
00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:55.491
- Like a telephone?

1043
00:49:55.493 --> 00:49:56.659
- [Katie] That would work.

1044
00:49:57.628 --> 00:49:59.695
- All right smartypants.
I'll call you.

1045
00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:00.596
- Okay.

1046
00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:06.535
You do know that it requires a
certain set of digits. right?

1047
00:50:06.537 --> 00:50:08.037
- I do.

1048
00:50:08.039 --> 00:50:09.739
- [Katie] And do you want mine?

1049
00:50:09.741 --> 00:50:11.273
- I have them.

1050
00:50:11.275 --> 00:50:12.174
- You do?

1051
00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:14.677
How?

1052
00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:16.112
- You board here don't you?

1053
00:50:17.215 --> 00:50:18.114
- Yeah.

1054
00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:23.236
I guess I just didn't realize

1055
00:50:23.237 --> 00:50:24.754
you had access to that
kind of information.

1056
00:50:25.957 --> 00:50:27.990
All right. well.
make sure you wait

1057
00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:30.726
the socially acceptable three
days before you call me.

1058
00:50:31.662 --> 00:50:32.628
- Not a chance.

1059
00:50:33.498 --> 00:50:38.567
(light gentle music)
(Katie laughs)

1060
00:50:46.778 --> 00:50:49.578
(birds chirping)

1061
00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:51.447
Sweet dreams.

1062
00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:55.785
- Goodnight.

1063
00:51:10.468 --> 00:51:13.202
(phone ringing)

1064
00:51:14.005 --> 00:51:14.970
- Hi.

1065
00:51:14.972 --> 00:51:16.305
- I did it.

1066
00:51:16.307 --> 00:51:18.040
I found a holiday boyfriend.

1067
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.643
- Really?

1068
00:51:20.645 --> 00:51:21.844
Where?

1069
00:51:21.846 --> 00:51:24.146
- He works at my ranch.

1070
00:51:24.148 --> 00:51:25.781
- [Valerie] You're
gonna date a stable boy?

1071
00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:27.850
- I am for the next
month and a half.

1072
00:51:28.753 --> 00:51:29.585
- Is he cute?

1073
00:51:29.587 --> 00:51:30.853
- He's so cute.

1074
00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:33.856
- Great. does he need the
Valerie stamp of approval?

1075
00:51:33.858 --> 00:51:35.091
- No.

1076
00:51:35.093 --> 00:51:36.725
I already know he is
not marriage material.

1077
00:51:36.727 --> 00:51:39.128
so he is perfect for this.

1078
00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:40.062
- Really?

1079
00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:40.896
What's the deal?

1080
00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:42.665
Is he a player?

1081
00:51:42.667 --> 00:51:43.632
- No.

1082
00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:44.633
- Oh.

1083
00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:46.869
Then why isn't he marriage
material?

1084
00:51:46.871 --> 00:51:50.639
- Oh. he's kind of weird and
awkward.

1085
00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:52.108
- And broke.

1086
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.242
- Yeah.

1087
00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:54.375
Not at all what you would
picture me with.

1088
00:51:54.378 --> 00:51:56.312
But the chemistry is good.

1089
00:51:56.314 --> 00:51:57.613
- Well perfect.

1090
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:59.482
- Look. I'm gonna
jump in the shower.

1091
00:51:59.484 --> 00:52:00.983
I will see you tomorrow. right?

1092
00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:02.118
- [Valerie] You got it.

1093
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.552
- Okay.

1094
00:52:03.554 --> 00:52:04.386
Goodnight.

1095
00:52:04.388 --> 00:52:05.955
- Goodnight.

1096
00:52:05.957 --> 00:52:06.956
Atta girl.

1097
00:52:09.861 --> 00:52:12.595
(phone ringing)

1098
00:52:19.237 --> 00:52:20.169
- Hello.

1099
00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:22.171
- [Male] Hey. it's Jacob.

1100
00:52:22.173 --> 00:52:23.506
- Hi.

1101
00:52:23.508 --> 00:52:26.075
- [Jacob] Gave it a
day. that's all you get.

1102
00:52:26.077 --> 00:52:27.743
- I'll let it slide.

1103
00:52:27.745 --> 00:52:29.912
- [Jacob] Busy tonight?

1104
00:52:29.914 --> 00:52:31.514
- No.

1105
00:52:31.516 --> 00:52:33.849
- [Jacob] Okay.
I'm gonna take you out.

1106
00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:35.484
- I think can be arranged.

1107
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:36.785
- [Jacob] Great.

1108
00:52:36.787 --> 00:52:39.288
Text me your address. and
I'll pick you up at 7:30.

1109
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:40.322
- Okay.

1110
00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:41.857
- [Jacob] I'll see you then.

1111
00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:42.758
- Bye.

1112
00:52:47.532 --> 00:52:48.931
I can't get that guy to shut up.

1113
00:52:53.037 --> 00:52:54.870
(door knocking)

1114
00:52:54.872 --> 00:52:55.771
Coming!

1115
00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:00.509
Hi.

1116
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:01.544
- [Jacob] Hey.

1117
00:53:01.546 --> 00:53:02.511
- Come on in.

1118
00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:03.846
How are you?

1119
00:53:03.848 --> 00:53:05.270
- Good.

1120
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:06.693
- Good. well just make
yourself comfortable. okay.

1121
00:53:06.694 --> 00:53:08.116
I'm gonna just grab
my shoes. my jacket.

1122
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:16.759
I had a client stay late
so I was a little...

1123
00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:17.793
What are you doing?

1124
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.130
I said make yourself
comfortable.

1125
00:53:21.132 --> 00:53:22.932
this is not comfortable.

1126
00:53:22.934 --> 00:53:24.133
Come in. explore.

1127
00:53:24.135 --> 00:53:25.701
My apartment doesn't bite.

1128
00:53:30.775 --> 00:53:31.607
What are you doing?

1129
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:33.142
Come. sit.

1130
00:53:33.144 --> 00:53:34.043
- I'm fine.

1131
00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:36.345
- Okay.

1132
00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:51.794
Let's go.

1133
00:53:52.863 --> 00:53:54.897
- You're gonna need a warm coat.

1134
00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:56.765
- [Katie] I have this.

1135
00:53:56.767 --> 00:53:57.666
- A coat.

1136
00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:01.203
- [Katie] I don't
wanna wear a coat.

1137
00:54:01.205 --> 00:54:02.805
- Trust me.

1138
00:54:02.807 --> 00:54:04.773
You're gonna wanna
wear a warm coat.

1139
00:54:12.917 --> 00:54:14.283
- Yeah. that'll work.

1140
00:54:14.285 --> 00:54:17.019
(festive music)

1141
00:54:21.292 --> 00:54:22.157
- [Katie] Where are we going?

1142
00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:23.259
- Ah. just a quaint little place

1143
00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:25.427
I like to call none ya business.

1144
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:26.395
- Even if I'm gonna be there?

1145
00:54:26.397 --> 00:54:27.363
- Even if you're gonna be there.

1146
00:54:27.365 --> 00:54:28.897
Matter of fact. close your eyes.

1147
00:54:28.899 --> 00:54:31.300
- I am not closing my eyes!

1148
00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:32.468
- [Jacob] You're so difficult.

1149
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:33.736
- Yeah. get used to it.

1150
00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:35.404
- I intend to.

1151
00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:37.840
Now close your eyes.

1152
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:40.709
- Fine.

1153
00:54:44.682 --> 00:54:46.548
This is ridiculous.

1154
00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:47.900
- You're ridiculous.

1155
00:54:47.901 --> 00:54:49.251
- You want me to stay
like this the whole way?

1156
00:54:49.253 --> 00:54:50.152
- [Jacob] The whole way!

1157
00:54:50.154 --> 00:54:52.021
Where is your discipline?

1158
00:54:57.862 --> 00:54:59.028
- Are we going to the ranch?

1159
00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.397
- [Jacob] Will you just
keep your eyes closed?

1160
00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:12.574
(Jacob clears throat)

1161
00:55:12.576 --> 00:55:13.409
- Can I open?

1162
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:14.743
- [Jacob] Nope.

1163
00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:16.245
Coming to get ya.

1164
00:55:21.786 --> 00:55:22.885
- [Katie] Okay.

1165
00:55:22.887 --> 00:55:24.620
- [Jacob] Keep 'em closed.

1166
00:55:24.622 --> 00:55:25.521
- [Katie] They're closed.

1167
00:55:25.523 --> 00:55:27.122
- [Jacob] Good work. good work.

1168
00:55:28.392 --> 00:55:30.426
Just a little further.

1169
00:55:30.428 --> 00:55:33.362
Just a little further.
(Katie giggling)

1170
00:55:33.364 --> 00:55:34.596
Okay hold it.

1171
00:55:34.598 --> 00:55:35.164
Keep 'em closed.
keep 'em closed.

1172
00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:39.735
- Can I open?

1173
00:55:39.737 --> 00:55:41.570
- [Jacob] Patience woman.
patience!

1174
00:55:42.373 --> 00:55:44.139
- It's not really
my strong suit.

1175
00:55:44.141 --> 00:55:45.040
- I can tell.

1176
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:48.210
Okay.

1177
00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:49.912
Open.

1178
00:55:51.382 --> 00:55:54.550
(light gentle music)

1179
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.319
- It's beautiful.

1180
00:55:59.457 --> 00:56:01.657
- [Jacob] Come on.

1181
00:56:01.659 --> 00:56:04.259
- I can't believe you did this.

1182
00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:05.894
Aren't you the romantic.

1183
00:56:05.896 --> 00:56:07.629
- I have my moments.

1184
00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.006
- What are we gonna eat?

1185
00:56:18.876 --> 00:56:20.776
There's no way you could
have prepared food.

1186
00:56:20.778 --> 00:56:21.343
brought it here...

1187
00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:27.950
Someone's delivering
a pizza aren't they?

1188
00:56:27.952 --> 00:56:28.851
- Nope.

1189
00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:31.353
Even better.

1190
00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:35.958
(speaking foreign language)

1191
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.960
- What are you
gonna do with those?

1192
00:56:37.962 --> 00:56:39.561
- [Jacob] Cook 'em.

1193
00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:40.796
- Where?

1194
00:56:40.798 --> 00:56:42.498
- [Jacob] Over the fire.

1195
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:43.599
- Are you serious?

1196
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:44.633
- First time?

1197
00:56:44.635 --> 00:56:45.701
- [Katie] Yes.

1198
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.837
- All right. well then
I'll get you started.

1199
00:56:52.777 --> 00:56:54.676
- Are you sure that's

1200
00:56:54.678 --> 00:56:55.778
sanitary.

1201
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.612
Yeah?

1202
00:56:56.614 --> 00:56:57.446
- [Jacob] Are you kidding?

1203
00:56:57.448 --> 00:56:58.564
- Okay. well...

1204
00:56:58.565 --> 00:56:59.681
- You're worried about
sanitation?

1205
00:56:59.683 --> 00:57:01.483
(Katie laughing)

1206
00:57:01.485 --> 00:57:02.451
- Yeah.

1207
00:57:02.453 --> 00:57:03.285
- Let's go to the fire.

1208
00:57:03.287 --> 00:57:04.486
- Okay.

1209
00:57:04.488 --> 00:57:06.121
- Don't throw it
right into the flames.

1210
00:57:06.123 --> 00:57:07.923
It's gonna make it burn.

1211
00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:10.726
- Well. I for sure want it
cooked.

1212
00:57:10.728 --> 00:57:12.194
- Yeah. well. just hold it up.

1213
00:57:12.196 --> 00:57:13.028
- Yeah?

1214
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.861
Okay. all right.
- Hold it up a little.

1215
00:57:13.864 --> 00:57:15.481
- [Jacob] It's a fire.

1216
00:57:15.482 --> 00:57:17.099
It's gonna produce heat.
- So bossy.

1217
00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:18.467
- [Katie] Telling me what to do.

1218
00:57:19.537 --> 00:57:20.469
I want mine cooked all the way.

1219
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:21.637
- Who's the rookie here?

1220
00:57:21.639 --> 00:57:24.239
- Okay yes. that's true.

1221
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:25.140
True.

1222
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:27.743
- Tell me. how'd you
get into riding?

1223
00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:31.346
- I was that little girl who
wanted a pony

1224
00:57:31.348 --> 00:57:34.516
for every birthday party.
every holiday.

1225
00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:36.318
My parents just
couldn't manage it.

1226
00:57:37.188 --> 00:57:38.687
So as soon as I was able.

1227
00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:42.591
I purchased Charlie and it's
been he and I ever since.

1228
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.464
Wow. it's so quiet.

1229
00:57:48.466 --> 00:57:49.832
It's so beautiful up here.

1230
00:57:51.702 --> 00:57:52.601
- Sure is.

1231
00:58:03.047 --> 00:58:06.114
And now. for the
piece de la resistance.

1232
00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:08.283
- [Katie] What is that?

1233
00:58:08.285 --> 00:58:09.518
- Best part of the night.

1234
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.587
It's time to make s'mores.

1235
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:13.021
¶ It's time for s'mores ¶

1236
00:58:13.023 --> 00:58:13.922
Go ahead.

1237
00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:15.991
Let's do s'mores.

1238
00:58:15.993 --> 00:58:17.793
- [Katie] What is a s'more?

1239
00:58:17.795 --> 00:58:18.694
- What!

1240
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:21.864
Were you raised by wolves?

1241
00:58:21.866 --> 00:58:22.998
What is a s'more?
- No!

1242
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.569
- [Jacob] How do you now
know what a s'more is?

1243
00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:28.637
- Oh.

1244
00:58:28.639 --> 00:58:29.471
Oh my.
(Jacob laughs)

1245
00:58:29.473 --> 00:58:30.439
- It's okay.

1246
00:58:30.441 --> 00:58:32.241
There you go.

1247
00:58:32.243 --> 00:58:34.260
Woo!

1248
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:36.278
You really do like to just
dive into the flame don't you?

1249
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.179
- Wow.

1250
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:38.714
- Just leave it.
chuck those off.

1251
00:58:38.716 --> 00:58:39.781
- Really?

1252
00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:40.616
- Yeah.

1253
00:58:40.618 --> 00:58:41.450
- Those are no good?

1254
00:58:41.452 --> 00:58:42.284
- Eh.

1255
00:58:42.286 --> 00:58:43.685
- You don't like 'em burnt?

1256
00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:44.653
- I personally don't. you might.

1257
00:58:44.655 --> 00:58:45.888
- That's the only way I cook.

1258
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.189
Just so you're aware.

1259
00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:48.290
Burnt. that's what
you get is burnt.

1260
00:58:48.292 --> 00:58:51.026
- Remind to never
ask you to cook.

1261
00:58:51.028 --> 00:58:53.161
- I was never gonna offer
anyway. don't worry.

1262
00:58:53.163 --> 00:58:54.630
Can I have some more.

1263
00:58:54.632 --> 00:58:55.731
- Yeah.
(Katie laughs)

1264
00:58:55.733 --> 00:58:57.065
You see. I just said it!

1265
00:58:57.067 --> 00:58:57.966
- See what you did?
- I just said it!

1266
00:58:57.968 --> 00:58:59.134
- Now you're learning.
- Oh my god.

1267
00:58:59.136 --> 00:59:01.036
- [Jacob] There ya go.

1268
00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:06.642
You know. my Dad always said.

1269
00:59:06.644 --> 00:59:08.744
"Ain't no use building a fire

1270
00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.845
"if you're not gonna roast
marshmallows over it."

1271
00:59:10.848 --> 00:59:12.581
- He sounds nice.

1272
00:59:12.583 --> 00:59:13.482
- He was.

1273
00:59:15.619 --> 00:59:16.518
He'd of liked you.

1274
00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:26.562
- Jacob. maybe we
should talk about

1275
00:59:26.564 --> 00:59:28.297
what we're doing here.

1276
00:59:28.299 --> 00:59:31.400
(slow paced music)
- Okay.

1277
00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:34.469
- I just wanna make sure
that we're on the same page.

1278
00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:37.940
With my job. I have some extra
time over the holidays and...

1279
00:59:39.476 --> 00:59:43.879
I was hoping we could
spend some of it together.

1280
00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:47.382
- So what. this is a fling?

1281
00:59:47.384 --> 00:59:48.283
- No.

1282
00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.620
It's two consenting adults

1283
00:59:51.622 --> 00:59:53.789
making the most of a special
time of year.

1284
00:59:55.259 --> 00:59:56.358
- So a holiday fling?

1285
00:59:57.361 --> 00:59:58.894
- Fine. if you wanna
think of it that way.

1286
00:59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.128
- [Jacob] I don't.

1287
01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.296
- Well I'm not
thinking of it that way.

1288
01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:04.199
- Well it sure
sounds like you are.

1289
01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.568
- Look. I just don't
want anybody to get hurt.

1290
01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:09.571
I like spending time with you.

1291
01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:13.609
But. I just don't see this
becoming anything long-term.

1292
01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.128
- Why not?

1293
01:00:16.129 --> 01:00:17.645
- I'm looking for
something very specific.

1294
01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.649
- And I'm not him.

1295
01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.918
- Look. we don't
have to do this. okay.

1296
01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.787
That's why I'm telling you.

1297
01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.655
So you can make
an educated decision.

1298
01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.390
I would love to spend
the holidays with you.

1299
01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:29.992
but if that's not something
you're interested in.

1300
01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.560
that's totally fine.

1301
01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:39.101
However. if that is something
that you're interested in.

1302
01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:41.837
I'm planning to decorate
my apartment on Friday.

1303
01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.271
I could use some help.

1304
01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.574
- So now I'm free labor?

1305
01:00:45.576 --> 01:00:47.810
- No.

1306
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.045
Fine. you come. I'll do
all the heavy lifting.

1307
01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:53.281
- Okay.

1308
01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.182
- Okay.

1309
01:00:55.586 --> 01:00:56.685
- But I got rules.

1310
01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:57.753
(festive music)

1311
01:00:57.755 --> 01:01:00.422
- About decorating my apartment?

1312
01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:02.357
- About our holiday fling.

1313
01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:05.895
- Okay.

1314
01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.129
- First. you don't
date anyone but me.

1315
01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:10.032
- Done.

1316
01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:12.367
- Second.

1317
01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.505
I get to go out with you
at least three times a week.

1318
01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.858
- Are you sure?

1319
01:01:19.859 --> 01:01:21.542
That is a lot of times a
week to see me.

1320
01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:22.377
- I'm sure.

1321
01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:23.211
- Yeah?

1322
01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.746
Okay.

1323
01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:25.647
- And finally.

1324
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.150
there'll be no sex.

1325
01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.318
- Really? Why?

1326
01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.556
- 'Cause I wanna win this
thing fair and square.

1327
01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:37.025
If we have sex. you're not
gonna be able to resist me.

1328
01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:42.230
- It's not something to
win. it's not a competition.

1329
01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:43.832
- If you say so.

1330
01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:44.900
- I say so.

1331
01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:45.967
- Okay.

1332
01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:46.802
- Okay.

1333
01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:47.703
- Rules still stand.

1334
01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.138
- Okay.

1335
01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.141
- Now. try this.

1336
01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:56.712
- Yeah.

1337
01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:03.385
That is delicious!

1338
01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:04.219
- Right?

1339
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.120
- Oh my gosh!

1340
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.789
How have I never
had one of these?

1341
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:08.890
- I don't know.

1342
01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.226
- It's probably your go to.

1343
01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.195
It's probably what you
do with all the girls.

1344
01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.029
Right?

1345
01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:14.997
- No. no.

1346
01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:15.964
- Take them to the
ranch. make them dinner.

1347
01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.133
- I'll take them to the ranch.
- Oh!

1348
01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:22.037
- [Jacob] but I don't
do s'mores for everyone.

1349
01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.882
- Okay. well.
thanks for walking me up.

1350
01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:34.716
- My pleasure.

1351
01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:36.485
- I'll see you on Friday?

1352
01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:37.986
- Sure.

1353
01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:38.887
- Okay.

1354
01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:43.091
Goodnight.

1355
01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.200
- Goodnight.

1356
01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:55.170
(slow paced music)

1357
01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:00.375
- Tease.

1358
01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:01.777
- [Jacob] Right back at ya.

1359
01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.650
- He said no sex?

1360
01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:10.585
- [Keiko] You have
to marry this man.

1361
01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:12.854
- She might be right.

1362
01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:15.590
- There is no way
that I am marrying him.

1363
01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:16.591
- What?

1364
01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:17.826
Too handsome and respectful?

1365
01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:19.461
- He is a stable boy.

1366
01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.729
- Yeah.

1367
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:24.900
But a stable boy who
can lay down the law!

1368
01:03:25.736 --> 01:03:27.536
- Yes. I'm into that.

1369
01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:28.937
- Look. it's nothing like that.

1370
01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.839
He's weird.

1371
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:32.791
- He's weird?

1372
01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.742
- Yeah. he wouldn't even come in
and sit down in my apartment.

1373
01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:36.011
I went to get my
shoes and my jacket.

1374
01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.112
I came back and he
was standing there

1375
01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:39.181
like a weird statue.

1376
01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.216
- Maybe he's just phobic?

1377
01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:44.519
- Yeah. that's not
really helping his case.

1378
01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:47.489
I just think he's
just socially stunted.

1379
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.690
You know. the kind of
person who stands

1380
01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:50.225
all by themselves at a party?

1381
01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:52.761
My whole life would be spent
entertaining him at events.

1382
01:03:52.763 --> 01:03:54.629
How exhausting would that be?

1383
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.598
- Well that depends
on how many parties

1384
01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.099
you plan on going to.

1385
01:03:58.101 --> 01:03:59.251
(Valerie laughs)

1386
01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.402
- Yeah Katie. maybe
you can manage it

1387
01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.571
for the one or two
parties you go to a year.

1388
01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:03.505
- Ha ha.

1389
01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:04.639
- Here you go.

1390
01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:07.843
Three thanksgiving specials.

1391
01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:08.910
- Thank you.

1392
01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:12.547
- Thank you.

1393
01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:15.584
- I'll see you later?

1394
01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:16.484
- Uh-huh.

1395
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.358
- Young love.

1396
01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.260
- Yeah.

1397
01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:26.761
Isn't it the best?

1398
01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:29.397
- So have you two done it yet?

1399
01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:30.298
- Done what?

1400
01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:34.002
- Never mind.

1401
01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.871
Okay. so Jacob is coming over

1402
01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:37.239
to help you decorate tomorrow?

1403
01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:38.941
- Yep.

1404
01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:40.642
- Is he actually
coming inside to sit?

1405
01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:41.877
- Fingers crossed.

1406
01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.213
- How will you thank him
properly

1407
01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:48.049
without your usual
methods at your disposal.

1408
01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.951
- I don't know.

1409
01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:52.687
Say thank you.

1410
01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:53.955
- Yawn. yawn. yawn.

1411
01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:56.024
- [Katie] Yeah. you are just
jealous.

1412
01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:57.492
- Of your non-love life?

1413
01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:58.994
- That I don't have to put out.

1414
01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:00.829
- But putting out
is the best part!

1415
01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.768
- Okay. and on that note.

1416
01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:08.937
I would like to say

1417
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.540
that I am very
grateful for both of you.

1418
01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.576
And I don't know what
I would do without you.

1419
01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:16.878
Happy Thanksgiving.

1420
01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.146
- [Keiko] Happy Thanksgiving.

1421
01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:19.214
- Here. here!

1422
01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:23.018
- [Keiko] Get tanked!

1423
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.287
- Ooh. that is yummy.

1424
01:05:27.658 --> 01:05:31.893
("Joy To The World"
instrumental)

1425
01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:38.199
Wait. wait!

1426
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:40.268
- I'm fine. I got this.

1427
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.102
We're good.

1428
01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:41.937
- [Katie] Watch the frame--

1429
01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:43.138
- Watch your doorframe?

1430
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.507
It's gonna end up getting
through the opening.

1431
01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:48.944
All right.

1432
01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:52.180
And I thought you said I wasn't

1433
01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.581
gonna have to do any work.

1434
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.517
- Yeah.

1435
01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:56.418
I lied.

1436
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:58.453
Wait. wait. wait!

1437
01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.888
Wait.

1438
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.122
- You're gonna do a
ceremony for this?

1439
01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.692
- Well. you're
gonna just light it?

1440
01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:05.060
- What do you wanna do?
- I mean this...

1441
01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:06.895
- [Katie] Okay. plug it in.

1442
01:06:06.897 --> 01:06:08.997
What am I gonna do with you?

1443
01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:11.800
(light gentle music)

1444
01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:12.634
- Look at that.

1445
01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.935
- Oh. it's so cute.

1446
01:06:13.937 --> 01:06:14.769
- It looks good right?

1447
01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:16.071
- We need some.

1448
01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.478
Yeah. just like that.

1449
01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.312
- Yeah?

1450
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.146
Okay.

1451
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.983
(Katie laughing)

1452
01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.127
- Hi.

1453
01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:47.028
- Hi.

1454
01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:49.931
- It's morning.

1455
01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.100
- So it is.

1456
01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:56.237
- I can't believe we
slept here all night.

1457
01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.606
Usually I can't sleep
with so many clothes on.

1458
01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:01.076
(Jacob chuckling)

1459
01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:03.645
- You kicked those off in
the middle of the night.

1460
01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:05.080
- Yeah.

1461
01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:07.248
- I promise I'll turn around
and let you put those back on

1462
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.884
if you promise
to kick 'em off again.

1463
01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:11.386
- Yeah I bet.

1464
01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:12.421
(Jacob chuckles)

1465
01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.455
- Don't you have to go
to work or something?

1466
01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:14.989
- [Jacob] Nope.

1467
01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:16.674
- Really?

1468
01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:18.358
You don't have to feed
horses or muck stalls?

1469
01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:19.861
- Nah. sometimes.

1470
01:08:22.065 --> 01:08:23.731
Hey. is it okay if I take a
shower?

1471
01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:28.303
- Sure.

1472
01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:31.706
Aren't you all cozy
all of a sudden.

1473
01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:32.707
- What do you mean?

1474
01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.410
- Nothing.

1475
01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:36.444
Go ahead.

1476
01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.646
- Nah. did you want to
take a shower first?

1477
01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:39.481
- [Katie] No. it's okay. you go.

1478
01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:41.683
- No. no. ladies first.

1479
01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:42.684
I insist.

1480
01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:47.655
- Are you sure?

1481
01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.457
I'll be super. out so fast.

1482
01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:50.358
- Go. go. go!

1483
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.326
- All right.

1484
01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:53.828
(Katie laughing)

1485
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.430
(door knocking)

1486
01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:56.264
- [Jacob] Is it my turn?

1487
01:08:56.266 --> 01:08:57.098
- Yes. sorry.

1488
01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.633
I know I'm taking way too long.

1489
01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.467
- No problem.

1490
01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.002
- I am done.

1491
01:09:04.074 --> 01:09:06.774
I don't have any boy stuff.

1492
01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:11.312
Oh actually. my ex left this.

1493
01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:15.617
Body wash.

1494
01:09:15.619 --> 01:09:16.451
- Nah.

1495
01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:17.752
- No. okay.

1496
01:09:18.722 --> 01:09:19.654
Toothbrush?

1497
01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:20.522
- His toothbrush?

1498
01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:21.356
- Yeah.

1499
01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:22.190
- Definitely not.

1500
01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:23.024
- No?

1501
01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:23.925
Probably better.

1502
01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:26.661
Whatever this is.

1503
01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:28.496
- It's a lawnmower.

1504
01:09:28.498 --> 01:09:29.531
- A what?

1505
01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:31.032
- [Jacob] A lawnmower.

1506
01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:33.301
- Huh. so no?

1507
01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.552
- Nah.

1508
01:09:34.553 --> 01:09:35.802
- No. okay.
- I'll just use mine.

1509
01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:36.771
- [Katie] You have one of these?

1510
01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:37.972
- Oh yeah. sure.

1511
01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.276
You trim the hedges
the tree stands taller.

1512
01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:45.213
- Oh.

1513
01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.514
Oh. I didn't. I didn't
know it was for that.

1514
01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:48.883
I'm just gonna.

1515
01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.485
you just use whatever you want.

1516
01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:51.419
- Thank you.

1517
01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:54.822
(Jacob chuckles)

1518
01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:57.358
It's lavender.
(door knocking)

1519
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.393
- Wait. what are you doing?

1520
01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.744
- Huh?

1521
01:09:59.745 --> 01:10:01.094
- This is my
expensive face cream.

1522
01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:01.930
- I bet it's expensive.

1523
01:10:01.932 --> 01:10:03.782
Is that glitter in there?

1524
01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.633
- It better be
gold for what it costs.

1525
01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:06.668
My gosh.

1526
01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:08.937
Feel better?

1527
01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:10.471
- I do. I feel moisturized.

1528
01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:13.841
- Oh my god.
- I feel golden!

1529
01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:14.776
- [Katie] I came in to
see if you wanted

1530
01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:16.277
to go to breakfast.

1531
01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:20.548
- Would you like to talk
about how you reacted

1532
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.549
over lotion?

1533
01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:23.918
- No.

1534
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.789
Yes.

1535
01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:29.023
- You don't wanna say
"I'm sorry I made such

1536
01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:31.926
"a big deal over my
expensive lotion Jacob?"

1537
01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.696
- No.

1538
01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:36.698
I mean maybe I
overreacted a little bit.

1539
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.133
but it certainly doesn't
warrant an apology.

1540
01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.368
- That's you
overreacting a little bit?

1541
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.036
- Yes.

1542
01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:42.937
- All right.

1543
01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:46.474
Guess it's good to know what
I'm getting myself into.

1544
01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.409
- What?

1545
01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:49.844
Shut up.

1546
01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:52.280
You're not even getting
yourself into anything.

1547
01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:56.985
I didn't mean it like that.

1548
01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:58.586
- Let's go for a ride tomorrow.

1549
01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.022
- Okay.

1550
01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:01.923
- See ya.

1551
01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:16.437
Hi there.

1552
01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:17.338
- Hi.

1553
01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:20.908
Now you're saddling
my horse for me?

1554
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.677
- Ah I was here.
figured why wait.

1555
01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:24.479
Don't worry. you can bathe them

1556
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.780
and put them away later.

1557
01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.049
- Oh I see. so this was
not a romantic gesture.

1558
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:29.717
but a quid pro quo situation

1559
01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.419
where I get to do
most of the work.

1560
01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:32.253
- What work?

1561
01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:33.187
You let 'em roll
around in the dirt

1562
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:34.555
and then you put 'em away.

1563
01:11:35.358 --> 01:11:36.624
- No. you. (stuttering).

1564
01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.428
you still have to brush
them after they--

1565
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.462
- If you say so.

1566
01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:42.430
- [Katie] I say so.

1567
01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:43.264
- All right.

1568
01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:44.899
Then it shall be done.

1569
01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:45.900
- Thank you.

1570
01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.869
- [Jacob] Here. put this on.

1571
01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.404
- Me or the horse.

1572
01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:50.305
- [Jacob] Either.

1573
01:11:53.043 --> 01:11:54.008
- [Katie] Hi baby.

1574
01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:57.478
You ready to go for a ride.

1575
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.114
(upbeat music)

1576
01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.092
Wait. wait. wait. no. no. no!

1577
01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:46.227
You gotta wash them first.

1578
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:47.495
- They don't wash it
at the grocery store?

1579
01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.364
- No they do not wash
it at the grocery store.

1580
01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:50.198
- You kidding me?

1581
01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.032
- No. I am serious.

1582
01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:51.999
- I thought that
the produce people

1583
01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:54.535
were in charge of all of that.

1584
01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:04.812
Oh come on.

1585
01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:05.713
- Yeah. take that.

1586
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.448
Okay. you know what.

1587
01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:29.537
You have to go.

1588
01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:30.938
- You're pushing me
out of your house?

1589
01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.773
- [Katie] Yes!

1590
01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:32.573
- I'm going!

1591
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:33.474
All right.

1592
01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:39.046
- Come here. okay.

1593
01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.282
(Katie giggling)

1594
01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:42.183
Wait.

1595
01:13:46.356 --> 01:13:47.255
Okay. bye.

1596
01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.759
(door closing)

1597
01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:10.678
Okay. I have my
wallet with my ID.

1598
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.481
my passport. and my ticket.

1599
01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:17.185
I have my phone. my charger.

1600
01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:18.953
and a book.

1601
01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:22.089
I think I'm all set.

1602
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:23.157
- So that's it then?

1603
01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:27.795
- If by that do you mean.
am I ready to go. then yes.

1604
01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:30.698
- Okay.

1605
01:14:32.402 --> 01:14:34.268
Be here in the morning.

1606
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:35.102
bright and early.

1607
01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:36.938
- Don't leave.

1608
01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:37.972
It's early.

1609
01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:44.378
Jacob. I'm gonna
be back in five days.

1610
01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.214
- And then what?

1611
01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:48.549
We wave at each
other at the ranch

1612
01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:50.618
as you take a ride
with some other dude?

1613
01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.155
- [Katie] Of course not.

1614
01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.389
- Well then what Katie?

1615
01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:58.893
Holiday fling is usually
over with the holiday.

1616
01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.597
- I don't know. but not that.

1617
01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:07.468
- Okay.

1618
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.439
See ya in the morning.

1619
01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:14.075
- Don't leave.

1620
01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.543
- Why not?

1621
01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:16.444
You're going to.

1622
01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.880
- I'm coming back.

1623
01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.550
- It's not what I
meant and you know it.

1624
01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:30.958
- Stay.

1625
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:42.770
Stay.

1626
01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:50.611
(light upbeat music)

1627
01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:39.360
(gentle music)

1628
01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:43.864
(birds chirping)

1629
01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.318
We're late.

1630
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.686
We forgot to set an alarm.

1631
01:17:13.363 --> 01:17:14.295
- What's wrong?

1632
01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:15.596
- Nothing.

1633
01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:16.530
We're late.

1634
01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:20.334
- You regret last night.
don't you?

1635
01:17:22.005 --> 01:17:23.871
- I don't regret it.

1636
01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.673
I'm unhappy about what it means.

1637
01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:26.507
- [Jacob] Why?

1638
01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:27.541
What does it mean?

1639
01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:28.876
- What it means is
that now this is

1640
01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:30.378
gonna be harder than before.

1641
01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.346
Because when I said I didn't
want a long-term relationship

1642
01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.065
I meant it.

1643
01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:35.783
And now. this is just. it's
completely--

1644
01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:36.584
- What?

1645
01:17:36.586 --> 01:17:38.185
Completely what?

1646
01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:39.820
What are you so afraid of?

1647
01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.322
- This.

1648
01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:42.523
This can never work.

1649
01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:44.659
You and I are in
completely different social

1650
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.093
and economic circles.

1651
01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:46.927
- So?

1652
01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:48.129
- So?

1653
01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:49.196
That's easy for you to say

1654
01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:50.331
when being with
me can only raise

1655
01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.233
your social and economic status.

1656
01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:53.534
- [Jacob] What are
you talking about?

1657
01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:54.802
- You know what.
it doesn't matter.

1658
01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.337
- Seems like it does.

1659
01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.871
- It seems like you don't even
understand what I'm saying.

1660
01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:59.407
- It seems like you're
saying you hang out

1661
01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.941
with a snootier crowd and
make more money than me.

1662
01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.343
- Oh. so you do understand.

1663
01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:04.545
- Wow.

1664
01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.481
I never had you
pegged for a gold digger.

1665
01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:09.216
- Oh. that's right.

1666
01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.452
Because if a woman wants
a man with a decent income

1667
01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:13.054
she must be a gold digger.

1668
01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:15.356
I mean never mind how hard
she's worked on her own career

1669
01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.358
or that being in a
long-term relationship

1670
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.726
means the possibility of a baby.

1671
01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:22.129
Something can only
hinder her career.

1672
01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:22.963
- You think I don't
make enough money

1673
01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:24.098
to provide for my family?

1674
01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.734
- How much can you possibly
make mucking out stalls?

1675
01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:29.103
- I own the ranch!

1676
01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:30.037
It's mine!

1677
01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.472
And the one across the street.

1678
01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:33.708
I bought the first one
when I was in my 20s.

1679
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:36.243
Second one I
bought a few years ago.

1680
01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:38.913
(solemn music)

1681
01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.082
Katie.

1682
01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:42.750
- You own the ranch?

1683
01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:45.586
Why would you let me think
that you were the stable boy?

1684
01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:48.522
- Look. I didn't say anything
'cause--

1685
01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:49.423
- 'Cause?

1686
01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:51.192
What?

1687
01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:52.359
I mean. it's a test?

1688
01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:53.194
- What?

1689
01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:53.861
That's crazy.

1690
01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:55.096
- Really?

1691
01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.330
You didn't wanna see if I
would still fall for you

1692
01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.564
even though I thought you
were just the stable boy?

1693
01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:03.537
Wow. you must
have a really low opinion

1694
01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:04.739
of my character.

1695
01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:05.906
- Katie. I love you.

1696
01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.375
- You obviously think
that I am capable

1697
01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:09.977
of picking a mate
based entirely on the

1698
01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.712
size of his income!

1699
01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:12.913
- I didn't think that.

1700
01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:15.082
it just seemed to
matter to you a lot.

1701
01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:18.786
And that made me nervous. so I--

1702
01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:20.187
- Lied.

1703
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:22.890
You lied about who you are.

1704
01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:23.958
And you know what. that's fine.

1705
01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.593
because this is over.

1706
01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:27.128
- Katie.

1707
01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:28.028
- You should go.

1708
01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:31.766
- No. I'm gonna
take you to the airport.

1709
01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:34.935
- I need you to leave.

1710
01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:35.836
- Come on.

1711
01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:38.839
Let me take you to the airport.

1712
01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:42.943
My last duty as the
holiday boyfriend.

1713
01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:45.346
- You lied to me.

1714
01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:47.648
- I know.

1715
01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:49.984
And I'm sorry.

1716
01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:53.220
- No. I can't.

1717
01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:58.993
I can't be lied to.
or betrayed. or hurt anymore.

1718
01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:00.261
I can't.

1719
01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:02.296
Please. I'm sorry. just go.

1720
01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.232
Please.

1721
01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:16.911
- You know I would
have come with you.

1722
01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:17.812
- What?

1723
01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:20.414
- Home.

1724
01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:21.549
For Christmas.

1725
01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.586
All you had to do was ask.

1726
01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:31.358
(Katie sobbing)

1727
01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.975
- [Katie] Happy holidays.

1728
01:20:58.421 --> 01:20:59.687
- Be here soon.

1729
01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:01.322
Oh wait. there she is.

1730
01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:03.224
Katie!

1731
01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:05.259
Oh. there you are!
- Hi!

1732
01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:06.126
- [Older Male] Hey there!

1733
01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.529
- We've been waiting for you!

1734
01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.497
- Sorry I'm late.

1735
01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:11.832
- Welcome home.

1736
01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:12.867
- Hurry up. dinner's ready.

1737
01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:13.934
We're eating.

1738
01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.002
- Okay. give me a second.

1739
01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:16.937
I'm gonna just go put my
stuff in my room okay.

1740
01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:18.005
- Of course.

1741
01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:23.377
(solemn music)

1742
01:21:54.277 --> 01:21:55.542
- [Katie] Hi guys!

1743
01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:58.012
- [Everyone] Hey Katie!

1744
01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.146
- Michael.

1745
01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:00.948
- Hi Kat. long time no see.

1746
01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.551
- What are you doing here?

1747
01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:06.820
- Michael's in town for work.

1748
01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:07.955
Isn't that crazy.

1749
01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:10.257
So when he stopped by to say hi.

1750
01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.126
I invited him for dinner.

1751
01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:14.128
- I didn't mean to intrude.

1752
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.296
but your mom insisted.

1753
01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:18.265
Was this a bad idea?

1754
01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.984
- Oh.
- No.

1755
01:22:19.985 --> 01:22:21.702
- [Mom] No. no. no. no.
don't be ridiculous.

1756
01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.671
There's no reason you
can't stay for dinner.

1757
01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:24.571
Right Kate?

1758
01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:27.374
- Yeah.

1759
01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:28.809
Nothing weird about that.

1760
01:22:30.313 --> 01:22:31.345
Hi Dad.

1761
01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:33.247
- [Dad] Hi sweetheart.

1762
01:22:36.519 --> 01:22:37.985
- [Katie] Hi.

1763
01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:38.953
How are you?

1764
01:22:39.722 --> 01:22:40.821
- Nice you made it.

1765
01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:42.056
Awesome.
- Yes.

1766
01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:43.157
- [Katie] Sorry for the stretch.

1767
01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:43.991
- [Brother-In-Law] You're good.

1768
01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:44.825
- [Little Boy] Hi.

1769
01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:46.460
- [Katie] Hi.

1770
01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.295
- Look what I got here.

1771
01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.730
- I'll just go brush up.

1772
01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:50.898
- [Dad] Okay.

1773
01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:06.347
- I'm sorry to ambush you.

1774
01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:08.282
But your Mom seemed to think
we should surprise you.

1775
01:23:08.284 --> 01:23:10.351
- That's because she knew
if I knew you were here.

1776
01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:11.185
I wouldn't come home.

1777
01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:12.219
- Don't be like that.

1778
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:13.354
- Like what?

1779
01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:16.390
- I just. I just wanna
come say hi.

1780
01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:17.591
That's all.

1781
01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:19.393
And I knew if I'd give
me the chance to say no.

1782
01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:21.261
then you would.

1783
01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:23.297
- So you did mean to ambush me.

1784
01:23:24.133 --> 01:23:25.866
Geeze Michael.
for years I begged you

1785
01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:26.967
to come home with
me for Christmas.

1786
01:23:26.969 --> 01:23:29.470
and now we haven't seen
each other in over a year.

1787
01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:30.437
here you are.

1788
01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:31.605
- I'm sorry.

1789
01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.941
But my company set up
our new office out here.

1790
01:23:33.943 --> 01:23:36.643
I was the only one who's
ever been to Colorado.

1791
01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.145
So I was volunteered.

1792
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:40.881
- That doesn't explain
what you're doing here

1793
01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:42.616
at my parents house.

1794
01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:43.951
- I missed you.

1795
01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:47.654
- Come on you two.
foods getting cold.

1796
01:23:57.433 --> 01:23:58.532
- So Michael. what have
you been up to

1797
01:23:58.534 --> 01:23:59.833
since last time we saw ya?

1798
01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:02.002
- Not much. this new company's
keeping me pretty busy.

1799
01:24:02.004 --> 01:24:03.170
- Yeah?

1800
01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:05.039
You guys are opening up
a new office out here.

1801
01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:05.939
that's pretty exciting.

1802
01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:07.641
- Yeah. you know.
we've been lucky.

1803
01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:08.909
- [Brother-In-Law]
That's awesome.

1804
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.176
- Yeah. how long are you
gonna be out here for?

1805
01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:11.612
- So we were
hoping the new office

1806
01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:14.048
would be open up and running by
now

1807
01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:15.849
but schedules been delayed.

1808
01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:17.918
which is why I'm still
here for the holidays.

1809
01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.119
So now we're
trying for the first.

1810
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:20.888
Make a real strong
start for the new year.

1811
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:22.423
- Yeah. good luck with that.

1812
01:24:22.425 --> 01:24:24.008
- Yeah. it'd be good.

1813
01:24:24.009 --> 01:24:25.592
- So. Michael. what are
you doing for Christmas?

1814
01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:27.928
- Mom.
(quirky music)

1815
01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:30.798
- Well. he can't
spend Christmas alone.

1816
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.133
- Thanks Mrs. Freeman
but I'm a big boy.

1817
01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:34.635
I'll be just fine.

1818
01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:37.337
- Well. you're always
welcome Michael.

1819
01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:39.473
- Obviously.

1820
01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:43.377
- [Brother-In-Law] I agree.
I like having Michael around.

1821
01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:49.683
- [Sister] Come on
kids let's go.

1822
01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:50.517
Time to go home.

1823
01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:52.252
Let's say goodbye to Aunt Katie.

1824
01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.087
Bye.

1825
01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:54.154
- [Katie] Bye.

1826
01:24:54.156 --> 01:24:54.988
- It's so nice to see you.

1827
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.823
- Yes. you too.

1828
01:24:55.825 --> 01:24:57.324
We'll see you again tomorrow.

1829
01:24:58.594 --> 01:24:59.426
- For Christmas Eve?

1830
01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:00.694
- For Christmas Eve.

1831
01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:02.830
What happens on Christmas Eve?

1832
01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:05.132
- [Little Boy] Santa
comes to visit!

1833
01:25:05.134 --> 01:25:06.200
And he has a

1834
01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:09.269
package for presents.

1835
01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:11.805
- For presents.

1836
01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:12.739
Only if you've been good.

1837
01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:13.607
Have you been good?

1838
01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:14.508
- [Little Girl] I have been.

1839
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:16.243
- You have been.
that's all I heard.

1840
01:25:16.245 --> 01:25:18.879
(people chattering)

1841
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:20.414
Ever. ever!

1842
01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:24.685
Bye.

1843
01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:25.953
- [Brother-In-Law] See ya Katie.

1844
01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:26.987
- [Dad] I'm gonna
put your jacket on.

1845
01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:29.323
You're welcome.

1846
01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:30.157
- [Katie] Bye you guys!

1847
01:25:30.159 --> 01:25:30.991
- [Little Girl] Bye!

1848
01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:33.127
Bye grandma. bye grandpa!

1849
01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:34.761
- [Dad] Good to see ya.

1850
01:25:34.763 --> 01:25:35.829
- [Brother-In-Law] You too.

1851
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:37.564
- I'll walk you out.

1852
01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:43.670
- So...

1853
01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:47.040
- What?

1854
01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:48.709
- What are you up to tomorrow?

1855
01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:50.310
- Why?

1856
01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.411
- I don't know. I was thinking

1857
01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:53.580
maybe we could hang out.

1858
01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:54.414
- Why?

1859
01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:55.516
- Why not?

1860
01:25:55.518 --> 01:25:57.084
Come on!

1861
01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:58.651
Just give me one day.
after that you can hate me

1862
01:25:58.654 --> 01:25:59.920
forever from afar.

1863
01:26:04.093 --> 01:26:05.526
- I don't want to hate you.

1864
01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:09.196
I want to nothing you.

1865
01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:10.197
- Ouch.

1866
01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.100
Just hear me out.

1867
01:26:16.772 --> 01:26:17.771
- Fine.

1868
01:26:17.773 --> 01:26:19.773
Lunch. tomorrow.

1869
01:26:19.775 --> 01:26:21.708
- I'll pick you up at one.

1870
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:24.444
(door creaking)

1871
01:26:27.249 --> 01:26:28.682
- [Dad] Michael. goodnight.

1872
01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:32.452
- Always glad to see you.

1873
01:26:41.564 --> 01:26:42.396
- I'm going to bed.

1874
01:26:42.398 --> 01:26:43.730
- Okay. goodnight Katie.

1875
01:26:43.732 --> 01:26:44.631
- Goodnight.

1876
01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:52.539
(door knocking)

1877
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:53.473
- Come in!

1878
01:26:58.881 --> 01:26:59.780
- How ya doing?

1879
01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:11.792
- You know that's the guy who
dumped me last year. right?

1880
01:27:11.794 --> 01:27:15.028
Like. right before Christmas.

1881
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:16.129
Probably just so
he didn't have to

1882
01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:17.965
come home with me for the
holidays.

1883
01:27:21.937 --> 01:27:24.438
- You seem so sad last year.

1884
01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:27.908
I'd never seen you like that.

1885
01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:31.345
I know you tried to hide it

1886
01:27:31.347 --> 01:27:34.348
but it was like you'd
lost your best friend.

1887
01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:37.251
- I had.

1888
01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:40.120
- I know.

1889
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:43.757
So when Michael
showed up I figured.

1890
01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:45.392
what the heck?

1891
01:27:45.394 --> 01:27:46.693
He wants redemption.

1892
01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:49.196
Let's give him a chance.

1893
01:27:49.198 --> 01:27:51.898
It's not like you were
dating someone else.

1894
01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.967
- I am dating someone else.

1895
01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:54.801
- You are?

1896
01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:56.236
- Yes.
- I mean.

1897
01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:58.338
- [Mom] Well you haven't
said anything to me

1898
01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.641
or on social media.

1899
01:28:00.643 --> 01:28:03.210
- That's because I didn't
want either of you to know.

1900
01:28:03.212 --> 01:28:07.781
- Well honey. then. who is he?

1901
01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.983
Then why do you
still seem so sad?

1902
01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:16.189
- We didn't part
on very good terms.

1903
01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:19.259
He lied to me.

1904
01:28:20.663 --> 01:28:21.561
- Well.

1905
01:28:21.563 --> 01:28:25.299
sounds like maybe you're
better off without him.

1906
01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:30.003
- No.

1907
01:28:31.707 --> 01:28:32.839
I lied to him too.

1908
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:36.276
All this time I've
been telling him

1909
01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:37.678
that he is not
good enough for me.

1910
01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.980
but that's not true.

1911
01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:45.052
The truth is that
Michael hurt me so badly.

1912
01:28:47.456 --> 01:28:48.388
I'm broken.

1913
01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:53.360
And I have been desperately
running around

1914
01:28:53.362 --> 01:28:54.628
trying to find love but.

1915
01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:58.432
I don't want to love.

1916
01:28:58.434 --> 01:29:01.301
Because I don't ever wanna
be hurt like that again.

1917
01:29:02.104 --> 01:29:03.904
And as soon as I saw
Michael I knew

1918
01:29:03.906 --> 01:29:05.839
it was never Jacob.

1919
01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.174
It was always me.

1920
01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:08.709
And as soon as he hurt me.

1921
01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:10.610
I used it as an
excuse to get out.

1922
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.214
- You can't love
and not get hurt.

1923
01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:17.784
It's just not possible.

1924
01:29:19.088 --> 01:29:22.255
Your friends.
your husband. your kids.

1925
01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.292
at some point they all
disappoint you honey.

1926
01:29:27.363 --> 01:29:29.596
And they all make you cry.

1927
01:29:31.967 --> 01:29:35.168
But life isn't worth
anything without them.

1928
01:29:36.939 --> 01:29:37.838
And you're strong enough.

1929
01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.807
Strong enough to
forgive and move on.

1930
01:29:42.411 --> 01:29:44.978
That's all you need for
any relationship honey.

1931
01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:50.317
- What if he can't forgive me?

1932
01:29:50.319 --> 01:29:52.052
All I've done is push him away.

1933
01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:55.989
- If he loves you.
he will forgive you.

1934
01:29:58.594 --> 01:30:02.129
So. what are you
gonna do about Michael?

1935
01:30:04.433 --> 01:30:06.633
- Well I'm not gonna invite
him over for Christmas.

1936
01:30:09.605 --> 01:30:11.838
But I think we can talk.

1937
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.508
and I can finally move on.

1938
01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:18.078
- Okay. good.

1939
01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:19.813
Okay. goodnight Katie.

1940
01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:23.116
- Goodnight Mom.

1941
01:30:25.154 --> 01:30:26.153
Mom.

1942
01:30:26.155 --> 01:30:27.521
- Hm?

1943
01:30:27.523 --> 01:30:28.422
- Thanks.

1944
01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:31.191
- Love you honey.

1945
01:30:31.193 --> 01:30:32.092
- Love you too.

1946
01:30:43.872 --> 01:30:46.006
- Why the blue icing?

1947
01:30:47.543 --> 01:30:48.475
- Christmas.

1948
01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:52.012
(phone ringing)

1949
01:30:54.817 --> 01:30:55.982
- Hiya.

1950
01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:57.234
What's up.

1951
01:30:57.235 --> 01:30:58.485
- You will never
believe who's here.

1952
01:30:58.487 --> 01:30:59.920
- [Valerie] Who?

1953
01:30:59.922 --> 01:31:00.987
- Michael.

1954
01:31:00.989 --> 01:31:01.822
- What?

1955
01:31:01.824 --> 01:31:02.656
- [Keiko] What happened?

1956
01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:03.790
- Michael's in Colorado.

1957
01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:04.624
- [Keiko] What?

1958
01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:06.660
- I'm gonna put you on speaker.

1959
01:31:06.662 --> 01:31:08.628
So. what. did he text you?

1960
01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:11.298
- No. he was here at my
parents house when I got here.

1961
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.132
- What? Why?

1962
01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:12.966
How?

1963
01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.234
Why was he there?

1964
01:31:14.236 --> 01:31:16.069
- He stopped by to
say hi to my parents

1965
01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:18.505
and my Mom invited
him over to dinner.

1966
01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:20.407
- Why would she do that?

1967
01:31:20.409 --> 01:31:22.409
- Something about redemption.

1968
01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:25.712
- Well he doesn't deserve
redemption. that snake!

1969
01:31:25.714 --> 01:31:27.180
I can't believe he just
showed up like that

1970
01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:28.782
after all this time.

1971
01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:29.850
What did you do?

1972
01:31:29.852 --> 01:31:30.684
- What could I do?

1973
01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:32.336
My whole family was like.

1974
01:31:32.337 --> 01:31:33.987
"Oh Michael. it's so
nice to see you.

1975
01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:36.990
"It's been such a long time.
please take Katie back."

1976
01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:37.924
- They said that?

1977
01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:41.127
- [Katie] No Keiko. they
didn't actually say that.

1978
01:31:41.129 --> 01:31:42.295
- He's gone right?

1979
01:31:42.297 --> 01:31:43.997
Never again.

1980
01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:44.898
- Well.

1981
01:31:46.802 --> 01:31:48.168
we're having lunch tomorrow.

1982
01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:50.237
- You're having lunch
tomorrow. with Michael?

1983
01:31:50.239 --> 01:31:51.638
- [Keiko] Why is she doing that?

1984
01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.039
- Keiko. I can hear you.

1985
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:54.875
- I'm talking to Valerie.

1986
01:31:54.877 --> 01:31:56.843
Why is she doing that?

1987
01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:57.944
- For closure.

1988
01:31:59.081 --> 01:32:01.114
I'm tired of being stuck.

1989
01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:03.683
and hurt. and angry.

1990
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.018
I wanna be open.

1991
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.787
- I think closure
might be overrated.

1992
01:32:07.789 --> 01:32:09.756
- Yeah. I don't think this lunch

1993
01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:11.291
is a very good idea.

1994
01:32:11.293 --> 01:32:13.159
Have you talked to
Jacob about this?

1995
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:18.198
(solemn music)

1996
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.933
Katie?
- Uh oh.

1997
01:32:19.935 --> 01:32:20.767
- [Katie] We broke up.

1998
01:32:20.769 --> 01:32:21.601
- What?

1999
01:32:21.603 --> 01:32:22.435
Seriously?

2000
01:32:22.437 --> 01:32:23.637
Katie. I think
you're taking this

2001
01:32:23.639 --> 01:32:25.672
whole holiday boyfriend
thing a little too far.

2002
01:32:25.674 --> 01:32:27.607
- No. not because of that.

2003
01:32:27.609 --> 01:32:28.842
- Then why?

2004
01:32:28.844 --> 01:32:30.544
- Jacob owns the ranch.

2005
01:32:30.546 --> 01:32:31.912
He's not the stable boy.

2006
01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.681
- Okay.

2007
01:32:34.683 --> 01:32:35.582
Well.

2008
01:32:37.352 --> 01:32:38.852
that's new information.

2009
01:32:38.854 --> 01:32:40.020
Not bad information.

2010
01:32:40.022 --> 01:32:42.756
but why would he lie about that?

2011
01:32:42.758 --> 01:32:45.859
- Duh. she kept calling
him her holiday boyfriend.

2012
01:32:45.861 --> 01:32:47.160
And that probably made him feel

2013
01:32:47.162 --> 01:32:49.696
like she didn't really
like him for who he was.

2014
01:32:49.698 --> 01:32:52.265
If she knew that he was
the owner of the ranch

2015
01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:53.900
and she still didn't want him.

2016
01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:57.070
then that would mean he had
a problem with his person.

2017
01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:58.338
But--

2018
01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.907
- If I didn't want him
because of the money.

2019
01:33:00.909 --> 01:33:01.908
that would mean there
was something wrong

2020
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.276
with me as a person.

2021
01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:05.745
- So he was protecting himself?

2022
01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.647
- He probably couldn't
bear the thought

2023
01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:09.282
of losing you.

2024
01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:11.384
Of being enough for you.

2025
01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:13.453
This way he had an excuse.

2026
01:33:14.823 --> 01:33:16.590
- [Valerie] So what are you
gonna do?

2027
01:33:17.593 --> 01:33:18.592
- I don't know.

2028
01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:19.993
I mean the plan was
always to break up

2029
01:33:19.995 --> 01:33:21.461
after the holidays.
maybe I should just--

2030
01:33:21.463 --> 01:33:24.130
- Katie. I don't think
that's what you really want.

2031
01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:25.899
- When he told me. it was like.

2032
01:33:25.901 --> 01:33:27.968
I didn't even know who he was.

2033
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:30.170
And I haven't exactly
treated him well.

2034
01:33:30.172 --> 01:33:32.172
I mean. maybe he's
better off without me.

2035
01:33:32.174 --> 01:33:33.239
- Are you crazy?

2036
01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:35.609
This man's in love with you!

2037
01:33:35.611 --> 01:33:36.876
- She's right.

2038
01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:39.779
And I don't say that
about her very often.

2039
01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:40.964
- Hey.

2040
01:33:40.965 --> 01:33:42.148
- Look. it's been a
really long day.

2041
01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:43.917
I'm gonna try to
get some sleep okay?

2042
01:33:43.919 --> 01:33:45.085
I'll call you guys tomorrow?

2043
01:33:45.087 --> 01:33:46.286
- Okay.

2044
01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:47.486
- Night sprites and
bed bug bites.

2045
01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:49.823
- Okay goodnight.

2046
01:33:49.825 --> 01:33:50.824
- [Valerie] Goodnight.

2047
01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:54.227
- What are we gonna do?

2048
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:55.328
- What do you mean
what are we gonna do?

2049
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.030
What can we do?

2050
01:33:57.032 --> 01:34:01.434
- What if Michael uses
his voodoo magic on her?

2051
01:34:01.436 --> 01:34:03.637
She's helpless against that.

2052
01:34:03.639 --> 01:34:06.006
- Yeah.
(slow light music)

2053
01:34:06.008 --> 01:34:06.906
I have an idea.

2054
01:34:13.415 --> 01:34:16.149
(phone beeping)

2055
01:34:39.574 --> 01:34:40.640
- Hi.

2056
01:34:40.642 --> 01:34:41.574
- Oh hi.

2057
01:34:41.576 --> 01:34:43.176
Where are you off to?

2058
01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:44.844
- Lunch with Micheal.

2059
01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:45.745
I'll be back.

2060
01:34:45.747 --> 01:34:48.048
- Okay. dinner's at six.

2061
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:49.650
Don't be late.

2062
01:34:49.651 --> 01:34:51.251
- Don't worry. I'll be
back way before then.

2063
01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:54.721
My jacket.

2064
01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:37.797
(quirky music)

2065
01:35:45.474 --> 01:35:48.475
(car engine turns)

2066
01:36:39.761 --> 01:36:43.730
- [Katie] You waited
so long. I've moved on.

2067
01:36:44.733 --> 01:36:45.665
- You're absolutely certain

2068
01:36:45.667 --> 01:36:47.333
that you're not gonna change
your mind?

2069
01:36:47.335 --> 01:36:50.336
Katie. don't throw away
everything that we ever had!

2070
01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:53.940
- Jacob.

2071
01:36:53.942 --> 01:36:54.908
- What?

2072
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:56.376
- Hey Katie.

2073
01:36:56.378 --> 01:36:58.111
- [Katie] What are
you doing here?

2074
01:37:01.116 --> 01:37:02.716
- Valerie texted me.

2075
01:37:02.717 --> 01:37:04.317
- Valerie texted you and
so you drove to Colorado?

2076
01:37:05.654 --> 01:37:07.187
- Yup.

2077
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:08.455
- I'm sorry.

2078
01:37:08.456 --> 01:37:09.722
but who is this guy?
(upbeat festive music)

2079
01:37:09.724 --> 01:37:11.057
- None of your business.

2080
01:37:11.059 --> 01:37:12.392
- Katie. I mean it.

2081
01:37:12.394 --> 01:37:14.027
We've been through
so much together.

2082
01:37:14.029 --> 01:37:15.361
Don't just throw it all away!

2083
01:37:15.363 --> 01:37:16.262
Especially.

2084
01:37:17.065 --> 01:37:18.298
not for this guy.

2085
01:37:19.301 --> 01:37:22.468
- I'm not the one who threw
us away Michael. you did.

2086
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:25.071
And this guy just drove
across three states

2087
01:37:25.073 --> 01:37:26.906
because my best
friend texted him.

2088
01:37:29.044 --> 01:37:30.310
- You gotta be kidding me.

2089
01:37:37.319 --> 01:37:39.352
You know what Katie.
don't come crawling back to me

2090
01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:41.688
when this little thing
doesn't work out for ya!

2091
01:37:51.733 --> 01:37:52.899
- [Katie] I can't
believe you're here.

2092
01:37:55.337 --> 01:37:56.769
- What kind of a holiday
boyfriend would I be

2093
01:37:56.771 --> 01:37:58.838
if I wasn't here
for the actual holiday?

2094
01:38:00.976 --> 01:38:01.875
I'm sorry.

2095
01:38:04.746 --> 01:38:05.979
- Keiko says you
were protecting yourself

2096
01:38:05.981 --> 01:38:08.248
because I didn't accept
you for who you are.

2097
01:38:09.284 --> 01:38:10.450
- Keiko said that?

2098
01:38:10.452 --> 01:38:12.385
- Yeah. really.

2099
01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:15.688
- Still.

2100
01:38:16.658 --> 01:38:17.924
I should've said something.

2101
01:38:19.027 --> 01:38:20.593
I don't know why I was so--

2102
01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:23.630
- Insecure.

2103
01:38:23.632 --> 01:38:24.998
- Easy now.

2104
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.467
- It did seem like
you were afraid.

2105
01:38:27.469 --> 01:38:28.568
- Afraid?

2106
01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:29.668
- Yeah. like maybe you
were scared to tell me--

2107
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:30.503
- Scared of what?

2108
01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:31.438
What was I scared of?

2109
01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:32.372
- Yeah. scared like you
know how you're like.

2110
01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:33.740
"Oh no. what if I tell her

2111
01:38:33.742 --> 01:38:34.707
"and she doesn't
like me anymore!"

2112
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:35.775
I'm serious!

2113
01:38:37.612 --> 01:38:38.678
- Who's scared now?

2114
01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:44.617
Who's this?

2115
01:38:44.619 --> 01:38:45.451
- [Jacob And Katie] Who's that?

2116
01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:46.352
- Oh!

2117
01:38:50.458 --> 01:38:51.324
- Katie!

2118
01:38:51.326 --> 01:38:52.558
- Hi guys!

2119
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.927
- How are you?

2120
01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:55.295
Who's this?

2121
01:38:55.297 --> 01:38:56.696
- [Katie] This is Jacob.

2122
01:38:56.698 --> 01:38:58.164
- Jacob. good to meet you.

2123
01:38:58.166 --> 01:38:59.432
- [Jacob] Good meeting you.

2124
01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:01.834
- Am I missing something here?

2125
01:39:03.071 --> 01:39:05.571
- We've been dating
for the past month.

2126
01:39:05.573 --> 01:39:08.074
- So. Jacob. you must be the one

2127
01:39:08.076 --> 01:39:09.609
Katie's been telling me about.

2128
01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:10.910
So nice to meet you.

2129
01:39:10.912 --> 01:39:12.011
- [Jacob] Pleasure to meet you.

2130
01:39:12.013 --> 01:39:14.380
- Come inside. it's cold!

2131
01:39:14.382 --> 01:39:15.515
- Let's do this!

2132
01:39:16.618 --> 01:39:17.801
So you from around here?

2133
01:39:17.802 --> 01:39:18.985
- [Jacob] No.
I came up from L.A.

2134
01:39:19.854 --> 01:39:20.753
- [Brother-In-Law] Nice!

2135
01:39:20.755 --> 01:39:21.955
Well. welcome--

2136
01:39:21.957 --> 01:39:23.556
(Jacob speaks too low)

2137
01:39:23.558 --> 01:39:24.691
(everyone laughing)

2138
01:39:24.693 --> 01:39:25.959
- [Jacob] Ah. you look
good to me.

2139
01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:33.066
¶ Joy to the world ¶

2140
01:39:33.068 --> 01:39:36.469
