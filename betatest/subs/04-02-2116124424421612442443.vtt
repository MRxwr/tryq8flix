Hello.

00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:19.168
Hello.

00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.215
Good morning.

00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:24.260
Welcome aboard.

00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:28.003
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Doctor Enrique Ferrari.

00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:30.745
My patients call me Quique.

00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:32.747
Are you there?

00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:34.923
Hello?

00:17:37.012 --> 00:17:39.058
- Hello.
- Very good.

00:17:39.188 --> 00:17:41.234
I'm the owner of this SUV.

00:17:42.322 --> 00:17:44.585
I've been robbed
28 times in my life.

00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:47.892
It sounds like a lie. but
if you do the math it was 28.

00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:49.764
Plus yours today. 29.

00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:51.070
- Let me out!
- Ssshh!

00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:53.246
Let me talk.

00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:56.075
We'll have plenty of time
to talk.

00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:58.860
You're inside my 4x4.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.862
It has an alarm
that's connected to my phone.

00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:03.517
and I can lock
all the doors with it.

00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:06.868
It's totally bulletproof.

00:18:06.998 --> 00:18:09.740
It won't move.
the active suspension is locked.

00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:11.916
It's soundproof.

00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:14.049
The windows are bulletproof
and polarized.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.530
The front windshield
is also polarized.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.053
The only thing
that's not bulletproof

00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:19.141
is the gas tank.

00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:22.188
It can hold 120 liters.
and it's full.

00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:25.104
It's a potential bomb.

00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:27.889
I'm just saying.
in case you decide to rebel.

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:30.979
Do you know what would happen?

00:18:32.589 --> 00:18:33.721
Boom!

00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:43.948
I'm a widower. I was born
in Quilmes 60 years ago.

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:45.385
I had a normal childhood

00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:47.735
for a middle-class child
at that time.

00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:51.565
The doors of the houses
were never locked.

00:18:53.088 --> 00:18:54.742
We're in such bad shape
that we miss what life was

00:18:54.872 --> 00:18:57.005
like half a century ago.

00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:04.578
What would you do
if you caught your son stealing?

00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:09.496
I don't know.

00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:11.411
Wrong answer.

00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:13.935
- I'm thirsty.
- Can you hear me?

00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:15.893
Hello!

00:19:17.808 --> 00:19:19.636
I'm going to report you.
son of a bitch.

00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:22.335
I'm melting to death in here.
I want water!

00:19:23.988 --> 00:19:26.034
I swear I'll get out of here
and kill you. son of a bitch!

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.168
I'll kill you!
You and all your family!

00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:31.039
Let me out of here!

00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:11.433
Let's try again.

00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:14.610
What would you do
if you caught your son stealing?

00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:16.569
I'm thirsty.

00:23:17.178 --> 00:23:19.354
Let me out. son of a bitch.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.575
If you answer correctly.
I'll give you water.

00:23:23.663 --> 00:23:26.622
What would you do
if you caught your son stealing?

00:23:26.753 --> 00:23:30.931
I'd grab him by the ears.
and take him to the coppers.

00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:32.236
Take him where?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.546
- To the police.
- No. wrong.

00:23:37.677 --> 00:23:41.594
Neither the police. judges.
teachers. nor lawyers.

00:23:41.724 --> 00:23:43.726
He's your son. you have to set
the example yourself.

00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:45.032
That's enough.

00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:48.296
I've learned my lesson.

00:23:49.689 --> 00:23:52.126
Can I tell you something?
Listen to this...

00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:56.260
Last December two men broke
into my daughter's house

00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:59.263
when she was parking her car.

00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:00.787
I had trained her
for a situation like this.

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:03.006
She avoided making eye contact.

00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:05.705
She had money prepared
to hand them out.

00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:08.490
But that wasn't enough.

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:11.841
They even took
their toothbrushes.

00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:16.411
That's enough. please.
I want to get out.

00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:19.545
They grabbed my grandson.
and put a gun to his head.

00:24:20.807 --> 00:24:23.157
He's five years old.
Do you get it?

00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:26.856
They held a gun to his head
for three hours.

00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:29.946
After that they sold the house.

00:24:30.077 --> 00:24:31.905
and moved to Barcelona.

00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:34.342
I'm dying of thirst.

00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:37.345
What kind of doctor are you?

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:40.304
Good question.
Take a guess.

00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:44.134
What kind of doctor am I?
Come on. guess.

00:24:44.265 --> 00:24:46.789
I don't know. Let me out.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.574
I'm not a cardiologist.

00:24:48.704 --> 00:24:51.054
Nor a clinical doctor.
nor a surgeon.

00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:53.579
Come on. take a guess.
There aren't that many left.

00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:55.145
Leave me alone!

00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:56.277
I'll give you a hint.

00:24:56.407 --> 00:24:58.497
I work
where everyone else plays.

00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:00.803
Water!

00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:12.092
Hey! Hey!

00:26:12.222 --> 00:26:14.050
Hey! Hey!

00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:20.579
Hey!

00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:22.493
Hey!

00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:24.278
Hey!

00:26:24.408 --> 00:26:25.322
Hey!

00:26:25.932 --> 00:26:27.890
Hey!

00:26:29.762 --> 00:26:30.632
Hey!

00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:37.291
Hey!

00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:39.336
Hey!

00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:40.686
Hey. man!

00:26:45.038 --> 00:26:46.300
Hey!

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.431
Hey!

00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:19.219
Your ID number. please.

00:28:21.351 --> 00:28:22.483
Water.

00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:24.615
Your ID number. buddy.

00:28:28.097 --> 00:28:29.664
I'm thirsty.

00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:33.276
Give me your first name.
last name. and ID number.

00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:35.409
And I'll give you water.

00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:40.719
Ciro.

00:28:43.896 --> 00:28:45.027
Ciro Bermúdez.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.205
Thirty-six...
eighty-seven...

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:52.339
Ninety. twenty-seven.

00:28:52.469 --> 00:28:56.473
Zero. two. seven. good.

00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:57.953
For the water.

00:28:58.084 --> 00:28:59.259
check the washer
hose in the back.

00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:12.027
Neighbordwhood watch...

00:30:17.772 --> 00:30:19.382
What do I know?

00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:23.517
They use it for cars.

00:30:24.692 --> 00:30:26.607
For houses.

00:30:26.737 --> 00:30:28.217
For businesses.

00:30:30.263 --> 00:30:31.960
It's no good for anything.

00:30:36.878 --> 00:30:38.749
Right now there must
be thousands of alarms

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.534
going off in the city.

00:30:41.752 --> 00:30:43.450
So many...

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.452
Like a concert.

00:32:15.846 --> 00:32:19.546
I'm wounded. and I have a fever.
What should I do?

00:32:20.199 --> 00:32:22.070
Is this a consultation?

00:32:25.247 --> 00:32:26.248
Yes.

00:32:27.423 --> 00:32:28.947
Well.

00:32:29.077 --> 00:32:32.559
everything depends on the
person's general condition.

00:32:32.689 --> 00:32:35.866
A fever with a wound
is a different story.

00:32:35.997 --> 00:32:38.957
Time passes very fast.
What happened to you?

00:32:40.436 --> 00:32:41.960
A gunshot in my leg.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.527
Wow!
How did this happen?

00:32:45.224 --> 00:32:47.574
I shot myself.
it was an accident.

00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:50.185
Is it still bleeding?

00:33:01.196 --> 00:33:02.328
No.

00:33:03.198 --> 00:33:04.852
Not a lot.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.115
What color is the skin
around the wound?

00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:09.596
Yellow.

00:33:09.726 --> 00:33:10.945
Is it hot?

00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:14.340
Yes. yes.

00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:18.039
That doesn't sound good.

00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:21.173
I'll turn the heat on.
If you have a fever.

00:33:21.303 --> 00:33:22.957
then you must feel cold.

00:33:23.088 --> 00:33:24.219
No. no. no.

00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:27.396
Today I woke up early.

00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:29.485
I went out for a run at 7 AM.

00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:31.270
I had breakfast.

00:33:32.097 --> 00:33:33.533
I went to the lab
to get the results

00:33:33.663 --> 00:33:35.274
of the tests
I had done last week.

00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:39.191
It's over. the spot expanded.

00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:43.543
My insides
are completely invaded.

00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:46.111
It's no big deal.

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:49.549
Optimistically. I've got
about a year left to live.

00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:53.596
That's not so bad.

00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:56.904
A lot of things can happen
in one year. you know?

00:33:58.819 --> 00:34:01.126
If you're organized.
you can change the world.

00:34:02.997 --> 00:34:05.695
Or a piece of the world
that's closest to you.

00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:14.400
I was remembering dates
and places.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.142
Things that happened to me
in the past few years.

00:34:17.272 --> 00:34:18.447
and I wrote them down.

00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:20.449
Listen to this.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.061
August 1998. I went out
for dinner with some friends.

00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:25.063
When we were leaving they had
stolen two wheels off my car.

00:34:25.193 --> 00:34:27.065
It was a Peugeot 205.

00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:29.415
January 2001. they got
into the patio in my house.

00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:31.243
and stole
some garden furniture.

00:34:31.373 --> 00:34:34.072
things from the pool.
and meat from the patio fridge.

00:34:35.116 --> 00:34:37.379
March 2006.
an armed robbery

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.555
in La Taba Restaurant
in Vicente López.

00:34:39.686 --> 00:34:40.904
They robbed everyone there.

00:34:41.035 --> 00:34:44.038
and hit an old man
with the grip of a gun.

00:34:44.169 --> 00:34:46.301
April 2008.
they got into my wife's car

00:34:46.432 --> 00:34:47.868
at a stoplight in San Miguel.

00:34:47.998 --> 00:34:50.044
and forced her to go shopping
with the credit card.

00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:52.046
They'd choose and she'd pay.

00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:55.484
Ma'am. buy me the LCD TV.
buy me the Samsung...

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.879
October 2009.
I go to River's stadium.

00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:00.707
the guy looking after my car
scratched it

00:35:00.837 --> 00:35:03.275
because I wouldn't pay him
700 pesos upfront.

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.669
August 2011. they broke
into my parents' house

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.368
when my dad was parking the car
in the garage.

00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:11.021
My mom was outside
opening the gate for him.

00:35:11.152 --> 00:35:12.806
they were already old.

00:35:12.936 --> 00:35:15.722
They didn't use guns.
but they really beat him up.

00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:20.553
I'll leave you now.
I have an emergency.

00:35:20.683 --> 00:35:22.250
We'll continue later.

00:41:56.688 --> 00:41:58.341
Son of a bitch!

00:41:58.472 --> 00:42:00.169
Don't come back
to the neighborhood!

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.215
Go fuck yourself!

00:42:02.345 --> 00:42:04.043
If you come back.
I'll beat you up!

00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:05.435
You're all useless!

00:42:16.795 --> 00:42:18.448
Always the same thing!

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:21.147
They never do anything.
I'm sick of this.

00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:22.670
What a shitty neighborhood!

00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:05.207
Saprotrophs.

00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:11.474
Tenth grade biology.

00:44:14.042 --> 00:44:15.653
I never passed.

00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:25.097
They're these fucking animals
that eat the other's leftovers.

00:44:25.837 --> 00:44:30.450
And keep nature in balance.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.153
Too many people on the streets

00:44:38.284 --> 00:44:40.373
have too many things.

00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:46.814
And those things
have to be distributed

00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:49.861
so that everyone can enjoy them.

00:44:58.217 --> 00:45:00.698
This place is full
of poor people.

00:45:02.177 --> 00:45:05.485
With laws made by rich people
for rich people.

00:45:05.615 --> 00:45:09.010
I will not obey them.
not even if they gun me down.

00:45:10.403 --> 00:45:11.447
Yes.

00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:13.623
Thief.

00:45:15.147 --> 00:45:16.931
Just like my father.

00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:19.629
Just like my grandfather.

00:46:22.214 --> 00:46:23.955
I'll do whatever you say.

00:46:26.087 --> 00:46:28.568
I'll do whatever you want.
I swear I'll behave.

00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:31.397
But I want to go home.

00:46:31.527 --> 00:46:33.791
Don't worry. you're not
missing out on anything.

00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:37.664
I'm having breakfast
and reading the newspaper.

00:46:39.492 --> 00:46:42.103
North Korea conducts
a new nuclear test.

00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:45.106
That fat guy is crazy.

00:46:45.977 --> 00:46:47.065
Del Potro is among
the 10 tallest

00:46:47.195 --> 00:46:48.196
tennis players in history.

00:46:48.327 --> 00:46:50.546
Look at that.
He's really amazing.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.201
Does "mate" make you fat?

00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:56.030
Fifteen myths and truths
about our national drink.

00:46:57.205 --> 00:46:58.772
Men and women
from Buenos Aires

00:46:58.903 --> 00:47:00.774
are among the most unfaithful
in the world.

00:47:02.689 --> 00:47:05.344
Well. today I got up
in a good mood.

00:47:05.779 --> 00:47:07.215
So you're in luck.

00:47:07.346 --> 00:47:09.217
There's a chocolate bar
behind the brakes.

00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:14.092
Hold on one second.

00:47:14.222 --> 00:47:15.745
I have a call on
my other cell phone.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.012
Hello. Yes.

00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:24.363
Tell me quickly.
I'm on another call.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:30.325
Yes. you'll have to come
to the clinic. What happened?

00:47:33.763 --> 00:47:35.983
Her water broke?
Was there any physical strain?

00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:41.336
Tell her to go quickly
to the emergency room.

00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:43.643
and to say that
she's Doctor Ferrari's patient.

00:47:44.644 --> 00:47:46.515
Okay. I'll see you soon.

00:47:49.518 --> 00:47:51.172
I'm sorry.
that was my secretary.

00:47:54.262 --> 00:47:55.873
Water.

00:47:58.832 --> 00:48:00.312
Water.

00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:03.445
And a joint.

00:48:10.322 --> 00:48:12.280
Here comes the girl in leggings
with her dog.

00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:16.023
That dog is worth more
than 1.000 dollars.

00:48:32.431 --> 00:48:33.780
Punctual.

00:48:35.303 --> 00:48:38.524
First the wife comes out.
and stands on guard.

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:42.267
The man opens the gate.
and gets his car out.

00:48:43.268 --> 00:48:46.184
And she stays there surveying
everything from the sidewalk.

00:48:52.625 --> 00:48:54.757
This guy keeps his door open
with the hose.

00:48:54.888 --> 00:48:56.368
So easy.

00:48:57.586 --> 00:48:59.153
I'll show up
and all he can do is pray

00:48:59.284 --> 00:49:00.894
while I look for all his money.

00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:02.417
What a wuss.

00:49:03.897 --> 00:49:05.855
Those little brothers don't have
more than a cell phone

00:49:05.986 --> 00:49:07.161
in their backpacks.

00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:15.213
The old man gets
the car started and leaves.

00:49:20.696 --> 00:49:22.002
Now he'll look
through the mirror.

00:49:22.133 --> 00:49:23.873
and watch the old woman
go back inside.

00:49:24.004 --> 00:49:24.918
And he leaves.

00:49:33.927 --> 00:49:36.147
Homeless son of a bitch.

00:49:36.277 --> 00:49:38.105
Yesterday two rotten apples.

00:49:38.888 --> 00:49:40.238
Today he's having pizza.

00:50:10.485 --> 00:50:11.878
Hey!

00:50:13.227 --> 00:50:14.968
Hey!

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.361
Here!

00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:19.059
In here!

00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:21.496
Help!

00:50:30.505 --> 00:50:31.550
Hey!

00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:23.645
Hello. Ciro.

00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:28.433
I have news from Irina
and Lionel.

00:51:31.262 --> 00:51:32.524
What?

00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:34.787
What you just heard.

00:51:37.485 --> 00:51:38.834
How do you know
my family's names.

00:51:38.965 --> 00:51:39.879
son of a bitch?

00:51:41.315 --> 00:51:43.404
Don't you even think
about doing something to them.

00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:46.103
Take it easy.
I didn't do anything to them.

00:51:48.061 --> 00:51:50.933
On the contrary. I met with them
and explained everything.

00:51:51.064 --> 00:51:53.110
I said I work for the lottery.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.677
that Ciro Bermúdez
had played a lottery ticket.

00:51:55.808 --> 00:51:58.071
and that
they could collect $100.000

00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.117
immediately and in cash.

00:52:06.732 --> 00:52:08.212
You were at my house?

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.389
Yes.

00:52:12.172 --> 00:52:15.219
106 St. Tower 3.
Apartment 10-E.

00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:16.698
San Benito.

00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:22.400
Of course Irina accepted
the money I gave her.

00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:24.750
I allowed myself to suggest

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.144
that she should try
to stop renting.

00:52:27.274 --> 00:52:28.841
That she should buy a property.

00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:32.061
And use the rest to give the kid
a good education.

00:52:33.498 --> 00:52:37.110
She is a young
and beautiful woman.

00:52:37.241 --> 00:52:40.157
She'll always have the chance
to restart her life.

00:52:43.986 --> 00:52:46.250
I didn't do anything to you.
son of a bitch.

00:52:48.295 --> 00:52:51.037
You did so little to have
such a beautiful family.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.084
You don't deserve it.
Do you know that?

00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:59.741
I have your
criminal record here.

00:52:59.872 --> 00:53:01.352
It's interesting.

00:53:02.614 --> 00:53:04.529
Have you ever killed anyone?

00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:07.271
I mean. how does it feel?

00:53:08.054 --> 00:53:09.055
No.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:10.491
No.

00:53:11.144 --> 00:53:12.798
I didn't kill anyone.

00:53:13.712 --> 00:53:15.192
They say that the first time
you kill it's horrible.

00:53:15.322 --> 00:53:17.368
And the rest of the deaths...

00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:20.762
Once you've killed.
you don't even feel them.

00:53:22.547 --> 00:53:25.724
I didn't kill anyone.
Are you crazy?

00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:28.857
You didn't kill anyone?

00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:33.558
The Salerno brothers
from the tire shop in Barracas.

00:53:33.862 --> 00:53:35.603
Do you remember?

00:53:36.517 --> 00:53:38.693
You broke in to rob them.
but he fought back...

00:53:39.128 --> 00:53:40.695
So you shot him.

00:53:43.263 --> 00:53:44.917
The guy pulled a knife out.

00:53:47.049 --> 00:53:50.314
Teófilo Mendoza.
bus driver. 64 years old.

00:53:51.619 --> 00:53:54.492
You beat him up
so you could rob the passengers.

00:53:55.014 --> 00:53:57.016
He was two days away
from retirement.

00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:59.105
The old man refused
to cooperate.

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.498
Aha!

00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:04.371
Look at this. Armed robbery
in Villa Ballester.

00:54:04.502 --> 00:54:06.417
Cristina Beruti.

00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:08.984
You and another one
stole her car and purse.

00:54:09.115 --> 00:54:11.770
And two blocks later
you ran over Mercedes Torres.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.554
She dies immediately.

00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:19.212
You were at
a youth detention center.

00:54:19.343 --> 00:54:21.083
You have a good curriculum.

00:54:21.649 --> 00:54:23.042
I made mistakes.

00:54:24.348 --> 00:54:25.610
I paid for them.

00:54:26.698 --> 00:54:28.003
What else do you want?

00:54:29.222 --> 00:54:30.179
Nothing.

00:54:31.355 --> 00:54:32.965
You're the chosen one.

00:54:34.532 --> 00:54:36.229
You're condemned.

00:54:37.752 --> 00:54:38.623
Just like me.

00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:42.077
Hi. we're Irina...

00:55:42.208 --> 00:55:43.209
And Lionel.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.472
This is our bat-voicemail.

00:55:45.603 --> 00:55:48.345
Leave your message
after the bat-beep.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.610
Irina...

00:55:56.222 --> 00:55:57.876
I screwed up again.

00:56:02.968 --> 00:56:04.186
Lio...

00:56:06.711 --> 00:56:07.538
It's daddy.

00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:34.739
Come on.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:36.784
Get out.

00:56:49.754 --> 00:56:50.711
Good luck.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.331
]

00:58:04.437 --> 00:58:06.047
Fucking gear stick!

00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:09.834
Fuck.

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:52.230
Sir.

01:01:54.362 --> 01:01:56.974
I need you to pay
for the food and get going.

01:02:02.153 --> 01:02:04.851
Fucking low life.
do you hear what I'm saying?

01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:08.072
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how to talk?

01:03:28.979 --> 01:03:30.241
Please.

01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:34.593
I want to see my son.

01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:37.552
That's impossible. no way.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.644
If I can't get out.
I'll kill myself.

01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:46.518
And then it'll all be over.

01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:51.653
One...

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:57.442
Two...

01:04:09.019 --> 01:04:10.324
Well?

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:11.369
What happened?

01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:13.110
Hello?

01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:16.809
The bullet got stuck?

01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:22.771
Sunday is a shitty day
for everything.

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:24.904
Even for committing suicide.

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:28.777
What do we do on Sundays?
We wash the car...

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.692
We celebrate the goals.

01:04:30.823 --> 01:04:32.564
We eat all day long
just waiting for Monday.

01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:35.132
Look at me.

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:40.485
Look at me.

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:43.401
Look at me.

01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:46.230
Look at me. I'm up front.

01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:51.626
Lights. camera. action.

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:54.586
Do you see me?

01:04:58.416 --> 01:04:59.504
Yes.

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.462
We finally meet.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.336
I left the hospital
to say hi to you.

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:07.816
Nice to meet you.

01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.689
I'm Enrique.

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:29.942
Surprise.

01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:34.991
I brought you
what you asked for.

01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:39.996
Your last wish.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.043
A joint.

01:06:47.612 --> 01:06:49.222
I bought it for you.

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:50.223
I don't smoke.

01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:11.070
Take it.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:12.898
Come on...

01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:14.900
Come on.

01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:18.295
There we go.

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:31.221
I brought this for me.

01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:34.789
Chocolate covered peanuts.

01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:37.618
I love
chocolate covered peanuts.

01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:58.074
How's your wound?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.034
Let me see.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:06.821
Get your hand out of there.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.174
We have to drain this.

01:08:11.304 --> 01:08:12.392
Stop screaming.

01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:14.133
Stop screaming.

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:15.787
We have to drain this.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.182
Does that hurt?

01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:20.400
Yes.

01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.576
- Does it hurt a lot?
- A lot.

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:24.361
A lot.

01:08:24.491 --> 01:08:26.189
- On a scale of one to ten?
- Ten!

01:08:33.935 --> 01:08:35.285
It'll get better.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.331
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.553
Margarita. how are you?

01:09:27.815 --> 01:09:29.687
Yes. I can talk.
I'm at a medical congress

01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:30.862
on Dominican Republic.

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.474
The baby is coming early?

01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.565
How long between
each contraction?

01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:44.136
Get the bag ready
with your husband.

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:47.574
And head slowly to the hospital.

01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.881
Doctor Ernesto Flores
will receive you there.

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:53.711
He always takes my cases
when I'm not there.

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:58.455
Write the number down.
15-3-176-5432.

01:09:58.585 --> 01:09:59.891
And as I always say.

01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:02.198
in the belly
of every pregnant mother

01:10:02.328 --> 01:10:03.329
is a treasure. darling.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.200
No!

01:10:32.619 --> 01:10:33.707
Help.

01:10:36.536 --> 01:10:37.581
Help.

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:44.675
Help.

01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.076
Come here!

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.082
Let me go. son of a bitch.

01:11:02.475 --> 01:11:04.738
- Come here.
- Let me go. son of a bitch!

01:11:04.869 --> 01:11:07.001
- Not back in the SUV.
- Look at what you did.

01:11:07.132 --> 01:11:09.830
- Not in the SUV!
- Yes. yes.

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:11.005
Help!

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:15.227
Help me.

01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:16.663
Freeze. police!

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:18.709
The gun.

01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:19.971
Drop the gun.

01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:24.976
Help. this man is crazy.
He locked me in his SUV.

01:11:25.106 --> 01:11:26.630
Help!

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.111
Take it easy.
we'll settle this ourselves.

01:11:30.242 --> 01:11:33.463
We'll drink a coffee and talk.
This is not your problem.

01:11:33.593 --> 01:11:36.727
Not you. not the police.
or anybody else.

01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:38.772
- So get going. girl.
- Help me.

01:11:38.903 --> 01:11:40.905
Do you always risk
your life for a bad salary?

01:11:41.035 --> 01:11:42.428
Congratulations.

01:11:42.559 --> 01:11:45.213
This is not what you're
thinking. you're mistaken.

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:48.565
This is his gun.
he tried to steal my SUV.

01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:51.698
He shot me. look.
And you're pointing at me.

01:11:51.829 --> 01:11:53.309
That's enough. drop the gun!

01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:56.442
After two hours of tension.

01:11:56.573 --> 01:11:58.705
the situation here
remains the same.

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:01.839
I'd like to ask you.
who are on the other side.

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:04.058
to those of you in the studio.

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:06.365
What is happening to us
as a society?

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:08.106
Up to what point
are these young criminals

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:10.238
not the real victims?

01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:13.241
Have we thought about
what kind of education they get?

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:16.201
What opportunities
did they have in their lives?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.594
He's the thief.
I'm the victim!

01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:21.206
Someone has taken justice
into their own hands.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:25.515
Human rights are to blame
for our country's problems.

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.125
I've been asked by the D.A.

01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:29.127
to tell you to calm down.
please.

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.650
And tell us what you want.

01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:32.826
I don't want anything.

01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:35.438
Hey. all of you!
I want you to vote.

01:12:35.568 --> 01:12:38.658
Put it in the headlines:
What should I do?

01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:40.704
Should I kill him.
or turn him over to the cops?

01:12:40.834 --> 01:12:42.488
Where he'll be released
tomorrow.

01:12:42.619 --> 01:12:45.186
I'll do whatever you decide.

01:12:45.317 --> 01:12:46.884
But we all have to commit
to this.

01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:48.102
Kill him!

01:12:48.233 --> 01:12:50.670
No hypocrisy.
just your hand on your heart.

01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:54.805
Even if we look bad.
The truth. the truth!

01:12:54.935 --> 01:12:56.502
We have to call Amadeo.
the negotiator.

01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:59.113
He's retired. it's impossible.

01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:00.201
Call him.

01:13:00.332 --> 01:13:01.377
On Twitter. on everything...

01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:02.552
Ma'am. please.

01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:04.380
Kill him or give him
to the police?

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:07.948
Officer. I've brought food
for the man and the robber.

01:13:08.079 --> 01:13:10.690
Ma'am. please leave now!

01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:11.996
I'm hungry.

01:13:20.613 --> 01:13:21.614
Hey.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.269
Hey. how's it going?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.792
- How are you?
- I'm great.

01:13:25.923 --> 01:13:27.490
- Thanks for coming. sir.
- No problem.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.492
I wasn't doing much.

01:13:29.622 --> 01:13:32.103
I was watching you on TV.

01:13:32.233 --> 01:13:34.932
- A vest?
- No. thanks.

01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:35.976
- Well?
- Follow me.

01:13:36.107 --> 01:13:37.064
Yes.

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:46.770
Hello. doctor.

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.207
Hey. boy.

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.253
I'll introduce myself.

01:13:53.254 --> 01:13:58.434
I'm Julio Amadeo.
mediator for the city police.

01:13:59.173 --> 01:14:02.002
I'm here to see if...

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:05.789
If I can help.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.230
Doctor. is there anything
I can do for you?

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.711
There is something
you can do for me.

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.323
The dog shit problem.

01:14:20.325 --> 01:14:23.720
I leave my clinic
on Syria Street...

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:26.897
I walk ten blocks
to Palermo Park...

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:30.422
There are 10 buildings
per block. that's 100 buildings.

01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.990
There are 10 dogs per building.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.948
That's 1.000 dogs.

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:37.603
At two dog stools per day.

01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:43.217
That's 2.000 turds. Julio.
That I avoid every day.

01:14:43.348 --> 01:14:45.089
Because their owners...

01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:47.134
Have a plastic bag.
but if you don't look at them.

01:14:47.265 --> 01:14:48.484
they don't do anything.

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:50.529
Excuse me. Enrique.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.098
Drop the gun.
and let the boy go.

01:14:54.228 --> 01:14:57.536
We both know he has
nothing to do with this.

01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.713
The issue is something else.

01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:03.977
True. The problem is deciding
what's fair and what's not.

01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:05.936
And that's what I'm doing.

01:15:06.763 --> 01:15:11.245
I'm tired of hearing
that "at least nobody got hurt".

01:15:11.768 --> 01:15:13.726
That I should be thankful
they weren't on drugs.

01:15:13.857 --> 01:15:15.467
Or that luckily
they were professionals.

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:17.991
They're sons of bitches!

01:15:18.122 --> 01:15:22.126
- They're from the neighborhood!
- Silence. silence!

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:24.258
Let me take care
of that son of a bitch.

01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:25.782
Doctor.

01:15:26.739 --> 01:15:29.960
I'd like you to reflect
upon this for one minute.

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.831
You're angry.

01:15:33.354 --> 01:15:35.531
But not at the boy.
he has nothing to do with this.

01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:38.359
You're angry at the world.

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:41.624
And I understand. because
you're not the only one.

01:15:41.754 --> 01:15:45.628
We're all angry. very angry.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:48.935
That doesn't matter. at least
I did something about it.

01:15:49.066 --> 01:15:51.721
Or what's left?
Living abroad?

01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:55.855
Look.
look at all the people here.

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:58.466
Look at this beautiful show.
Julio.

01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.904
The boy has already
learned his lesson.

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.819
- Let him go.
- No.

01:16:02.949 --> 01:16:04.734
For what? For justice
to do the work?

01:16:04.864 --> 01:16:06.562
Sons of bitches!
They go in one door.

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:08.389
and exit through another!

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.479
I believe in my own justice.
end of story.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.308
I hunted this one down.
he's mine.

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.833
I'm angry too!

01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:20.488
Do you know the difference
between my anger and yours?

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:23.883
It's that I know
this isn't good for anything!

01:16:25.319 --> 01:16:26.364
This is a free-for-all
neighborhood!

01:16:26.494 --> 01:16:28.627
We get robbed here every day!

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:30.803
Let's see. how many
of you have been robbed?

01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:33.197
Raise your hands.
How many have fences?

01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:34.590
How many have alarms?

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.505
How many are scared
of taking your kids to school.

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:39.595
so you check
the gates before entering?

01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:43.816
This man has nothing to lose.
that's why in his head...

01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:46.166
He'll always win.

01:16:46.297 --> 01:16:48.473
The son of a bitch is a samurai.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.955
Let's hear it for the police
who are present here. good job.

01:16:52.085 --> 01:16:53.870
I'm going to drag this out
a bit.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.959
I'll see if he gets tired.

01:16:56.089 --> 01:16:57.395
Doctor.

01:16:58.396 --> 01:17:01.181
Let me bring you both
some water.

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:04.576
Safety. safety. safety!

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:05.882
There we go.

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:07.144
Let's go.

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:10.669
Safety. safety. safety!

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:14.281
No. no. no.

01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:17.894
The girl. my friend.

01:17:18.024 --> 01:17:19.112
Go ahead.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:21.506
The gun.

01:17:27.991 --> 01:17:29.035
Go ahead.

01:17:31.168 --> 01:17:33.518
Taboada. Taboada.
Follow Tapia.

01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.348
Follow Tapia. Taboada.

01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:15.516
Thanks. sweetheart.

01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:23.089
- He requested water.
- Not for him. for the hostage...

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:34.361
Give me that.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:37.495
Doctor. Think about it.

01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:42.718
You're an educated man.

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:46.417
Look. I'm going to tell you
a story.

01:18:47.026 --> 01:18:49.333
The story of a boy
who lives in his house

01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:52.989
with his younger brother.
his mom. a house wife.

01:18:53.119 --> 01:18:56.296
and his dad. who works
at a meat processing plant.

01:18:57.776 --> 01:19:00.344
A normal family. I'd say.

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:04.087
On an ordinary day the man
leaves his home to go to work.

01:19:04.217 --> 01:19:06.219
and he never comes back.

01:19:07.046 --> 01:19:09.353
Those were complicated
months for the family.

01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:11.790
The father
wasn't around. but...

01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:14.924
Time eventually healed things.

01:19:15.054 --> 01:19:18.666
The boys continued
at school with their friends.

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:20.668
The woman met a man.

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:23.715
He was a dentist. a widower
from the neighborhood.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.154
You must be wondering
what my point is with this.

01:19:28.285 --> 01:19:29.808
I'm saying
that whatever happens.

01:19:29.939 --> 01:19:32.463
whatever you do...

01:19:32.593 --> 01:19:35.379
The world keeps on spinning.

01:19:38.164 --> 01:19:40.688
The years passed. and this boy
became a young man.

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:41.994
He was 20 years old.

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:44.692
And one day he looks
out of his window.

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:47.521
and sees a disheveled man.

01:19:47.652 --> 01:19:50.220
A filthy man under the rain.

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.700
He seems homeless.
he's staring at him.

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.312
But he didn't really
pay attention to it.

01:19:56.052 --> 01:19:57.705
A few days later
he leaves his house

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.272
to go to school.

01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:01.927
And he sees a crowd
in the middle of the street.

01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:04.103
And somebody
was lying dead on the ground.

01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:06.105
He had been run over.

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:08.238
He was the same homeless man.

01:20:08.368 --> 01:20:11.328
who a few days earlier
was staring at his house.

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:15.071
And now he recognizes him.

01:20:15.854 --> 01:20:17.900
This homeless man
was his father.

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:20.816
And the young man...

01:20:22.252 --> 01:20:23.688
Was me.

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:29.520
Listen doctor.
I'm going to speak frankly.

01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:32.479
Look me in the eye.

01:20:34.133 --> 01:20:36.396
These eyes have seen it all.

01:20:38.007 --> 01:20:40.226
I don't have a wife anymore.
she passed away.

01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:44.448
We didn't have kids.
we weren't able to.

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:47.190
I have few friends.

01:20:48.756 --> 01:20:52.630
My best friend was Coquito.
a cat who died of old age.

01:20:54.153 --> 01:20:57.417
I don't have savings.
I don't have dollars.

01:20:57.548 --> 01:20:59.289
I live off
of my police retirement.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:02.945
And I can guarantee you.

01:21:03.075 --> 01:21:05.904
I don't want to have
anything I don't have.

01:21:06.905 --> 01:21:08.994
I have fucking nothing to lose.

01:21:10.517 --> 01:21:11.562
Less than you.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.175
Do you know
what the only thing I have is?

01:21:20.179 --> 01:21:22.616
Three beers in the fridge.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.489
Don't give in. doctor!

01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:29.362
Let go of the boy.
he's learned his lesson.

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:32.409
And drop the gun.

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:35.629
When all of this is over...

01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:38.415
You can come to my place
one day.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:39.677
we can have a beer.

01:21:39.807 --> 01:21:43.420
eat some pizza.
and have a long chat.

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:45.857
Come on. let him go.

01:21:49.469 --> 01:21:50.949
Kill him!

01:21:51.428 --> 01:21:52.516
What?

01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:55.127
And if I don't want to.
what happens?

01:21:55.258 --> 01:21:57.434
You know exactly what happens.

01:21:57.564 --> 01:21:59.827
If I kill him. you kill me?

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.134
Kill him. shoot him.

01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:04.049
Go on. shoot him!

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.269
That way you end
all of his troubles.

01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:08.271
The boy won't feel
anything anymore.

01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:10.882
Now. the burden of that death

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.884
is something
you'll carry on your own.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:18.498
Drop the gun.
he could be your son.

01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:20.544
Daughter. I have a daughter.

01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:21.980
Okay. your daughter.

01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:23.590
My daughter
would never kill anyone.

01:22:23.721 --> 01:22:26.593
But she would still be
the daughter of a man

01:22:26.724 --> 01:22:30.075
who has been threatening
to kill a boy for five hours.

01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:32.643
Do you want to kill him
in front of everyone?

01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:34.514
Do you want to do
it for the cameras?

01:22:36.647 --> 01:22:39.955
For the cameras. you say?

01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:44.350
I've brought tons of babies
into this world!

01:22:44.481 --> 01:22:46.396
Kill him. he'll be one less!

01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:47.919
He must pay for it!

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.138
Put him in jail!

01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:50.704
We want to feel safe!

01:22:50.835 --> 01:22:53.577
Let him go.
you crazy asshole!

01:22:53.707 --> 01:22:55.622
They should all be killed!

01:22:55.753 --> 01:22:57.537
He's a person too!

01:23:00.627 --> 01:23:03.369
We should kill them all!

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.937
In the end. what are you?

01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:07.634
Just a murderer?

01:23:07.765 --> 01:23:09.723
- Kill him!
- He's a person!

01:23:10.594 --> 01:23:12.204
Let him go. he's just a boy.

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:14.076
He's a human being.

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:20.952
Let's go!

01:23:21.953 --> 01:23:23.346
- Thank you.
- Grab him!

01:23:24.477 --> 01:23:25.696
Stay still. stay still!

01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:28.003
Drop the gun. please.

01:23:28.133 --> 01:23:29.395
- Stay still.
- Against the car.

01:23:29.526 --> 01:23:31.528
Come on. put him
against the car.

01:23:31.658 --> 01:23:32.355
We have the boy. everyone ready.

01:23:32.485 --> 01:23:34.487
It's over. Enrique.

01:23:41.146 --> 01:23:42.626
Please.

01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:48.153
We're all ready.

01:24:06.867 --> 01:24:08.260
Let's go. let's go!

01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:17.617
No! Step back!

01:24:17.748 --> 01:24:19.358
- Everyone. step back!
- Let's go!

01:24:23.536 --> 01:24:25.016
Holy shit!

01:24:32.154 --> 01:24:33.633
Move! Move! Move!

01:24:59.746 --> 01:25:03.010
The people from the neighborhood
are truly shocked.

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:06.231
After hours of following
the alternatives

01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:08.668
closely behind police lines...

01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:10.670
After the unthinkable
occurred...

01:25:10.801 --> 01:25:11.976
The neighbours
can't seem to get over

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.108
the surprise of this outcome.

01:26:54.905 --> 01:26:57.473
The country is still shocked
with the Enrique Ferrari case.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:58.865
The obstetrician.

01:26:58.996 --> 01:27:00.171
As we all know.

01:27:00.302 --> 01:27:02.913
the case had a tragic
and surprising ending.

01:27:03.043 --> 01:27:04.871
One more case of someone
taking justice

01:27:05.002 --> 01:27:06.133
into their own hands.

01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:07.787
On this occasion.
Enrique Ferrari.

01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:10.312
or the "Samurai Doctor".
as the press called him.

01:27:10.442 --> 01:27:14.098
challenged all limits.
and became a leading case.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.100
One which has opened
a new debate

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.711
about the subject that worries
all Argentineans the most.

01:27:18.842 --> 01:27:20.974
The lack of safety.

01:27:21.105 --> 01:27:23.455
Ciro Bermúdez. the robber
who was held captive

01:27:23.586 --> 01:27:25.065
inside the SUV.

01:27:25.196 --> 01:27:27.459
could recover his freedom
in the following hours.

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:30.245
The remains
of a late night of fury

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:31.855
can be seen in the neighborhood.

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:36.076
...the 4x4 SUV was parked
next to a space for rent.

01:27:36.207 --> 01:27:39.732
It was a cage on wheels.
kind of a mousetrap.

01:27:41.647 --> 01:27:43.475
Colleagues and friends
from the hospital

01:27:43.606 --> 01:27:47.262
assured us that the obstetrician
was well liked and respected

01:27:47.392 --> 01:27:49.264
at the San Giuliano Clinic.

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:51.614
We've gone out to the streets
to ask people what they think.
