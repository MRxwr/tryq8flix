00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.446
Haw. Togo! Haw! Haw!

2
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.827
Good dog! Good dog!

3
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.791
Leave it!

4
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.675
Leave it alone!

5
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.358
Good dog.

6
00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.198
Well done. Togo!

7
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.174
Well done. all!

8
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.629
There'll be full bellies
and warm beds tonight.

9
00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.049
All right. Togo! Hike!

10
00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.786
Whoa!

11
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.961
There's been a diphtheria outbreak.

12
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.043
How long?

13
00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.167
- More than a week.
- Constance?

14
00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.264
Fine. She's fine.

15
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.383
It's mostly children.

16
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.394
Five have died.

17
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.140
Bless them.

18
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.930
Twenty more sick here in Nome.

19
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.929
And no telling how many
in the Inuit villages.

20
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.769
They found serum in Fairbanks.

21
00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.612
They just don't know how
to get it from there to here.

22
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.649
Anyway. everybody's at Dexter's.
and they're asking for you.

23
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.119
Hike!

24
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.829
What we have in our children
is an epidemic.

25
00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.746
And without antitoxin.
it's a death sentence to most.

26
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.174
if not all those infected.

27
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.165
The good news is.

28
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.756
they've located antitoxin
at the Fairbanks Railroad Hospital.

29
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.430
and they're ready
to put it on the next train to Nenana.

30
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.143
A round trip from here to Nenana
is still 600 miles.

31
00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:30.524
They have aeroplanes in Fairbanks.
and we could fly it here.

32
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.748
Did you see those clouds on the horizon
when you came over?

33
00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.402
Of course I did.
but maybe it's not as bad as it looks.

34
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.659
Seppala. you were out there.
What do you think?

35
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.993
It's going to be bad.

36
00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:45.913
How bad?

37
00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.004
Memorable. I think.

38
00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.998
What makes you think?

39
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.577
Well. it looks biblical enough.

40
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.797
and the barometer's falling
in a pretty disturbing way but...

41
00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.012
But what?

42
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.626
We came up on caribou this morning.

43
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.548
About 200 yards to our right. he saw them.

44
00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:08.767
My foot was ready on the brake.
and he ignored them and kept running.

45
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.524
That's when I knew this storm was special.

46
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.153
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

47
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.441
Togo's a caribou chaser of some renown.

48
00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.859
I still don't understand.

49
00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.374
Never in 12 years
had he not at least turned for them.

50
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:26.485
When an animal denies his nature

51
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.326
and runs for the barn
because he fears the storm...

52
00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.834
man better fear the storm.

53
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:34.673
I see.

54
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.801
In a storm like this.
how quickly could you get there and back?

55
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.299
Not "how quickly."

56
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.381
"if."

57
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.223
Then I say aeroplane.

58
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.847
Open cockpit aeroplane?

59
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.137
Water-cooled engines?
Did you call that airfield in Fairbanks?

60
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.555
They're making an assessment.

61
00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:52.733
I'll bet they are.

62
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.483
I seriously don't think
flying's an option.

63
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.818
But. in answer to your question.
"how quick?"

64
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.401
Seppala once ran for me.
all the way to Nenana. in four days.

65
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.992
For factual reference only.

66
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.794
Personally I never cared
for the notion that sled dogs

67
00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.618
should be replaced by machines.

68
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:14.076
but today I'm a champion of progress.

69
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.799
Come on. pup.

70
00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.107
Seppala. you going by the hospital?

71
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.124
Climb on.

72
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:53.871
Hike!

73
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.719
Whoa! Whoa!

74
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.601
Much obliged.

75
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.821
Good luck. doctor.

76
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:29.488
Towns are. uh.
usually founded by topography...

77
00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.037
proximity to roads and rivers.

78
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.250
Nome was founded by luck.

79
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.711
The gold at Anvil Creek?

80
00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.455
You could see it with your naked eye.

81
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.550
pick it up with your fingers
from the sand.

82
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.514
Gold dries up.

83
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.104
Luck dries up.

84
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.932
Where does he find the energy?

85
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.977
By his reckoning.
he's still ten weeks old.

86
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.573
So. you'll go?

87
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.871
I just got home.
You're anxious to be rid of me?

88
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.253
Hmm. Could be.

89
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.290
Have reason for me to be gone. do you?

90
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.825
- I have lovers.
- Ah?

91
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.168
Too many to count.

92
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.302
I have no one but myself to blame.

93
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:52.377
I was warned
not to marry someone so beautiful.

94
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.797
Warned by whom?

95
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.139
Everyone with eyesight.

96
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.229
So. you will go?

97
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.612
I have no such inclination.

98
00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.519
Then why are you waxing sled runners?

99
00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.488
They need wax.

100
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.880
Can it even be done in this weather?

101
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.462
Anything can be done.

102
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.625
Well. let them choose
someone else for once.

103
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.511
- The room was full of mushers.
- Right.

104
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.431
But it's always my husband they come for.

105
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.301
Pick someone with more at stake in this.

106
00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:45.187
I stopped at the hospital.
All those children. we know them.

107
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.024
I know.

108
00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:51.065
That little girl that lives next to Mallon
and always runs out to pet the dogs.

109
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.491
Sally. who pets everyone's dogs.
not just yours.

110
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.316
We know those children.
We know their parents.

111
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:02.197
I understand this.
And tomorrow I'll be ashamed.

112
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.327
But right now. I'm sorry. I'm afraid.

113
00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.048
It's not the first storm to hit Alaska.

114
00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.418
Don't patronize me.

115
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.014
You're right.

116
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.962
Don't take Togo. Fritz could lead.

117
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.131
I'll cross that bridge when and if.

118
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.800
He's 12 years old.
You said he's too old to go to Elwald.

119
00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.959
and that isn't even
a quarter of this distance.

120
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.798
You're upsetting yourself for nothing.

121
00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.012
Let's go to sleep.

122
00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.748
I must say this before you make a decision
you'll forever regret.

123
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.573
You're more attached to him than you know.
and you're about to run him to his death.

124
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.620
And you're not prepared for what
it's going to do to you. I promise you.

125
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.250
Is that all?

126
00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:30.165
He is. of course. your dog.
and a working dog.

127
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.250
And. were I more pragmatic.
I wouldn't love him. but I do.

128
00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:39.177
And I'm just so heartsick
that these are my last hours with him.

129
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.141
Two things.

130
00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:48.097
One: if I were to try for Nenana
in these conditions without him.

131
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.234
these would be your last hours with me.

132
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:56.532
And two: at this hour. nothing's decided.

133
00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:02.818
You were saying?

134
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.247
George?

135
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.674
Evening. George.

136
00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.961
It appears your forecast is correct.

137
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.300
if my journey out here is any evidence.

138
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.549
The wind almost stopped me dead
a couple times.

139
00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:29.347
Oh. I... I talked with Fairbanks.
There will be no airborne rescue of Nome.

140
00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:36.523
So. the time of the dog.
not only continues. it's at hand.

141
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:39.438
So. you felt the need to come
all the way out here to share this news?

142
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.357
Some things you need to say
to a man's face.

143
00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.816
isn't that right. Mr. Mayor?

144
00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.199
Yeah.

145
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.289
Coffee or whiskey?

146
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.211
Whiskey. If it's no trouble.

147
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:53.248
No. No trouble. I'm having both.

148
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.721
We have to be smart about this.

149
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.892
You're going to ride in the sled
when I tell you.

150
00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.518
No squirming. No arguments. for once.

151
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.910
Got one more in ya. pup?

152
00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.044
Almost there.

153
00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.539
Good dogs.

154
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:45.756
I've seen worse.

155
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:47.848
We could have a picnic.

156
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.860
I'll be back before you know it.

157
00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:58.859
I won't even make the bed.

158
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.581
Hey. Hey.

159
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.457
You bring him back to me. okay?

160
00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.712
And you come back to me.

161
00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:26.887
Good boy.

162
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.150
All right. Togo!

163
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:48.777
Hike!

164
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.406
Come on. Togo!

165
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.082
Come on. Togo!

166
00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.962
Come on! There you go.

167
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:40.708
Hike!

168
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:08.704
Here it comes.

169
00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.004
You tend to your business.
I'll tend to mine.

170
00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:08.205
How can it not be my business?
No dogs in the bedroom.

171
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.836
He's in such pain.

172
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.093
And in our bedroom.

173
00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:16.345
A runt has more imperfections
than just size. you know.

174
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.425
Nature has its ways of sorting things out.

175
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.017
Oh. should I just drown him
and speed up the process?

176
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:30.150
I'm just saying that Alaska
can be particularly cruel to the weak.

177
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.025
I don't need to be reminded.

178
00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.279
What does it cost you
to give this life a chance?

179
00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.829
What does he bring
to the breed if he survives?

180
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.400
The heart of a survivor.

181
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:51.628
You're too softhearted.

182
00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.799
You're too Norwegian.

183
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.446
Get!

184
00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.697
Why don't you put him back in the kennel?

185
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.405
Every time I do. he digs his way out.

186
00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:28.747
I'm spending more daylight filling holes
than doing the work I should be doing.

187
00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.917
I catch you. you'll be sorry.

188
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.551
It's all your fault.

189
00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.017
I thought you were supposed to be
a great trainer of dogs.

190
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.518
He's a devil.

191
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.600
Saint Francis of Assisi
would shoot this dog.

192
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:48.395
Hey!

193
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.901
- He's fast.
- He's mentally deficient.

194
00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:55.322
He's undersized.
unintelligent. untrainable.

195
00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.363
Yeah. but he's fast.

196
00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.567
I think you ought to give him
a chance on the sled.

197
00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.577
Stop. stop. That is not a sled dog.

198
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.790
Never ever.

199
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.540
Well. you won't know until you try.

200
00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.292
I won't know. period.

201
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.584
Victor Anderson wants one of my pups.

202
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.497
Well. I have the dog to give him.

203
00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.719
Every year we go through this.

204
00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.264
Not like this.

205
00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.517
How many times do I have to remind you?

206
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:28.139
They're not pets. They're not our friends.
They're not our children.

207
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.690
They're animals.

208
00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:31.942
Work animals.

209
00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.158
Serves you right.

210
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.179
Here you go.

211
00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.868
Here's your damn dog back!

212
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:25.469
Well. shame on you. Victor Anderson.
If you didn't want a dog. why bother us?

213
00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:27.433
He's more trouble than he's worth.

214
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.729
I think I'll go down now.

215
00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:36.483
I would.

216
00:22:58.753 --> 00:22:59.753
Hike up!

217
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.022
The easy part is over.

218
00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:36.035
Easy! Easy!

219
00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:57.852
Whoa. Whoa!

220
00:23:58.855 --> 00:23:59.855
Haw!

221
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:05.951
Whoa!

222
00:24:35.392 --> 00:24:39.272
Togo! Hike up! Hike up!

223
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.070
Togo! Togo! Hike up!
Hike up!

224
00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:02.499
Pull. Togo!

225
00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:03.835
Pull!

226
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:06.171
Pull up!

227
00:25:13.346 --> 00:25:14.346
Pull!

228
00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:17.141
Togo! Pull up!

229
00:25:26.693 --> 00:25:27.693
Yes!

230
00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:29.236
Yes!

231
00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:37.004
Good dog!

232
00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:44.629
Yes! Pull.

233
00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:56.428
Good dog!

234
00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:59.434
Next time I go the wrong way.
you tell me to go to hell.

235
00:26:00.894 --> 00:26:02.024
Good dog.

236
00:26:03.188 --> 00:26:04.648
Good dogs. all!

237
00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:13.072
We have to take care of this
at the roadhouse.

238
00:26:31.758 --> 00:26:32.838
Thank you.

239
00:26:54.364 --> 00:26:56.834
Her name. Atiqtalik.

240
00:26:56.908 --> 00:26:59.948
means "polar bear mother."

241
00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:03.674
Your dog is her cub now.

242
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:18.345
She can fix.

243
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.640
What does her song say?

244
00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:27.977
"Don't worry. young one...

245
00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:32.361
soon it'll be warm again."

246
00:27:38.908 --> 00:27:42.828
When I finish.
you'll start serving life in prison.

247
00:27:43.747 --> 00:27:45.867
All because I married a Belgian.

248
00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:49.094
Belgium is a soft country.

249
00:27:49.794 --> 00:27:52.964
Norway. on the other hand.
is a harsh country.

250
00:27:53.965 --> 00:27:57.335
In Brussels.
you'd sleep in a feathered bed

251
00:27:58.011 --> 00:27:59.931
and have salmon roe for breakfast.

252
00:28:00.764 --> 00:28:03.644
In Storfjord. your days would be numbered.

253
00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:08.976
Lesson number one: never marry a Belgian.

254
00:28:09.606 --> 00:28:11.316
They're sentimental.

255
00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:13.229
And you end up doing days of hard work

256
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:16.448
for a problem that a bullet
solves in seconds.

257
00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:22.704
Lesson number two: for you. Satan.
or whatever your name is...

258
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.750
try digging out now.

259
00:28:44.057 --> 00:28:45.137
Okay!

260
00:28:48.186 --> 00:28:50.686
Hike! Hike! Good job!

261
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:11.956
Hey! Stop that!

262
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:14.081
Hey!

263
00:31:14.165 --> 00:31:17.535
Hey. stop that! Hey!

264
00:31:17.627 --> 00:31:20.167
Whoa!

265
00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:22.757
No! No!

266
00:31:23.925 --> 00:31:24.925
You.

267
00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:32.773
Oh. no.

268
00:31:32.851 --> 00:31:35.101
Easy now. Leave it!

269
00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:36.226
Leave it!

270
00:31:37.105 --> 00:31:38.765
No! No!

271
00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:42.191
Leave it! No!

272
00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:47.319
On by!

273
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.660
Leave it!

274
00:31:57.917 --> 00:31:59.207
Leave it alone!

275
00:32:01.838 --> 00:32:02.838
No!

276
00:32:07.177 --> 00:32:08.597
Whoa!

277
00:32:12.557 --> 00:32:13.887
Haw! Haw!

278
00:32:44.381 --> 00:32:45.471
Go! Get!

279
00:32:48.426 --> 00:32:51.716
Since when did you start worrying about
keeping people out of the tack room?

280
00:32:51.805 --> 00:32:53.425
This isn't for keeping people out.

281
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.190
You're taking him out of the kennel
and putting him in here?

282
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.690
The kennel won't hold him.

283
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:03.361
- Apparently your dog...
- Not my dog.

284
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:06.111
Your dog. who disrupts my team.

285
00:33:06.194 --> 00:33:08.204
Your dog. who jumps on me

286
00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:10.779
no matter how many knees
I put to his chest.

287
00:33:10.865 --> 00:33:13.985
Your dog.
who violates the rules of the pack

288
00:33:14.077 --> 00:33:17.537
and upsets the hierarchy
I've worked years to establish.

289
00:33:18.373 --> 00:33:22.753
Your cur.
who rewards your kind nature with anarchy.

290
00:33:24.754 --> 00:33:26.134
This is for keeping him in.

291
00:33:31.511 --> 00:33:33.141
Was that a piece of our house?

292
00:34:08.131 --> 00:34:09.261
Hey!

293
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:10.381
Hike!

294
00:34:14.512 --> 00:34:15.512
Good dogs!

295
00:36:39.407 --> 00:36:40.867
Well. good afternoon.

296
00:36:52.337 --> 00:36:53.587
Good luck. little one.

297
00:36:58.593 --> 00:37:00.973
Hey! You again?

298
00:37:01.054 --> 00:37:02.974
Just leave it. Leave it!

299
00:37:03.848 --> 00:37:05.978
Stop! No!

300
00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:11.108
Stop! Let... You little devil.

301
00:37:13.024 --> 00:37:14.614
Hey! Stop that!

302
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.750
When you see Oki. say hello.

303
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:29.291
Not going to see Oki.

304
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:31.581
You're gonna cut across the Sound?

305
00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:32.918
It'll save me a day.

306
00:37:33.003 --> 00:37:34.173
It'll cost you your life.

307
00:37:34.254 --> 00:37:35.384
I've done it before.

308
00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:37.667
The ice is unpredictable now.

309
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:39.547
We'll make it. Listen to me.

310
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:44.141
stay away from contact with people
until I come back with the medicine.

311
00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:48.175
Who would be foolish enough
to come here in this weather?

312
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:38.690
All right. Togo.

313
00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:42.905
Hike!

314
00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:33.916
Good dog! On by!

315
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.640
What. my pups. are we to fear ice now?

316
00:39:50.557 --> 00:39:53.307
He which hath no stomach to this fight.

317
00:39:54.185 --> 00:39:57.475
Let him depart.
His passport shall be made.

318
00:39:57.564 --> 00:40:00.574
We will not die in that dog's company.

319
00:40:01.234 --> 00:40:06.454
Old dogs forget
but he will remember. with advantages.

320
00:40:06.531 --> 00:40:08.371
the feats he did that day.

321
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.580
Then shall our names familiar in his mouth
as household words.

322
00:40:14.664 --> 00:40:16.464
Seppala. the driver.

323
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:21.047
Fritz and Sally. Molly and Red and Togo.

324
00:40:21.421 --> 00:40:23.761
the great Togo in lead.

325
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.220
be all in their flowing water bowls
freshly remembered.

326
00:40:29.012 --> 00:40:34.562
And dogs in Nome. now abed. shall think
themselves accursed they were not here.

327
00:40:35.852 --> 00:40:42.532
We few. we happy few.
we band of champions.

328
00:40:43.568 --> 00:40:47.278
Now. run. my pups. Run!

329
00:41:18.895 --> 00:41:21.015
Max. get this out to the Associated Press.

330
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.230
People should know what's happening here.

331
00:41:24.901 --> 00:41:26.441
This is all you want to write?

332
00:41:28.029 --> 00:41:29.239
It's all I have in me.

333
00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:01.769
"Temperatures
of almost 60 degrees below zero

334
00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:04.475
and winds topping 50 miles an hour."

335
00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:06.816
"Man and dog risk all

336
00:42:07.318 --> 00:42:10.568
on a 640-mile round trip."

337
00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:12.216
With lives in the balance.

338
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.490
a heroic race runs through conditions
so terrible we can scarcely imagine.

339
00:42:15.577 --> 00:42:18.264
...The question on everyone's lips is not
"can they get there and back in time?"

340
00:42:18.288 --> 00:42:20.208
but "can they get there and back at all?"

341
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:39.931
Well done. pups. Well done!

342
00:43:06.836 --> 00:43:07.996
You're trail weary.

343
00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:10.167
I've been worse.

344
00:43:12.342 --> 00:43:13.802
So. to Nulato next?

345
00:43:14.344 --> 00:43:15.804
In an hour.

346
00:43:15.887 --> 00:43:17.677
Why? We bothering you?

347
00:43:18.264 --> 00:43:20.314
Only the white man bothers me.

348
00:43:21.685 --> 00:43:24.055
I only tolerate you
because I like your little dog.

349
00:43:24.604 --> 00:43:26.404
You like to bet on my little dog.

350
00:43:27.816 --> 00:43:30.856
There are advantages
to being at this roadhouse on race days.

351
00:43:32.112 --> 00:43:36.832
Most dogs. when they reach Shaktoolik.
have worry in their eyes.

352
00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:40.037
This one. never.

353
00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:42.245
This one wants to hurry up and win

354
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.920
so he can chase caribou
and fight polar bear.

355
00:43:47.252 --> 00:43:48.802
I tried to give him away. you know.

356
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.590
Twice.

357
00:44:21.536 --> 00:44:22.746
Whoa!

358
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:33.342
When I told my father
I was leaving for Alaska.

359
00:44:33.965 --> 00:44:36.045
he laughed at me.
He thought it was a joke.

360
00:44:36.801 --> 00:44:38.851
Only an idiot would be foolish enough

361
00:44:38.928 --> 00:44:42.468
to give up an apprenticeship in Norway
to be unemployed in America.

362
00:44:44.351 --> 00:44:47.811
When I said the word "gold."
he slapped me.

363
00:44:48.813 --> 00:44:52.153
And he promised me
that the only gold I would find in Alaska

364
00:44:52.233 --> 00:44:53.993
was what I'd brought in my own teeth.

365
00:44:56.029 --> 00:44:57.529
He was right.

366
00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:01.624
I've dug so many holes in this country.

367
00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:06.747
The law of averages would say that.
at least. I'd find some gold but...

368
00:45:08.875 --> 00:45:09.875
no.

369
00:45:13.254 --> 00:45:16.554
My business is dogs. not pets.
Working dogs.

370
00:45:16.633 --> 00:45:18.803
And hard decisions have to be made.

371
00:45:19.552 --> 00:45:21.892
If this is the hardest decision
we ever have to make.

372
00:45:21.971 --> 00:45:24.221
then you can consider us lucky.

373
00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:29.395
You see spirit and something lovable.

374
00:45:30.355 --> 00:45:34.605
All I see is trouble.
waste of time. and failure.

375
00:45:37.028 --> 00:45:38.028
Step up!

376
00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:51.745
Oh. he's just perfect.

377
00:45:51.835 --> 00:45:54.745
He's an escape artist. though.
as I told you before.

378
00:45:54.838 --> 00:45:58.588
Oh. Don't worry about that.
I want him to be an inside dog.

379
00:45:58.675 --> 00:45:59.965
Well. inside might not...

380
00:46:00.051 --> 00:46:02.101
Last winter I had wolves at the door.

381
00:46:02.178 --> 00:46:04.848
They would jump up at the window
and stare at me.

382
00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:09.268
Trust me. There were no wolves
where I was raised in Ireland.

383
00:46:09.352 --> 00:46:13.732
But with this lad by my side.
no wolf would dare enter.

384
00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:15.475
Unless he opens the door for them.

385
00:46:16.526 --> 00:46:17.736
I beg pardon?

386
00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:21.819
Uh. my wife was just reminding me that
we must be going.

387
00:46:21.906 --> 00:46:25.076
So. please. enjoy your puppy.

388
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.240
Thank you.

389
00:46:32.584 --> 00:46:36.634
It's okay. sweetheart.
This is your new home.

390
00:46:41.051 --> 00:46:42.091
He'll be fine.

391
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:03.569
Okay. hike!

392
00:47:11.081 --> 00:47:12.871
That's enough now. you daft mongrel.

393
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.745
You're no dog. you're the Devil himself.

394
00:47:16.586 --> 00:47:19.916
That's it. You go ahead and run.

395
00:47:20.006 --> 00:47:21.626
There's no way out.

396
00:47:22.842 --> 00:47:24.592
All the time in the world.

397
00:47:24.678 --> 00:47:27.758
You'll run till you're tired.
then we can start working on your manners.

398
00:47:28.848 --> 00:47:32.308
Oi! This isn't Little Creek anymore.
you little hooligan.

399
00:47:41.027 --> 00:47:42.947
Ah. that's better.

400
00:47:43.613 --> 00:47:45.033
There you are.

401
00:47:45.115 --> 00:47:46.445
Now. you be a good boy

402
00:47:47.117 --> 00:47:49.367
and I'll fix you a nice beef steak
for your lunch.

403
00:47:53.957 --> 00:47:55.497
Oh. no! No. No!

404
00:48:13.893 --> 00:48:15.603
Hike! Hike!

405
00:48:20.567 --> 00:48:21.567
Whoa!

406
00:48:55.352 --> 00:48:56.602
Whoa!

407
00:49:08.156 --> 00:49:09.156
Hey!

408
00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:13.202
Every predator for miles
smells that blood.

409
00:49:13.995 --> 00:49:15.285
I'm trying to save your life.

410
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:18.291
Okay. Russky. come with me.

411
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:21.750
Come on. up. Up.

412
00:49:24.339 --> 00:49:25.339
Good dog.

413
00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:29.757
Oh. no. Don't even think about it.

414
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:40.941
All right. Last row for you.

415
00:49:44.067 --> 00:49:50.447
Meet Ilsa. Try something with her
and I promise you. you'll regret it.

416
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:14.721
All right. hike!

417
00:50:50.008 --> 00:50:52.888
Well. you outran Ilsa.
Let's see how you do on point.

418
00:50:54.971 --> 00:50:55.971
Good.

419
00:50:57.682 --> 00:50:58.732
Come on.

420
00:51:02.062 --> 00:51:03.312
Good dog. Jens.

421
00:51:58.284 --> 00:51:59.374
Haw!

422
00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.800
Good pups.

423
00:52:47.959 --> 00:52:51.669
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

424
00:53:02.098 --> 00:53:05.058
Whoa!

425
00:53:05.143 --> 00:53:07.443
It's the most extraordinary thing
I've ever seen.

426
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.610
He's not a sled dog. he's a lead dog.

427
00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:12.479
You should have seen him.
He outran every single one of them.

428
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.860
- He's magnificent. A future champion.
- There's blood.

429
00:53:16.946 --> 00:53:20.906
You were right.
He's got the heart of a survivor.

430
00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:24.999
I'm going to name him Togo.

431
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:29.919
After the admiral.
An underdog named for an underdog.

432
00:53:31.211 --> 00:53:32.301
It's fitting.

433
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:47.561
Honey! Come here. please?

434
00:53:52.148 --> 00:53:54.438
Come. Step around him. he won't move.

435
00:53:54.526 --> 00:53:57.736
- I have things to do.
- Over here. Next to me.

436
00:53:58.697 --> 00:53:59.697
Please.

437
00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.920
Okay. now. call him.
Ask him to come into the bedroom.

438
00:54:11.793 --> 00:54:12.793
Do it.

439
00:54:14.087 --> 00:54:15.167
Togo. come.

440
00:54:15.797 --> 00:54:16.837
Again.

441
00:54:16.923 --> 00:54:20.013
- This isn't fair.
- Of course it is. Again. more demanding.

442
00:54:21.636 --> 00:54:24.506
Togo. you come in this room!

443
00:54:24.597 --> 00:54:26.977
My husband is trying to prove
a point of some kind.

444
00:54:28.143 --> 00:54:30.443
No dogs in the bedroom.

445
00:54:31.646 --> 00:54:33.816
Good boy. Togo. Good boy.

446
00:54:34.357 --> 00:54:36.647
Outstanding!

447
00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:38.736
Good dog.

448
00:54:39.446 --> 00:54:41.549
I don't care what the governor says.
he's wrong.

449
00:54:41.573 --> 00:54:44.083
Irrespective of how you feel. Jafet...

450
00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:45.579
Well. Mrs. Seppala.

451
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.660
Any musher would be lucky
to survive 30 miles in this weather.

452
00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:51.327
Seppala's the only one
who can survive a longer run!

453
00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:53.336
What's this nonsense about a relay?

454
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:56.550
Uh. now. Constance. this is a good thing.

455
00:54:56.629 --> 00:54:58.049
- Is this it?
- It is.

456
00:54:58.131 --> 00:55:00.341
Fourteen teams stationed
at these roadhouses

457
00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:02.215
between Nenana and Shaktoolik.

458
00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:04.392
Even as we speak.
they're running short legs

459
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:06.471
passing the serum
from one sled to the next.

460
00:55:06.556 --> 00:55:10.556
And on our end. two teams will go out
to these roadhouses and wait for Seppala.

461
00:55:11.895 --> 00:55:14.055
We'll need another sled
for the relay on our end.

462
00:55:14.147 --> 00:55:16.000
Is it possible you can
put together a team for us?

463
00:55:16.024 --> 00:55:17.034
Of course.

464
00:55:17.108 --> 00:55:18.544
Do you think your man. Gunnar.
would drive them?

465
00:55:18.568 --> 00:55:19.988
- Of course.
- Good.

466
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.610
The governor came up with this when?

467
00:55:21.696 --> 00:55:23.406
Twelve hours after Seppala departed.

468
00:55:24.657 --> 00:55:27.537
Leave it to a politician to change
the rules after the game's begun.

469
00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:29.999
No. This is a good thing.

470
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.540
Seppala won't have to go as far.

471
00:55:31.623 --> 00:55:34.173
- But he has no idea there's a relay.
- Exactly.

472
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:36.290
Just... Please.

473
00:55:38.046 --> 00:55:40.296
Now. by best estimate.

474
00:55:40.382 --> 00:55:44.142
the relay should be at the roadhouse
in Shaktoolik tomorrow.

475
00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:46.259
Now the governor's people
have worked this all out.

476
00:55:46.346 --> 00:55:49.516
And by all accounts. when Seppala arrives
at Shaktoolik tomorrow.

477
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:51.429
the serum will be there waiting for him.

478
00:55:51.518 --> 00:55:52.918
He's in Shaktoolik now.

479
00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.900
- Or past it.
- What? No. No. that's not possible.

480
00:55:56.981 --> 00:56:00.321
I know my husband. if there's ice
on Norton Sound. he's crossed it.

481
00:56:00.402 --> 00:56:02.702
In this storm?
Surely he's not going to try and cross...

482
00:56:02.779 --> 00:56:03.859
Of course he would.

483
00:56:04.656 --> 00:56:07.656
Going around the Sound
is 90 miles. crossing it is 20.

484
00:56:07.742 --> 00:56:08.992
He saves a day each way.

485
00:56:09.077 --> 00:56:12.537
George. if there's ice on the Sound.
he's crossed it.

486
00:56:13.373 --> 00:56:14.934
And if they don't meet at the roadhouse...

487
00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:18.208
Then they'll just hook up on the trail.

488
00:56:18.294 --> 00:56:21.214
There are 1.000 ways a driver
can miss another on the trail.

489
00:56:21.297 --> 00:56:23.217
A thousand ways in good weather.

490
00:56:24.092 --> 00:56:26.012
- You know this.
- I do.

491
00:56:26.094 --> 00:56:29.474
So. if my husband doesn't magically run
into your relay team.

492
00:56:29.556 --> 00:56:30.658
the one he is not even looking for.

493
00:56:30.682 --> 00:56:32.392
he and his dogs will drive on for Nenana.

494
00:56:32.475 --> 00:56:35.725
And your relay driver.
when he realizes he's missed them.

495
00:56:35.812 --> 00:56:37.232
he will set out on his own.

496
00:56:37.313 --> 00:56:38.673
But he wouldn't do that. would he?

497
00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:41.072
- Who is it? Who's the driver?
- Henry Ivanoff.

498
00:56:41.151 --> 00:56:43.031
Well. Henry is tough and brave.

499
00:56:43.111 --> 00:56:46.161
and he's not going to sit in front
of a warm fire while children die.

500
00:56:46.239 --> 00:56:47.659
I promise you that. He'll set out.

501
00:56:50.285 --> 00:56:51.405
Well. can he make it?

502
00:56:54.122 --> 00:56:55.962
I won't speculate on the life of a musher.

503
00:56:58.585 --> 00:56:59.585
Can he?

504
00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:04.048
My guess is
we don't find Henry until the spring.

505
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:08.600
Not him. not his dogs.
not the serum. until the thaw.

506
00:57:09.512 --> 00:57:10.512
But. uh...

507
00:57:10.597 --> 00:57:12.137
Four days ago. in this very room.

508
00:57:12.223 --> 00:57:15.563
we concluded only one man and one dog
could make that run.

509
00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:18.019
And nothing has changed but the weather.

510
00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:21.226
It's worse.

511
00:57:21.858 --> 00:57:24.438
All those children... lost.

512
00:57:29.449 --> 00:57:30.619
Pray they meet.

513
00:57:53.515 --> 00:57:55.055
Gee! Gee!

514
00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.560
Gee! Gee! Round.

515
00:58:10.824 --> 00:58:13.244
Hike! Gee! Gee!

516
00:58:22.669 --> 00:58:24.549
Leave it. Leave it!

517
00:58:25.171 --> 00:58:27.261
Haw! Haw!

518
00:58:30.176 --> 00:58:31.176
Leave it!

519
00:58:33.304 --> 00:58:34.314
Haw!

520
00:59:09.007 --> 00:59:10.007
No. no. no. no. no.

521
00:59:10.842 --> 00:59:12.052
Sepp. no!

522
00:59:12.802 --> 00:59:13.802
Don't!

523
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.220
Sepp! Sepp!

524
00:59:19.059 --> 00:59:20.309
I have the serum!

525
00:59:21.936 --> 00:59:24.686
No! I have the serum.

526
00:59:25.857 --> 00:59:26.857
Sepp!

527
00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:29.066
Sepp!

528
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.320
No!

529
01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:37.682
Bill Shannon took the first leg.
Ran through the night.

530
01:00:38.513 --> 01:00:39.973
Fifty below. easy.

531
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.734
He arrived in Tolovana
with his face black from frostbite.

532
01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:47.151
He passed on to Ed Kallands.

533
01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:50.981
They had to pour hot water on his hands
'cause they were frozen to the sled.

534
01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.199
Then went Tommy Patsy.

535
01:00:56.197 --> 01:00:57.317
Then Jackscrew.

536
01:00:58.199 --> 01:01:00.699
But none of us are as tough as you. Sepp.

537
01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.877
- Sepp?
- Yeah. what?

538
01:01:10.211 --> 01:01:11.211
You okay?

539
01:01:12.797 --> 01:01:15.427
Of course. Never better.

540
01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:22.024
What about him?

541
01:01:22.098 --> 01:01:23.138
What about him?

542
01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:26.269
Please take this the right way. okay?

543
01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:31.229
That. right there.
is the best dog I've ever known...

544
01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:35.236
but what I'm looking at is a spent animal.

545
01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:40.123
He is.
This storm just about broke all my pups.

546
01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:44.698
I wouldn't be a true friend
if I didn't speak my mind and...

547
01:01:50.043 --> 01:01:52.923
Leave him here. I'll take good care of him
till the weather breaks.

548
01:01:53.004 --> 01:01:54.094
He's my lead!

549
01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:58.757
Now do yourself a favor
and tend to your own.

550
01:02:04.474 --> 01:02:05.484
Sure. Sepp.

551
01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.106
I'm sorry.

552
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.780
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

553
01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:19.492
Yeah. don't give it a second thought.

554
01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:22.492
No. that was shameful of me.

555
01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:25.948
Especially since what you said
was out of kindness.

556
01:02:28.206 --> 01:02:29.456
Whatever happens tomorrow.

557
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.591
fortune or fault.
is mine and mine to reconcile.

558
01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:36.126
But I thank you. Henry.
for thinking of the dog.

559
01:02:38.508 --> 01:02:39.678
Not many do.

560
01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:48.144
"To sleep. to sleep.

561
01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:50.984
The long bright day is done.

562
01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.520
And darkness rises
from the fall of the sun.

563
01:02:56.067 --> 01:02:58.487
To sleep. to sleep.

564
01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:02.906
Whate'er thy joys.
they vanish with the day.

565
01:03:04.034 --> 01:03:08.204
Whate'er thy griefs.
in sleep they fade away.

566
01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:11.424
To sleep. to sleep.

567
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:16.548
Sleep mournful heart
and let the past be past.

568
01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:19.262
Sleep. happy soul.

569
01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:22.796
All life will sleep at last.

570
01:03:24.846 --> 01:03:25.846
To sleep.

571
01:03:27.515 --> 01:03:28.765
To sleep."

572
01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:34.649
Still time for me to place a bet?

573
01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:36.571
Thanks for your hospitality.

574
01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:37.939
Looks like I was wrong.

575
01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:41.696
You weren't wrong.
The die is cast. We'll make it.

576
01:03:52.415 --> 01:03:54.785
All right. Togo! Hike!

577
01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.047
He's going across the Sound again.

578
01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.585
Seppala. no!

579
01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:06.471
He knows what his dogs have left.

580
01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:10.019
For him. it's the Sound or nothing.

581
01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:49.388
Hike!

582
01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:05.237
Gee! Gee!

583
01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:19.339
Haw! Haw!

584
01:05:22.797 --> 01:05:24.167
Good puppies!

585
01:05:25.508 --> 01:05:26.678
Good dogs!

586
01:05:27.635 --> 01:05:29.505
Good dog! Go puppies!

587
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.180
Go!

588
01:05:32.515 --> 01:05:33.925
Hold up. Togo!

589
01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:37.563
Good dog.

590
01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:40.022
Run!

591
01:05:42.275 --> 01:05:43.275
Run!

592
01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:46.203
On straight.

593
01:05:49.074 --> 01:05:50.454
Run. puppies!

594
01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:04.513
- Come on! Come on!
- Go. go. go. go. go!

595
01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:12.636
Twenty more dollars on Leonhard Seppala.

596
01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:15.925
Twenty dollars on those itty-bitty dogs.

597
01:06:16.017 --> 01:06:17.887
Scotty Allan.
the greatest musher of all time.

598
01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:20.017
left the last roadhouse in the lead.

599
01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.225
Friend. this race is over.

600
01:06:35.662 --> 01:06:36.962
You see that?

601
01:06:37.038 --> 01:06:39.288
That's the best dog team
in the world. right there.

602
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.915
- Hike! Hike!
- They know who they are.

603
01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:45.013
time for us to find out who we are.

604
01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:50.635
Go! Come on. puppies!

605
01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:53.219
Haw! Haw!

606
01:06:53.304 --> 01:06:58.234
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!

607
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:59.729
Hike! Good dog!

608
01:07:07.235 --> 01:07:09.355
Come on. dogs! Come on. dogs!

609
01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:12.816
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

610
01:07:12.907 --> 01:07:17.947
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

611
01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:19.038
Hike. doggy!

612
01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:25.504
Whoo-hoo!

613
01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:28.966
Wait a minute.

614
01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:30.379
That's not Scotty.

615
01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:33.966
Who is that?

616
01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:38.814
That. my friends. is Leonhard Seppala
and his itty-bitty dogs.

617
01:07:38.892 --> 01:07:42.152
Whoo!

618
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:55.951
Whoa!

619
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.960
Congratulations. Sepp.

620
01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:10.507
Togo. Hi.

621
01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.934
Well done. You did it.

622
01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:15.762
Good boy.

623
01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:32.148
Did you ever think we'd have
such a thing on our wall?

624
01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:35.657
I never thought we'd have
$5.000 in prize money.

625
01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.700
Prize money you can't hang on a wall.

626
01:08:37.784 --> 01:08:40.754
Actually. you can if you have enough pins.

627
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:44.460
All thanks to this troublemaker.

628
01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:49.047
The only one
who never underestimated you. was you.

629
01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:52.339
And my genius wife.

630
01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.974
My beautiful. genius wife.

631
01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:26.457
Haw!

632
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.710
Haw!

633
01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.019
Hike up!

634
01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:25.516
Hike up!

635
01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:31.518
Up! Up! Up!

636
01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:01.301
Run!

637
01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:11.475
Hike up!

638
01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:40.882
Togo! Hike up! Go!

639
01:11:48.975 --> 01:11:49.975
Good dog!

640
01:11:51.519 --> 01:11:53.019
Good dog!

641
01:11:54.564 --> 01:11:55.944
Run puppies!

642
01:12:05.992 --> 01:12:06.992
We made it.

643
01:12:09.954 --> 01:12:11.414
We made it!

644
01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:16.586
Whoa! Whoa!

645
01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:12.643
No matter what happens. forgive me.

646
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:21.191
Hike up. Togo! Hike!

647
01:13:26.781 --> 01:13:28.621
Hike up! Hike up!

648
01:13:37.334 --> 01:13:38.544
Pull up. Togo!

649
01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:40.631
Pull!

650
01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:42.841
Pull!

651
01:13:43.256 --> 01:13:45.216
No. Fritz. Wait! Wait!

652
01:13:57.062 --> 01:13:58.062
Yes!

653
01:14:01.483 --> 01:14:02.573
Yes! Hike!

654
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:38.521
Good boy. Togo! Good dog.

655
01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:42.574
Good dogs. all!

656
01:14:49.155 --> 01:14:50.485
Get up there. puppies.

657
01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:01.381
You know. I can do that.

658
01:15:01.918 --> 01:15:04.048
I'll do it. Drink that.

659
01:15:27.485 --> 01:15:28.485
Why?

660
01:15:40.498 --> 01:15:42.328
The pine stings her eyes.

661
01:15:52.594 --> 01:15:54.354
Thank you for doing this. Gunnar.

662
01:15:54.387 --> 01:15:55.787
Anything I can do to help.

663
01:15:56.139 --> 01:15:58.309
My greatest worry is that
he'd be within miles and...

664
01:15:58.391 --> 01:16:00.231
No such thing is going to happen.

665
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:04.150
Sepp is the best musher I know.
Nothing will stop him from getting home.

666
01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:06.440
If you'll outfit the sled.
I'll start pulling dogs.

667
01:16:06.524 --> 01:16:08.194
No. no. Mrs. Seppala. I can do both.

668
01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:09.436
You should sleep.

669
01:16:09.527 --> 01:16:11.197
I've had my fill of time in the house.

670
01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:14.819
If it's all the same to you.
I'd prefer to fetch dogs.

671
01:16:14.908 --> 01:16:17.908
Sure. And who do you think
I should have in lead?

672
01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:21.414
Fox is the best dog left.
Paired with Balto.

673
01:16:22.415 --> 01:16:23.535
They won't win any races.

674
01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.785
but they'll plow through snow
and run home for dinner.

675
01:16:37.347 --> 01:16:38.347
Thank you.

676
01:16:47.148 --> 01:16:48.148
Hike up!

677
01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:50.569
Good dogs.

678
01:16:57.117 --> 01:16:59.327
Pass the word
there's chores waiting for him.

679
01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:01.203
Gladly.

680
01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:08.841
Fox. Balto. Hike!

681
01:17:25.478 --> 01:17:26.478
Come with me.

682
01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:28.305
I haven't the time.

683
01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.074
Come.

684
01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:31.440
I need to go.

685
01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:41.951
Last night I was worried about you.

686
01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:46.247
Thought you'd bit off
more than you could chew.

687
01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.206
Then I saw that.

688
01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:52.167
And asked myself...

689
01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:56.756
"Why should Amituk worry about any man...

690
01:17:58.136 --> 01:18:00.756
who cheats death like this?"

691
01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:19.445
Now. you're gonna ride in the sled.

692
01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.330
Even if it's just for 20 miles.

693
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:31.125
Come now. for once ride in the sled.

694
01:18:33.672 --> 01:18:34.672
Stay.

695
01:18:58.071 --> 01:18:59.071
Hike!

696
01:19:44.034 --> 01:19:45.044
Whoa!

697
01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:07.216
Togo! I'm sorry. I can't help you.

698
01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:09.016
I can't see.

699
01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:11.726
We need to get to the next roadhouse.

700
01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:14.437
Take us to Big Joe. I know you can.

701
01:20:16.024 --> 01:20:17.194
I know you can.

702
01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.238
Good dog. Good dog.

703
01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:22.738
Hike up!

704
01:21:46.322 --> 01:21:47.572
Oh. no.

705
01:21:58.835 --> 01:21:59.955
Togo?

706
01:22:05.175 --> 01:22:06.175
Togo?

707
01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:18.153
We can't stop. We must keep going.

708
01:22:18.855 --> 01:22:23.775
Do you understand? We stop. we die.

709
01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:29.989
Listen to me. if you stop. you die.

710
01:22:40.335 --> 01:22:41.745
- Seppala?
- Oh!

711
01:22:43.421 --> 01:22:45.301
- Seppala. is that you?
- Oh. God.

712
01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:47.092
Joe. we're here.

713
01:22:47.175 --> 01:22:48.465
Oh. God.

714
01:22:48.551 --> 01:22:50.391
The serum's in the sled.

715
01:22:54.974 --> 01:22:57.194
You go inside.
I'll get the dogs in the barn.

716
01:22:57.268 --> 01:22:58.808
Thank you. But not him.

717
01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.776
You're magnificent.

718
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:15.701
Magnificent. Magnificent.

719
01:23:16.746 --> 01:23:18.456
Seppala! Inside.

720
01:24:01.207 --> 01:24:02.917
Now. Leonhard. your race is over.

721
01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:04.922
Just have a drink with me.

722
01:24:11.843 --> 01:24:14.513
This one. this one here.

723
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.390
All those miles in this storm.
12 years old.

724
01:24:19.517 --> 01:24:21.307
That's just incredible.

725
01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:22.404
Wish me luck.

726
01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:56.139
Charlie. you made it.

727
01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.061
- Here.
- Is this the serum?

728
01:24:58.139 --> 01:24:59.929
- Warm this.
- Aye.

729
01:25:00.016 --> 01:25:01.726
- Good luck. Gunnar.
- Thanks.

730
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.650
My dogs. my dogs. they're... I need help.

731
01:25:52.068 --> 01:25:53.398
There is a sled coming to town.

732
01:26:04.205 --> 01:26:05.535
Here.

733
01:26:05.623 --> 01:26:06.713
Thank you.

734
01:26:13.465 --> 01:26:17.755
Sir. I need your name.
for the record. sir.

735
01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:19.635
Gunnar Kaasen.

736
01:26:20.263 --> 01:26:23.023
"Gunnar Kaasen." Excellent.

737
01:26:23.099 --> 01:26:26.189
Now. the lead dog. What's its name?

738
01:26:26.269 --> 01:26:27.899
One's called Fox.

739
01:26:27.979 --> 01:26:29.229
"Fox"?

740
01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:32.654
People will think it's a real fox.
The other one. what's its name?

741
01:26:33.401 --> 01:26:34.531
Balto.

742
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:37.111
"Balto." Yeah. Perfect.

743
01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:40.372
Hey! Get that dog's photo there.

744
01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:44.200
That's Balto. Champion savior of Nome.

745
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.220
You ought to stay another week. at least.

746
01:27:38.299 --> 01:27:39.469
Look at this.

747
01:27:39.551 --> 01:27:43.511
I know. I just wish
you would allow yourself more...

748
01:27:43.596 --> 01:27:45.556
You've been a fine host. Joe.

749
01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.890
You treated me and my dogs like family.

750
01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:49.016
Thank you.

751
01:27:54.566 --> 01:27:55.646
He up to it?

752
01:28:01.573 --> 01:28:02.573
We'll make it.

753
01:29:21.736 --> 01:29:23.026
There's a dog in our bedroom.

754
01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:24.860
Yes. there is.

755
01:29:26.991 --> 01:29:28.471
There's a dog on our bed.

756
01:29:29.369 --> 01:29:32.209
Yes. There is.

757
01:30:11.828 --> 01:30:12.908
You should've woke me.

758
01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:16.077
You had him to yourself long enough.

759
01:30:17.042 --> 01:30:18.882
Then again.
to hear the newspapers tell it.

760
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.880
you never left the house.
It was all Balto and Gunnar.

761
01:30:21.963 --> 01:30:23.053
We have company.

762
01:30:35.185 --> 01:30:37.805
If you like pears. these'll put
a smile on your face. I think.

763
01:30:37.896 --> 01:30:39.186
Thank you. Eileen. Come in.

764
01:30:40.315 --> 01:30:43.815
Ah. bacon.
It's the best I ever made right here.

765
01:30:43.902 --> 01:30:45.362
Thank you. Bill.

766
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:48.030
Hey. Sepp!

767
01:30:48.656 --> 01:30:49.866
Really. this is too much.

768
01:30:50.658 --> 01:30:52.038
Oh. it's not nearly enough.

769
01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:56.655
Good morning. Dan.

770
01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.753
Morning. Constance.

771
01:30:59.834 --> 01:31:00.884
Sepp.

772
01:31:01.503 --> 01:31:06.633
So. I had some furs laying around
and I stuffed them with straw.

773
01:31:06.716 --> 01:31:09.716
You know. something for between him
and the cold floor.

774
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:11.720
Hey. Togo.

775
01:31:11.805 --> 01:31:13.215
I made something for you.

776
01:31:15.558 --> 01:31:16.938
Well. go on. Give it a try.

777
01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:20.114
Go on.

778
01:31:32.242 --> 01:31:34.702
Thank you. Dan.
Have a seat. I'll bring you some coffee.

779
01:31:35.662 --> 01:31:38.672
Uh. no. No. I mean. I'd love to.

780
01:31:38.748 --> 01:31:42.668
but I have my own dogs to attend.

781
01:31:42.752 --> 01:31:44.632
so thank you.

782
01:31:47.257 --> 01:31:48.257
Sepp.

783
01:31:52.762 --> 01:31:53.762
Morning. Dan.

784
01:31:54.597 --> 01:31:56.427
- Knock-knock.
- Hello. Mayor. Come in.

785
01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.100
That all right. then?

786
01:32:00.186 --> 01:32:01.686
Sepp. thank you so much.

787
01:32:02.856 --> 01:32:04.976
We appreciate
everything you've done for us.

788
01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:07.253
Ever so grateful. Mr. Seppala.

789
01:32:07.277 --> 01:32:09.437
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

790
01:32:23.293 --> 01:32:24.673
No. it's too much.

791
01:32:38.058 --> 01:32:41.558
Hi. Sally. Hello. Dev.
Won't you please come in?

792
01:32:48.485 --> 01:32:50.105
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

793
01:32:55.658 --> 01:32:56.868
It's Togo.

794
01:32:57.285 --> 01:32:58.365
Thank you.

795
01:32:59.579 --> 01:33:02.079
Father carved it. but I painted it.

796
01:33:02.832 --> 01:33:05.592
Well. it's a brilliant likeness. Sally.
Thank you.

797
01:33:13.635 --> 01:33:15.005
He likes his ears.

798
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.140
Another man would be enjoying all this
but not a private man like yourself.

799
01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:22.476
Am I right?

800
01:33:22.894 --> 01:33:24.830
Do you think he stayed warm outside?

801
01:33:24.854 --> 01:33:27.774
I wouldn't have come myself
if not for her insistence.

802
01:33:27.857 --> 01:33:30.537
But she wanted to see him...

803
01:33:32.195 --> 01:33:36.825
and I want to be with her at every moment.

804
01:33:36.908 --> 01:33:37.968
Around the side.

805
01:33:37.992 --> 01:33:40.622
- Top?
- The top.

806
01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:44.624
It's strange. You know. I...
I see her and yet...

807
01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:49.052
I don't know how to describe it.
it's unworldly.

808
01:33:49.671 --> 01:33:50.761
Does that make sense?

809
01:33:52.173 --> 01:33:56.553
Kinda like every moment I'm with her
seems impossible yet...

810
01:33:58.054 --> 01:33:59.144
yet there she is.

811
01:34:05.311 --> 01:34:06.311
Mr. Seppala...

812
01:34:07.564 --> 01:34:08.984
is Togo going to die?

813
01:34:16.406 --> 01:34:18.196
Leonhard. Leonhard.

814
01:34:21.619 --> 01:34:24.659
Um. excuse me.
I have cake for you both so please stay.

815
01:34:24.748 --> 01:34:26.248
- Okay.
- Please.

816
01:34:28.793 --> 01:34:30.803
Leonhard. come back inside and apologize.

817
01:34:30.879 --> 01:34:32.209
They're guests in our home.

818
01:34:32.297 --> 01:34:34.167
Apologize for me.

819
01:34:34.257 --> 01:34:36.797
She meant no ill by it.
She's just a child.

820
01:34:36.885 --> 01:34:38.795
I know. She spoke the truth.

821
01:34:38.887 --> 01:34:40.927
No. don't say that. He's on the mend.

822
01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:43.984
It's not winter lameness.
He doesn't have a bad paw.

823
01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:46.849
You know. You've seen it before.

824
01:34:50.148 --> 01:34:51.648
Well. could another dog have lead?

825
01:34:51.733 --> 01:34:53.153
We'll never know.

826
01:34:53.234 --> 01:34:56.074
Well. I think you should consider a world
where Dev has no child

827
01:34:56.154 --> 01:34:57.494
and I have no husband.

828
01:34:57.572 --> 01:35:00.952
Everything you ever tried to warn me about
has come true.

829
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.250
I have run him to death.

830
01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:07.961
I have.

831
01:35:10.085 --> 01:35:12.085
And I'm not at all prepared.

832
01:36:32.167 --> 01:36:33.287
Be safe.

833
01:36:59.778 --> 01:37:00.898
I have to go.

834
01:37:02.655 --> 01:37:03.865
I have to go to work.

835
01:37:06.326 --> 01:37:07.406
Forgive me.

836
01:37:26.054 --> 01:37:28.644
Togo. Togo! Hey. Come.

837
01:37:42.153 --> 01:37:43.993
Togo! Hey! Come.

838
01:37:44.072 --> 01:37:46.372
Come now.
Togo. come now. Come.

839
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.910
Togo! Come. Calm down.

840
01:37:51.287 --> 01:37:52.287
Hike up!

841
01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.460
Quiet!

842
01:38:12.308 --> 01:38:15.148
Okay. Hike!

843
01:38:41.338 --> 01:38:42.628
Togo. you want some bacon?

844
01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:46.681
Good boy. Tog...

845
01:38:48.553 --> 01:38:51.063
No! No. no. no. no.
No! Togo! Hey!

846
01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:52.769
Hey! Togo!

847
01:38:55.435 --> 01:38:57.265
Togo! Togo. come!

848
01:39:19.626 --> 01:39:20.786
Togo!

849
01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:24.051
Togo!

850
01:39:35.892 --> 01:39:36.892
Togo!

851
01:39:46.069 --> 01:39:47.359
Whoa!

852
01:40:41.082 --> 01:40:44.042
It was foolish of me
to think Togo would ever be denied.

853
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:49.129
I always thought he lived for the sled.

854
01:40:50.133 --> 01:40:54.893
When all along. what he lived for was me.

855
01:41:00.769 --> 01:41:02.769
We resumed the trail.

856
01:41:02.854 --> 01:41:05.694
We discovered a walk was as good as a run.

857
01:41:11.196 --> 01:41:14.236
As always. Constance was right.

858
01:41:14.991 --> 01:41:17.451
Togo had the heart of a survivor.

859
01:41:18.578 --> 01:41:21.038
Not the storm of the century.

860
01:41:21.122 --> 01:41:23.582
nor a harrowing serum run could stop him.

861
01:41:26.878 --> 01:41:29.508
He lived out his golden years
with a new job...

862
01:41:31.132 --> 01:41:32.432
father.

863
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.850
For two years he sired pups.

864
01:41:45.522 --> 01:41:48.442
While the lower 48 celebrated Balto.

865
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:53.660
mushers from all over the world
elbowed to get one of Togo's line.

866
01:41:54.781 --> 01:41:56.871
Kennels from Fairbanks to Maine

867
01:41:56.950 --> 01:42:00.160
bred what came to be known
as Seppala Siberians.

868
01:42:01.287 --> 01:42:05.287
A breed valued for their intelligence.
stamina. courage.

869
01:42:05.375 --> 01:42:10.205
but most of all. their good nature
and uncommon bond with humans.

870
01:42:19.764 --> 01:42:22.274
He left us on a Thursday in December.

871
01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:31.230
Constance and I continued
working with dogs

872
01:42:31.317 --> 01:42:34.237
because if you're around them
long enough...

873
01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320
Whoa!

874
01:42:35.405 --> 01:42:36.985
...they tend to get under your skin.

875
01:42:38.908 --> 01:42:41.748
And if you're lucky enough
to have known a great one.

876
01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.120
they never really leave.

877
01:42:45.749 --> 01:42:48.629
They stay with you as long as you live.

878
01:42:50.003 --> 01:42:51.763
Harnessed to your heart.

879
01:42:51.838 --> 01:42:53.548
giving their all...

880
01:42:59.888 --> 01:43:00.888
Hike!

881
01:43:04.017 --> 01:43:05.267
Always.
