1
00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:12.489
All right. here he comes.

2
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:14.491
Now. this is the one you want.

3
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.468
He'll make a fine specimen.

4
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:44.155
Nice shooting.

5
00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:50.100
Now. let's get this thing on the truck
and get it over with.

6
00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.569
We almost finished here?

7
00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:02.081
You don't want to spend
too much time in one place.

8
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.080
Once one croc spots you. they all come.

9
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.613
This place is infested.

10
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.281
Shut up. old man.

11
00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:11.548
These animals are gonna
make us all very rich.

12
00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:13.685
So just be patient.

13
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.089
We're beginning the procedure now.
gentlemen.

14
00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.329
As long as we're getting on with it.

15
00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:25.328
I'll take my money.

16
00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:27.664
That wasn't the deal. Long John Silver.

17
00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:32.902
The deal was that
I get you and your people in here.

18
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.204
I did that.

19
00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:38.514
The deal was you get us in and out.

20
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.311
All right.

21
00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:49.619
This is only half the numbers.

22
00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.288
Yeah. Mama didn't raise no fool.

23
00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:55.062
You'll get the other half
when I get my money.

24
00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.731
All right. it's just
a little stick. sweetie.

25
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:05.068
Why are you talking
to an anesthetized croc?

26
00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:06.374
It's an old habit.

27
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.340
From my hospital days.

28
00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:13.309
I don't understand why we can't just
take this stuff back to the lab?

29
00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.545
And why does that snake have to be here?

30
00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:19.183
What we're doing here is very precise.

31
00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.253
Yikes!

32
00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:24.988
Once we've altered the structure.

33
00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.258
the manipulated DNA
becomes very fragile.

34
00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:33.363
So. an immediate implantation
into an egg-producing female

35
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.166
will give us the best chance
for success.

36
00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.834
She's ready to lay her eggs.

37
00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.743
They just need to get fertilized.

38
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.139
Now. these two smaller male snakes

39
00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.341
will provide the catalyst
for the procedure.

40
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:48.811
Fine. So the snakes will mate.
Get on with it.

41
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.687
Can I at least see the money?

42
00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:01.401
Excuse me. Watch the hook. man.

43
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:06.665
Aren't you gonna count it?

44
00:04:07.897 --> 00:04:09.766
I trust that it's all there.

45
00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.439
I'd thumb through it. but no thumb.

46
00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:18.274
It's an awful lot of cash
just to get you to open a gate.

47
00:04:18.374 --> 00:04:20.743
And to keep my mouth shut.

48
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:24.180
You see. without the proper motivation.

49
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.350
I might just be tempted to call
Fish and Wildlife.

50
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.421
Bet they'd be real interested
in exactly what you want

51
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.468
with those protected crocodiles.

52
00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:43.467
You give Ms. Murdoch my regards.

53
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.203
And boys.
you all be careful with these crocs.

54
00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:49.405
Take my word for it.

55
00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.610
First bite's always the worst.

56
00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:54.679
- Jim. we ain't done here yet.
- Firearms.

57
00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:58.681
And you still owe me
the last three numbers.

58
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.227
- Okay.
- Pardon me. Crossing. Watch the gun.

59
00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:04.795
No problemo.

60
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.068
I'm injecting her
with the mutated cells now.

61
00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:23.973
Finito.

62
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.714
What now?

63
00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:29.818
Now? Now we wait
for the new cells to take.

64
00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:33.082
This female snake
is genetically engineered

65
00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:37.520
which means that all of her
biological process has been accelerated.

66
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.389
She'll grow faster. molt faster.

67
00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:42.458
Lay eggs faster. Got it. How long?

68
00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:46.195
She should lay her eggs
in the next 24 to 48 hours.

69
00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.765
Dear God.

70
00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:51.668
Great. Wake me up
when it's time to go home.

71
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.036
We'll get her back to the lab

72
00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:56.174
and everything else will be done
in an incubator. Okay?

73
00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:02.914
Our friend here is awake.

74
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.149
That's not possible.
I gave that thing enough tranquilizer

75
00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.217
to knock out an elephant for 12 hours.

76
00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:09.762
You know this isn't an elephant. right?

77
00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:13.990
It's getting loose.

78
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.398
It's getting loose!

79
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.400
The snakes!

80
00:07:25.127 --> 00:07:26.128
Shit!

81
00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:04.500
Shit.

82
00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:12.270
Hey. Tully.

83
00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:15.771
New sunglasses? Nice.

84
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:17.942
You know I can see the deer. right?

85
00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.157
Deer just jumped out
in front of my truck.

86
00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:29.788
What about the one in the back there?

87
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.763
I forgot. There was two of them.

88
00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:36.359
You sure that's the story
you want to stick to?

89
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.497
It's the God's honest truth this time.

90
00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:42.139
Isn't that a bullet hole?

91
00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.405
Looks like about a .308 there.
wouldn't you say?

92
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:50.473
A .308?

93
00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:53.209
I don't know anything about ballistics.

94
00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:54.481
Ballistics?

95
00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:58.481
That's a real big word for you. Earl.
I'm impressed.

96
00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:02.720
Don't worry.
I know it wasn't you that shot him.

97
00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:06.355
Earl Junior!

98
00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:09.058
Why don't you come out
from behind that bush over there?

99
00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:12.162
Let's have a little chat before I have
to cart your old man off to jail.

100
00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:17.706
He's just a kid. Tully.
You're scaring him half to death.

101
00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:21.581
Poaching is poaching. Earl.

102
00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.512
You know the deal.

103
00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:25.747
the fine or the time.

104
00:10:26.242 --> 00:10:27.585
The fine.

105
00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.422
Have a nice day.

106
00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:35.123
That ain't no way to treat a citizen!

107
00:10:36.686 --> 00:10:38.359
First beer's on me later.

108
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.155
Have you seen her?
Have you seen my baby?

109
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:15.124
Daphne! Daphne!
Have you seen her? She's missing.

110
00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:16.567
- My baby.
- Get away from me. lady.

111
00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:20.240
- No.
- Sheriff! Sheriff. stop!

112
00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:24.400
Have you found her?
Have you found my baby?

113
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.203
We're pretty sure that
she's with Jared. Mrs. Mailer.

114
00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:29.538
No. Sheriff. what if she's not with him?

115
00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:33.542
I told her to stay away
from that piece of trash.

116
00:11:33.642 --> 00:11:36.623
I'd cut that sucker's balls off
myself if I...

117
00:11:38.748 --> 00:11:41.083
If I could do it legally. that is.

118
00:11:41.183 --> 00:11:43.552
She's really a good girl. Sheriff.

119
00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:47.930
Yes. yes. I know. She's been an absolute doll
since she got out of jail this time.

120
00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:52.128
But. Sheriff. it's been two days.

121
00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:55.798
I'm not stupid. I watch reality TV.

122
00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:57.700
After the first 48 hours.

123
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.303
it's practically a cold case.

124
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.774
Okay. Well. we're doing
our best to locate her

125
00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:07.810
and I promise I'll be in touch
as soon as I hear something. okay?

126
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.978
Thank you. Ms. Mailer.

127
00:12:09.078 --> 00:12:11.854
- You have a good day.
- Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey!

128
00:12:12.414 --> 00:12:13.415
Stop!

129
00:12:18.053 --> 00:12:19.293
Sheriff.

130
00:12:19.922 --> 00:12:21.323
Mr. Mayor.

131
00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:22.858
What was that all about?

132
00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.232
Her daughter went missing.

133
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.661
Last seen?

134
00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:27.763
Hiking outside the fence at Black Lake.

135
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.900
- Outside the fence?
- Yes. sir.

136
00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:33.406
Is this something that
I should be worried about?

137
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.939
Because if it is.
I'll have to call in a prescription.

138
00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:39.442
The daughter is a grown woman. sir.

139
00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:41.577
We think that she took off
with the boyfriend.

140
00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:45.682
The mother's not too fond of him.
But. we are considering other possibilities.

141
00:12:46.615 --> 00:12:47.750
Good.

142
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.387
I gave you this job because
you know the town. its people.

143
00:12:51.487 --> 00:12:54.156
and to make sure that
the crocodiles at Black Lake

144
00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:56.125
don't cause any problems.

145
00:12:56.225 --> 00:13:00.329
You gave me this job. sir.
because nobody else wanted it.

146
00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:01.831
I sent Ferguson down to take a look.

147
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:03.766
Ferguson?

148
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:06.268
I have complete faith in your abilities.

149
00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:08.507
I'm behind you all the way.

150
00:13:09.104 --> 00:13:12.608
But if you screw up. I'll throw you
under the bus in a heartbeat.

151
00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:15.511
- Steve. how are you? Nice to see you.
- Mr. Mayor.

152
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:16.712
Thanks for the building permit.

153
00:13:16.812 --> 00:13:19.793
Remember. it's an election year.

154
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:23.488
Ice cream! The mayor has coupons
for free ice cream!

155
00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:26.393
- Coupons for free ice cream. everyone!
- What the...

156
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.666
Sheriff. can you hear me?

157
00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:37.678
Yeah. Ferguson. where are you?

158
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:39.769
Is that you?

159
00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:43.773
Yeah. Go ahead. Ferguson.
before I kick your ass.

160
00:13:43.873 --> 00:13:44.940
Yeah. roger that.

161
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.344
We are combing the perimeter fence
just like you instructed.

162
00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:49.612
Find anything?

163
00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:50.884
Yeah. Yes. ma'am.

164
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.748
Is it Daphne Mailer?

165
00:13:52.848 --> 00:13:54.054
No. ma'am.

166
00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:57.395
You need to see this for yourself.

167
00:13:58.821 --> 00:14:00.689
Okay. since we're playing this game.

168
00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:02.758
secure the scene. I'm on my way.

169
00:14:02.858 --> 00:14:04.201
Roger that.

170
00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:07.969
Secure the scene!

171
00:14:36.158 --> 00:14:38.001
I can't believe she would
use this picture of me.

172
00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:41.900
Yo. Daphne! Open the door.

173
00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:44.403
Wait. I got the key.

174
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.504
- Where the hell have you been?
- Hey!

175
00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:50.105
You scared the hell out of me.

176
00:14:50.205 --> 00:14:51.582
Look at this.

177
00:14:52.174 --> 00:14:53.275
Cool.

178
00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:55.311
Look at the picture! I look like a pig!

179
00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:57.446
My mom picked the worst photo
she could find of me.

180
00:14:57.546 --> 00:14:59.348
Boo-boo. you look good.

181
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:00.583
Good and fat.

182
00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:02.959
No. you look good. real good.

183
00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:05.487
You look hot.

184
00:15:05.587 --> 00:15:07.623
you look sexy.

185
00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:09.358
Girl. you look smart.

186
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:12.837
Wait. you really think I'm smart?

187
00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.805
Yeah. you got a GED.

188
00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:19.368
You know. there's something
I really like

189
00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:23.245
about a guy that appreciates me
for my mind and not just my body.

190
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.175
Okay.

191
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.509
Baby.

192
00:15:29.979 --> 00:15:30.980
What?

193
00:15:32.114 --> 00:15:33.320
Okay.

194
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.990
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

195
00:15:38.787 --> 00:15:40.698
- Baby. you said you like it rough.
- Yeah.

196
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:44.198
Sorta. Okay.

197
00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:45.862
Baby!

198
00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:51.977
Okay. Just a little less.

199
00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:53.769
Yeah.

200
00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:05.285
- Where have you been?
- I've been walking all night.

201
00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.616
- What do you mean?
- They got out.

202
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:08.817
What do you mean. "They got out"?

203
00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.586
They're loose.

204
00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:13.667
- Get to my office immediately.
- Roger that.

205
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.292
Whose fault is that?

206
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.928
I ain't taking the fall
for what went on out there.

207
00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:21.997
I'm not asking you
to take the fall. Mr. Beach.

208
00:16:22.097 --> 00:16:23.866
But you will help me get them back.

209
00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:25.167
Wait. I'm gonna what?

210
00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:29.271
Those snakes are a very rare.
very endangered species.

211
00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:31.607
They are monsters. is what they are.

212
00:16:31.707 --> 00:16:37.157
Yes. Well. they also represent
billions of dollars to this company.

213
00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.716
Have you ever heard of the Blood Orchid?

214
00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:42.318
Can't say I have.

215
00:16:42.718 --> 00:16:43.953
It's a tropical species.

216
00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:45.327
Very rare.

217
00:16:45.954 --> 00:16:49.291
My father discovered
that the orchid extract.

218
00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:53.862
when mixed with the particular secretions
of a molting giant anaconda

219
00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:57.433
created a compound
capable of regenerating cells.

220
00:16:57.533 --> 00:16:59.468
Cell regeneration?

221
00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:03.105
I'm talking about biological immortality.
Mr. Beach.

222
00:17:03.205 --> 00:17:06.812
Imagine what people would be
willing to pay to live forever.

223
00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:09.445
Anything.

224
00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:11.013
But there was a problem.

225
00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.983
A protein bond triggers
cell regeneration in reptiles.

226
00:17:14.083 --> 00:17:17.319
Unfortunately. it doesn't work
the same way in humans.

227
00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:19.126
So. how does it work?

228
00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:22.535
It becomes lethally toxic.

229
00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:25.594
Do I still have your attention?

230
00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:27.731
Absolutely.

231
00:17:28.097 --> 00:17:31.100
Before he died.
my father found a solution

232
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.502
but it required creating a hybrid.

233
00:17:33.602 --> 00:17:36.939
And with that
you get your fountain of youth?

234
00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:40.843
Unfortunately.
the only compatible reptile on Earth

235
00:17:40.943 --> 00:17:43.746
is as rare as the orchid itself.

236
00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:45.147
A species of crocodile.

237
00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:48.017
Enormous. aggressive.

238
00:17:48.117 --> 00:17:50.853
And they can only be found
one place on Earth.

239
00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:53.822
Yeah. I know. I fought with one.

240
00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:57.292
Gather your men. Mr. Beach.
We're going back there.

241
00:17:57.392 --> 00:17:59.995
We're gonna find that snake
before she lays her eggs

242
00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:03.167
or someone or something
gets to her first.

243
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.704
I need those baby crocacondas alive.

244
00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:10.205
You're listening to Monster Rock on Q95.

245
00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:11.648
You're listening to Monster Rock on Q95.

246
00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:27.756
There's no way you got 2.200
on your SATs.

247
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.769
I did. I swear. I'm. like. a genius.

248
00:18:31.627 --> 00:18:33.732
No. Actually. you're like. terrifying.

249
00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:35.898
- It's so wrong.
- Whatever.

250
00:18:35.998 --> 00:18:38.367
I only got. like. 1.900.

251
00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:41.539
And somehow they still let you
into vocational school.

252
00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.448
What about you?
What'd you get on your SATs?

253
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.312
Right around 2.350.

254
00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:51.847
- What?
- What? You're full of it.

255
00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:54.450
Hey. hey. hey. Don't hate.

256
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.154
Yeah.

257
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.969
Goody. it's Tiff!

258
00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:10.732
Hey. big sister.

259
00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:13.904
Put me on speaker.
Everybody needs to hear this.

260
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.738
Okay. bitches.

261
00:19:16.838 --> 00:19:19.942
it's time to put down your phones
and that copy of Girl Mag

262
00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:21.248
and listen the hell up.

263
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:24.379
My phone.

264
00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:26.686
The bitch can't talk right now.

265
00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:30.324
Are you slow?

266
00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:31.920
Slow?

267
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.591
No. no. I'm seriously asking
if you're stupid.

268
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.159
Like. mentally challenged?

269
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:40.429
Because I need to know
what I'm dealing with.

270
00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:44.399
I mean. seriously.
what the hell do you think this is?

271
00:19:44.499 --> 00:19:47.402
What I see in front of me
are a bunch of stupid little girls

272
00:19:47.502 --> 00:19:51.306
who think they have what it takes
to become Delta Phi Beta sisters.

273
00:19:51.406 --> 00:19:54.042
And I can tell you right now. they...

274
00:19:54.142 --> 00:19:56.545
- Are wrong!
- Are wrong!

275
00:19:56.645 --> 00:19:59.148
You are some sorry-ass losers.

276
00:20:00.382 --> 00:20:01.950
If you want to get in.

277
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.259
you're gonna have to prove yourselves.

278
00:20:20.002 --> 00:20:22.642
I thought I had lost you.
my little friend.

279
00:20:25.841 --> 00:20:27.643
Are you calling your boyfriend?

280
00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:29.811
What's his name? Maybe I know him.

281
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:33.382
Since when did you ever need to know
a guy's name before you do him?

282
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.052
Whatever.

283
00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:43.158
This is Tully.

284
00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:44.326
Hey. Dad.

285
00:20:44.426 --> 00:20:47.162
Hey. sweetie. how are you doing?

286
00:20:47.262 --> 00:20:48.935
What ya doing?

287
00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:55.104
I just stopped by the house real quick
to try and grab a quick snack.

288
00:20:56.305 --> 00:20:57.613
You miss me yet?

289
00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:00.676
Of course I miss you. honey.
I mean. you're off at college

290
00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:03.620
and then I'm here all alone.

291
00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:07.182
I think they call it
empty nest syndrome.

292
00:21:07.282 --> 00:21:09.351
Shut up. you probably
already turned my room

293
00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:11.556
into a man cave or something.

294
00:21:12.954 --> 00:21:16.024
Yes. indeed.
I just hung a flat screen up in there.

295
00:21:16.124 --> 00:21:17.226
Got it all cleaned up.

296
00:21:17.326 --> 00:21:20.362
Put a La-Z-Boy in there.
I got a little mini fridge.

297
00:21:20.462 --> 00:21:24.672
I am set for football season.
You have no idea.

298
00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:29.671
That sounds great. All you need now
is a dog to lay by your feet.

299
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.341
I would love that.

300
00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:35.244
So. what's up. babe?

301
00:21:35.777 --> 00:21:38.714
Just keeping to our agreement.
Checking in.

302
00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:40.415
Thought I'd let you know
that I'm going to

303
00:21:40.515 --> 00:21:43.018
rush weekend with the sorority girls.

304
00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:46.121
Right. I completely forgot about that.

305
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.556
Where you guys going?

306
00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:49.567
We're going up to Clear Lake.

307
00:21:50.292 --> 00:21:51.965
You don't have to worry.

308
00:21:52.794 --> 00:21:54.796
Just do me a favor and just let me know

309
00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:56.598
when you're heading
back to the dorms. okay?

310
00:21:56.698 --> 00:21:58.033
Okay.

311
00:21:58.133 --> 00:21:59.835
All right. I love you.

312
00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:01.303
I love you. too.

313
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.746
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

314
00:22:59.227 --> 00:23:00.529
I'm hungry.

315
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:02.973
I'm gonna go back to the truck
and get a snack.

316
00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:07.174
Hey. Bring me some Cheez Doodles.

317
00:23:07.869 --> 00:23:09.371
Okay. Dad.

318
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:55.525
Anything but crocodiles.
Please let it be anything but crocodiles.

319
00:24:20.575 --> 00:24:22.611
What the hell is going on here?

320
00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:24.446
Well.

321
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:27.425
yeah. the forensics
are still going over it.

322
00:24:28.517 --> 00:24:29.825
But it could be arson.

323
00:24:29.951 --> 00:24:31.319
Arson?

324
00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:33.456
Does this look like arson
to you. Ferguson?

325
00:24:35.924 --> 00:24:37.826
Maybe not.

326
00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:41.029
Find any bodies? Daphne Mailer. maybe?

327
00:24:41.129 --> 00:24:42.898
Well. we have one...

328
00:24:42.998 --> 00:24:45.467
- Ferguson. just a little personal space here.
- Sorry.

329
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:48.970
We have one partial set
of human remains.

330
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.207
What isn't still attached
is probably inside the...

331
00:24:52.307 --> 00:24:53.542
- You know...
- The crocodile?

332
00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:56.384
You can say it. Ferguson.
just not too loudly.

333
00:24:57.746 --> 00:24:59.481
Well. while we're here.
we might as well be sure.

334
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.349
Cut him open.

335
00:25:01.449 --> 00:25:03.852
I'm not really good with.
with sharp things.

336
00:25:03.952 --> 00:25:05.754
But I can get you a set of gloves.

337
00:25:05.854 --> 00:25:08.061
No. no. that's okay.

338
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.961
My hands have been in
some pretty nasty places.

339
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.233
Okay. bag those up. Get me some DNA.

340
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.177
I want to make sure that
they don't match our missing person.

341
00:25:55.937 --> 00:25:57.007
Yes. ma'am.

342
00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:07.649
Hello. everyone.

343
00:26:07.749 --> 00:26:09.417
- Hey. Mayor.
- Nice to see you. Bob.

344
00:26:09.517 --> 00:26:10.852
- How's the game going?
- Good. sir.

345
00:26:10.952 --> 00:26:11.987
Working on the handicap?

346
00:26:12.087 --> 00:26:13.157
- You got it.
- Good boy.

347
00:26:14.222 --> 00:26:15.790
What the hell is going on here?

348
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.692
I heard the call on the scanner
in my office.

349
00:26:17.792 --> 00:26:19.465
Okay. I have it under control.

350
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:24.699
You call that under control?

351
00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:26.608
I don't call this under control.

352
00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:29.671
And you're gonna call Fish and Wildlife

353
00:26:29.771 --> 00:26:32.908
before anybody gets
what's going on around here.

354
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:36.144
I don't have to tell you that
November's just around the corner

355
00:26:36.244 --> 00:26:38.053
and my ass is on the line.

356
00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:39.685
Just take care of it.

357
00:26:40.615 --> 00:26:43.718
All right. everybody.
the mayor is leaving. See you later!

358
00:26:43.818 --> 00:26:45.854
- Bob. take care. Remember. Sunday picnic.
- Yep.

359
00:26:45.954 --> 00:26:47.289
- Bring the kids.
- You have a good day. too.

360
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:49.995
- I'll be there. sir.
- Keep up the good work. everyone.

361
00:27:08.943 --> 00:27:10.149
All right.

362
00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:16.192
Sweetie. two times in one day?

363
00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:20.365
I do have unlimited minutes.
Sweetie? Do I know you?

364
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.593
I am really sorry.

365
00:27:24.693 --> 00:27:27.696
You know what?
I thought you were my daughter.

366
00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:30.675
Could be. My mom dated a lot of guys.

367
00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:32.300
What?

368
00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:34.669
This is the Aroostook County sheriff.

369
00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:37.113
Am I speaking with
Will Tull. Fish and Wildlife?

370
00:27:37.372 --> 00:27:40.508
Yes. this is Will Tull.
My friends call me Tully.

371
00:27:40.608 --> 00:27:44.279
Well. Tully. I'm Reba
and I don't have any friends.

372
00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:46.181
so you can call me Reba.

373
00:27:46.281 --> 00:27:48.583
Yes. I'm familiar with who you are.

374
00:27:48.683 --> 00:27:50.822
I think I'll stick with Sheriff for now.

375
00:27:52.554 --> 00:27:54.534
How much do you know about crocodiles?

376
00:28:42.837 --> 00:28:44.639
- Did you get another tattoo?
- I totally did.

377
00:28:44.739 --> 00:28:45.974
- Let me see.
- I had to.

378
00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:47.142
- Oh. my gosh.
- It's just small.

379
00:28:47.242 --> 00:28:50.086
- I didn't want anything really big.
- This is really good.

380
00:28:53.248 --> 00:28:56.251
What do you think this is? A vacation?

381
00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:58.262
You are all useless.

382
00:28:58.853 --> 00:29:00.989
All right. bitches. on the line!

383
00:29:01.089 --> 00:29:02.659
Get on the line right now!

384
00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:12.300
That's better.

385
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.270
I happen to know
that none of my DPB sisters

386
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.539
or brothers at Kappa Tau Pi

387
00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:20.375
are gonna want anything to do
with any of you

388
00:29:20.475 --> 00:29:22.614
if you all suck.

389
00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:25.714
And right now. you do.

390
00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:29.050
That's it. you're out.
You didn't make it. Come on. Leave!

391
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.286
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
You can get back in line.

392
00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:32.797
Get back in line!

393
00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:35.758
Now get in the water.

394
00:29:36.758 --> 00:29:39.360
I don't think any guy minds if we suck.

395
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.202
if you get my politically
incorrect innuendo.

396
00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:45.839
What are you all waiting for?

397
00:29:47.001 --> 00:29:49.345
Are you afraid of the crocodiles?

398
00:29:51.172 --> 00:29:53.942
I cannot believe
you are all this stupid.

399
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.350
This is Clear Lake.

400
00:29:55.944 --> 00:29:58.913
There are no crocodiles in Clear Lake.

401
00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:01.994
The crocodiles are in Black Lake.

402
00:30:02.183 --> 00:30:05.289
Now get in the water!

403
00:30:06.588 --> 00:30:07.989
Go on.

404
00:30:08.089 --> 00:30:10.262
Get your asses in there!

405
00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:13.762
Where do you think you're going?

406
00:30:13.862 --> 00:30:15.997
- But you said to...
- And what was your name again?

407
00:30:16.097 --> 00:30:17.065
Jane.

408
00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:18.166
Jane?

409
00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:20.869
As in plain Jane?

410
00:30:20.969 --> 00:30:23.108
As in Goldsburg.

411
00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:27.780
You have 20 minutes to dig a hole
big enough to bury your sorry ass in.

412
00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:37.754
Are you both deaf?

413
00:30:38.553 --> 00:30:42.558
Or maybe you really don't have
what it takes to become a Delta Phi Beta.

414
00:30:44.058 --> 00:30:47.062
I've got my eye on both of you.

415
00:30:49.364 --> 00:30:54.335
Is that even possible.
to have one singular eye on both of us?

416
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:55.709
I don't think so.

417
00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:01.948
It's gonna be fine.

418
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.748
It's so cold.

419
00:31:05.046 --> 00:31:07.492
Move it. You don't want to piss her off.

420
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:10.652
Let's go. guys. Go.

421
00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:12.987
It's a beach. bitches!

422
00:31:13.087 --> 00:31:17.035
Walk until you can't touch the bottom
and tread water until I say stop.

423
00:31:19.093 --> 00:31:20.094
Go!

424
00:31:20.194 --> 00:31:22.765
Looks like Megan's already halfway
to becoming a sister.

425
00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:32.685
That's it. Keep swimming.

426
00:31:58.533 --> 00:32:01.912
Let's hear it for Brett and Andrew
from Kappa Tau Pi!

427
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.671
Go. guys!

428
00:32:03.771 --> 00:32:06.274
Great performance. guys!

429
00:32:06.374 --> 00:32:08.610
Oh. my God. Are you okay?

430
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.744
That was crazy.

431
00:32:09.844 --> 00:32:11.619
Bro. that was awesome!

432
00:32:12.814 --> 00:32:15.016
I'm sure the girls will show you
their appreciation later.

433
00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:16.651
if you get my meaning.

434
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:18.151
All right!

435
00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:31.139
I'll give you 10 seconds
to move your vehicle.

436
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.869
I'm here meeting the sheriff.

437
00:32:34.969 --> 00:32:37.405
It's your lucky day. You found her.

438
00:32:37.505 --> 00:32:40.541
I know. I'm Will Tull.
Fish and Wildlife.

439
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:42.677
Tull! Just the man
we've been waiting for.

440
00:32:42.777 --> 00:32:44.415
You still got to move your vehicle.

441
00:32:49.751 --> 00:32:50.786
Oh. boy.

442
00:32:54.355 --> 00:32:55.527
Here we go.

443
00:32:56.157 --> 00:32:58.026
So. you have an ID yet?

444
00:32:58.126 --> 00:33:01.198
No ID. but I can tell you the legs
do belong to the rest of him.

445
00:33:01.362 --> 00:33:03.197
How can you be sure?

446
00:33:03.297 --> 00:33:06.369
You'll have to forgive me.
This is the only time I have to eat my lunch.

447
00:33:07.969 --> 00:33:09.073
Wing Ding?

448
00:33:10.705 --> 00:33:12.340
Thanks. but no.

449
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.942
You can tell by the break.

450
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:16.844
Clearly the legs were torn off
with tremendous force

451
00:33:16.944 --> 00:33:18.252
coming down on the femurs.

452
00:33:18.846 --> 00:33:21.383
But here. you can see how they match.

453
00:33:22.817 --> 00:33:23.785
Yeah.

454
00:33:23.885 --> 00:33:25.853
And you're absolutely certain
that he's a he?

455
00:33:25.953 --> 00:33:26.921
No question.

456
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:28.957
Well. how long before
you can give me a name?

457
00:33:29.057 --> 00:33:30.593
I got no usable prints.

458
00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:34.733
Possibility of dental records.
but that could take weeks. even longer.

459
00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:36.608
- All right. thanks.
- Yeah.

460
00:33:56.084 --> 00:33:57.222
Sorry.

461
00:33:57.952 --> 00:33:58.953
Thanks.

462
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.625
Did they find what was left
of the lab unit?

463
00:34:04.725 --> 00:34:07.061
Even if they have. there's no way
they can connect it to us.

464
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:08.162
I made sure.

465
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.810
You better hope so for all our sakes.

466
00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:13.043
Eyes front.

467
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:15.069
So. what's the plan?

468
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:16.604
What a bitch.

469
00:34:16.704 --> 00:34:19.874
A couple of days ago I had our tech guys
block their tracking device

470
00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:21.743
so only ours will work.

471
00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:23.911
So we're the only ones
that can track these things?

472
00:34:24.011 --> 00:34:25.580
Bingo.

473
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.449
We'll use this to find the female
and bring her back to the lab.

474
00:34:28.549 --> 00:34:29.751
And if we can't?

475
00:34:29.851 --> 00:34:31.888
This is a portable incubator.

476
00:34:33.121 --> 00:34:35.857
If we can't bring her back to the lab.
we'll take her eggs.

477
00:34:35.957 --> 00:34:39.694
Whatever happens.
we can't have her lay them in the wild.

478
00:34:39.794 --> 00:34:41.501
Those eggs are the key to the serum.

479
00:34:42.096 --> 00:34:44.133
And what if she does lay them
in the wild?

480
00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:46.506
I don't want to know.

481
00:34:48.102 --> 00:34:50.805
I guess we're gonna
need Bickerman again.

482
00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:52.940
No one knows the land like him.

483
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.943
Well. he does have a bag
full of my money.

484
00:34:56.043 --> 00:34:58.580
I think it's about time
Captain Hook earned it.

485
00:35:04.552 --> 00:35:07.465
The good news is
it's not our missing person.

486
00:35:07.822 --> 00:35:10.425
The bad news is that
our missing person is still missing.

487
00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:13.472
Finding a dead guy inside of a croc
isn't bad news enough?

488
00:35:13.961 --> 00:35:15.596
Spend a little time with us. Mr. Tull.

489
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:18.466
and you'll find that it's just another day
at the office around here.

490
00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:19.867
What'd you got on the tractor trailer?

491
00:35:19.967 --> 00:35:23.504
Unfortunately. not much.
The license plates melted in the fire.

492
00:35:23.604 --> 00:35:25.173
Can't even get a readable VIN number.

493
00:35:25.273 --> 00:35:27.208
The guys at the garage
are taking it apart

494
00:35:27.308 --> 00:35:29.720
to see if they can get
some serial numbers off the engine.

495
00:35:30.244 --> 00:35:31.746
Might be able to trace it from there.

496
00:35:31.846 --> 00:35:33.147
All right. Well. keep on it.

497
00:35:33.247 --> 00:35:36.984
Yes sir. ma'am.
I mean. Sheriff. Sheriff.

498
00:35:37.084 --> 00:35:39.086
Mr. Tull. what do you need from us
to get started?

499
00:35:39.754 --> 00:35:41.989
Well. first things first.

500
00:35:42.089 --> 00:35:44.296
Probably best to go ahead
and show me what you've got.

501
00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:43.084
Boo!

502
00:36:43.184 --> 00:36:45.486
Oh. my God. you scared me.

503
00:36:45.586 --> 00:36:48.289
Well. with your ear buds in
and your eyes closed.

504
00:36:48.389 --> 00:36:51.131
Sasquatch and his whole family
could sneak up on you.

505
00:36:52.226 --> 00:36:55.429
Here. it's the only thing
I could find to actually drink.

506
00:36:55.529 --> 00:36:56.797
Thanks.

507
00:36:56.897 --> 00:36:59.571
Unless you want to join
the vomit patrol over there?

508
00:37:05.773 --> 00:37:07.150
I'm okay.

509
00:37:09.777 --> 00:37:11.120
Okay. let's do it.

510
00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:14.815
Neanderthals.

511
00:37:17.051 --> 00:37:19.053
I'm surprised they don't
drag them off by their hair.

512
00:37:21.889 --> 00:37:24.870
Why are you here?
You don't seem like the type.

513
00:37:25.593 --> 00:37:28.733
What. can't you tell
that I live to be a Delta?

514
00:37:28.896 --> 00:37:30.498
Paint each other's toenails.

515
00:37:30.598 --> 00:37:32.633
call each other sisters and BFFs?

516
00:37:32.733 --> 00:37:34.135
Compare each other's boob jobs?

517
00:37:34.235 --> 00:37:35.670
- Stop.
- Get a daring

518
00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.139
butterfly tattoo on our ankles.

519
00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:39.874
- Okay. stop.
- Pierce our unmentionables.

520
00:37:39.974 --> 00:37:41.976
Seriously. stop.

521
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:45.521
Really. why are you here?

522
00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:49.920
Truth is I'm a psych major.

523
00:37:50.918 --> 00:37:54.923
And I mean. what is more psycho
then wanting to join a sorority?

524
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.828
Great resource material.

525
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:03.604
I'm bored! Make them swim.

526
00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:07.045
Get in the water.

527
00:38:10.137 --> 00:38:11.772
Come on. Go. Go.

528
00:38:11.872 --> 00:38:14.041
Get in. bitches.

529
00:38:14.141 --> 00:38:16.644
News flash. you stupid bitches!

530
00:38:16.744 --> 00:38:19.647
Frats don't like boring
sorority sisters.

531
00:38:19.747 --> 00:38:21.522
Now. get in the water!

532
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.518
What about you. girlfriend?

533
00:38:24.618 --> 00:38:26.354
What's your excuse?

534
00:38:26.454 --> 00:38:30.424
I'm a legacy. My mom was a Delta.

535
00:38:30.524 --> 00:38:32.927
So. what. she. like.
forced you into it or something?

536
00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:34.472
No.

537
00:38:35.062 --> 00:38:36.735
She died when I was little.

538
00:38:37.264 --> 00:38:39.600
It was just me and my dad.

539
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.705
So I thought that becoming a Delta
would be something to remember her by.

540
00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:46.841
That's sweet.

541
00:38:46.941 --> 00:38:49.353
I mean. I want to throw up.

542
00:38:50.678 --> 00:38:52.713
But it's sweet. Seriously.

543
00:38:52.813 --> 00:38:55.082
Don't think I don't see you two
sitting over here snickering

544
00:38:55.182 --> 00:38:56.784
or laughing or whatever.

545
00:38:56.884 --> 00:38:59.364
You do know that those words
mean the same thing. right?

546
00:38:59.954 --> 00:39:02.757
What I do know is that
you are two of the sorriest pledges

547
00:39:02.857 --> 00:39:04.725
I have ever seen in my life.

548
00:39:04.825 --> 00:39:07.228
And if you want a hope in hell
of getting into this sorority.

549
00:39:07.328 --> 00:39:09.330
you better get it together.

550
00:39:12.733 --> 00:39:16.476
Well. let's take one
for Mom and my studies.

551
00:39:26.814 --> 00:39:28.149
This is a mess.

552
00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:30.818
- This happened last night?
- Right about then.

553
00:39:30.918 --> 00:39:33.754
We don't get many eyewitnesses out here
in the middle of the night.

554
00:39:33.854 --> 00:39:34.889
which. I'm sure. was the point.

555
00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:38.392
I'm not gonna candy coat this
for you. Sheriff.

556
00:39:38.492 --> 00:39:39.994
If this fence was down for even an hour.

557
00:39:40.094 --> 00:39:42.663
it's entirely possible that
some of the crocs escaped.

558
00:39:42.763 --> 00:39:46.000
I mean. there's a chance
we can track some of them. but...

559
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.511
Then what are we waiting for?

560
00:39:50.938 --> 00:39:55.076
Well. I mean. you obviously
know a lot about breeding.

561
00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:56.519
Excuse me?

562
00:39:57.144 --> 00:39:58.312
That came out wrong.

563
00:39:58.412 --> 00:40:00.790
Let me clarify that.

564
00:40:01.615 --> 00:40:03.150
Aroostook Station Wildlife.

565
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.120
Hey. Sheryl. it's Tully.
I'm out here at Black Lake.

566
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.122
just trying to take my foot
out of my mouth.

567
00:40:08.222 --> 00:40:09.223
You do that a lot. Tully.

568
00:40:09.323 --> 00:40:11.425
If you could do me a solid
and get Falmouth on the line

569
00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:14.128
and have them send over
all the transponder numbers

570
00:40:14.228 --> 00:40:17.365
for the crocs they tagged
out here on their last survey.

571
00:40:17.465 --> 00:40:18.833
that would be great.

572
00:40:18.933 --> 00:40:21.102
And if you could make it snappy.
I would be very happy.

573
00:40:21.202 --> 00:40:23.771
We could have a very serious situation
on our hands here.

574
00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:25.942
- I don't know. I'll pass it on.
- Okay.

575
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.409
- Yep. Thanks.
- Tully. what about that raise I...

576
00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:30.546
Okay. bye. bye. Bye. Bye.

577
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.148
What I was saying earlier is that

578
00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:36.117
any crocs that were born
after they were tagged

579
00:40:36.217 --> 00:40:37.651
aren't gonna have any transponders.

580
00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:39.120
So we're gonna have to hunt
the old-fashioned way.

581
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.187
And if we're gonna do that.

582
00:40:40.287 --> 00:40:42.893
it's gonna take a lot more than
that peashooter to stop 'em.

583
00:40:43.457 --> 00:40:44.992
Don't you worry about me.

584
00:40:45.092 --> 00:40:47.928
If there's one thing I'm good at.
it's stopping crocodiles.

585
00:40:48.028 --> 00:40:49.530
So I've heard.

586
00:40:50.464 --> 00:40:51.565
All right.

587
00:40:51.665 --> 00:40:55.909
Here's a list of all the transponders
that they tagged the crocs with.

588
00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:57.338
Looks like a lot.

589
00:40:57.438 --> 00:41:00.841
Yeah. but this is not right.

590
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:03.387
This is last week's readout. Hold on.

591
00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:05.713
What the hell?

592
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:09.517
The whole system went down.

593
00:41:09.617 --> 00:41:10.618
Is that normal?

594
00:41:10.985 --> 00:41:14.355
Well. it's never gone down on me before.
so to speak.

595
00:41:14.455 --> 00:41:16.490
There's a first time
for everything. I guess.

596
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.193
- That's kind of convenient timing.
- Not really.

597
00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:23.364
Well. I mean. a bizarre accident
blows a hole in our security gate

598
00:41:23.464 --> 00:41:25.967
around the same time
the tracking system goes down.

599
00:41:27.535 --> 00:41:30.277
We don't even know
how many crocs have escaped. if any.

600
00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:32.706
True. true.
We don't know how many escaped.

601
00:41:32.806 --> 00:41:34.909
but we do know where they're going.

602
00:41:35.009 --> 00:41:37.578
Check this out. Pull up this map.

603
00:41:37.678 --> 00:41:39.513
All right. This is us.

604
00:41:39.613 --> 00:41:40.915
And here's Black Lake.

605
00:41:41.015 --> 00:41:42.850
Now I'm willing to bet
they've probably consumed

606
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.119
most of the lake's resources. so.

607
00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:47.922
the crocs are gonna be headed
toward the nearest source of ready food.

608
00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:51.592
which is right there.

609
00:41:51.692 --> 00:41:52.693
Clear Lake.

610
00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:09.777
Hey!

611
00:42:24.491 --> 00:42:26.360
Where do you want us to start?

612
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.461
Start in there.

613
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:29.463
That's where we found him
the first time.

614
00:42:29.563 --> 00:42:31.665
If we're lucky.
he'll be drinking his way through

615
00:42:31.765 --> 00:42:33.767
that money we gave him.

616
00:42:34.068 --> 00:42:35.604
You two wait out here.

617
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:38.806
Try to blend in with the locals.

618
00:42:38.906 --> 00:42:40.613
I'll go around the back.

619
00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:45.116
What's up?

620
00:42:45.946 --> 00:42:47.152
What's up?

621
00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:56.866
Come on. Beth. answer the phone. please.

622
00:42:57.725 --> 00:42:58.893
Look. just try to relax.

623
00:42:58.993 --> 00:43:02.029
You know. she's probably out
having some fun with friends.

624
00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:03.998
Besides. we don't even know
if the crocs did escape

625
00:43:04.098 --> 00:43:05.766
or even if they made it to Clear Lake.

626
00:43:05.866 --> 00:43:08.969
Look. I'm not gonna be able to relax
until I know my daughter is safe.

627
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:11.605
So. I'm gonna go look for her.

628
00:43:11.705 --> 00:43:13.309
We're working here. Tull.

629
00:43:14.642 --> 00:43:18.279
Once that fence is fixed. your lake is safe.
I can't say the same thing about my daughter.

630
00:43:18.379 --> 00:43:20.985
So. I'm gonna go try and find her.
you can come or not.

631
00:43:22.082 --> 00:43:23.220
I'm coming!

632
00:43:57.685 --> 00:43:59.323
I was never here.

633
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.593
You got it. boss.

634
00:44:15.869 --> 00:44:18.440
- Hey. buddy. what can I get you?
- I'm looking for Jim Bickerman.

635
00:44:19.406 --> 00:44:22.546
Jim. Jim. Jim. Jim. Jim who?

636
00:44:27.281 --> 00:44:29.416
I'm still having a hard time
with that last name.

637
00:44:29.516 --> 00:44:30.790
Bickersteen?

638
00:44:34.188 --> 00:44:35.923
Bickerman. Jimmy Bickerman.

639
00:44:36.023 --> 00:44:37.400
Why didn't you say so?

640
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.067
Haven't seen him.

641
00:44:50.137 --> 00:44:51.405
Hi. Jim.

642
00:44:51.505 --> 00:44:53.674
Happy hour start a little early today?

643
00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:57.085
Don't hassle me. Ms. Murdoch.
I'm a cripple.

644
00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.889
Physically challenged
is the preferred term now.

645
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.964
I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

646
00:45:09.923 --> 00:45:13.166
Come on. Jim.
We still have business to discuss.

647
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:16.202
Let me help you up.

648
00:45:19.399 --> 00:45:20.668
Did you see that?

649
00:45:20.768 --> 00:45:22.635
I think I got me a lawsuit here.

650
00:45:31.044 --> 00:45:33.786
- He's actually kind of cute.
- Yeah.

651
00:45:35.082 --> 00:45:36.083
You ready?

652
00:45:37.184 --> 00:45:39.130
- Born ready.
- Yeah.

653
00:45:41.955 --> 00:45:45.426
Ladies. Andrew is gonna
give Hannah here...

654
00:45:45.526 --> 00:45:47.261
- Heather.
- Close enough.

655
00:45:47.361 --> 00:45:48.999
A show to remember.

656
00:45:51.765 --> 00:45:53.167
Damn. it's cold.

657
00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:55.213
- I'm gonna go up front.
- Yeah.

658
00:45:59.773 --> 00:46:03.448
Baby. you know tops are
optional on my boat.

659
00:46:04.945 --> 00:46:06.686
Does that line really work?

660
00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:10.791
Well. I am the captain.

661
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:17.695
You handle the throttle.

662
00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:18.928
Hit it!

663
00:46:37.778 --> 00:46:39.348
Yeah. baby.

664
00:46:45.118 --> 00:46:46.563
Let's go over there.

665
00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:56.132
What? I'm serious. You're so much hotter
than the other girls.

666
00:47:00.033 --> 00:47:01.774
How about a little suck face?

667
00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:06.840
Stop.

668
00:47:08.609 --> 00:47:10.043
Stop! Stop the boat!

669
00:47:10.143 --> 00:47:11.554
Why? What's wrong?

670
00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:14.456
He's gone. He's gone!

671
00:47:17.885 --> 00:47:21.321
Something attacked him.
I think a giant alligator or something!

672
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:23.724
Yeah. yeah. he's probably joking around.

673
00:47:23.824 --> 00:47:25.667
- I'll circle back and pick him up.
- I'm sorry.

674
00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:42.346
I'm allergic to water.

675
00:47:52.386 --> 00:47:53.888
He'll be okay. all right?

676
00:47:56.823 --> 00:47:57.927
I don't know.

677
00:48:02.362 --> 00:48:03.534
What the...

678
00:48:05.198 --> 00:48:06.677
Very funny. Andrew!

679
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:09.247
That was a $200 rope.

680
00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:11.805
Maybe we should get back to the beach.

681
00:48:12.172 --> 00:48:14.675
I can't leave Andrew
in the middle of the lake.

682
00:48:14.775 --> 00:48:16.311
joke or no joke.

683
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.596
Not again. Cut it out.

684
00:48:35.696 --> 00:48:38.232
That's not funny.
We've seen this before.

685
00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:39.538
Andrew?

686
00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:55.918
I did not give them permission
to get out of the water!

687
00:49:12.265 --> 00:49:13.869
Oh. my God. they're gone!

688
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.206
Melissa!

689
00:49:15.702 --> 00:49:18.205
Oh. my God! Help me!

690
00:49:19.272 --> 00:49:21.013
Go. go!

691
00:49:25.345 --> 00:49:27.757
- Oh. my God!
- Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

692
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.454
Go. go!

693
00:49:31.718 --> 00:49:34.221
- Help me!
- No. Heather. no!

694
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:35.764
Melissa. help me!

695
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:43.737
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!
What do we do? Tiffani!

696
00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:45.342
I don't think we can outrun them!

697
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:47.567
- God!
- Wait! I have an idea!

698
00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:48.668
What?

699
00:49:50.103 --> 00:49:51.207
Help me!

700
00:49:52.706 --> 00:49:54.117
No!

701
00:49:58.278 --> 00:50:00.881
Need I tell you that you're going
just a tad over the speed limit?

702
00:50:00.981 --> 00:50:03.183
- Write me a ticket.
- Don't tempt me.

703
00:50:03.283 --> 00:50:05.024
Ferguson. you out there?

704
00:50:05.619 --> 00:50:06.859
Come in.

705
00:50:07.654 --> 00:50:09.463
Ferguson. come in.

706
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.960
- Excuse me. bro. Official police business.
- Ferguson.

707
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.195
- Just. just one minute. Thanks.
- Okay.

708
00:50:15.295 --> 00:50:17.775
This is Ferguson. Who's this?

709
00:50:19.466 --> 00:50:21.335
It's your mother. Ferguson.

710
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:24.541
I need you to get out to the Clear
Lake Marina and get everybody out.

711
00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:26.173
The lake is officially closed.

712
00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:29.409
Blame it on red algae
or brain-eating amoebas.

713
00:50:29.509 --> 00:50:31.445
I don't really care.
Just don't let anybody

714
00:50:31.545 --> 00:50:33.752
hear you say the word "Crocodile."

715
00:50:34.014 --> 00:50:36.083
We don't need to start a panic.
Am I clear?

716
00:50:36.183 --> 00:50:37.560
Roger that. Sheriff.

717
00:50:37.717 --> 00:50:39.697
Ix-nay on the ocodile-cray.

718
00:50:45.258 --> 00:50:46.464
Where's my...

719
00:50:47.894 --> 00:50:49.032
Okay.

720
00:50:50.997 --> 00:50:53.238
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

721
00:50:54.668 --> 00:50:56.011
Get in the car.

722
00:50:57.237 --> 00:50:59.973
- Where's Amber?
- I tried to save her. but she didn't make it.

723
00:51:00.073 --> 00:51:01.245
What? Oh. my God!

724
00:51:09.216 --> 00:51:10.984
Wait. You can't come in this car.

725
00:51:11.084 --> 00:51:13.064
- Why?
- I don't like your bikini.

726
00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:20.300
That's it. We're leaving.

727
00:51:21.094 --> 00:51:24.268
God. can you believe it?
I left the keys on the beach.

728
00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:28.141
You mind going back and getting them.
big sister?

729
00:51:28.702 --> 00:51:29.874
What? Are you nuts?

730
00:51:34.908 --> 00:51:37.320
Come on. come on. get out of here!

731
00:51:37.978 --> 00:51:39.286
Why aren't they leaving?

732
00:51:39.646 --> 00:51:41.182
Go! Go away!

733
00:51:41.815 --> 00:51:43.954
Yeah. that'll work.
Just tell them to leave.

734
00:51:55.729 --> 00:51:57.097
I'm getting out of here!

735
00:51:57.197 --> 00:51:59.108
No! Cassie. no!

736
00:52:03.236 --> 00:52:04.579
No!

737
00:52:11.778 --> 00:52:12.916
She's not gonna make it.

738
00:52:13.046 --> 00:52:14.047
Better her than me.

739
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:16.421
- We got to help her.
- I volunteer...

740
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.787
- Her.
- Why her?

741
00:52:19.019 --> 00:52:20.862
It's not like she's gonna get in anyway.

742
00:52:22.022 --> 00:52:24.593
Do you try to be a bitch
or does it just come naturally?

743
00:52:24.824 --> 00:52:26.633
Our only hope is Tiff's car.

744
00:52:27.294 --> 00:52:29.274
Okay? We go on three!

745
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:33.534
One. two. three!

746
00:52:38.905 --> 00:52:39.906
No!

747
00:52:41.508 --> 00:52:43.749
I got you! I got you.

748
00:52:44.211 --> 00:52:45.519
I got you.

749
00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.458
We got to distract them.

750
00:52:54.754 --> 00:52:56.665
- Who's got something we can use?
- Like what?

751
00:52:57.057 --> 00:52:59.867
I need a can of hair spray.
Something flammable.

752
00:53:02.662 --> 00:53:03.730
How about spray tanner?

753
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.931
Somebody must have left it there.

754
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:07.170
That'll work. Who's got a lighter?

755
00:53:10.203 --> 00:53:11.682
Guilty as charged.

756
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:16.881
Help! Help!

757
00:53:17.544 --> 00:53:19.279
They're gonna... They're gonna...

758
00:53:19.379 --> 00:53:20.947
No. they're not. It's okay.

759
00:53:21.047 --> 00:53:23.721
When I say the word.
just be ready to run. okay?

760
00:53:24.017 --> 00:53:26.361
Wait a second. I'm in charge here.
I say the word.

761
00:53:26.486 --> 00:53:27.863
I'm listening!

762
00:53:28.521 --> 00:53:30.057
Hey! Over here!

763
00:53:30.423 --> 00:53:31.424
Now?

764
00:53:31.524 --> 00:53:34.664
Now! Now! Now!

765
00:53:35.662 --> 00:53:36.936
Oh. my God!

766
00:54:07.394 --> 00:54:09.262
I'm not getting a signal.

767
00:54:09.362 --> 00:54:11.137
We must be out of range.

768
00:54:33.987 --> 00:54:35.489
It's a snake skin.

769
00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:40.161
One of them is molting.

770
00:54:43.129 --> 00:54:44.335
It's too big for the males.

771
00:54:44.664 --> 00:54:45.972
It's come from the female.

772
00:54:46.333 --> 00:54:48.501
She may be ready to lay her eggs.

773
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:50.877
- We know one thing for sure.
- Which is what?

774
00:54:51.504 --> 00:54:52.710
She's still growing.

775
00:54:53.606 --> 00:54:55.984
Yeah. like she wasn't
big enough already.

776
00:54:56.609 --> 00:54:57.883
Move out!

777
00:54:59.879 --> 00:55:01.248
I'm fine.

778
00:55:01.348 --> 00:55:03.726
Just fine. Thanks for asking.

779
00:55:11.925 --> 00:55:13.461
Okay. sorry. Sorry.

780
00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:18.131
People of the visitors' center.
I need you to leave the premises right away.

781
00:55:18.231 --> 00:55:20.533
There is absolutely no reason to panic.

782
00:55:20.633 --> 00:55:21.601
Sorry.

783
00:55:21.701 --> 00:55:24.238
There is no need to panic.
Everything will be okay.

784
00:55:27.874 --> 00:55:30.010
By order of the Aroostook
County sheriff.

785
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.613
I need you to all remove your vehicles
and exit in a calm and orderly manner.

786
00:55:33.713 --> 00:55:34.981
There's no need for pushing and shoving.

787
00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:36.716
Get out of the way. nerd boy!

788
00:55:36.816 --> 00:55:38.090
Be polite. people!

789
00:55:38.785 --> 00:55:41.925
This is a major emergency! Run!
Your life may depend on it!

790
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.300
Stop. Stop!

791
00:55:49.562 --> 00:55:50.836
What is it?

792
00:56:00.473 --> 00:56:01.645
Sheriff...

793
00:56:03.843 --> 00:56:05.378
What the hell is it?

794
00:56:05.478 --> 00:56:07.185
It's crocodile prints.

795
00:56:08.548 --> 00:56:11.085
That tracker of yours
showing anything around here?

796
00:56:12.051 --> 00:56:15.157
No. no. no. It's still not working.
I left it in the truck.

797
00:56:58.731 --> 00:57:01.075
That's weird.
Where the hell did that thing go?

798
00:57:10.343 --> 00:57:11.378
Do something!

799
00:57:11.478 --> 00:57:12.752
Working on it!

800
00:57:20.753 --> 00:57:21.959
Oh. my God!

801
00:57:23.957 --> 00:57:25.197
What's that?

802
00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.186
Where you going?

803
00:57:49.148 --> 00:57:50.149
Damn!

804
00:57:54.187 --> 00:57:55.222
Sheriff!

805
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:57.790
Sheriff!

806
00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:00.059
Sheriff. stop! What are you doing?

807
00:58:00.159 --> 00:58:01.528
I'm going after the snake!

808
00:58:01.628 --> 00:58:02.829
Hell. no.

809
00:58:02.929 --> 00:58:05.165
I'm not about to become
part of the food chain.

810
00:58:05.265 --> 00:58:06.533
I'm going back to the truck
to find my daughter.

811
00:58:06.633 --> 00:58:07.737
What?

812
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.580
Come on.

813
00:58:16.809 --> 00:58:17.944
Come on. this way.

814
00:58:18.044 --> 00:58:20.524
I'm coming. I'm coming.
I got a bum knee.

815
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.457
Sheriff. this is Ferguson.

816
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.264
Sheriff. you copy?

817
00:58:32.458 --> 00:58:34.062
Yeah. I hear you. Ferguson. Go.

818
00:58:34.727 --> 00:58:35.899
This is Ferguson.

819
00:58:36.796 --> 00:58:39.106
I know. Ferguson. You just radio-ed me.

820
00:58:39.465 --> 00:58:42.936
Yeah. I just wanted you to know
that the visitors' center is secure

821
00:58:43.036 --> 00:58:44.709
and I've locked all the perimeter gates.

822
00:58:45.004 --> 00:58:46.176
Roger that.

823
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.477
By any chance you come across
a group of sorority girls out there?

824
00:58:50.577 --> 00:58:52.212
Negative. Sheriff.
Just a bunch of families.

825
00:58:52.312 --> 00:58:53.382
Why?

826
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.116
Did somebody else go missing?

827
00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:58.425
I'm with Tull. Meet me on the fire road.
We got another problem.

828
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:01.432
Does it involve a C-R-O-C?

829
00:59:01.821 --> 00:59:03.061
Now. Ferguson!

830
00:59:03.256 --> 00:59:04.496
Roger that.

831
00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:06.296
Oh. my God.

832
00:59:08.761 --> 00:59:10.502
Damn it! Still no answer.

833
00:59:11.764 --> 00:59:13.867
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

834
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:15.571
No. me neither.

835
00:59:15.935 --> 00:59:18.037
I mean. it... It had to be an anaconda.

836
00:59:18.137 --> 00:59:21.641
The green anaconda. that's the largest
species in recorded history.

837
00:59:22.942 --> 00:59:27.015
That thing wasn't just large. Tull.
It was. it was ginormous.

838
00:59:27.146 --> 00:59:29.415
I know. I saw it. I can't explain it.

839
00:59:29.515 --> 00:59:31.284
I mean. I've heard stories
of these snakes

840
00:59:31.384 --> 00:59:34.365
getting to be 50 or more feet long.
eating cattle and people.

841
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.124
But this is deep down in the jungles.
and they're just legends.

842
00:59:38.224 --> 00:59:39.362
Maybe not.

843
00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:43.830
Well. even if it's not a story.
they're indigenous to the Amazon.

844
00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:45.031
What the hell are they doing here?

845
00:59:45.131 --> 00:59:47.166
It had to have come from somewhere.

846
00:59:47.266 --> 00:59:49.135
It had to be a person
who brought it here.

847
00:59:49.235 --> 00:59:51.010
Great minds think alike.

848
00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:52.580
How did it get so big?

849
00:59:52.805 --> 00:59:55.149
I don't know. That's the least
of my worries at this point.

850
00:59:55.508 --> 00:59:56.509
You need more?

851
00:59:56.609 --> 00:59:58.578
My daughter is still out there.

852
00:59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.919
And any of these snakes
could be out there with her.

853
01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.922
And here I thought the crocs were bad.

854
01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:12.832
We can't just stay here.

855
01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:15.562
Maybe we can. I mean.
someone will figure out we're missing

856
01:00:15.662 --> 01:00:17.964
and send someone to find us. Right?

857
01:00:18.064 --> 01:00:19.065
That could take days.

858
01:00:19.165 --> 01:00:20.466
We'll starve to death.

859
01:00:20.566 --> 01:00:23.336
Trust me. some of you girls
could stand to lose a little weight.

860
01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:25.438
Oh. my God. Do I have to do everything?

861
01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:26.983
Switch with me.

862
01:00:28.141 --> 01:00:29.381
Okay.

863
01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:37.356
What are you doing?

864
01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:39.858
You were serious about stealing cars?

865
01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:47.366
All better. Let's go.

866
01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.095
How'd you learn to do that?

867
01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:51.238
When my dad wouldn't lend me his car.

868
01:00:51.597 --> 01:00:54.168
And that is why being a DG
is not in your future.

869
01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:56.169
How will my life go on?

870
01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:57.509
Drive!

871
01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:08.816
- I don't know...
- Where are we going?

872
01:01:09.849 --> 01:01:11.351
Oh. my God. watch out for that tree!

873
01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:14.432
My goodness! My goodness!

874
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:17.590
Damn it!

875
01:01:19.492 --> 01:01:21.369
Back up. There has to be another way.

876
01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:24.072
Come on!

877
01:01:24.697 --> 01:01:27.507
What are you waiting for. Tiff?
Just drive!

878
01:01:32.238 --> 01:01:33.239
Oh. my God!

879
01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:42.422
Everybody out! Now!

880
01:01:46.385 --> 01:01:48.729
- Get out! Get out!
- I can't go out there!

881
01:01:48.888 --> 01:01:49.989
I can't!

882
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:51.932
Wait! Where's Jennifer?

883
01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:54.129
Oh. my God.

884
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:56.696
- She's still inside!
- What?

885
01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:59.333
We have to get her out! Oh. my God.

886
01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.269
Hey. get off of there! Get off!

887
01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:06.748
- Yeah. that's smart! Piss off the giant snake!
- Somebody help me!

888
01:02:07.373 --> 01:02:10.445
Somebody help me! Someone!

889
01:02:25.525 --> 01:02:26.833
I'm so sorry.

890
01:02:27.927 --> 01:02:31.374
Hey. you did everything
somebody like you was willing to do.

891
01:02:32.231 --> 01:02:34.177
What am I going to tell my dad?

892
01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:37.578
He just bought me that car!

893
01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:45.478
If something happens
and I don't make it. do me a favor.

894
01:02:45.578 --> 01:02:47.023
Kick her ass.

895
01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.758
First on my bucket list.

896
01:03:04.497 --> 01:03:06.943
- What is it?
- There's something out there.

897
01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:09.744
It's not showing up on here.

898
01:03:09.902 --> 01:03:12.075
Maybe the transmission
got damaged somehow.

899
01:03:12.338 --> 01:03:14.079
Or maybe it's something else.

900
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.951
Don't shoot it. It's a federal offense.

901
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.615
What's it doing?

902
01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:23.955
Hunting.

903
01:03:24.116 --> 01:03:25.527
Hunting what?

904
01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:26.953
Us.

905
01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.258
The hell with this!

906
01:04:12.632 --> 01:04:13.736
He's dead.

907
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:19.777
Let's get moving.
She could lay her eggs any time.

908
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.176
We can't just leave him here like that.

909
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.717
We can't take him with us.
He'll just slow us down.

910
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.693
He knew what he was signing up for.
He have a family?

911
01:04:31.517 --> 01:04:32.689
A sister.

912
01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:35.764
Send flowers. Let's go.

913
01:04:40.993 --> 01:04:43.769
You do realize she's a sociopath. right?

914
01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:45.866
It had crossed my mind.

915
01:05:10.122 --> 01:05:11.457
Any new leads on the sorority girls?

916
01:05:11.557 --> 01:05:13.434
- Space. Ferguson.
- No. sir... Sorry.

917
01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.337
You guys are covered in blood.

918
01:05:16.028 --> 01:05:20.099
There are only really two
usable beaches along the shoreline.

919
01:05:20.199 --> 01:05:22.501
Everything else is just too rocky.
too many trees.

920
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.080
There's one along this path

921
01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:26.706
and another one round back
all the way over to the other side.

922
01:05:26.806 --> 01:05:29.675
That one's more popular
with the local teenagers.

923
01:05:29.775 --> 01:05:32.051
If you. if you get my meaning.

924
01:05:32.545 --> 01:05:34.456
- Show me.
- Okay. Yeah.

925
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:36.253
Okay.

926
01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.335
Oh. my God.

927
01:05:54.633 --> 01:05:55.935
Beth!

928
01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.912
What the hell happened here?

929
01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:00.545
Bethany!

930
01:06:01.907 --> 01:06:04.285
- I'm gonna go check the lake.
- What...

931
01:06:08.347 --> 01:06:09.348
I'm just gonna...

932
01:06:09.782 --> 01:06:12.018
- Ferguson! Let's go!
- Just gotta get my gun.

933
01:06:12.118 --> 01:06:13.188
Okay.

934
01:06:15.988 --> 01:06:17.865
What's an abandoned boat doing here?

935
01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:20.660
Ferguson. go check the boat out. okay?

936
01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.001
We're gonna check the shoreline.
Let's go.

937
01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:50.064
What the...

938
01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:06.539
I need you to focus.
Okay. I'm gonna ask you again.

939
01:07:06.639 --> 01:07:08.174
What happened on the boat?

940
01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.576
Who else was on the boat with you?
Think.

941
01:07:10.676 --> 01:07:12.747
I don't know.

942
01:07:13.579 --> 01:07:18.085
Andrew was wakeboarding and...

943
01:07:19.085 --> 01:07:21.821
Okay. but who else was there. all right?
I'm looking for someone. Okay?

944
01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:26.292
I'm looking for a girl. 5'4". blond hair.
blue eyes. named Bethany.

945
01:07:26.392 --> 01:07:27.598
Bethany Tull.

946
01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:29.929
- Her name is Bethany!
- Okay. relax. Tully. okay?

947
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:32.431
I don't remember any other girls
on the beach!

948
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.603
Are you here for rush week?
Are you part of the sorority?

949
01:07:35.835 --> 01:07:37.075
I'm looking for my daughter. damn it!

950
01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:39.577
- Tully. come here!
- I told you I don't remember!

951
01:07:39.939 --> 01:07:41.077
Take it easy. Tully.

952
01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.275
Can't you see
that the girl is hysterical?

953
01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:45.444
You're not gonna get anything from her.
not now.

954
01:07:45.544 --> 01:07:47.546
- I know. I just... I'm sorry. I lost it.
- It's all right.

955
01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:48.852
I'm sorry.

956
01:07:49.748 --> 01:07:51.951
Everything will be okay. I promise.
I promise. It'll all be okay.

957
01:07:52.051 --> 01:07:53.052
It's okay.

958
01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:54.754
Get her to the hospital. would you?
Okay?

959
01:07:54.854 --> 01:07:56.299
Okay. Hey.

960
01:07:58.124 --> 01:08:00.968
Hey. Now let's go find
your daughter. okay?

961
01:08:02.461 --> 01:08:03.735
Come on.

962
01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.804
I got something.

963
01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:11.246
Signal's pretty weak.

964
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.411
She's far.

965
01:08:18.043 --> 01:08:19.147
How big is this lake?

966
01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:23.290
Well. this is about as wide as she gets.

967
01:08:23.983 --> 01:08:27.328
Goes down that way another click or so
before it hits the Clear Lake Dam.

968
01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:29.727
How do we get there?

969
01:08:31.557 --> 01:08:32.865
Well. let's see.

970
01:08:33.092 --> 01:08:35.572
Well. we could take the roads
or go back over land.

971
01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:42.542
There's a boat. That'll do.

972
01:08:44.403 --> 01:08:47.179
I believe that's a tad too small. miss.

973
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.786
I'm sure you've heard that
more than once in your life.

974
01:08:52.144 --> 01:08:54.380
I don't think that belongs to us.
Ms. Murdoch.

975
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.516
I don't care what you think.
Now are you coming?

976
01:08:57.616 --> 01:08:59.789
Or are you giving me my money back?

977
01:09:28.013 --> 01:09:29.356
What the hell?

978
01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:41.697
Something crushed it like a tin can.

979
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.400
There's no way a crocodile
could do this.

980
01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:46.776
You and I both know it wasn't a croc.

981
01:09:56.075 --> 01:09:57.486
Where are you going?

982
01:09:58.143 --> 01:10:00.623
I'm gonna find my daughter
before that snake does.

983
01:10:01.213 --> 01:10:03.159
Just another day at the office.

984
01:10:07.753 --> 01:10:10.789
Lower your throttle. you goon.
You're going too fast.

985
01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:12.698
Don't listen to him. Speed up!

986
01:10:15.094 --> 01:10:16.929
That's a hell of a lot of wake.

987
01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:18.064
So?

988
01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:21.506
So. a big wake. lots of splashing.

989
01:10:21.867 --> 01:10:23.904
tends to attract crocs.

990
01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:27.642
I got bigger things to worry about
than crocodiles. Mr. Bickerman.

991
01:10:28.073 --> 01:10:30.314
Yeah. That's what you think.

992
01:10:44.423 --> 01:10:45.691
What the hell was that?

993
01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:46.959
We hit something.

994
01:10:47.059 --> 01:10:48.561
Or something hit us.

995
01:10:50.062 --> 01:10:52.440
I don't have time for this. Move!

996
01:10:52.865 --> 01:10:54.469
Can you even drive a boat. lady?

997
01:10:56.602 --> 01:10:59.879
What are you doing? We have to go back.
We have to go back.

998
01:11:00.072 --> 01:11:01.312
Hey!

999
01:11:02.207 --> 01:11:03.277
Hey!

1000
01:11:03.442 --> 01:11:05.319
Murdoch. you bitch!

1001
01:11:06.612 --> 01:11:08.714
- Help!
- Hey! Turn the boat around.

1002
01:11:08.814 --> 01:11:10.049
We got to go back and get him!

1003
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:11.457
We're not going back.

1004
01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:14.990
You want to save him?
Feel free to go for a swim.

1005
01:11:36.809 --> 01:11:39.483
That's it. I've had it.
I'm taking a break.

1006
01:11:40.012 --> 01:11:41.347
We should just keep moving.

1007
01:11:41.447 --> 01:11:42.983
I don't care what you do.

1008
01:11:43.182 --> 01:11:44.923
I need a minute to catch my breath.

1009
01:11:45.317 --> 01:11:47.524
No. no. she's right.
We should just stop.

1010
01:11:47.853 --> 01:11:50.522
Let's just stand here
so the giant snake can catch us.

1011
01:11:50.622 --> 01:11:51.790
I don't think it followed us.

1012
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.370
What we need to do
is find our way back to the main road.

1013
01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:56.673
Get your weasel ass up and keep moving.

1014
01:11:56.829 --> 01:12:00.140
The only way you're getting into
this sorority is over my dead body.

1015
01:12:00.532 --> 01:12:01.704
Dare to dream.

1016
01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.003
All right. girls. Two minutes.

1017
01:12:04.103 --> 01:12:06.005
And then we try to find the main road.

1018
01:12:06.105 --> 01:12:07.846
Just keep an eye out.

1019
01:12:08.307 --> 01:12:10.753
Crocodiles. snakes.

1020
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.953
who knows what else
could be out here with us?

1021
01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.458
Lions and tigers and bears. oh my.

1022
01:12:16.815 --> 01:12:20.285
Brings me back to my wonderful.
yet nightmarish. childhood.

1023
01:12:22.221 --> 01:12:23.598
Anybody else hear that?

1024
01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:25.424
Yes.

1025
01:12:25.858 --> 01:12:27.235
Oh. my God. something's out there.

1026
01:12:30.829 --> 01:12:33.605
Anyone want to bet it's not a cute.
little. scary-ass munchkin?

1027
01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:35.868
Maybe it's a search party.

1028
01:12:35.968 --> 01:12:37.572
Maybe they're looking for me.

1029
01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:40.408
Whatever it is. it's coming this way.

1030
01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:43.119
If it is a search party.
they're not leaving without me.

1031
01:12:57.723 --> 01:13:00.135
I didn't think there were any crocodiles
in Clear Lake!

1032
01:13:00.492 --> 01:13:02.403
Well. there's your search party.

1033
01:13:02.728 --> 01:13:05.197
That's not funny! What do I do?

1034
01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:07.299
Just don't move.

1035
01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:11.675
Don't move.

1036
01:13:16.775 --> 01:13:19.153
No! Nobody messes with a DG sister!

1037
01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.090
Oh. my God!

1038
01:13:38.163 --> 01:13:39.574
What the hell?

1039
01:13:45.804 --> 01:13:47.673
- Run!
- Oh. my God!

1040
01:13:47.773 --> 01:13:49.480
- Oh. my God. run!
- Beth!

1041
01:13:50.409 --> 01:13:52.082
Dad! Dad!

1042
01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:55.289
Oh. my God. I thought I lost you.

1043
01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.326
I knew you'd come for me.

1044
01:13:57.749 --> 01:13:58.887
Of course.

1045
01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:03.028
I'm gonna go home and reenact that
to my dad and evil stepmom.

1046
01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.992
Listen. this is real sweet and all.
but we'd better get moving.

1047
01:14:07.092 --> 01:14:08.093
I can't argue with that.

1048
01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:10.398
- Come on. let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

1049
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.802
All right. Beach.

1050
01:14:16.902 --> 01:14:19.338
You've had that look on your face
since we got off the boat.

1051
01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:20.539
What is it?

1052
01:14:20.639 --> 01:14:22.508
Nothing you need to worry about.

1053
01:14:22.608 --> 01:14:25.277
I'm putting my mission
and my life in your hands.

1054
01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:28.881
If you have a problem.
then hell yes. I need to worry.

1055
01:14:29.114 --> 01:14:32.951
I didn't like him any more than you did.
but we could've pulled him out of the water.

1056
01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:36.089
No one around here is gonna miss
Jim Bickerman. believe me.

1057
01:14:36.455 --> 01:14:38.264
Besides. he's probably fine.

1058
01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.734
There wasn't that much left of him.

1059
01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:42.967
He was a loose end.

1060
01:14:43.662 --> 01:14:46.199
He was right. You are a sociopath.

1061
01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:49.071
I'm not a sociopath. Mr. Beach.

1062
01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:52.571
I'm a person trying to protect
her father's legacy.

1063
01:14:52.671 --> 01:14:55.641
He spent most of his life
perfecting the Blood Orchid serum

1064
01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.914
and I intend to finish what he started.

1065
01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.645
Make no mistakes.

1066
01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:03.921
I will gladly sacrifice anyone
or anything that gets in my way.

1067
01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:05.284
Including you.

1068
01:15:07.286 --> 01:15:08.560
Nice to know where I stand.

1069
01:15:09.121 --> 01:15:11.692
Just keep doing your job
and you'll be fine.

1070
01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:26.442
This was such a gigantic mistake.

1071
01:15:26.872 --> 01:15:29.011
I should have pledged Omega Kappa.

1072
01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:31.543
How much further is it?

1073
01:15:31.643 --> 01:15:33.912
This is not my neck
of the woods. I am lost.

1074
01:15:34.012 --> 01:15:36.248
Relax. Tully. I know where we're going.

1075
01:15:36.348 --> 01:15:37.520
All right.

1076
01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:43.428
Sheriff. this is Ferguson. You copy?

1077
01:15:44.656 --> 01:15:45.828
Roger that.

1078
01:15:46.558 --> 01:15:48.299
Sheriff. can you hear me?

1079
01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.330
I copy. Ferguson.

1080
01:15:50.862 --> 01:15:52.034
Is that you?

1081
01:15:54.399 --> 01:15:55.742
I give up. I give up.

1082
01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:02.912
According to this signal.
she's right here somewhere.

1083
01:16:03.775 --> 01:16:06.654
We've been flushing them out
toward the choke point.

1084
01:16:07.112 --> 01:16:09.285
There's no way out.

1085
01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.287
I'm telling you.

1086
01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:15.326
She's right here.

1087
01:16:15.621 --> 01:16:17.089
What do you mean. right here?

1088
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:20.592
The only thing I'm seeing out here
is you. me and Mr. Happy.

1089
01:16:20.692 --> 01:16:24.139
I'm telling you. she's right here.

1090
01:16:27.132 --> 01:16:28.372
Where is it?

1091
01:16:49.287 --> 01:16:51.233
- That's not her.
- What do you mean. that's not her?

1092
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.357
That's the male.

1093
01:16:52.457 --> 01:16:53.527
Then where the hell is she?

1094
01:16:57.295 --> 01:16:58.365
Don't shoot it!

1095
01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:02.437
Damn!

1096
01:17:07.973 --> 01:17:09.384
You'll kill him if you shoot my snake!

1097
01:17:14.312 --> 01:17:15.347
What are you doing?

1098
01:17:15.747 --> 01:17:17.749
I told you I wasn't
gonna let you kill it.

1099
01:17:17.849 --> 01:17:20.452
which is what I'll do to you
if you get in my way.

1100
01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:21.553
Over there.

1101
01:17:24.856 --> 01:17:26.927
Don't you ever do that again.

1102
01:17:27.526 --> 01:17:28.766
Now. come on!

1103
01:17:41.606 --> 01:17:42.908
What the hell was that?

1104
01:17:43.008 --> 01:17:45.177
I don't know. but it's big. Let's move.

1105
01:17:45.277 --> 01:17:46.381
Come on.

1106
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:52.250
Wait a second!

1107
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.352
We need the tracking device
and the case. you idiot!

1108
01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.323
And I'll take my gun back.

1109
01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:09.901
This is Ferguson. over.

1110
01:18:10.001 --> 01:18:12.404
Lot of movement down here.
Crocs and snakes. over.

1111
01:18:12.504 --> 01:18:14.006
Ferguson. where the hell are you?

1112
01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:17.048
I'm in a back path somewhere
trying to find one of the crocs.

1113
01:18:18.076 --> 01:18:20.249
And I think I can hear something.

1114
01:18:23.048 --> 01:18:24.493
Can you hear this. Ferguson?

1115
01:18:24.883 --> 01:18:27.386
You're hearing us. You're hearing us!

1116
01:18:27.986 --> 01:18:29.522
- Turn around!
- What?

1117
01:18:29.988 --> 01:18:31.194
Got it.

1118
01:18:35.761 --> 01:18:37.138
No grip on my shoes.

1119
01:18:40.565 --> 01:18:41.873
Come on.

1120
01:18:45.237 --> 01:18:46.511
Okay. got it.

1121
01:18:46.772 --> 01:18:48.149
- All right?
- Okay.

1122
01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:57.221
Nobody move!

1123
01:18:59.484 --> 01:19:01.086
Ready to fill your freezer?

1124
01:19:01.186 --> 01:19:02.320
You got a full clip?

1125
01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.189
Never leave home without it.

1126
01:19:04.289 --> 01:19:07.998
Hey. how dare you point
your guns at my snake?

1127
01:19:08.293 --> 01:19:10.295
I'm the sheriff. lady.
Who the hell are you?

1128
01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:13.567
I don't care who you are.
You're not killing my snake!

1129
01:19:13.899 --> 01:19:16.812
You see. I'm the one who says
who kills who and what around here.

1130
01:19:17.135 --> 01:19:18.512
Right now. you're on my list.

1131
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.272
This is a controlled animal reserve.

1132
01:19:20.372 --> 01:19:22.374
Drop your gun
and tell your henchmen to stand down.

1133
01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:24.244
Let me just educate you a little bit.

1134
01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:29.921
Those snakes are the property
of the Wexel Corporation.

1135
01:19:30.549 --> 01:19:35.157
You kill them and I am gonna sue
the town of Lake Placid into bankruptcy.

1136
01:19:35.821 --> 01:19:39.564
It's gonna be a little tricky. don't you think.
to attract tourists to a ghost town?

1137
01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.972
Now. I'm gonna put him down
for a little nap.

1138
01:19:44.329 --> 01:19:47.333
My extraction team is gonna
bring them back to the lab.

1139
01:19:47.732 --> 01:19:49.167
And you and your little
college field trip

1140
01:19:49.267 --> 01:19:51.304
can do whatever you want
with your crocodiles.

1141
01:19:51.736 --> 01:19:52.737
Beach.

1142
01:19:55.006 --> 01:19:58.681
Extraction Team. this is Black Lake recovery.
Get ready for extraction.

1143
01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:00.514
Read you loud and clear. We're here.

1144
01:20:00.679 --> 01:20:03.751
Then again. Beach. kill the damn crocs.

1145
01:20:03.982 --> 01:20:05.393
Don't let them kill the male.

1146
01:20:06.985 --> 01:20:08.123
What the hell was that?

1147
01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.401
After everything I've seen today.
nothing would surprise me.

1148
01:20:13.191 --> 01:20:14.363
Hello?

1149
01:20:15.327 --> 01:20:16.567
Except that.

1150
01:20:16.695 --> 01:20:17.833
She's here!

1151
01:20:18.096 --> 01:20:20.576
That is one big-ass snake.

1152
01:20:25.136 --> 01:20:26.706
That's my girl!

1153
01:20:27.606 --> 01:20:30.883
On my coordinates. gentlemen.
prepare for snake extraction.

1154
01:20:31.843 --> 01:20:33.379
Roger that. We have eyes on you.

1155
01:20:36.648 --> 01:20:38.389
That's okay. baby.

1156
01:20:38.817 --> 01:20:41.058
You will all be home soon.

1157
01:20:53.732 --> 01:20:56.067
Looks like your extraction team
just got extracted.

1158
01:20:56.167 --> 01:20:57.569
- Ferguson!
- Yes. sir.

1159
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:59.171
Get my daughter
and her friends to safety.

1160
01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:00.405
I'm not leaving you here.

1161
01:21:00.505 --> 01:21:01.540
I'll be fine.

1162
01:21:02.173 --> 01:21:04.342
- Just go. Go!
- Yeah. okay. Come on. let's go.

1163
01:21:04.442 --> 01:21:05.977
And if things go south.
get 'em the hell out of here.

1164
01:21:06.077 --> 01:21:07.385
Yes. sir. Yes. sir.

1165
01:21:12.217 --> 01:21:13.753
Just kill the damn croc!

1166
01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:28.476
- Kill it.
- Oh. my God!

1167
01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.755
No! Don't kill my baby!

1168
01:21:50.855 --> 01:21:52.892
You really are a psycho bitch!

1169
01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:55.999
Damn it!

1170
01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.705
Girls. don't watch. don't watch.
Don't watch!

1171
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:06.608
Oh. my God.

1172
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:24.798
Bye. bye. baby!

1173
01:22:26.391 --> 01:22:28.769
No!

1174
01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:37.602
Oh. my God.

1175
01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:40.842
This is really starting
to get disgusting.

1176
01:22:41.006 --> 01:22:42.073
God!

1177
01:22:42.173 --> 01:22:43.447
God!

1178
01:22:45.777 --> 01:22:47.484
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1179
01:22:48.079 --> 01:22:49.114
- Oh. my God.
- Okay.

1180
01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:50.750
God. that's disgusting.

1181
01:23:44.302 --> 01:23:47.647
When my lawyers are through with you.
you'll wish you never met me.

1182
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.742
I already do. Trust me.

1183
01:23:50.842 --> 01:23:54.045
When she's done with you.
you and I have some business to discuss.

1184
01:23:54.145 --> 01:23:56.284
Yeah. good luck keeping your badge.

1185
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:02.061
Good luck being
someone's bitch behind bars.

1186
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.791
Ferguson. cuff her.

1187
01:24:06.891 --> 01:24:08.165
Yeah.

1188
01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:13.100
I left 'em at home. Sorry.

1189
01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:17.643
- Here. There you go.
- Sorry.

1190
01:24:18.269 --> 01:24:19.680
- Ferguson?
- Yeah?

1191
01:24:21.039 --> 01:24:22.143
Good job.

1192
01:24:25.176 --> 01:24:26.746
Space. Ferguson.

1193
01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.125
Tull.

1194
01:24:31.616 --> 01:24:35.223
This is why your tracking software
was on the fritz.

1195
01:24:36.254 --> 01:24:37.422
Back in the day.

1196
01:24:37.522 --> 01:24:40.935
we used those to track tagged animals
and jam the Feds.

1197
01:24:41.226 --> 01:24:42.427
No kidding?

1198
01:24:42.527 --> 01:24:43.528
Far out.

1199
01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:47.874
This is great. I mean. I can get
all the crocs back in the reserve now.

1200
01:24:48.967 --> 01:24:50.844
Finally. some good news. huh?

1201
01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:52.837
Dad!

1202
01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.509
Babe.

1203
01:24:59.844 --> 01:25:03.986
So. Dad. I know I said I would join
Deltas in honor of Mom.

1204
01:25:04.883 --> 01:25:06.863
but do you think it would be
okay if I didn't?

1205
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.357
I don't think that she would mind a bit.

1206
01:25:12.423 --> 01:25:16.633
Besides. you honor her every day
by being so awesome.

1207
01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.143
- I love you so much.
- Thanks. Dad.

1208
01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.004
I'm so glad you're safe.

1209
01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:26.675
Hey. guess what?

1210
01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:29.146
Get in the truck!

1211
01:25:43.855 --> 01:25:45.129
Later. gator.

1212
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:48.066
It's not a gator. It's a crocodile.

1213
01:25:48.593 --> 01:25:49.901
Whatever.
