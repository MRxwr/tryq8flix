00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.251
<i>Once upon a time.
there was an 18-year-old human.</i>

2
00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:10.251
<i>uh...</i>

3
00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:14.292
Oh. come on. Marla. just...
just be normal. Just be normal.

4
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.667
There comes a time
in every young person's life...

5
00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:18.626
Not "person."
That sounds too formal.

6
00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.709
Girl. No. not girl.

7
00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:23.251
Woman.

8
00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.126
There comes a time
in every young woman's life

9
00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:28.209
when she has to make a decision.

10
00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:29.751
Okay. um...

11
00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.584
Look. Mom and Dad.

12
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:33.501
obviously I want to go to college.

13
00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.584
education is the most important
thing in the world. but...

14
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.334
after 12 years of school.

15
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:42.042
think about how valuable
it will be for me

16
00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.167
to actually experience the world.

17
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:46.709
As Amelia Earhart once said:

18
00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:49.042
"Adventure is worthwhile in itself."

19
00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:51.501
Which is why...

20
00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.792
I got...

21
00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.751
...this!

22
00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:58.209
What's in your pocket?

23
00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:00.001
What? Nothing.

24
00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:01.542
If you don't tell me.

25
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.876
I'll tell Mom you gave me
ice cream for dinner.

26
00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:06.167
Wow! Blackmail.

27
00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:09.334
- Impressive. but illegal.
- Not when you're six.

28
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:11.542
Alright. you have
to promise not to tell

29
00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.167
Mom and Dad until I've told them.

30
00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:14.876
Pinky swear?

31
00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:16.417
Pinky swear.

32
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.417
- Do you know what this is?
- A really small notebook?

33
00:02:22.584 --> 00:02:25.126
It's a passport. It lets you
go anywhere in the world.

34
00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:28.209
I've saved up all my work money
and I'm gonna backpack everywhere.

35
00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:30.459
And then I'll go to college. It's just...

36
00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.001
I don't know. Mom and Dad make
everything so easy for us. you know?

37
00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:37.126
Sometimes. you gotta test yourself.

38
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:39.417
But you take lots of tests.

39
00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:42.626
No. not those kind of tests.
Real-life tests.

40
00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:44.584
Where you go everywhere.

41
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:47.667
and do everything. and see
what you're really made of.

42
00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:56.876
I get to be an explorer.
A "never before her."

43
00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:58.626
A crosser of borders.

44
00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:00.834

Marla. the noble knight? Hi-yah!

Stay away from my brother!

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.584

00:05:37.334 --> 00:05:38.917
Hi-yah! Ha!

97
00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:42.626
Catch me. Charlie. catch me!
We saved the day!

98
00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:44.167

Viking and knight!
Viking and knight!

101
00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:52.417
Hey. Charlie. don't open the door!

102
00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:58.251
Alright. I'm coming!

103
00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:07.667
Marla Brenner?

104
00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:10.126
Yes.

105
00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:13.084
I'm sorry.
but there's been an accident.

106
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.667
Could we please come inside
and speak with you?

107
00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.917
Your parents
were in a car accident...

108
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:43.876
Marla. you're not listening to me!

109
00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:47.292
Charlie. I am listening to you.
but the answer is still no!

110
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:50.626
So you're bailing on me again?
Fine. Then I'll just go with Danny.

111
00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.001
Ha! To the city? I don't think so.

112
00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:54.917
You always do this!

113
00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.292
Hey! I am trying
to run a household here.

114
00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:01.834
That doesn't mean
we can't have any fun!

115
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:05.126
Yeah. well. sometimes. there are
more important things than fun.

116
00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:08.209
- This sucks!
- Language!

117
00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:10.751
And don't you dare...

118
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.417
...slam the door.

119
00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:18.917
Good!

120
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.584
That went great!

121
00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.292
Charlie. dinner's ready.

122
00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:08.917
Come on. Bud. let's talk.

123
00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:24.376
Charlie!

124
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:32.751
Sorry.

125
00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:37.751
Oh. hey. Danny. Uh...
Yeah. I'm on my way now.

126
00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.792
Sorry. Uh. not too long.

127
00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:44.459
Yeah. can you hold on a minute?

128
00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:49.417
Danny? Yeah. my sister
was totally cool with it.

129
00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:52.209
Uh... yeah. I'm close.

130
00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:55.334
I think. like. 10 minutes.

131
00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:06.417
Make that 20.

132
00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:18.209
Come on. Charlie.
pick up the phone!

133
00:09:23.584 --> 00:09:26.667
Midtown?!
Argh! Are you kidding me?!

134
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:53.876
Hey. whoa! Lady!
You can't go in there.

135
00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:57.167
Trust me. mister.
I am not here for the Gateway to Fun.

136
00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:59.459
My little brother is in there.
I have to find him

137
00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:01.542
so I can tell him
he's grounded till he's 18.

138
00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:03.109
- Yeah. okay. let's go.
- Thank you!

139
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:07.042
No. I said let's go. you know. together.
She's gonna make me run!

140
00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:12.751
Whoa.

141
00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:29.167
Charlie?

142
00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:46.709
This is so awesome!

143
00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:51.792
Charlie? Charlie!

144
00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:53.667
- Marla!
- What were you thinking?!

145
00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:56.042
- How did you find me?
- You scared me half to death.

146
00:10:56.209 --> 00:10:59.417
I'm sorry. but you won't believe this!
You have to check this out!

147
00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:03.209
- Charlie. we're leaving.
- No! Wait! Marla!

148
00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:06.251
It's all lined up exactly like we had it.

149
00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:09.084
There's the Coliseum
and all the knights.

150
00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.417
Remember? What are...
what are the chances?

151
00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:13.709
Look. any minute now.
a rent-a-cop is gonna come

152
00:11:13.876 --> 00:11:16.001
through that curtain
and arrest us for trespassing.

153
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:19.626
Come on! Look around!

154
00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:23.042
It's like we're meant to be here.

155
00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:25.042
Meant to be here?
That's ridiculous.

156
00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:27.876
- What is wrong with you?
- Excuse me?

157
00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.751
You used to talk about adventures
and seeing the world.

158
00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.709
"Nothing's worse
than a small. stationary life?"

159
00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:35.792
But I grew up. Charlie.

160
00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:38.209
And I learned the hard way
that life is not an adventure.

161
00:11:38.376 --> 00:11:41.251
It's full of disappointments
and it's not the way you want it to be.

162
00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:43.709
That's just how you made it

163
00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:47.251
because you don't do anything.
you won't let me do anything!

164
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:51.709
It's like ever since Mom and Dad died...

165
00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:54.126
Don't. Charlie.

166
00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:55.792
...you died.

167
00:11:55.959 --> 00:11:58.417
And now we're just
pretending to be a family.

168
00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:04.376
Well. then. I guess you're just
stuck with dead old me.

169
00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:07.167
Come on. let's go.

170
00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:11.084
No!

171
00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:15.626
Wait. There's even a spot here...
for my Viking!

172
00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:18.001
No. there's not. Charlie!

173
00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:21.292
This is not for us! This is a toy!

174
00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:24.417
It's a stupid toy.
and none of this means anything!

175
00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:40.001
I think something bad's happening.

176
00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:45.001
Or something good.

177
00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:48.834

207
00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:53.334
- Charlie?!
- Yeah. Marla.

208
00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:55.584
You're not... you.

209
00:14:55.751 --> 00:14:57.876
I know! I feel different!

210
00:14:58.042 --> 00:15:00.542
Yeah... you look different.

211
00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:02.417
You have a... a beard!

212
00:15:02.584 --> 00:15:04.542
Ha! I do!

The Vikings. All of it.

217
00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:15.417
It's... it's real!

218
00:15:15.584 --> 00:15:17.264

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:21.292
- The lighthouse? The lighthouse!
- Cool!

221
00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:24.459
That's it! We came through
the lighthouse to get here.

222
00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.186
- Marla?
- So that must be the way back!

223
00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:27.751
- Of course!

224
00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:29.643

Oh. no matter.
Charles the Destroyer.

Lady Fortune has sent him
right to us!

357
00:21:54.209 --> 00:21:57.126
Whoa! Whoa! When I dreamed
of riding a horse one day.

358
00:21:57.292 --> 00:21:59.709
this is not what I had in mind. oh!

Fitzy... my good man.

it is Del. your buddy. callin'.

371
00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:43.251
Heh. With the truck.

372
00:22:43.417 --> 00:22:45.376
We've met many times!

373
00:22:45.542 --> 00:22:48.417
Yes. yes! I got a beard. yeah!

374
00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:51.084
Anyway. listen. what if I told you

375
00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:55.792
I had an incredible opportunity
on some rare enchanted hay.

376
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:58.792
Huh! I'm coming for you. Charlie!

377
00:22:58.959 --> 00:23:00.584
Yah! Giddy-up!

378
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:03.185
So how much can I put you down for?
Let's crunch some numbers.

379
00:23:03.209 --> 00:23:06.584
Hey. watch it! Watch...

380
00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:08.542
I don't want no trouble!

381
00:23:08.709 --> 00:23:10.126
No!

382
00:23:10.292 --> 00:23:12.626
At that price.
I'm practically paying you.

383
00:23:12.792 --> 00:23:16.709
Oh. hold on. I'm getting another call.
Someone probably wanting hay.

384
00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:20.167
Del's Enchanted Hay. This is Del.

385
00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:22.792
<i>- Del!</i>
- Glinara!

386
00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:24.542
What a surprise.

387
00:23:24.709 --> 00:23:26.917
<i>- We need to talk! Now!</i>
- You sound angry. Glinara.

388
00:23:27.084 --> 00:23:28.751
<i>I want my money!</i>

389
00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:31.077
What a coincidence.
I'm just happened to be on my way

390
00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:33.292
to pick up your money right now.
it's great.

391
00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:35.709
- Oh!
- My dogs are going crazy!

392
00:23:35.876 --> 00:23:38.334
- Get outta here!
- I need to borrow this! Ah! Oof!

393
00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:41.167
- Oh. that's my pole!
- Come on!

394
00:23:41.334 --> 00:23:44.251
- I gotta feed my kids with that! Come on!
- Oh! Ouch! Oh!

395
00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:50.001
Oof! Ah! Oh! Oh! Argh!

396
00:23:51.251 --> 00:23:53.459
But this truck is all I have!

397
00:23:53.626 --> 00:23:56.501
You can't just send someone
to take my...

398
00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:59.792
Ah! Outta the way!
I'm taking the truck.

399
00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:01.626
- What?! N-n-n-no!
- Give me that!

400
00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:03.232
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!
- Stop it!

401
00:24:03.334 --> 00:24:06.126
Tell Glinara I need more time!
Please!

402
00:24:06.292 --> 00:24:08.917
Who do you think you are?!

403
00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:12.292
Why are you doing this to me?!
Don't hurt Del's Belle!

404
00:24:12.459 --> 00:24:15.417
- You're going to make us crash!
- It's my truck. lady!

405
00:24:15.584 --> 00:24:17.667
- I got enough troubles! Ow!
- Move your foot! Aha!

406
00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:20.001
Whoa! Ah! What are you... Ugh!

407
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:22.709
Go! Go! Fast! Oh!

408
00:24:22.876 --> 00:24:24.917
Faster! Go! Come on!

409
00:24:25.084 --> 00:24:28.917
Oh! What?! No!
No. no. no. no. no. no!

410
00:24:29.084 --> 00:24:33.084
Where did they go?!
Where did they... Charlie!

411
00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.792
Charlie?!

412
00:24:40.167 --> 00:24:41.626
Oh...

413
00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:44.001
I've... I've lost him.

414
00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:45.792
Joyride's over!

415
00:24:45.959 --> 00:24:48.501
You clearly don't work for Glinara.

416
00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:52.667
And this is my truck. lady!
Have a nice life!

417
00:24:52.834 --> 00:24:55.501
I'm saying that sarcastically!

418
00:24:56.542 --> 00:24:58.167
Ah!

419
00:24:58.334 --> 00:25:00.459
Argh!

420
00:25:00.626 --> 00:25:02.584
Grrr! What the heck?!

421
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:05.167
What is going on
in this crazy place?

422
00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:11.292
Oh!

423
00:25:11.459 --> 00:25:13.959
Oh. thank goodness you're back.

424
00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:18.667
Look. I realize
we got off to a bad start.

425
00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:22.209
and that I need you more
than you need me...

426
00:25:24.584 --> 00:25:26.709
Ah! Oh!

427
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:31.417
Ah...

428
00:25:31.584 --> 00:25:34.126
Huh. Alright.

429
00:25:34.292 --> 00:25:37.626
Okay. I just need to find some help.

430
00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:46.917
Perfect.

431
00:25:55.542 --> 00:25:57.792
Huh?

432
00:25:57.959 --> 00:26:00.376
Ah! Oh!

433
00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:15.292
Hello?

434
00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:20.459
Oh!

435
00:26:22.917 --> 00:26:25.001
Huh.

436
00:26:26.334 --> 00:26:28.459
Guess not.

437
00:26:28.626 --> 00:26:31.792
No! Not a darn-tootin' nugget
of gold today!

438
00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:34.167
What? Well. yeah. I agree!

439
00:26:34.334 --> 00:26:35.959
Uh. sir? Excuse me?

440
00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:38.001
Can I help you with
something. little lady?

441
00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:40.792
Yeah! Any idea where
I can find the sher...

442
00:26:40.959 --> 00:26:43.334
Yee-haw!

443
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.209
- Uh...
- Whoo!

444
00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:47.667
- Eat lead. Sheriff!
- Sheriff?

445
00:26:47.834 --> 00:26:51.042
Yah! Yah! I'll get you boys!

446
00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.292
- Sheriff! Sheriff! Wait. Sheriff. wait!
- Yah! Giddy-up! Yah!

447
00:26:54.459 --> 00:26:57.584
- Not on my watch! Hi-yah!
- Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff?

448
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.751
- C'mon! Yah! Yah!
- Sheriff?

449
00:26:59.917 --> 00:27:01.542
- Sheriff...
- Yeah!

450
00:27:01.709 --> 00:27:05.542
- And stay out!
- Oof!

451
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:07.626
- Him again?
- Ow.

452
00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:09.376
That hurts.

453
00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:11.376
Ugh! Ah...

454
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.834
Come on! We had a deal!

455
00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:18.001
Deal's off!
Your hay dun changed my steeds!

456
00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:20.167
Take a good look.

457
00:27:21.209 --> 00:27:23.792
What are you talking about?
I don't see any...

458
00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:30.459
Ah... that's not good.

459
00:27:33.042 --> 00:27:36.501
All they want to do is frolic
and dance around!

460
00:27:36.667 --> 00:27:38.876
And there's glitter everywhere!

461
00:27:39.042 --> 00:27:41.751
The-the-the wizard
who sold me the hay

462
00:27:41.917 --> 00:27:43.709
didn't say anything
about sprouting wings!

463
00:27:43.876 --> 00:27:46.876
Well. he should have!
Lying wizard!

464
00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:48.792
And I'm not paying you
a plumb cent!

465
00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:51.334
No. no. no. no! Please!
I was counting on that money.

466
00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:54.001
I need to pay Glinara back!

467
00:27:54.167 --> 00:27:55.751
Aw. come on!

468
00:27:55.917 --> 00:28:00.292
Oh. look who it is. You make friends
everywhere you go. don't you?

469
00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:04.251
You! You're the maniac
who carjacked me. and lost all my hay!

470
00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:06.167
Why-why are you following me?!

471
00:28:06.334 --> 00:28:09.292
Me? Following you?!
I don't think so.

472
00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:11.251
'Cause I already have
enough problems!

473
00:28:11.417 --> 00:28:13.167
I'm just here to...

474
00:28:13.334 --> 00:28:15.501
...get a posse together.

475
00:28:16.542 --> 00:28:18.917
You? Gather a posse?

476
00:28:24.709 --> 00:28:28.792
Okay. okay. okay. okay. okay.
A posse. I gotta see this. Okay. go ahead.

477
00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:30.459
Ugh!

478
00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:37.501
Ahem.

479
00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:43.376
Okay. Yee-haw!

480
00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:46.501
Um... giddy-up. lil' pardners.

481
00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:48.501
I'm. uh. leadin' a posse

482
00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:51.334
to find my rootin-est.
tootin-est brother.

483
00:28:53.167 --> 00:28:55.501
Don't it sound
like a hoot and a holler?

484
00:28:59.209 --> 00:29:01.917
Uh-heh. I'll. uh...

485
00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:04.501
I'll pay a fair wage.

486
00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:07.376
Oh!

487
00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:09.334
Gold!

488
00:29:17.084 --> 00:29:19.501
Oh. great! You're all coming forward?

489
00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:21.709
This is excellent!
Do any of you have resumes?

490
00:29:21.876 --> 00:29:24.917
Why didn't you tell me
you had Viking gold?!

491
00:29:25.084 --> 00:29:27.334
Are you out of your mind?
Put those away!

492
00:29:27.501 --> 00:29:29.376
Half this town
will kill you for them.

493
00:29:29.542 --> 00:29:31.709
the other half
doesn't need a reason!

494
00:29:31.876 --> 00:29:36.542
How's about you hand over
that gold? Nice and slow-like.

495
00:29:36.709 --> 00:29:38.084
- Come on.
- Hi.

496
00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:39.751
- Guys?
- Walking away now.

497
00:29:39.917 --> 00:29:41.459
- We can work something out here.
- Ah!

498
00:29:41.626 --> 00:29:43.126
- Ooh!
- Ah!

499
00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:45.959
Ah!

500
00:29:50.084 --> 00:29:51.834
Whoo! Yee-hoo!

501
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.792
Ooh! What...?

502
00:29:56.959 --> 00:29:58.917
Who are...? Excuse me!

503
00:29:59.084 --> 00:30:02.417
Where'd she go?!
Oh. I see her! Get that gold!

504
00:30:07.167 --> 00:30:09.084
Ah!

505
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:10.491
I want that gold!

506
00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:14.084
Come on! Let's go!

507
00:30:17.667 --> 00:30:20.792
Quick! Throw me the gold!

508
00:30:20.959 --> 00:30:22.959
- What?! No!
- Okay. get in!

509
00:30:23.126 --> 00:30:25.042
Get in! Come on! Come on!

510
00:30:25.209 --> 00:30:26.667
We'll get you. girl!

511
00:30:28.334 --> 00:30:30.251
Hey. wait! Wait. wait!

512
00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:32.709
Oh!

513
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:46.792
Hey. uh. the saddlebag
move you did. nicely done.

514
00:30:46.959 --> 00:30:48.834
I was gonna do it. yeah...

515
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:51.542
I was about to do it.
and then I saw you do it.

516
00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:53.876
and I was. like. well.
I'm not gonna do it now.

517
00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:55.442
But you know what?
No hard feelings.

518
00:30:55.584 --> 00:30:57.959
Yeah. I could tell.
especially when you were

519
00:30:58.126 --> 00:30:59.886
hiding behind me
like a scared little poodle.

520
00:31:00.042 --> 00:31:02.001
That's...

521
00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:03.751
Uh. so...

522
00:31:05.126 --> 00:31:07.667
- About the gold?
- Seriously?

523
00:31:07.834 --> 00:31:11.376
You know. you can just drop me
off at the next exit. I'm cool.

524
00:31:11.542 --> 00:31:15.959
You want to get off
at Jurassic Jungle? Okay.

525
00:31:20.084 --> 00:31:21.501
Holy...!

526
00:31:21.667 --> 00:31:23.751
Um. you know.
on... on second thought.

527
00:31:23.917 --> 00:31:26.084
why don't we just keep driving. heh?

528
00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.792
I'm Marla. by the way.

529
00:31:27.959 --> 00:31:29.667
Hi. Marla. I'm Del.

530
00:31:29.834 --> 00:31:32.917
And this is. uh.
Del's Belle. my truck.

531
00:31:33.084 --> 00:31:34.876
I don't let a lot of people in here.

532
00:31:35.042 --> 00:31:37.376
and I'm. uh. letting you in
because I like you.

533
00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:40.876
and not just because you're rich
or that you have a bag of coins.

534
00:31:41.042 --> 00:31:44.126
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Um. is this a food truck?

535
00:31:44.292 --> 00:31:48.001
Used to be. Yeah. couple guys
in Summer Fun Land traded it to me

536
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.584
for a pirate's cannon a few years ago.

537
00:31:50.751 --> 00:31:53.167
Now she's my mobile office.

538
00:31:53.334 --> 00:31:55.292
my apartment on wheels.

539
00:31:55.459 --> 00:31:57.376
I sleep here. I live here.

540
00:31:57.542 --> 00:32:00.001
Anyway. we have had some fun!

541
00:32:00.167 --> 00:32:02.834
Me and Del's Belle.
all the stories she could tell...

542
00:32:03.001 --> 00:32:04.626
And I'd love to hear them.

543
00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:07.584
But I need to focus on finding
my little brother right now.

544
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:09.584
Okay. What does he look like?

545
00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:12.667
Well. actually.
he's about this tall.

546
00:32:12.834 --> 00:32:15.001
tattoos. beard.

547
00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:17.417
carries around this giant axe.

548
00:32:17.584 --> 00:32:20.501
- How old is he?
- He's 10.

549
00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:23.501
Well. lucky for you.
you ended up with me!

550
00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:27.084
With my connections.
I could find your brother. <i>no problemo.</i>

551
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:30.417
But the truth is. my back's
against the wall here. alright?

552
00:32:30.584 --> 00:32:34.084
All I want to do is help. That's all
I want to do. But you know what?

553
00:32:34.251 --> 00:32:37.126
I'm gonna have to be
compensated for my time.

554
00:32:40.417 --> 00:32:43.084
How many gold coins
did you say were in the bag?

555
00:32:44.334 --> 00:32:45.959
40. Maybe 50.

556
00:32:46.126 --> 00:32:49.001
And they're all yours
if you can help me find Charlie.

557
00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.626
- You got yourself a deal.
- Deal!

558
00:32:50.792 --> 00:32:54.501
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah!
Me and Del's Belle are on the case!

559
00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:56.251
Ain't nothin' gonna stop...

560
00:32:56.417 --> 00:32:58.126
Stop! Stop! Stop!

561
00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:03.501
No...!

562
00:33:10.917 --> 00:33:13.792
Hold on! I'm gonna try
to bring her in for a landing!

563
00:33:17.876 --> 00:33:20.417
Whoa...!

564
00:33:20.584 --> 00:33:22.167
Whoo! Lean into it!

565
00:33:36.542 --> 00:33:38.584
Oh.

566
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:42.084
We be rich. lads!
Tonight we feast!

567
00:33:42.251 --> 00:33:45.376
The first round of turkey legs
is on me. alright?!

568
00:33:45.542 --> 00:33:47.709
What?!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

569
00:33:47.876 --> 00:33:51.292
Me own crew
collectin' a booty for me booty?!

570
00:33:51.459 --> 00:33:53.834
You think
you can just snatch me away

571
00:33:54.001 --> 00:33:57.084
from my Amazonian sisters
in the middle of the night?!

572
00:33:57.251 --> 00:34:00.459
Oh! Unleash me now
and see how you fare!

573
00:34:00.626 --> 00:34:04.501
Pipe down. Amazonian.
You're hurting my ears.

574
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:06.376
Quiet. Zarkonian scum.

575
00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:08.834
or I'll rip your three tongues out
with my bare hands!

576
00:34:09.001 --> 00:34:12.917
Argh! Ook-Ook free!
Ook-Ook free now!

577
00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:14.792
All hail...

578
00:34:14.959 --> 00:34:16.917

579
00:34:17.084 --> 00:34:20.417

581
00:34:25.584 --> 00:34:30.001
Well. well.
look what we have here.

582
00:34:30.167 --> 00:34:33.251
I really was
on the nice list this year.

583
00:34:33.417 --> 00:34:35.917
- Argh!
- Mm. Yes. strong.

584
00:34:36.084 --> 00:34:39.459
And you have the braids
of a much stronger woman.

585
00:34:39.626 --> 00:34:41.459
This is a beard! Argh!

586
00:34:41.626 --> 00:34:44.542
- Oh! Oh!
- And what do we have here?

587
00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:46.751
Your worst nightmare.

588
00:34:46.917 --> 00:34:49.001
Pfft. You're not a piñata
full of bees?

589
00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:51.167
- Hey. sir! Let me go!
- Hmm?

590
00:34:51.334 --> 00:34:54.167
My new Viking friends
are coming for me. I'm sure of it.

591
00:34:54.334 --> 00:34:57.459
And when they free me.
we're all gonna make you pay!

592
00:34:57.626 --> 00:34:59.626
Ha! Well. good luck to them
finding you.

593
00:34:59.792 --> 00:35:01.584
Good luck to anyone
finding you here.

594
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:05.501
This entire city is on a remote island.

595
00:35:05.667 --> 00:35:09.417
It's surrounded by jagged rocks
and an impenetrable wall.

596
00:35:09.584 --> 00:35:11.834
guarded day and night.

597
00:35:12.001 --> 00:35:13.834
No one's coming for you. kid.

598
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:15.417
Trust me.

599
00:35:15.584 --> 00:35:17.126
Balderdash!

600
00:35:17.292 --> 00:35:19.126
Release me now.

601
00:35:19.292 --> 00:35:23.292
and I may just let you live.
vile knave!

602
00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:26.167
You kiss your mother
with that mouth? Pfft! Goodbye!

603
00:35:26.334 --> 00:35:29.376

Over the last several months.

680

have vanished into thin air.

who took my brother?

688
00:39:50.459 --> 00:39:53.167
Once you look past the roses
and carnations.

689
00:39:53.334 --> 00:39:57.501
you'll find the headquarters for
a top-secret organization known as SKULL.

690
00:39:57.667 --> 00:40:00.209
The Secret Killers Union
of Lethal Lemurs.

falls apart at the end.

692

00:40:04.917 --> 00:40:06.959
and hoped people wouldn't
wonder what it stands for.

694
00:40:07.126 --> 00:40:11.001
We get to the top floor. we access
their satellite surveillance system.

695
00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:13.209
From there.
we'll check yesterday's feed.

696
00:40:13.376 --> 00:40:16.001
and get a visual on where
that wagon took your brother.

697
00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:20.126
Like it. Good plan.
And it sounds easy. Right. Rex?

698
00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:23.001
I mean. there's no chance
of death or anything. right?

699
00:40:23.167 --> 00:40:26.084
Well. aside from the multiple
levels of security.

700
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:29.501
unique daily access codes
and a laser retina scan.

701
00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:31.126
it should be quite fun!

702
00:40:31.292 --> 00:40:35.292
- Oh. great. When do we start?
- We already have.

703
00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.501
<i>Dr. Greta Grim.</i>

704
00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:40.709
<i>Tenacious. brilliant. icy.</i>

705
00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:42.917
<i>with only one weakness:</i>

706
00:40:43.084 --> 00:40:45.126
<i>spicy breakfast burritos.</i>

707
00:40:46.251 --> 00:40:49.334
<i>She. and only she. has full access</i>

708
00:40:49.501 --> 00:40:51.917
<i>and can move freely
throughout the facility.</i>

709
00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:57.501
<i>Upon entrance
into the secret corridor.</i>

710
00:40:57.667 --> 00:41:00.792
<i>she is escorted by her two
most trusted lieutenants.</i>

711
00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:04.834
<i>Then she is given the access code
to the computer mainframe.</i>

712
00:41:05.001 --> 00:41:07.542
<i>Remember. the key
to impersonating Dr. Grim</i>

713
00:41:07.709 --> 00:41:09.167
<i>is her confidence.</i>

714
00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:11.292
<i>She is unwavering.</i>

715
00:41:11.459 --> 00:41:13.876
Dr. Grim. wait!

716
00:41:15.334 --> 00:41:17.501
We need your expert advice.

717
00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:20.417
Oh! Uh... not now.

718
00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:23.084
Very busy with the. uh...

719
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:26.709
...secret doomsday
robot submarine thingy...

720
00:41:26.876 --> 00:41:28.459
Oh. no need.

721
00:41:28.626 --> 00:41:32.792
The Secret Doomsday Robot
Submarine Thingy has already launched.

722
00:41:32.959 --> 00:41:34.917
- Wait. Really?
- Indeed.

723
00:41:35.084 --> 00:41:38.542
Now we need your expertise
with freeze-ray laser cannon.

724
00:41:41.584 --> 00:41:43.501
Ah. Um...

725
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:46.084
Try adding more...

726
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:47.834
...ice?

727
00:41:49.459 --> 00:41:51.209
- Oh!
- Oh! Yes. yes. yes!

728
00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:52.977
- Why didn't we think of that?
- Brilliant!

729
00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:57.084
<i>- Good show. my dear.</i>
- That was close.

730
00:41:57.251 --> 00:41:59.751
Okay. Del.
how are those burritos coming?

731
00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:02.084
People. you can't rush delicious.

732
00:42:02.251 --> 00:42:04.792
<i>Del. listen to me.
Dr. Grim must eat a burrito.</i>

733
00:42:04.959 --> 00:42:07.709
<i>Otherwise. Marla's cover
will be completely blown.</i>

734
00:42:07.876 --> 00:42:09.792
I see her!
Uh... she's in my sights!

735
00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:13.001
Oh. I hope your intel's right
about her loving these things. Rex!

736
00:42:13.167 --> 00:42:15.834
<i>Huh. My intel's always right.</i>

737
00:42:16.001 --> 00:42:17.917
<i>Now. lay out the free samples.</i>

738
00:42:18.084 --> 00:42:20.501
<i>and dose them with
the sleep serum I gave you.</i>

739
00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:24.167
I'm on it!
It's sleepy time for Dr. Grim.

740
00:42:26.042 --> 00:42:27.542
Ugh.

741
00:42:27.709 --> 00:42:29.376
I can't open it.

742
00:42:37.376 --> 00:42:39.292
Open. open. open!

743
00:42:42.084 --> 00:42:45.584
Ooh. Spicy burritos! For free?

744
00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:47.667
Delicious.

745
00:42:47.834 --> 00:42:50.001
Okay. Rex.
I'm at the retina scanner.

746
00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:53.542
Tell me that firewall is down.
or there's no way I'm getting in.

747
00:42:53.709 --> 00:42:55.917
Just a moment.

748
00:43:06.459 --> 00:43:09.876
Huh.
Please hurry!

749
00:43:11.251 --> 00:43:12.709
- Guard!
- Oh!

750

There's emergency on level 1!
Report there immediately!

751
00:43:15.709 --> 00:43:18.084
Oh. I'm just an intern!
No. no. no...!

752
00:43:18.251 --> 00:43:19.917
I'll take that.

753
00:43:20.084 --> 00:43:21.751
Don't hurry back.

754
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:28.001

Oh! Retinal scan offline.

759
00:43:45.667 --> 00:43:48.626
<i>First. log in with the access codes

761
00:44:03.626 --> 00:44:04.959
Hmm...

762
00:44:05.126 --> 00:44:07.417
Okay. Got it!

763
00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:14.376
Come on. come on!

764
00:44:14.542 --> 00:44:17.042
Hi. Come on!

765
00:44:18.542 --> 00:44:20.709
Dr. Grim! More ice!

766
00:44:20.876 --> 00:44:23.917
Almost there. C'mon!

767
00:44:24.084 --> 00:44:25.626

772
00:44:41.042 --> 00:44:42.292
Ridiculous.

773
00:44:42.459 --> 00:44:45.459
She does not have... mustache.

774
00:44:45.626 --> 00:44:47.459
Heh-heh-heh.

00:49:49.626 --> 00:49:50.917
There!

868
00:49:51.084 --> 00:49:52.935
- Is that what made them disappear?
- I don't know.

869
00:49:52.959 --> 00:49:55.209
- But I sure recognize this!
- What is that?

870
00:49:55.376 --> 00:49:57.917
Not a what. It's a who!

871
00:49:58.084 --> 00:50:01.126
And I know exactly

872
00:50:01.292 --> 00:50:04.959
Ah... come on!
Let's mo-ti-vate!

873
00:50:05.126 --> 00:50:07.042

00:50:11.001 --> 00:50:13.251
Hey. I should be thanking you.

876
00:50:13.417 --> 00:50:16.376
After all. your bag of Viking coins

877
00:50:16.542 --> 00:50:17.917
is really gonna save my bacon.

878
00:50:18.084 --> 00:50:19.459
Big time!

879
00:50:19.626 --> 00:50:21.084

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:23.709

882
00:50:27.626 --> 00:50:29.709

883
00:50:29.876 --> 00:50:32.042

- Uh! Uh...

887
00:50:39.001 --> 00:50:42.709
I will not spend another nanosecond
with this lower life form.

888
00:50:42.876 --> 00:50:46.126
Arrogant talk coming
from a gutless bounty hunter!

889
00:50:50.626 --> 00:50:52.001
Eh...

890
00:50:52.167 --> 00:50:54.251
Stow ye tempers.

891
00:50:55.876 --> 00:50:58.709
There be a common enemy
facing all of us.

892
00:50:58.876 --> 00:51:00.917
that horrible beastie!

893
00:51:01.084 --> 00:51:02.792
Look around. will ya?

894
00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:05.334
There's a reason
we were all captured.

895
00:51:05.501 --> 00:51:08.917
We're the toughest of the tough.
the baddest of the lot.

896
00:51:09.084 --> 00:51:10.709
Aye.

897
00:51:10.876 --> 00:51:14.209
And there be strength
in numbers.

898
00:51:14.376 --> 00:51:18.167
Oh. I hate to say it.
but the pirate's right.

899
00:51:18.334 --> 00:51:19.834
We can survive together.

900
00:51:20.001 --> 00:51:23.292
After all. who among us
hasn't spit in death's face

901
00:51:23.459 --> 00:51:27.917
100 times in just the last month
and lived to tell about it?!

902
00:51:30.459 --> 00:51:32.959
Oh... yeah!

903
00:51:33.126 --> 00:51:35.542
- Uh...
- Wookoo! Wookookoo!

904
00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:37.709
Yeah!

905
00:51:43.876 --> 00:51:46.459
Aye. no time to waste.

906
00:51:46.626 --> 00:51:49.709
There be some escaping to do.

907
00:51:54.209 --> 00:51:56.917
Ah. yes.
city of the future.

908
00:51:57.084 --> 00:51:58.709
Take it all in. Marla!

909
00:51:58.876 --> 00:52:00.459
- This is amazing!
- Ha-ha!

910
00:52:00.626 --> 00:52:03.334
Pretty wonderful. right?
Am I right? I'm right.

911
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:05.792
Alright. let's do this!

912
00:52:05.959 --> 00:52:08.542
- Whoa.
- Hey. good to see you!

913
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:10.334
Wow. your head looks thinner.

914
00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:12.917
Hey. keep it close.
This shouldn't take long.

915
00:52:13.084 --> 00:52:16.667
- Whoa! This is so cool.
- Marla. Marla.

916
00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:18.584
- Hey. uh. they don't like that.
- Pfft!

917
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:20.167
- Let's go.
- Pfft!

918
00:52:20.334 --> 00:52:22.042
It's like one of those stress balls.

919
00:52:22.209 --> 00:52:24.126
Someone gave me one once.
It didn't help.

920
00:52:24.292 --> 00:52:25.834
Oh!

921
00:52:27.376 --> 00:52:28.959
A club?

922
00:52:29.126 --> 00:52:31.334
Hey. careful. you might
be having a good time.

923
00:52:31.501 --> 00:52:34.334
Hey! Hi! Ha-ha!
What's going on?

924
00:52:34.501 --> 00:52:36.501
I'm not really in the mood
to dance right now.

925
00:52:36.667 --> 00:52:38.501
We're here to see Glinara!

926
00:52:38.667 --> 00:52:39.959
What?! Glinara?!

927
00:52:40.126 --> 00:52:43.042
This is her club.
but... but it's all a front.

928
00:52:43.209 --> 00:52:46.459
She's got her hands
in everything illegal.

929
00:52:46.626 --> 00:52:49.251
including black-market tech.

930
00:52:49.417 --> 00:52:51.959
- Come on.
- O-okay.

931
00:52:52.126 --> 00:52:54.459
I just didn't realize
we were seeing her so soon.

932
00:52:54.626 --> 00:52:56.709
Relax. Marla.

933
00:52:56.876 --> 00:52:59.917
Ha-ha! What's up?

934
00:53:00.084 --> 00:53:03.126
Tell the boss
Del's here to see her.

935
00:53:03.292 --> 00:53:05.042
I have her money.

936
00:53:06.084 --> 00:53:07.292
Uh...

937
00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:09.542
I got a Del down here
askin' to see Miss G.

938
00:53:09.709 --> 00:53:12.084
- No. not Adele. That'd be awesome.
- But what if...

939
00:53:12.251 --> 00:53:14.626
- No. just Del. Yeah. yeah.
- What if we don't have enough?

940
00:53:14.792 --> 00:53:16.417
What are you talking about? Trust me.

941
00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:19.917
You have enough gold
in that bag to pay off my debt

942
00:53:20.084 --> 00:53:23.001
and buy the info we need about Charlie.

943
00:53:23.167 --> 00:53:26.376
Because if you didn't.
we wouldn't get outta here alive.

944
00:53:26.542 --> 00:53:28.001
- Huh.
- Del!

945
00:53:28.167 --> 00:53:30.042
She's ready. Let's go.

946
00:53:30.209 --> 00:53:32.917
- You see?
- Uh... Del?

947
00:53:33.084 --> 00:53:35.792
I really think we should talk
about this first.

948
00:53:35.959 --> 00:53:38.042
Will you stop worrying?
We're perfectly safe.

949
00:53:38.209 --> 00:53:41.292
Deep down. Glinara
is a completely delightful...

950
00:53:41.459 --> 00:53:42.876
Whoa!

951
00:53:43.042 --> 00:53:44.917
Oh. my... Oh.

952
00:53:45.084 --> 00:53:46.792
I want umbrellas in my drinks!

953
00:53:46.959 --> 00:53:48.917
- Hey. are you alright?
- Ow!

954
00:53:49.084 --> 00:53:51.959
Here. let me help you up.

955
00:53:52.126 --> 00:53:54.584
Oh. poor little robot.

956
00:53:54.751 --> 00:53:56.209
Hey. it's okay.

957
00:53:56.376 --> 00:53:59.292
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're not scary. I promise.

958
00:53:59.459 --> 00:54:01.876
Dude! You took quite a spill.
You okay?

959
00:54:03.959 --> 00:54:06.001
Del! Get up here already!

960
00:54:06.167 --> 00:54:08.126
Gotta go. gotta go!

961
00:54:08.292 --> 00:54:10.126
Delightful. huh?

962
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:14.584
There she is. my Glinara!
Look at you!

963
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.501
Give me a couple coins.
I'm gonna need 'em.

964
00:54:16.667 --> 00:54:17.959
Oh. um... here.

965
00:54:18.126 --> 00:54:20.042
You look amazing!

966
00:54:20.209 --> 00:54:23.542
I mean. just as radiant as ever.
Mwah. mwah!

967
00:54:23.709 --> 00:54:25.626
Ah. can the sweet talk. Del.

968
00:54:25.792 --> 00:54:29.001
You know I always glow
during molting season. Hmm...

969
00:54:29.167 --> 00:54:30.751
- Um... Oh!
- Who are you?

970
00:54:30.917 --> 00:54:32.584
A little tight. Um...

971
00:54:32.751 --> 00:54:35.292
- I'm... I'm Marla. Oh!
- Oh. you thought I cared?

972
00:54:35.459 --> 00:54:37.417
- Ha! You're hilarious!
- Ow!

973
00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:40.292
- Now. where's my money. Del?
- Huh!

974
00:54:40.459 --> 00:54:43.667
Please don't make me do
something I don't want to do.

975
00:54:43.834 --> 00:54:48.042
Relax! You're gonna get back
double what I owe you.

976
00:54:48.209 --> 00:54:50.584
Oh! So shiny!

977
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:54.209
Oh. my little Viking gold.
Who loves you more than I do?

978
00:54:54.376 --> 00:54:55.584
- Double? Okay.
- Nobody.

979
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:59.334
- Uh. Del?
- Glinny. I just need some help.

980
00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:03.209
I saw your logo on some high-tech.
disappearing-gizmo thing.

981
00:55:03.376 --> 00:55:05.876
A disappearing... Ah!

982
00:55:06.042 --> 00:55:10.042
Why would I tell you
about illegal cloaking devices?

983
00:55:10.209 --> 00:55:12.751
If I knew. which of course I don't.

984
00:55:12.917 --> 00:55:16.334
Oh... what's that behind your ear?

985
00:55:20.792 --> 00:55:23.209
Del! You. rascal. you!

986
00:55:23.376 --> 00:55:25.542
Robotitron. get over here!

987
00:55:27.501 --> 00:55:30.917
Show me the black-market files.

988
00:55:31.084 --> 00:55:33.292
Uh-huh-huh.
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

989
00:55:33.459 --> 00:55:37.792
Oh. yes. looks like I did sell
cloaking devices. Who knew? Ah...

990
00:55:37.959 --> 00:55:40.126
Oh. Maximus...

991
00:55:40.292 --> 00:55:43.959
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
You mean Emperor Maximus?

992
00:55:44.126 --> 00:55:46.042
- Who's that?
- Oh. Emperor Maximus

993
00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:50.417
is the supreme ruler of Constantinopolis
and my number-one client.

994
00:55:50.584 --> 00:55:54.001
Well. your client has my brother.
and we're going to get him back!

995
00:55:54.167 --> 00:55:56.792
Oh. cupcake.
if Maximus has your brother.

996
00:55:56.959 --> 00:56:00.417
that means he's fighting
in the coliseum tomorrow night!

997
00:56:00.584 --> 00:56:03.917
Fighting? Tomorrow?!
Del. we need to go now!

998
00:56:04.084 --> 00:56:07.084
Forget something?
The rest of my money?!

999
00:56:07.251 --> 00:56:09.542
Okay. okay. Easy. easy.

1000
00:56:09.709 --> 00:56:11.334
I'm a man of my word.

1001
00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:14.709
Marla. the rest
of the gold coins if you will.

1002
00:56:14.876 --> 00:56:17.334
Um. yeah. about that...

1003
00:56:17.501 --> 00:56:19.126
We should've
really discussed this.

1004
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:22.459
Marla? Stop messing around. Let go.

1005
00:56:22.626 --> 00:56:24.542
- You let go!
- Would you...

1006
00:56:24.709 --> 00:56:27.209
- You don't want to do this!
- Oh. yes. I do. I really do!

1007
00:56:27.376 --> 00:56:29.209
No. you... don't!

1008
00:56:30.626 --> 00:56:33.917
What the heck is...
What the heck is this?!

1009
00:56:34.084 --> 00:56:37.042
Is this a spoon?!
Where's... where's the money?

1010
00:56:37.209 --> 00:56:40.792
Del. I'm so sorry.
but... I never had the money.

1011
00:56:40.959 --> 00:56:44.501
Marla. you... you lied to me?

1012
00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:47.709
I had to do everything I could
to save my brother. Even lie!

1013
00:56:47.876 --> 00:56:51.251
I was gonna tell you. I'm... I'm sorry!

1014
00:56:51.417 --> 00:56:55.459
Whap. whap. whap!
Guess you got taken for a ride. Del. Hmm?

1015
00:56:55.626 --> 00:56:57.959
And since you don't have my money.

1016
00:56:58.126 --> 00:57:00.834
it looks like this is your last stop!

1017
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:02.709
Uh. Glinara? Please!

1018
00:57:02.876 --> 00:57:04.501
Hey. c'mon.
We can work something out.

1019
00:57:04.667 --> 00:57:08.667
He has nothing to do with this!
He was just helping me! Please! Oh!

1020
00:57:08.834 --> 00:57:10.834
If I were you. and I'm glad I'm not.

1021
00:57:11.001 --> 00:57:12.542
I'd worry less about your brother

1022
00:57:12.709 --> 00:57:15.292
and more about what I'm gonna
do to the two you.

1023
00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:26.459
- Whoa!
- Toss me the janglers.

1024
00:57:29.209 --> 00:57:31.959
Ugh. The keys. Toss me the keys.

1025
00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:36.167
Thank ye.

1026
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:41.501
- Uh... are they gonna be okay?
- Don't worry.

1027
00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:45.626
They'll wake up in...
12 to 48 hours.

1028
00:57:45.792 --> 00:57:47.084
C'mon! C'mon! Hurry now!

1029
00:57:47.251 --> 00:57:49.501
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Shhh! Keep it down!

1030
00:57:55.959 --> 00:57:57.417
Now's our chance!

1031
00:57:57.584 --> 00:57:58.792
- Ook-Ook. you're up.
- Ook!

1032
00:57:58.959 --> 00:58:00.709
Show us where the fishies swim!

1033
00:58:00.876 --> 00:58:04.167
- Ook. Ook. Ook.
- Well. now that's cute. But no.

1034
00:58:04.334 --> 00:58:07.709

1042
00:58:27.876 --> 00:58:29.459
- Which boat do we take?
- Ha!

00:58:29.626 --> 00:58:33.459
Nah. we be escapin' in style.

1044
00:58:33.626 --> 00:58:36.584
Wow! A real-life pirate ship!

1045
00:58:36.751 --> 00:58:38.376
Not just any pirate ship.

1046
00:58:38.542 --> 00:58:41.792

- Oh! Oh.

1056
00:59:09.376 --> 00:59:12.876
Oh. no! Wake up!

1057
00:59:13.042 --> 00:59:14.709
- Stop!
- Aye!

1058
00:59:14.876 --> 00:59:16.917
We need to set sail. Now!

1059
00:59:17.084 --> 00:59:19.626
- Come on. Captain.
- Come on. wake up!

1060
00:59:19.792 --> 00:59:22.376
Oh. it's no use. He's out cold!

1061
00:59:22.542 --> 00:59:25.709
Oh. no! What do we do?!
Who's gonna sail the ship?!

1062
00:59:25.876 --> 00:59:27.334
- You!
- Me?

1063
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:30.667
Vikings are the most steadfast
sailors in all the land!

1064
00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:32.709
You can sail us out of here. Viking!

1065
00:59:32.876 --> 00:59:35.626
- Ook-Ook!
- Oh. uh. right.

1066
00:59:35.792 --> 00:59:37.834
Get them! Hurry!

1067
00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:42.042
We stand ready for your order.
Captain Charles!

1068
00:59:42.209 --> 00:59:44.959
- Hurry. Viking!
- Uh...

1069
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:49.167
You can do this. Charlie.
Just think it through.

1070
00:59:49.334 --> 00:59:50.917
Ook!

1071
00:59:51.084 --> 00:59:52.834
It's now or never. Captain!

1072
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:56.209
Um... okay!
Let's pull on. uh...

1073
00:59:56.376 --> 01:00:00.376
...that rope. that one and... that one!

1074
01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:05.792
Aye. aye. Captain!

1075
01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:09.959
Ha-ha! Let's cut and run!

1076
01:00:11.501 --> 01:00:12.834
Ook-Ook!

1077
01:00:15.459 --> 01:00:16.959
- Ha-ha!
- Yes!

1078
01:00:17.126 --> 01:00:18.667
- We're moving!
- We did it!

1079
01:00:18.834 --> 01:00:21.542
- Ook-Ook!
- Yes! It worked!

1080
01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:23.709
They're getting away!
Stop them!

1081
01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:25.334
Halt! Stop!

1082
01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:28.251
- That's it! Whoo!
- Ha-ha-ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!

1083
01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:29.626
- We're sailing!
- Whoo-hoo!

1084
01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.542
Yes. we are!
Yeah-ha-ha!

1085
01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:34.042
- Yeah!
- Good instinct. Viking!

1086
01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:38.167
If Marla
could only see me now.

1087
01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:41.626
Um...

1088
01:00:43.626 --> 01:00:45.334
Oh. that almost worked.

1089
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.751
Almost.

1090
01:00:50.334 --> 01:00:52.042
What'd I miss?

1091
01:00:52.209 --> 01:00:54.584
Del. I know
what I did was wrong.

1092
01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.834
How many times can I say I'm sorry?

1093
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:59.792
But we need to work together
if we're gonna get out of this.

1094
01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:01.417
Is someone talking to me?

1095
01:01:01.584 --> 01:01:04.024
I don't know. because I've blocked out
all liars and traitors.

1096
01:01:04.084 --> 01:01:06.334
so I can't hear anything
from people that are jerks.

1097
01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:07.751
Pipe down. you two!

1098
01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:10.126
Now. where is the top destination

1099
01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:12.334
for double-crossers this season?

1100
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:14.542
- Glinara! Slug Muffin!
- Hmm. Ooh.

1101
01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:17.042
The scorching desert
of Pharaoh Dunes?

1102
01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:18.709
Ooh. you are gonna burn!

1103
01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:21.060
- Come on!
- No. no. no! Not there. not there!

1104
01:01:21.084 --> 01:01:24.084
Or maybe the unforgiving.
frigid terrain of Yeti Tundra!

1105
01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:25.709
- Oh. come on!
- No!

1106
01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:29.501
Better yet... Oh!
The volcanoes of Pompeii Plaza!

1107
01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:31.917
Yes!

1108
01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:33.876
No. no! Come on. Glinara. please!

1109
01:01:34.042 --> 01:01:37.501
If you have even one decent bone
in your body. you can't do this!

1110
01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:40.459
I don't have bones in my body.
thank you very much.

1111
01:01:40.626 --> 01:01:42.167
- No. no. no!
- Please! Glinara!

1112
01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:44.917
Buh-bye!

1113
01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:47.334
- Oh. I love this part!
- Del! Ah!

1114
01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:51.834
Huh?!

1115
01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.542
Oh!

1116
01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:56.792
- You saved us. little guy! Thank you!
- Oh. thank you. buddy!

1117
01:01:56.959 --> 01:01:58.876
Robotitron! How dare you?!

1118
01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:01.376
Ha-ha-ha! Ow. Oh. my.

1119
01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:03.459
- Whoa! Ah! Whoa!
- Oh. no. no.

1120
01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:07.501
Go! Hurry up! Get 'em!

1121
01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:10.042
Come on! Let's go. boys!

1122
01:02:10.209 --> 01:02:11.876
Whoa...! Hold on!

1123
01:02:12.042 --> 01:02:13.882
Changing channel.
changing channel. changing.

1124
01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:15.251
Changing.

1125
01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:16.917
Ah! Sharks!

1126
01:02:17.084 --> 01:02:19.626
- No. flowers!
- Flowers!

1127
01:02:19.792 --> 01:02:21.632
Go back to the flowers!

1128
01:02:21.709 --> 01:02:25.376
Oh! Don't let go!

1129
01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:37.792
Ow!

1130
01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:44.626
Oh... yes! Yes! We made it!

1131
01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:46.709
We're alive! We're alive!

1132
01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:49.501
Oh! And now we know
where Charlie is!

1133
01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:51.792
We still have a full day
to get to him.

1134
01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:54.209
We can do this! Oh!

1135
01:02:54.376 --> 01:02:56.876
Is that a fairytale castle?!

1136
01:02:57.042 --> 01:02:59.417
Yes! If we can find help
at the castle. then we can...

1137
01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:05.001
We?! I'm sorry.
I... I keep hearing "we." There is no we!

1138
01:03:05.167 --> 01:03:09.542
Not anymore. Marla!
This little adventure of ours is over!

1139
01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:14.709
- You lied to me!
- Ugh! Del. come on!

1140
01:03:14.876 --> 01:03:17.126
Would you have helped me
for no money?!

1141
01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:19.709
Would I have helped you?
How dare you?

1142
01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:21.292
Probably not.

1143
01:03:21.459 --> 01:03:23.042
I probably wouldn't have helped you.

1144
01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:25.501
But... that's not the point.

1145
01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:30.876
That is the point.

1146
01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:34.792
I mean. is there anyone's life
you don't ruin. Marla?

1147
01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:40.334
Good luck finding your brother!
I really do mean that.

1148
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:44.459
- Del! Del. wait!
- But I also hope you don't find me.

1149
01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:47.501
I can't do this without you. Del!

1150
01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:49.792
- Del.
- Well. fine!

1151
01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:53.501
If that's the way you want it.
Robotitron's gonna help me...

1152
01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.334
...find Charlie.

1153
01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.834
Well. look who it is!

1154
01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:03.292
My little rotten runaways.
How's that taste?

1155
01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:05.001
Oh. oh. oh!

1156
01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:08.834
I see you're taking <i>stock</i>
of your new accommodations.

1157
01:04:09.001 --> 01:04:11.542
See what I did with the words?
Alright. let's go.

1158
01:04:11.709 --> 01:04:13.209
Where are the rose pedals?!

1159
01:04:13.376 --> 01:04:16.167
- This is all my fault.
- Ya think?!

1160
01:04:16.334 --> 01:04:18.167
I just wanted an adventure.

1161
01:04:18.334 --> 01:04:20.959
to have some fun
with my sister for once.

1162
01:04:21.126 --> 01:04:24.667
Marla. I don't even know
where she is.

1163
01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:26.542
I hope she's not in trouble too.

1164
01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:29.751
- Or eaten by a shark.
- What?! Don't say that!

1165
01:04:29.917 --> 01:04:31.626
I'm sorry.

1166
01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:35.084
My sister and I got
into a huge fight.

1167
01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:38.084
I bet... she hates me now.

1168
01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:42.667
I. too. miss my sisters
back in Amazonia.

1169
01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:46.042
The fights we had
amongst ourselves were legend!

1170
01:04:46.209 --> 01:04:49.542
But we loved each other
fiercely as well.

1171
01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:53.834
Out of the way! Move along!
Fresh meat coming through!

1172
01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:57.501
Alright. alright. I'm coming!

1173
01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:59.167
Ugh. Ugh.

1174
01:05:01.251 --> 01:05:02.792
How's my hair?

1175
01:05:02.959 --> 01:05:05.959
You're the missing warriors.

1176
01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:08.084
Secret Agent Rex Dasher.

1177
01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:09.834
- ♪ Rex Dash... ♪
- Oh!

1178
01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:12.959
At your service.

1179
01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:14.834
I was on a mission
to rescue you all.

1180
01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:19.917
And this brute must be - ha!
- Charlie the Viking!

1181
01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:23.376
Ah. your sister Marla
is coming for you. my good man.

1182
01:05:23.542 --> 01:05:25.542
- You know Marla?
- Know her?

1183
01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:27.667
I served side-by-side with her.

1184
01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:30.667
She's battled all manner of deadly foe

1185
01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:32.751
and unspeakable danger to find you.

1186
01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:34.626
Wow.

1187
01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:36.834
Sounds like a true Amazonian!

1188
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:38.417
She'd make a great bounty hunter.

1189
01:05:38.584 --> 01:05:41.167
Ha-ha!
Tell us about this amazing lass!

1190
01:05:41.334 --> 01:05:42.709
Ook-Ook!

1191
01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:44.709
Charlie?
What are you doin'. lad?

1192
01:05:44.876 --> 01:05:48.584
Argh! I need... to find my...

1193
01:05:48.751 --> 01:05:50.417
...sister!

1194
01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:52.751
Stop!

1195
01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:54.751
Emergency! Emperor!

1196
01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:57.459
Ah. are you kidding me?
Now what?

1197
01:05:57.626 --> 01:05:59.751
Oh. my! Where...

1198
01:05:59.917 --> 01:06:03.167
Where did they go?
What am I paying you for?! Get them!

1199
01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.042
Let's go!

1200
01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:06.584
They're on our tail!

1201
01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:09.084
Shuffle. shuffle.
shuffle. shuffle. shuffle!

1202
01:06:10.959 --> 01:06:12.893
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Shuffle. shuffle. shuffle. shuffle!

1203
01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:14.334
Let's go!

1204
01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:16.209
- And heave!
- Look out!

1205
01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:18.167
- Okay. we need to turn!
- Hard left!

1206
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.542
Whoa...!

1207
01:06:29.084 --> 01:06:31.334
We're surrounded!
We're not gonna make it!

1208
01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:33.751
Come on. guys.
we're not done yet!

1209
01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:35.417
Ladies first.

1210
01:06:35.584 --> 01:06:37.126
Tally-ho!

1211
01:06:37.292 --> 01:06:39.652
- Charles. what are you doing?
- Get down here this instant!

1212
01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:41.209
We ain't leavin' ya behind!

1213
01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:43.834
Let me do this. I owe you guys.

1214
01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:47.584
- You're a great warrior Viking.
- You're alright. kid.

1215
01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:51.792
Go! Go!

1216
01:06:56.751 --> 01:06:58.834
Ah... ah...

1217
01:06:59.001 --> 01:07:02.167
Hey. droopy. up.
Up on the corner. Ah...

1218
01:07:02.334 --> 01:07:05.417
You think you're so brave.

1219
01:07:05.584 --> 01:07:07.542
letting your co-stars escape?

1220
01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:10.876
Well. Mr. Big Shot. in one hour.

1221
01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:15.376
it'll be a one-man show where you're
fighting for your life in my arena!

1222
01:07:15.542 --> 01:07:18.792
All... by... your... lonesome!

1223
01:07:28.334 --> 01:07:31.334
You okay. buddy?
You're sounding a little squeaky.

1224
01:07:31.501 --> 01:07:33.001
No. Okay.

1225
01:07:33.167 --> 01:07:35.084
We're going to find help.

1226
01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:38.459
I-I think the castle is... this way.

1227
01:07:39.501 --> 01:07:41.667
Uh...

1228
01:07:42.709 --> 01:07:43.959
This... way?

1229
01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.751
Okay. Okay.

1230
01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:51.667
We gotta be close.

1231
01:07:52.709 --> 01:07:54.542
How long...

1232
01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:56.126
...have we been walking?

1233
01:07:56.292 --> 01:07:59.792
Ah! Whoa! Oof!

1234
01:07:59.959 --> 01:08:01.959
Oh! Ow!

1235
01:08:02.126 --> 01:08:03.626
Argh...!

1236
01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:06.792
Oh. I am so sorry.
Are... are you okay?

1237
01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:09.042
- My arm.
- Let me get that for you.

1238
01:08:09.209 --> 01:08:10.959
- I'm fine.
- Is that better?

1239
01:08:11.126 --> 01:08:13.667
- Yes.
- That was my fault. I...

1240
01:08:13.834 --> 01:08:16.251
Wait a second. No!

1241
01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.251
No. this can't be right!

1242
01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:20.209
We're right back
where we started!

1243
01:08:21.584 --> 01:08:24.876
This can't possibly get any worse!

1244
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.334
Oh. come on!

1245
01:08:41.292 --> 01:08:43.376
Ow!

1246
01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:44.917
What the...?

1247
01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:46.876
- What was that?
- Careful. Careful.

1248
01:08:47.042 --> 01:08:49.376
- Ah...
- Who... who's there?

1249
01:08:55.751 --> 01:08:57.334
Whoa-ho-ho!

1250
01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.209
Ugh. Ow!

1251
01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:00.584
- Wow!
- Who are you?

1252
01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:02.959
Really?
The gown-and-wand ensemble?

1253
01:09:03.126 --> 01:09:06.167
The shimmering glow?
The floating in the air?

1254
01:09:06.334 --> 01:09:08.334
None of that gave it away?

1255
01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:10.917
Hello? I'm a fairy godmother.

1256
01:09:11.084 --> 01:09:12.667
Oh. Ooh.

1257
01:09:12.834 --> 01:09:14.501
Sorry about that.

1258
01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:16.876
No worries. Easy fix.

1259
01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:19.959
Wait a minute.
You're the voice that I heard.

1260
01:09:20.126 --> 01:09:22.209
- Yeah... that was me.
- Well...

1261
01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:25.209
people are usually so excited
to see a fairy godmother.

1262
01:09:25.376 --> 01:09:27.626
they generally
don't hurl things at my face.

1263
01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:30.112
For instance. the bearded guy
I ran into a few hours ago...

1264
01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.126
- Del?
- ...would not stop hugging me.

1265
01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:33.959
You saw Del? Is he okay?

1266
01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:37.084
No. Sadly. the wolves got him.

1267
01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:39.667
- What?!
- Kidding. Kidding.

1268
01:09:39.834 --> 01:09:41.667
Jeez. Calm down. Come on.

1269
01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.709
What kind of a fairy godmother
would I be?

1270
01:09:43.876 --> 01:09:46.501
I gave him a wish
and I sent him on his way.

1271
01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:48.959
- A wish?
- That's what I do.

1272
01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:52.667
I find people who seem lost
and set them on the right path.

1273
01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:54.459
I'm amazing.

1274
01:09:54.626 --> 01:09:57.001
Okay. great! I've got until
sundown to save my brother.

1275
01:09:57.167 --> 01:10:00.126
Can you please use that wand
to zap him back to me?

1276
01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:03.167
Ha! No. My wishes
don't quite work like that.

1277
01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:05.542
I mean. Cinderella got her gown.

1278
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:08.584
but she still had to go
to the ball herself.

1279
01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:12.417
I've tried doing it myself.
But look at me. I'm a wreck.

1280
01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:14.667
Girl. we gotta change that attitude.

1281
01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:18.084
Now. come on. step into my office.

1282
01:10:18.251 --> 01:10:21.334
It's a place
where wishes come true.

1283
01:10:23.334 --> 01:10:25.292
Wow.

1284
01:10:25.459 --> 01:10:27.751
How did I not find this place?

1285
01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:30.417
Sometimes we don't see
what's right in front of us.

1286
01:10:30.584 --> 01:10:34.209
- Wow. wow. wow.
- Also. it's magic.

1287
01:10:34.376 --> 01:10:36.667
There's still time to save Charlie.

1288
01:10:36.834 --> 01:10:40.209

01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:48.959
As Amelia Earhart once said.

1379
01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:51.542
"Adventure is worthwhile in itself."

1380
01:14:54.501 --> 01:14:56.709
It's just something
I used to do. Let... let's go.

1381
01:15:09.334 --> 01:15:12.001
Hey! Who goes there?!

1382
01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.751
- Aha!
- Ah!

1383
01:15:14.917 --> 01:15:16.417
- Huh?
- Hi-yah!

1384
01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:21.417
Walk it off. big guy!

1385
01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:29.584
...was broken by a cartful
of watermelons!

1386
01:15:29.751 --> 01:15:33.334
Let the other guards know
immediately. Go. go. go!

1387
01:15:33.501 --> 01:15:35.376
We need to blend in.

1388
01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:38.251
Hmm...

1389
01:15:42.126 --> 01:15:46.209
Let's go. Ready. Ready!

1390
01:15:46.376 --> 01:15:49.959
Love the disguise. buddy. but. uh.
you still stick out like a sore thumb.

1391
01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:53.126
Stay put. I'll be back for you
once I get Charlie.

1392
01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:54.584
Danger. danger.

1393
01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:57.167
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

1394
01:15:57.334 --> 01:15:59.417
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye-bye.

1395
01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:03.542
- Not if I can help it.
- ...that fits this description?

1396
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:06.542
They are wearing a backpack
with a sword sticking out of...

1397
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:08.584
Do you mean like that?

1398
01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:11.167
Hey! Hey. you!

1399
01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:13.001
Stop at once!

1400
01:16:18.001 --> 01:16:21.667
Guards! I spotted an intruder
inside our very city!

1401
01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:23.792
Go now! Go!

1402
01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:36.292
Charlie?

1403
01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:39.292
Oh... Charlie?!

1404
01:16:39.459 --> 01:16:41.417
Oh!

1405
01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:43.834
Charlie!

1406
01:16:57.126 --> 01:16:58.626
Hey. chop-chop! Let's go!

1407
01:16:58.792 --> 01:17:00.459
Bring me the stepstool!
Take it! Come on!

1408
01:17:00.626 --> 01:17:02.066
- No way! You take it!
- You take it!

1409
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:03.917
- It's not my job!
- Take it right now.

1410
01:17:04.084 --> 01:17:05.602
- I'm not taking it.
- I am letting go!

1411
01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:07.001
- My hands are in the air!
- Do it!

1412
01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:09.417
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes!

1413
01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:25.084
- Maximus!
- Oh! Charlie?

1414
01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:27.501
Oh!

1415
01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:35.001
- Whoo!
- Maximus! Maximus!

1416
01:17:35.167 --> 01:17:37.292
- Maximus!
- Maximus! We want Maximus!

1417
01:17:37.459 --> 01:17:40.917
Ha-ha! Aw. you're all cheering
for me and I love it!

1418
01:17:41.084 --> 01:17:43.501
I love it. I love it. I love it!

1419
01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:46.501
Make sure I'm outta here before
any of this riffraff can touch me.

1420
01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:48.084
And now...

1421
01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:51.876
...the moment
you've all been waiting for!

1422
01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.334
I give you...

1423
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:57.459
...Charles the Destroyer!

1424
01:18:04.001 --> 01:18:05.459
Ah...

1425
01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:10.501
Huh... uh...

1426
01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:16.126
I. Emperor Maximus
of Constantinopolis.

1427
01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.042
declare the games...

1428
01:18:19.209 --> 01:18:21.126
...open!

1429
01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:22.751
What?!

1430
01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:26.834
Oh! Hey! Who do you think...
Oh! Oh-ho!

1431
01:18:30.792 --> 01:18:33.584
- Uh...
- Oh! Ah! Hey!

1432
01:18:37.042 --> 01:18:39.584
Uh...

1433
01:18:39.751 --> 01:18:41.667
- Wait!
- Yah!

1434
01:18:41.834 --> 01:18:44.792
Huh?

1435
01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.417
Marla?

1436
01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:49.251
Marla! Oh!

1437
01:18:49.417 --> 01:18:51.042
- Ooh!
- Oh. Charlie!

1438
01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:52.959
Thank goodness I found you!

1439
01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:56.126
You're the knight!
You're really the noble knight!

1440
01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:58.292
What a treat.

1441
01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:02.126
We have a special guest
for tonight's show!

1442
01:19:02.292 --> 01:19:03.709
Don't worry.

1443
01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:06.334
You can all pay extra for it
on the way out.

1444
01:19:06.501 --> 01:19:08.417
Now. release the beast!

1445
01:19:18.001 --> 01:19:20.393
Here he comes. here he comes.
here he comes. here he comes.

1446
01:19:20.417 --> 01:19:22.292
here he comes. here he comes!

1447
01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:25.126
Um... Marla?

1448
01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:27.834
Alright. Charlie. we got this!

1449
01:19:36.626 --> 01:19:39.126
Marla. is that a T-Rex?!

1450
01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:42.001
Charlie... run!

1451
01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.251
Ha-ha! Turn around!

1452
01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.959
He's behind you!

1453
01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:58.209
Charlie. catch!

1454
01:20:04.501 --> 01:20:06.626
Stay away from my brother!

1455
01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.792
Ah! Ah!

1456
01:20:29.667 --> 01:20:33.042
Hey! I think you're part
of my carpool.

1457
01:20:33.209 --> 01:20:35.667
No... way! Del!

1458
01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:39.292
Who ordered a food truck?!

1459
01:20:39.459 --> 01:20:41.792
- La-la-la-la-la-la!
- Hold on!

1460
01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:44.501
Let's make this dino... sore.

1461
01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:47.876
- Wah-wah-wah.
- Come on. it wasn't that bad!

1462
01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:04.126
Excellent!

1463
01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:07.626
Great timing! Oh. it's so good
to see you guys!

1464
01:21:07.792 --> 01:21:10.084
Buckle up.
I'm getting us outta here.

1465
01:21:10.251 --> 01:21:13.042
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me.

1466
01:21:13.209 --> 01:21:14.643
- I met a fairy godmother.
- Hurry up!

1467
01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:16.876
- Del. eyes on the road!
- And she gave me a wish!

1468
01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:20.292
Come on. you prehistoric pea-brain!
Finish them!

1469
01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:22.751
- Del...
- ...for a thousand breakfast burritos!

1470
01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:24.959
- So I paid Glinara back...
- It's gaining on us!

1471
01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:26.751
- Del. focus!
- Double!

1472
01:21:26.917 --> 01:21:29.251
And she let me use
her transporter to get back here!

1473
01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.584
Hold on back there!

1474
01:21:31.751 --> 01:21:33.709
Argh! Oh!

1475
01:21:34.917 --> 01:21:37.667
Ah! Guys! I got a plan!

1476
01:21:47.584 --> 01:21:49.084
Come on!

1477
01:21:49.251 --> 01:21:52.334
Del. we're in position.
Are you ready?

1478
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:54.376
Ready! Let's go!

1479
01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:58.042
Okay. brave Viking.
this one's for Mom and Dad.

1480
01:21:58.209 --> 01:22:00.417
Let's do it
like we always used to.

1481
01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:03.667
It's time to take down this guy
with the...

1482
01:22:03.834 --> 01:22:06.626
- Duo...
- Slingshot!

1483
01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.709
Go. Marla!

1484
01:22:15.209 --> 01:22:17.167
Catch me. Charlie! Catch me!

1485
01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:19.334
Oh! Yes!

1486
01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:26.167
- Oh.
- Marla. I don't think it worked!

1487
01:22:26.334 --> 01:22:29.584
Ha-ha-ha!
Finally! The big finale!

1488
01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:44.917
You don't see that every day.

1489
01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:49.167
- Awesome! Way to go!
- Oh. yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1490
01:22:52.084 --> 01:22:55.334
What the heck is going on?! Oh!

1491
01:22:55.501 --> 01:22:58.126
Guards. seize my prisoners!

1492
01:23:05.292 --> 01:23:07.709
Sorry we're late.

1493
01:23:07.876 --> 01:23:10.334
Had to do a bit of vanquishing
before we arrived.

1494
01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:13.167
Oh. yeah! We bad!

1495
01:23:13.334 --> 01:23:15.417
Oh! How dare you all?!

1496
01:23:15.584 --> 01:23:18.834
Why. if I wasn't all the way
up here on this balcony. I would...

1497
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:21.417
- You'd what now?
- Oh!

1498
01:23:21.584 --> 01:23:23.501
Believe me. we wanted a fight.

1499
01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:27.084
but your soldiers ran away so fast.

1500
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:29.709
Captain. I... I didn't see you there.

1501
01:23:29.876 --> 01:23:33.459
Uh. guards? Anyone? A little help?!

1502
01:23:33.626 --> 01:23:36.834
Yer days of swindlin'
and plunderin' are over.

1503
01:23:37.001 --> 01:23:39.126
Maxi. old boy.

1504
01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:41.334
Toss this urchin in the brig!

1505
01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:43.251
Aye-aye. Cap'n.

1506
01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:45.334
Oh! No. No. no. no!

1507
01:23:45.501 --> 01:23:47.251
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah!

1508
01:23:47.417 --> 01:23:49.876
Hey. hey. hey. hey!
Please don't hurt me. Ah!

1509
01:23:50.042 --> 01:23:52.917
Oh. no fair.

1510
01:23:53.084 --> 01:23:54.667
Ha-ha! Alright!

1511
01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:57.126
Whoo-hoo!

1512
01:23:57.292 --> 01:23:59.709
Captain Bloodbones.
you got your crew back!

1513
01:23:59.876 --> 01:24:02.709
Aye. Charles!
I gave them a choice:

1514
01:24:02.876 --> 01:24:05.334
be eaten alive
by a school of piranha.

1515
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:07.126
or work for me!

1516
01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.917
Two of them chose the piranha!

1517
01:24:11.584 --> 01:24:14.501
Wow. Marla.
look at all these people.

1518
01:24:16.792 --> 01:24:20.917
Oh! Who are probably hungry...

1519
01:24:21.084 --> 01:24:23.917
...for some food from a food truck!

1520
01:24:24.084 --> 01:24:25.459
Burritos!

1521
01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:28.584
Meatballs and spicy burritos!

1522
01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:31.042
Whoo-hoo!

1523
01:24:31.209 --> 01:24:35.626
Come on down to Del's Belle
for the finest spicy burritos...

1524
01:24:35.792 --> 01:24:38.001
- Let's go home. Marla.
- Sure.

1525
01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:40.751
There's just one last thing
I have to do.

1526
01:24:44.334 --> 01:24:45.667
Yah!

1527
01:24:45.834 --> 01:24:47.959
You're no one's prisoner anymore.

1528
01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:50.584
You can fly anywhere you want.

1529
01:25:06.126 --> 01:25:08.626
Viking and knight!
Viking and knight!

1530
01:25:08.792 --> 01:25:10.709
Viking and knight!

1531
01:25:10.876 --> 01:25:12.834
Yeah!

1532
01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.417
Thanks for your help. everybody.

1533
01:25:16.584 --> 01:25:19.292
It was an honor. my friend.

1534
01:25:19.459 --> 01:25:21.751
And a privilege to work with you.
Agent Marla.

1535
01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:23.501
Ook-Ook...!

1536
01:25:23.667 --> 01:25:26.001
Good Ook-Ook.

1537
01:25:26.167 --> 01:25:29.126
- Ook-ook-ook.
- I guess... this is goodbye.

1538
01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.459
Whoa!

1539
01:25:32.626 --> 01:25:34.334
Ah...

1540
01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:36.834
I'm gonna miss you. Marla.

1541
01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:40.542
- Oh...
- I mean. I won't miss being chased.

1542
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:43.334
shot at. almost eaten alive.

1543
01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:45.917
That... that was... terrifying.

1544
01:25:46.084 --> 01:25:47.917
But I will miss you.

1545
01:25:48.084 --> 01:25:51.834
Without you. I would never have
realized that cooking completes me.

1546
01:25:52.001 --> 01:25:56.126
It's who I am. I mean. I'm also
a very good singer. but I... I should cook.

1547
01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:57.751
Thank you. Marla.

1548
01:25:57.917 --> 01:26:00.501
Thank you. Del. I'll miss you. too.

1549
