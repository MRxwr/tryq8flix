00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:25.904
- Same dream?

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.198
I bet I can make you forget about it.

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.095
Just wait. just one. just wait.

00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:14.655
- What?

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:18.367
- Hold on. let me get safe.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.983
-  So we've seen
Wall Street completely change

00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:29.999
because of these huge multi-nationals.

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.967
and then while we're getting
handouts from the feds.

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.275
There used to be an abundance
of comedy instances.

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:38.060
They were all competitors.
they all got incredible prices.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.927
but now there's no
competition for great rates.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.398
So we have this terrible pricing.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:44.653
and this just keeps
happening over and over--

00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:45.486
- Shit.

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:14.230
-  Ari Reinholtz's office.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.340
- Hey Lynn. this Vincent Jamison.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.183
Is Ari in?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.050
-  No. I'm sorry. Mr. Jamison.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.610
He's in his car. I just
got off the phone with him.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.140
Would you like his voicemail?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.053
- No. that's okay.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.650
Listen. Lynn. I know I
scheduled this meeting today.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.293
but could you tell Ari I can't make it?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.920
I double booked and
didn't sync my calendars.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.353
I would love to reschedule
with Ari. and just Ari.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.930
- Well. Mr. Jamison. I'm
sorry. but I should tell you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.770
for the conversation I just
had with Mr. Reinholtz.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.770
that he's instructed me
to note on the calendar

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.940
that the meeting is now mandatory

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.593
for all scheduled attendees.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.970
Mr. Jamison?

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.330
- Yeah.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.290
-  I can still
message him if you'd like.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.403
- No. Lynn. that's okay.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.333
Thank you. Lynn.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.233
- Vincent.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.263
You need to get past it. it's time.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.370
There will never be a child between us.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.493
I will not go through it again. I cannot.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.463
I'm lonely with you. Vincent.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.403
I need you to understand that.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.470
I have scheduled an
appointment for us today

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.700
with a counselor whom I do
not know. but comes highly--

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.056
- I am not gonna sit in some office

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:22.120
with a colleague of yours!

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.350
Today?

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.860
Come on. Roni!

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.160
Today?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.907
I have a very important
meeting with Ari today.

00:05:28.907 --> 00:05:31.063
and I got to take the car over to Bobby's.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.320
- I scheduled it during lunch.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.570
I expect you to be there.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.823
- Fine.

00:06:01.023 --> 00:06:03.106
- Ari Reinholtz's office.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.750
No. sir. I'm sorry.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.450
He's about to step into a meeting.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.990
I would love to forward
you over to his voicemail.

00:06:13.422 --> 00:06:15.857
No. he is fully booked.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:27.503
-  Come on.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.653
Time to be a man.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.133
He's ready to see you now.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.980
- He's ready to see you now.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.183
Mr. Jamison.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.473
Mr. Jamison?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600
Ari's ready for you.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.810
- Why RNS Investment?

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.740
Because we have both
the skill and the means

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.510
to manage this volume of debt.
yet we will be positioned

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.290
to reap the maximum benefit
with well. a little risk.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.630
Is this outside our risk
tolerance threshold?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.463
Yes.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.190
But I've been in touch with a contact

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.248
at North Texas Financial.

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:14.930
- Wait. wait. Vince. wait.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.873
Sit for a second.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.680
Listen. Vince.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.070
I realized that when you
requested this meeting

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.373
you had certain expectations in mind.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.450
But I have to say. I was as of then.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.490
completely unaware of. and
I'm being generous here.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.597
the lackluster performance
of Hector here's department.

00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:44.450
- I told you about your serial
over aggressive bullshit.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.580
Jamison. and financials back that up.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.440
- What the hell are you--

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.420
- Did you think I was going to
let you fucking backdoor me?

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.770
Book this meeting with
Ari and just not show?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.294
Drag my fucking department
down. go over my head!

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.533
- Shut the fuck up!

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.503
Look. Vincent.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.730
I'm not gonna drag this out.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.530
We're letting you go. unfortunately.

00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:11.066
- What?

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.733
Wait.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.300
Look. Ari.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.610
I have always kept Suarez in on the loop

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.890
on every single deal I made.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.170
He knew exactly--
- Always is bullshit!

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.240
All that rank lowering crap you pushed.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.690
I told you I didn't want
to see any more of that.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.893
- Ari.

00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:34.960
Come on look. what the
hell am I supposed to do?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.013
I'm fucking 43 years old.

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:44.348
There has to be another way.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.870
Okay. another option.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.133
- Not in my department.
- Get out Hector!

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.313
Step outside.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.373
Vince.

00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:05.300
I'm sorry.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.113
Suarez here. he went to Mosha
before he came to me first.

00:09:10.163 --> 00:09:12.943
There's nothing I can do.

00:09:12.943 --> 00:09:15.460
I don't even understand
why this bothers you.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.040
If I was sitting on a
trust fund like you are.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.840
I wouldn't work a day in this place.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:26.300
Look. if you're still looking
for another salt mine.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.133
Call that guy.

00:09:28.724 --> 00:09:29.641
Headhunter.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.223
- Ari. wait.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.520
Can you at least hold off

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.910
putting this out there
for a couple of weeks?

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.840
It's gonna be hard enough out there

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.463
without the fired stigma.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.003
- Yeah.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.933
Yeah. I think we can do that.

00:09:59.987 --> 00:10:02.793
And look. take as much time
as you need it here. okay.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.633
I'm sorry Vince. give my best to Roni.

00:10:11.204 --> 00:10:14.770
And when you're done in here.
go clean out your office.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.453
Don't touch the computer.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.350
You'll be escorted from the
building in a half an hour.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.550
-  Hello. this is Bibi.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.770
- Bibi my dear. how are you?

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.810
- Well. I suppose that all
depends on what you have to say.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.093
Your guy is on board?

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.310
- I pushed Ari. I really did.
and he likes the concept.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.106
He says it's the direction
we need to be moving in--

00:11:59.106 --> 00:12:00.150
-  But?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.572
- But he isn't ready to
move in that direction now.

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:03.405
-  Vincent.

00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:04.480
- That we're too over leveraged

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.460
for a capital outlay of that magnitude.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.293
blah. blah. blah. blah. blah.

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.880
But look. it's really about the hit

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.390
we took when the market tanked.
and not just financially.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.797
Between you and I. Bibi.
the feds have been. the SEC.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.190
they've been difficult.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.333
and he just doesn't
want the heat right now.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.580
Bibi?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.440
-  I have to say. this
isn't what I was expecting.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.026
What you led me to believe and--

00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:36.100
- I understand. but can
we still do the deal.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.410
You guys just have to take the lead.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.290
I'm sure we can put--

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.620
- What you let me believe. Vincent.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.920
and what I've been priming
partners for here at Texas

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.860
is that RNS Investment
was going to be doing

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.460
the heavy lifting and we
would be just filling the gap.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.640
- Yes. and that was when--

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.473
-  Given that fact and the fact

00:12:51.473 --> 00:12:54.030
that I have yet to see any
drill down ratings data.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.590
we won't be doing any deal.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.720
I'm sorry. but detailing
ratings of the debt

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.740
would have to make sense
for us to even consider

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.950
acquiring it alone.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.960
Get me the data I need that
shows the numbers work for us.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.610
that this credit union isn't holding

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.950
a bunch of bottom feeding
bullshit. and we can reconsider.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.960
Can you do that?

00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:15.841
That tells me all I need to know.

00:13:15.841 --> 00:13:17.424
Take care. Vincent.

00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:02.200
- So?

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:05.378
- To so.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.773
What. Roni?

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.743
I can't have a drink anymore?

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.750
I mean. I just...

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.353
The session.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.073
- Exactly.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.953
So?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.003
- I'm sorry. okay?

00:14:36.003 --> 00:14:40.040
I just had a very shitty day.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.463
- I told you exactly what
I needed this morning.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.820
I made myself impeccably clear.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.860
and yet you still chose not to show up.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.260
- I didn't choose.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.910
Okay. I told you. I had a very shitty day.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.800
with Ari and everything. and I lost...

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.870
A deal fell through.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.730
- You consistently don't show up for us.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.702
- Well. what the fuck did you expect?

00:15:06.702 --> 00:15:08.640
What did you expect?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.770
You made this appointment. not me.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.210
You didn't think about what I had to do.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.100
my time or my schedule.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.380
- You are a no-show for us. Vincent.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.990
Not just this. all the time.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.740
When it comes to us. you
consistently don't show up.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.860
- I am sorry about today. I am.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.390
I did mean to come today.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.223
I did. Roni.

00:15:32.517 --> 00:15:34.340
- I told you the way
that I felt this morning

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.570
and you still refused to respond.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.570
- I know what you said this morning

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.350
and I still do want to make us work.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.030
- It would be better
if you simply admitted

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.740
your lack of interest in us.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.055
- That's not true. Roni. it's not.

00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:50.500
Look. no excuses. I am sorry.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.083
Schedule it again. okay?

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.900
Schedule it again. and I'll show.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.511
I swear. I will. I will.

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:00.511
I will show.

00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:15.510
Maybe you won't be quite so lonely

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.525
if we had a baby.

00:16:17.525 --> 00:16:18.870
- Get off me. get off!

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.556
- What the fuck. Roni?

00:16:20.556 --> 00:16:21.953
- What the hell is wrong with you?

00:16:24.222 --> 00:16:27.030
- There is nothing wrong with me.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.380
-  No. no. no. that's bullshit.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.930
I mean. it's all about the heart.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.830
If you know the heart. you know the woman.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.640
if you win the heart. you win the woman.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.610
-  You're both wrong.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.420
Feminine mind is a difference--

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.253
- Bullshit.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.033
I say she's unfathom-ing.

00:16:49.033 --> 00:16:50.636
-  I hold.

00:16:50.636 --> 00:16:52.323
I thought you were
bringing in the car today.

00:16:52.323 --> 00:16:54.330
- I'll bring it by tomorrow.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.000
And it's unfathomable.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.573
-  Maybe get a dictionary.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.420
- Guys. wait a minute.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.038
Just hold. damn. let me think a minute.

00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:03.138
- Need some more time?

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.143
Maybe save up a little
more money or nerve.

00:17:07.143 --> 00:17:09.790
or maybe you want to come
back in a couple of weeks

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.563
and we'll play next time.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.160
-  Call him.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.120
-  Call him. bitch.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.810
-  Oh!
-  Oh!

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.843
- Money don't mean shit if
you got a fucking trust fund.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.990
- That's why you lose and I win.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.823
- Oh are you saying you win

00:17:28.823 --> 00:17:30.140
because you're smarter than us?

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.820
Fuck you man.
- Smarter than you.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.910
that's for damn sure.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.700
- Oh. come on. man.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.560
- I play poker every day.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.340
What. did you think I just come here

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.930
every few weeks to play with you guys?

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.310
- What the hell. you don't play every day.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.690
- Every day.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.320
I have to look suckers in the eyes

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.720
that are much smarter than your sorry ass.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.758
- Oh. so I'm sorry now. right.

00:17:48.758 --> 00:17:49.730
- That's not nice to say. man.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.010
- Who have a lot more money on the line

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.830
and know if they're bluffing.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.650
- Oh. so you've got some secret life

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.520
as some fucking card shark?

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.650
- No dumb ass.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.170
Debt. collateralized debt.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.830
And every day I look
these clowns in the eyes

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.480
and I have to know if they're bluffing.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.720
If they're pushing me
millions in bullshit.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.727
or if it's legit. and I
do it every fucking day.

00:18:10.727 --> 00:18:13.640
and I was damn good at
it. damn good at it.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.370
What do you do. Mitch?

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.640
Dig fucking ditches?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.500
-  Oh come on.
-  Dude!

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.340
- What the fuck. man?

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.690
Come on V. now you're
being a fucking prick.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.970
- Yeah. that's too far.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.803
Come on.

00:18:26.537 --> 00:18:28.043
- So you want to play the next hand?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.257
Are you in or are you out?

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.043
- So anyway.

00:18:45.193 --> 00:18:48.143
you were saying something about
women being like an engine.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.850
- A difference engine. like in computing.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.460
Only built to evaluate resources
as it relates to needs.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.580
her needs. and then she
calculates her decision

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.302
based on those factors.

00:19:02.302 --> 00:19:03.460
- That sounds like bullshit.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.498
- That's some double-tug shit talking--

00:19:05.498 --> 00:19:09.570
- Hold on a second now.
let's hear the genius out.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.030
He might have something.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.286
Go on. too.

00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:13.960
Go on.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.973
Enlighten us.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.590
- Say a couple of cave chicks
are sitting around a campfire.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.860
and you three clowns show up

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.760
just coming back from the hunt. right?

00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:29.113
And old Keith here has a rabbit.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.190
Mitch. he just has a couple
of scrawny squirrel nuts

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:38.029
or some shit.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.370
But Bobby. Bobby walks up

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.130
with a great big old side of mammoth meat.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.613
- The chicks know I
pack serious meat. baby!

00:19:48.613 --> 00:19:50.270
- Man. shut up.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.160
- Now. who do you think those cave chicks

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.460
are gonna want to be with?

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.363
Their need. food. fur.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.793
clothing. defense.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.360
They look at the three of you.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.833
they evaluate the difference.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.333
and they go with Bobby every time.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.273
- I'm sorry Vincent. it doesn't
explain something though.

00:20:14.273 --> 00:20:16.894
- Yeah. what's that?

00:20:16.894 --> 00:20:19.334
- If you're right about all this.

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:21.660
what the fuck is Roni doing with you?

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.880
- What?

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.600
- Beautiful. gorgeous. successful shrink?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.110
She doesn't need your money.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.050
- What I'm saying is that love

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.470
is a subordinate need.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.087
- Oh. listen to this
guy. subordinate need?

00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:36.550
- Just like it is with every other woman.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.410
- Every woman. including Roni?

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.720
- Look. I already said it.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.350
but you need to keep Roni out of it.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.850
- Well shit. that's it.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.210
I'm with Keith then.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.550
I think you're a full
of shit. arrogant prick.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.452
- Wait a minute. I
didn't say that exactly.

00:20:48.452 --> 00:20:49.285
-  Damn. what you on?

00:20:49.285 --> 00:20:51.307
- Gentlemen I think it's about the heart.

00:20:51.307 --> 00:20:54.280
And if there was a subordinate anything.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.200
it's 'cause you're not
doing it for her anymore.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.033
-  Whoa. hey!

00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:58.130
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Vince!

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.500
- Shut the fuck up!

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.947
- First man that comes around
the does do it for her.

00:21:01.947 --> 00:21:04.230
she gonna kick your sorry to the curb.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.193
- Come on V. sit down. man.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.193
Sit down.

00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:18.323
Relax. man.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.100
First. you don't know
a motherfucking thing

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.020
about me and Roni.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.263
- Oh. you'd be surprised
what I know. Vince.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.420
- Second. if you did know.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.733
you'd know there was a prenup in place.

00:21:31.733 --> 00:21:34.880
And the prenup says that
if she messes around.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.713
she gets nothing.

00:21:35.713 --> 00:21:37.410
If she walks. she gets nothing.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.070
And that prenup is rock solid.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.353
So love or no. I promise you.
she's thinking about that.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.130
- Vince. unless you can swap
out that rock solid prenup

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.320
for a rock solid cock.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.864
Roni's gonna hump the first motherfucker.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.538
-  Hey hey. Vince!

00:21:55.538 --> 00:21:57.130
- Just do it Vince!

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.047
The first man that comes
right on the desk for her.

00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:02.260
and she'll kick what's so
subordinate to the curb.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.023
Get off me. man. get off me!

00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:04.856
Come on!

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.770
-  Stop talking shit. Mitch.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:07.883
Shut your mouth!

00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:12.824
- Shit.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.953
Oh. damn.

00:22:17.037 --> 00:22:18.610
Put your money where your mouth is.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.447
- Shut the fuck up.

00:22:20.447 --> 00:22:22.840
- Come on. put your money
where your mouth is.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.987
Mr. Love Subordinate. rock
solid prenup. trust fund

00:22:24.987 --> 00:22:26.630
is all I need motherfucker.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.290
- What the fuck are you talking about?

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.510
- Two months.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.700
I'll bet you Vince. in two months.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.453
she'd damn near anybody held.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.950
Pretty boy here could
have Roni cheating on you

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.337
and throwing away her so-called needs.

00:22:40.337 --> 00:22:42.130
- Fuck you fat--
- That's fucked up!

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.403
- Well. are you in. or are you out?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.447
Oh. what's wrong?

00:22:50.447 --> 00:22:52.403
It's a rock-solid prenup. right?

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.750
Afraid her difference
engine will break down?

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.650
- Oh. come on. man!

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.270
We're supposed to be
friends. what the hell?

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.310
- Look man. I would never.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.240
All right. I couldn't!

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.540
- Well shit. there you go.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.053
Look at the silver spoon.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.456
So he don't even want to do it.

00:23:09.456 --> 00:23:11.160
He wouldn't try that hard.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.510
So what do you got to lose?

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.016
- Stakes.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.403
- 10 Gs.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.073
- Fine.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.220
Fuck you.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.096
- Look Vincent. I am not.

00:23:32.096 --> 00:23:32.929
- Hey.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.720
I'll cut you in for half
of what I'm getting.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.080
and considering what you're
already getting out of it.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.207
Hell. you're already getting more than me.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.240
- That's some bullshit. Mitch!

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.971
What the fuck was that all about. man?

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.607
- Come on over here.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.163
Close the door.

00:24:59.312 --> 00:25:01.574
Look at me.

00:25:01.574 --> 00:25:06.031
Look at me!

00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:07.583
Look at me!

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.863
There are two things you
must always understand.

00:25:18.214 --> 00:25:23.214
You will never be a man until
you make your own money.

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:27.491
Because.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.040
you can't live off of me.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.223
Not and be a man.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.163
Your old man.

00:25:40.013 --> 00:25:41.427
You must father a family.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.163
A legacy.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.733
And this

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.543
is the price of a clean start.

00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:32.418
-  Hello. this is Barbara Conrad.

00:26:32.418 --> 00:26:33.625
Please leave a message.

00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:35.291
- Bibi. hey.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.743
Listen. I'm going back
over the ratings data.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.320
I have talked it over with Ari and Mosha.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.380
and they are fine with
me providing it to you

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.363
strictly for your personal review.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.293
I can get it to you
tomorrow. midday latest.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.120
I'm sure you'll agree
after you've reviewed it

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.993
that we can move forward.

00:27:03.139 --> 00:27:03.972
Okay. so.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.613
look forward to talking to you tomorrow.

00:29:08.047 --> 00:29:08.880
Fuck it!

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.890
- What's the ETA here. Bobby?

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.878
I got some place I gotta be. man.

00:29:22.878 --> 00:29:23.980
- I don't know. man.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.413
Like 30. 40 minutes. I don't know.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.150
How long has it been knocking like this?

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.480
British piece of shit.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.926
- Couple of weeks.

00:29:31.926 --> 00:29:33.290
- Well. you should have got to me sooner.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.570
'cause now you got a
shit-load of problems.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.500
Bullshit thermostat sticks.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.210
It could be a busted water pumping pillar.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.760
Cooling reservoir is all right.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.422
But whatever it is. I'ma give
you a good deal though. V.

00:29:45.422 --> 00:29:47.060
But not too damn good. you know.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.640
'cause I got to make a
little something too myself.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.947
And it's probably the whole reason

00:29:50.947 --> 00:29:54.113
why I'm still at bootleg
ass. backyard mechanic.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.253
Too many favors.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.933
- I let that mess with Mitch
last night get out of hand.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.830
I never should've done that.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.003
- Fuck Mitch. fuck him!

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.860
He's got no right calling
you an arrogant prick. what?

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.730
Just because you got money?

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.563
That's bullshit.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.900
Your old man had money.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.920
but you didn't go to some
rich through private school.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.200
You put yourself through
fucking Dominguez Hills.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.220
just like the rest of us.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.812
And at least you finished.

00:30:22.812 --> 00:30:25.288
unlike Mitch and yours truly.

00:30:25.288 --> 00:30:26.688
But that's beside the point.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:32.340
Point being. you worked
shitty part time jobs.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.350
busting your hump. just
like the rest of us.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.397
but you became successful
more than the rest of us.

00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:38.203
and he fucking hates that.

00:30:39.993 --> 00:30:42.080
- Just I was already pissed off.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.630
Roni got me all wound
up with her bullshit.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.560
- What?

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.120
With the kid thing again?

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.060
- Yeah.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.690
- V.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.123
Come on man. you gotta let that shit go.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.830
- What?

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.090
- Well. yeah man. I mean
it's her wound right?

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.490
As men. we don't know how
traumatizing it is to lose a baby.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.853
We may think we do. but
we really don't know.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.660
Come on. how old are you V?

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.140
Trust me. the 16 and 18 I got at home.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.830
you don't want to start at my age.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.080
You'd pretty much be an old man

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.200
right around the time they're acting

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.430
like a rebellious-ass teenager.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.770
You don't want that.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.000
You just got to accept the fact

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.990
that you and Roni might
not ever have kids.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.823
and I think it's--

00:31:20.823 --> 00:31:23.330
- Shut the fuck up. Bobby.
just shut the fuck up!

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.493
Shut the fuck up and fix the fucking car.

00:31:28.823 --> 00:31:29.656
- Wait a minute.

00:31:29.656 --> 00:31:31.373
- You talk too much. Bobby.

00:31:31.373 --> 00:31:33.373
- What the fuck is wrong with you man?

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.300
Fuck man. I'm trying to
give you friendly advice

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.740
and you're gonna talk to me like that?

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.980
- I don't need your advice.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.780
You fix cars.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.163
So fix the fucking car.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.520
- You know what. V?

00:31:48.638 --> 00:31:51.156
You're not an arrogant
prick 'cause you got money.

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:52.683
You're just an arrogant prick.

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:56.573
Fix your own damn car.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.928
- Hello?

00:32:13.928 --> 00:32:15.336
-  Get out of the car

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:17.236
and walk across the street.

00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:18.069
- Okay. but where--

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:21.154
-  Just get out.

00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:31.244
Walk across the street.

00:32:36.106 --> 00:32:38.689
Turn left. walk down the drive.

00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:46.178
Once you get to the first alley. stop.

00:32:52.494 --> 00:32:56.447
Turn right and walk to the
third garage door on the right.

00:32:56.447 --> 00:32:58.280
and knock three times.

00:33:33.255 --> 00:33:35.088
- I'm Prophyte.

00:33:35.088 --> 00:33:36.588
Were you followed?

00:33:37.493 --> 00:33:39.993
-  I don't know.
I wasn't really looking.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.953
- Are you a cop?

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.343
- No. I'm not a cop.

00:33:45.343 --> 00:33:46.743
- Well. you look like a cop.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.123
How'd you find me?

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.160
- You're kidding. right?

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.240
Need a data recovery specialist.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.150
contact Prophyte Craigslist.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.150
- Oh snap. I never took that ad down.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.470
That was last year's shit. man.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.970
Last year's. I got a new going on now. OG.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.070
Papers. IDs. driver's licenses.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.170
All that illegals need to
get from here to there.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.890
- Do you still do data recovery?

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.880
- Yeah. of course.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.117
Come on.

00:34:36.062 --> 00:34:37.479
You got the data?

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.013
What is it?

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.083
- Some files.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.055
I lost the password.

00:34:53.055 --> 00:34:53.970
- Oh.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:56.280
Oh yeah?

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.543
Whatever. man.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.693
So how long is this gonna take?

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.493
- Finished.

00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:13.050
Not just some script kiddie.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.660
True crypt derivation. man.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.487
Half the kids on a school
could have cracked that.

00:35:16.487 --> 00:35:18.393
and they're dumbasses.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.520
Anyway. 400 bucks.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.493
I take Bitcoin.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.793
Or fucking PayPal. yes?

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.190
-  But that's not the thing. see?

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.293
It's 40 years right out of
high school. down the drain.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.210
-  Down the drain.
why do you say that?

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.103
-  Why do I say that?

00:35:42.103 --> 00:35:44.640
There's no work. that's why.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.126
They're moving everything to Canada.

00:35:46.126 --> 00:35:49.350
or Australia or even frigging Texas.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.910
Jackasses down there.
use some illegal kid.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.370
Gets his hand blown off.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.173
They just bring in another.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.080
- Gus. listen. while
I very much would like

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.010
to help you gain perspective on this.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:03.030
I do need to remind you that
today is typically my day off.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.970
So if we continue. my
billable rates will be higher.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.890
- No. I know. but I got
a lot left in the tank

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.193
and I'm not ready to hang them up.

00:36:48.761 --> 00:36:52.011
- Vince. these numbers are impressive.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.010
But the client's group doesn't know

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.040
they're undervaluing the debt.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.330
How could they not know?

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.810
- Well. that's the thing.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.643
I think...

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.540
I know they know. but
they have to dump it.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.300
They just want it in the right hands.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.750
- And you're the right hands?

00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:11.323
- We are the right hands. baby.

00:37:13.513 --> 00:37:15.550
- And you've made no
insurances or guarantees?

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.383
- No. no. no.

00:37:16.383 --> 00:37:17.850
Nothing explicit and nothing concrete.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.680
Look Bibi. this is what
relationship I cultivated

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.400
for a number of years.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.830
Now. they trust me to do as
well for them as I possibly can.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.350
- Well. they're an easy sale.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:31.763
Rated way below risk.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.893
All right. let's do this.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.310
Call the credit union
so you can get them here

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:50.220
in the next couple of days

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.620
before I have to go back to Texas.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.210
Let's see if we can do this deal.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.043
- Sounds great.

00:37:56.475 --> 00:37:57.725
I will be in touch. Bibi.

00:37:58.563 --> 00:37:59.396
- Okay.

00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:04.347
-  Good to see you. Bibi.

00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:05.180
- You too.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.860
-  Hey. what's up?

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.350
-  Hey. you got
time for some coffee?

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:13.873
Maybe we can chat.

00:38:13.873 --> 00:38:16.408
In the cafe in your building.

00:38:16.408 --> 00:38:19.579
We can talk about a few things.

00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:21.030
-  Okay. sure.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.680
Say in about 45 minutes?

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.980
-  See you there.

00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:29.039
- No joke.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.290
- V!

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.720
Hey man. it's good to see you.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.710
Yeah. it's good to see you too. man.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.093
What's going on. what are you doing here?

00:38:38.093 --> 00:38:40.450
- I had an audition. man.
up on the fourth floor.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.560
Stopped in here for coffee

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.010
and I bumped into this pretty lady.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.970
- Literally.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.670
Practically knocked the
coffee right out of his hands.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.840
- Well. I'll leave you two to whatever.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.680
No. it's fine. man.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.820
No worries.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.653
- You sure?

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.220
- Keith might be--
- Testing.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.510
- Testing at the network
for a new TV series.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.920
- Yeah.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.753
Great man.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.760
When do you have this test?

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.770
- I don't know.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.700
I have to wait and see

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.650
about how they felt I did upstairs.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:23.350
- I see. so you may not
actually be testing.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.150
- Well. I think I did pretty good.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.930
but we'll just have to see.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:31.070
- And he's doing a play
here downtown at LATC.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.220
and I just saw you in that.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.270
what was it?

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.227
- Soldier thing. the cruise movie.

00:39:35.227 --> 00:39:36.510
- No. no.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.343
- Captain Morgan's?

00:39:37.343 --> 00:39:38.960
- No.
- Men's warehouse.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.340
- No. it was--

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.810
- Calvin Klein.
- Yes. yes.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.781
You're doing very well.

00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:49.114
- What are you. his groupie?

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.480
- No. I just think success

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.670
deserves some acknowledgement. praise.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.700
- See. that's why I may
need your services. doc.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.390
- Her services?

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:02.730
You?

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.197
- No seriously. I mean. if
it's all right with you.

00:40:04.197 --> 00:40:06.193
- You don't need Vincent's approval.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.510
- I'm being serious here. Vince.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.840
A lot of people see the work actors do.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.740
Like if we get a big gig.
or we're working a lot.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.220
and they think that we
think we're the shit.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.293
The big success.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.340
But man. I don't feel like a success.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.960
It never feels like it's enough.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.920
or it's like the next gig
or the one we're working on

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.123
is gonna be the last.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.203
So that's all.

00:40:32.544 --> 00:40:34.380
And then the hundreds of rejections

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.233
just to get that one yes.

00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:39.861
It's stressful. man.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.630
Seriously. I'd love to contact you.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.617
squeeze in a few sessions if we can.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.970
- Okay. I'll tell you what.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.700
I don't know what my
immediate schedule is like.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.610
but give my office a call tomorrow morning

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.360
and we'll see what we can work out.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.460
- Well. I'll leave you two to do

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.560
whatever it is that husbands and wives do.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.480
Thanks. you'll be hearing from me soon.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.620
See you later. man.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.453
- Yeah. man.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.153
-  He has really changed.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:17.967
- What?
- Yeah.

00:41:17.967 --> 00:41:20.250
Out of your whole crew of friends.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.420
Keith has always struck
me as the most immature.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.673
but he seems to have it
the most together now.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.630
- The most together?

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.640
He just hired a psychologist.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.440
- Well. being able to ask
for help when you need it

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.840
is having together. Vincent.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.590
- Point taken. I'm sorry.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.373
Look Roni. I've been thinking. feeling.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.297
maybe we can turn things around.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.063
I'm willing.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.717
If we're both willing--

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.320
- Dammit. it's the DA's office.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.700
They need me on an
emergency conference call.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.640
I'm sorry. I can't.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.701
- It's fine. go. do what you gotta do.

00:42:09.701 --> 00:42:10.960
We'll talk later.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.180
- Maybe tomorrow morning.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.210
I'm sure that they'll have
me at the Parker Center late.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:15.093
- Fine. go.

00:42:30.703 --> 00:42:32.593
- Vincent.

00:42:32.593 --> 00:42:34.190
Vincent.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.023
- What's wrong?

00:42:35.023 --> 00:42:37.473
- There's somebody here. I
heard somebody in the house.

00:42:37.473 --> 00:42:38.306
I heard someone!

00:42:43.804 --> 00:42:44.721
- You sure?

00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:48.184
Okay. stay here.

00:43:10.324 --> 00:43:11.747
- Vincent. don't!

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.600
- Any proceeds due PGCU
through a securitization

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.353
would become available as
early as three to six months.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.613
- If you're saying this is
the deal we're looking for.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.690
I'm willing to go along with it.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.523
- Great.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:19.480
Then all that's left is
whatever due diligence

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.463
you have left in Wichita.

00:45:20.463 --> 00:45:22.810
I'll get things organized in Texas.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.340
and bring you and your team in.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.543
and we'll get everything
signed and in motion.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.313
- Well. I've got to get out of
here and get to the airport.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.319
You've got the sunshine. but
you've got the traffic too.

00:45:36.783 --> 00:45:37.733
- That's the truth.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.510
- Ms. Conrad. it was nice to meet you.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.210
I look forward to seeing you soon.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.253
Vincent.

00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:49.538
- Okay.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.350
- Well. I'm glad to see
you finally woke up.

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:02.340
because we have to get
you a ticket to Texas too.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.020
My board wants to meet you. Vince.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.880
Rumor is they're looking
to open an LA office

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.340
and if you are ready to leave RNS.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.713
provided that this thing
with PGCU goes well.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.993
I will be willing to give
you a recommendation.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.480
- Yeah?

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.080
- Yeah.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.783
That's fantastic. Bibi.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.910
- Now. shall we grab a drink?

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:27.163
A celebrate Terry toast?

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.350
- As much as I want to say yes.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:36.183
and I do very much want to say yes.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:40.470
there's a dinner I should probably do.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.563
- Okay. next time.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:45.793
Maybe in Texas.

00:46:46.994 --> 00:46:47.827
- Maybe.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.123
- Okay. see you soon.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.773
-  Hello?

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.443
- What would you like for dinner tonight?

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.490
-  What?

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:13.427
- Dinner tonight. what would you like?

00:47:13.427 --> 00:47:15.823
I'm cooking. I'm thinking
a little coq au vin.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.800
some sauteed artichoke.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.143
but whatever Madam desires I will provide.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.370
-  All right. what is going on?

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.363
- We're celebrating.
-  Vincent?

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.240
Celebrating what?

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:36.490
- The deal I just closed and my new job.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.270
-  Okay.

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.340
Clearly I've missed a
few chapters of the book.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.210
you need to catch me up.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.853
- Just dinner. okay?

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.630
We'll talk about everything else as well.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:50.463
So it's a date?

00:47:52.198 --> 00:47:53.394
-  It's a date.

00:47:53.394 --> 00:47:54.853
- Great.

00:47:54.853 --> 00:47:56.823
I'll see you then.

00:49:26.022 --> 00:49:26.855
Roni!

00:49:37.435 --> 00:49:38.830
- What?

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.530
- Just wanted to know
if you want some coffee.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.580
- No. I'm already running
late. but thank you.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.150
But I do want to hear about your deal.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.740
and you're leaving RNS?

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.693
I have to be sitting in
Voir dire in 20 minutes.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.910
- No. it's fine.

00:49:54.839 --> 00:49:56.700
We can talk about it later.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.900
You will have time. right?

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.940
- You're angry about last night.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.350
You're angry. aren't you?

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.503
- No. we can talk later.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.230
- Okay.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.670
- How's your mom?

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.620
- Oh. she's fine.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.920
She's got the flu. I think.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.790
But if she's calling me

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.400
then she's obviously worried about it.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.400
Gonna be checking in on her again later.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.860
I also will most likely be working late

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.030
at Parker Center all week.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.060
but I really am sorry about last night.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.493
And I do. Vincent. wanna
hear what is going on.

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:28.763
- Okay.

00:50:28.763 --> 00:50:30.630
Just tell your mom I said feel better.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.463
- I will.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:51.893
-  I've got you.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.120
Wait. that's not fair.

00:50:57.551 --> 00:50:58.968
- What's up. man?

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.653
Smells all right.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.420
- I know you didn't come here
looking for a handout. right?

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.253
Not you.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:12.423
- Not for some B-grade barbecue. no.

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.943
Look. at poker.

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:26.773
that was wrong. okay?

00:51:28.274 --> 00:51:32.880
We said some things. or at
least I said some things

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.503
I shouldn't have. I didn't really mean.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:39.700
I've been drinking too much.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.413
and I had some personal baggage.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.393
- Okay. some things were said. so?

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.200
- We all go a long way back. man.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.160
to let some bullshit like
the other night jam us up.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.160
-  You're it!

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.903
- Yeah. why let that happen?

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.913
- So. hard feelings?

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:12.840
- No. I don't have any feelings about it.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.053
Hard or otherwise.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.360
- Good man. good.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.950
'Cause I mean. some of the
things I said about you

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.420
and all that stuff about Roni.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.523
and getting her to cheat with Keith.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.853
All that. you know I
didn't mean that. right?

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.253
You know that.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.483
We can just let all that
just be bullshit. right?

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.603
It's in the past.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:46.500
- Kelsey. Chelle. you guys
go in the house for a second.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.800
- But we just got out here.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.913
- I know. go on. do what you're told.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.570
- Sorry about my language. man.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.180
I forgot they were out here.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.760
My bad.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.013
- Fuck you. Vince.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:12.940
- What?

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.783
- You heard me.

00:53:14.856 --> 00:53:16.840
The fuck you think you are?

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.430
Come strolling in my backyard.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.670
I'm trying to enjoy my family.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.310
You acting all entitled and shit

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.000
only 'cause you want me
to let you off the hook.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.793
You don't think I know why you're here?

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:28.710
Fuck you. Vincent.

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.500
You made the bet.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.260
- The bet is bullshit. Mitch.

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.133
We know that.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.510
I came here trying to make things right.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.290
We've been friends too long. man.

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.230
I'm here trying to smooth things over.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.670
Oh yeah. we've been friends too damn long.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.510
and all the while you've
been a smug. arrogant prick.

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.220
Always trying to get things your way.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.560
Well. not this time.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.083
Not this fucking time.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:58.057
We made a bet and you're
gonna stick to it.

00:53:58.057 --> 00:54:00.838
- Forget the bet. Mitch.

00:54:00.838 --> 00:54:03.743
What. you think you're gonna
get something out of this?

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.430
There's no payout for you
on this. fucking farce!

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:11.620
I'm not giving you anything.
I'm not paying shit.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:13.120
You're paying me now. Vincent.

00:54:15.834 --> 00:54:17.250
- Come on. man. what the hell?

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.840
So we had a little argument.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.673
Bullshit.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:29.170
You tell Keith to back
off. leave Roni alone.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.170
or I just may tell him the hard way.

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.590
- Vince. you're always beating your chest

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:38.780
about your so-called success.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.690
Lording it over us. how superior you are.

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.303
Always telling us you
know more than any of us.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.053
Well. Keith is gonna find out
just how much you really know.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.920
This is happening. Vince.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.480
Keith is fucking Roni.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.315
There's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.330
-  Hello. you've reached
Veronica Wills-Jamison.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:33.853
Please leave me a message.

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:41.310
- Hey. I just thinking about you

00:57:42.261 --> 00:57:44.580
and wanted to see if we could catch up

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:46.003
before I leave town tonight.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:52.200
But I know you're very
busy fixing people's lives.

00:57:55.383 --> 00:57:56.216
So.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.283
anyway. there we go.

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:25.850
Bibi. hey.

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:27.580
-  I hope you're not
on that plane. Vincent.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.570
In fact. I know you're
not. so don't bother.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.190
What's going on?

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.513
-  You lied. Vincent.

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:35.203
- What?

00:58:35.203 --> 00:58:36.640
-  You had an obligation by law

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.500
to disclose to me truthful and
accurate ratings information

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.800
regarding the state of
those debt obligations.

00:58:43.396 --> 00:58:46.450
- Listen Bibi. those numbers are accurate.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.260
at least to the best of
my knowledge they are.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.211
-  Vincent don't!

00:58:49.211 --> 00:58:51.130
Don't make the worse for yourself.

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:52.690
you've got bigger problems.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:55.090
You manipulated the numbers to
make the ratings look better

00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:56.240
than they actually are.

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.000
Furthermore. you failed to mentioned

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.180
you were fired from RNS Investments.

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.970
We are no longer interested in this deal.

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:03.680
and then PGCU placed a hardball.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.380
if there's a portion of liability
you will be under the bus.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:07.213
- Bibi!

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.003
- Oh!

01:01:58.218 --> 01:01:59.132
Oh my god!

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.549
- Oh shit. Vince!

01:02:01.729 --> 01:02:03.128
- How could you?

01:02:03.128 --> 01:02:04.420
How could you do this?

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.253
- Listen man.

01:02:05.253 --> 01:02:06.530
I'm sorry. all right?

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.806
This never should have happened.

01:02:07.806 --> 01:02:08.639
- Put the gun down.

01:02:08.639 --> 01:02:09.472
- I'm sorry. all right?

01:02:09.472 --> 01:02:10.305
I'm sorry!

01:02:10.305 --> 01:02:11.690
- Just shut the fuck up!

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:12.523
- I'm sorry!

01:02:12.523 --> 01:02:13.700
- Shut the fuck up!

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.690
You're goddamn right it
never should have happened.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.913
You're goddamn right!

01:02:23.009 --> 01:02:24.700
- Oh my god. okay.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.830
Please Vincent listen to me.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.203
Okay. focus on my words.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.130
I am so sorry.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.240
I am so sorry. I never
meant for this to happen.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.033
I am so sorry. Vincent.

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.960
You need to believe me.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.113
I am so sorry.

01:03:03.456 --> 01:03:06.623
Oh my god Vincent. what have you done?

01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:10.178
-  Oh shit.

01:03:13.313 --> 01:03:16.130
- It's okay. Vincent. we
can still make this right.

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:17.370
We can fix this.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:18.473
We can still fix this.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.066
- It's not okay. I just
fucking killed Keith.

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:24.134
It is definitely not okay!

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.143
- Listen to me. we can still fix this!

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.023
Nobody knows that he was here.

01:03:34.495 --> 01:03:35.400
-  What are you--

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.263
- Listen!

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.030
Nobody will come looking for him here.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.153
We just have to get rid of the body.

01:03:43.259 --> 01:03:44.092
- What?

01:03:44.092 --> 01:03:45.703
- The body. we have to get rid of it.

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:48.413
- Keith.
- Yes. honey.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:50.743
Vincent. we have to.

01:03:52.239 --> 01:03:53.220
I'm sorry.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.380
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.390
I never meant...

01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:01.670
The thought of you going
away forever for this.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:02.983
or worse. I couldn't.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.813
Please Vincent. we have to do this.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.151
Vincent!

01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:12.683
- What do I have to do?

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.500
What do we need to do?

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:18.983
- More sheets.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.460
- So where are we going?

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.330
We can't just keep--

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.040
- I don't know. Roni. I don't know.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.340
Just let me fucking think.

01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:59.321
- Vincent. when I worked
on the Ellison case.

01:04:59.321 --> 01:05:01.583
- I don't need to. I don't know where--

01:05:01.583 --> 01:05:02.923
- Just listen to me!

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:08.380
- When I worked on the Ellison case.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:12.110
I developed a very good
relationship with the DA's Office.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.103
- I am not turning myself in.

01:05:14.974 --> 01:05:17.220
- What I presented to them

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:20.370
in an effort to obtain a
conviction was invaluable

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:23.233
and it led them to the
remains of the victim.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.983
but they couldn't obtain a conviction.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.390
because the body had been
dumped in the High Desert.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.940
and the remains had been
so scattered by scavengers

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.610
that they didn't have enough evidence

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.573
to determine the cause of death.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.613
-  Let go of it.

01:05:55.882 --> 01:05:57.499
All right?

01:05:57.499 --> 01:05:59.082
- Yeah. I think so.

01:06:04.942 --> 01:06:06.523
Should we get a shovel?

01:06:06.523 --> 01:06:08.306
- What the fuck. Roni?

01:06:08.306 --> 01:06:09.700
Does it look like I brought a shovel?

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.983
- My hands were a little
full. just like yours.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.383
Man. I'll get a shovel.

01:06:17.401 --> 01:06:19.401
What the hell am I getting a shovel for?

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:24.243
I thought the whole idea
was to bring him out here

01:06:24.243 --> 01:06:26.690
and let the animals

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.973
do whatever.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.567
- Don't want to make it
too hard for them. right?

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.380
- We can't go back the way we came.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.900
at least we shouldn't.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.197
We could take Oxford to the 101.

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:13.070
Maybe we can.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.573
- Maybe you should just
keep your mouth shut.

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:26.720
- Vincent. give me the gun.

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:32.730
- What?

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.313
You don't trust me?

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.943
Are you being ironic?

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:40.190
Think this is how it all ends.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:43.760
the old marital murder
suicide on the high--

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.593
- Stop it!

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:51.720
That isn't it.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.380
Okay. it's not what.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.090
- Mitch and Bobby know.

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:55.923
- What?

01:07:56.893 --> 01:07:57.893
- They know.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.720
About Keith. about you
and Keith. they know.

01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:03.410
- How could they know?

01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:04.793
We didn't tell anybody.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.613
- At poker. Mitch and I made a bet.

01:08:10.865 --> 01:08:12.750
Oh God. Mitch bet that

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.333
Keith could get you to sleep with him.

01:08:19.736 --> 01:08:22.153
- And you went along with it?

01:08:25.623 --> 01:08:26.790
How could you?

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.653
- Maybe I thought you wouldn't do it.

01:08:33.606 --> 01:08:34.450
- We'll talk through this. okay.

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:36.083
we'll just figure this out.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.860
- I have to leave.

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.813
- Baby.
- I have to leave. I do.

01:08:50.552 --> 01:08:51.385
- What?

01:08:58.577 --> 01:09:02.410
- I have to leave. I have to go.

01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:03.868
- Vincent. no.

01:09:03.868 --> 01:09:06.610
- When Keith turns up missing.

01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:08.857
I'll be the first person
they come looking for.

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.693
- Vincent.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.853
I am so sorry.

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:17.959
I should have been
stronger. I should have.

01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:19.228
- No.

01:09:19.228 --> 01:09:20.173
Roni stop.

01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:25.560
Everything. all of this is on me.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.393
All of it.

01:09:29.641 --> 01:09:32.474
I never should have made that bet.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.093
I never should have put
you in that position.

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:39.423
And I am sorry.

01:09:41.028 --> 01:09:44.028
- I can't believe this is happening.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.340
I'm coming with you.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.330
- If you came with me.

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:50.950
you would look just as guilty as I am.

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:52.263
and I don't want that.

01:09:55.675 --> 01:09:56.508
I'm sorry.

01:09:59.549 --> 01:10:02.520
I'm not gonna be able to get much money

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.570
out of the ATM. okay?

01:10:04.412 --> 01:10:06.033
Eight. 900 bucks.

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:10.860
including what we have
in the safe at home.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.883
I will contact you somehow.

01:10:14.883 --> 01:10:16.603
I will tell you how to send me.

01:10:18.389 --> 01:10:19.813
- Where are you gonna go?

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.613
- South.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.353
- What. Mexico?

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.990
-  Yeah. I guess.

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.950
- How?

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:29.210
They check IDs at the border.

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:32.060
- Don't worry about it.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.763
I know a guy.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:36.606
A kid really.

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:45.743
When all this settles down. baby.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.333
I will find a way for us.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.393
I promise.

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:04.740
- Give me the gun.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
- What. why?

01:11:08.942 --> 01:11:13.192
- If you get caught. they
can't find you with that.

01:11:24.356 --> 01:11:25.189
- Okay.

01:11:27.008 --> 01:11:28.584
All right.

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:29.417
You okay?

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:52.370
Hey.

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:53.353
- Here. doc.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.693
It's all there.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.253
Driver's license. social. passport.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:04.483
All cash.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:09.940
Hey.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.584
If you get caught. don't
snitch like a little bitch.

01:13:13.584 --> 01:13:14.917
You feel me. OG?

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.960
-  Nothing electronic.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.283
No email. computers.
phone. texts. none of that.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.483
All of it can be traced.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.890
Get a PO box. use cash to pay for it.

01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:44.450
Tell them not to mail you
the link to the invoice.

01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.250
you'll come in to pick it up.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:49.103
Give them fake home
address just to be safe.

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:51.663
Memorize my address.

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:54.460
Don't write it anywhere.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.910
When you write me. send
whatever cash you can.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.360
Nothing too large. it'll
draw too much attention.

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:04.110
And never use the
mailboxes near the house.

01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:05.993
Mix them up. keep them random.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.950
I'm sorry for all this.

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:11.283
I love you and I miss you.

01:15:12.767 --> 01:15:14.683
I'm desperate to see your face again.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.163
Be sure to burn every
letter after you've read it.

01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:30.929
All my love. Vincent.

01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:58.980
- Now is not the best
time to leave the room.

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.843
Sit.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:11.093
I apologize for my earlier rudeness.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.430
I did not give you my name.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:15.923
I am Chano.

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:18.573
You call me Chan.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.270
- Nice to meet you. Chan.

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:22.153
- Likewise.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.253
Okay. okay.

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:29.003
Well.

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.223
All right. oh. excuse me.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.810
I wish I could tell you that my visit

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:41.053
is strictly motel hospitality.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.013
but it is not.

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:49.860
Allow me to explain to you the rules

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.780
of the stay for your time here.

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:04.370
From the hours of 5:00 in
the morning to 12:00 noon

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:08.950
and 6:00 in the evening
to 10 o'clock at night.

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:13.650
you are forbidden to leave
the room without my assessor.

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:16.940
Unfortunately your border patrol

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.973
has taken a particular
interest in this area.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:24.498
- Yeah.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:28.953
- Now the phone.

01:17:29.857 --> 01:17:31.307
The phone is a prepaid phone.

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.560
- Yeah. it's a prepaid phone.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560
It's a payphone.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.460
- It's a prepay me first phone.

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.333
then you prepay the phone phone.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.273
- Okay look. I'm not
gonna be using it anyways.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.113
- Your rent is due the first of the month.

01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:57.513
No exceptions. none.

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.233
You will get two meals a day.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.763
No complaining about the food.

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:11.612
Kidding.

01:18:11.612 --> 01:18:13.523
You can complain about
the food if you want to.

01:18:13.523 --> 01:18:14.753
it's okay.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.487
But it's better if you don't.

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:24.003
The rest. you will
discover as you go along.

01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:30.810
Now. these are the rules that
will govern your life here.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.823
Do you understand them?

01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:38.223
- Yeah.

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:41.547
-  But it is becoming
more difficult here.

01:18:41.547 --> 01:18:42.963
and I am concerned.

01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:47.390
They found evidence of
Keith's blood in the bedroom.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.760
I told them he'd cut himself
helping you move furniture.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.523
but I don't think they believed me.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.570
The detectives have been by three times

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:56.940
and continue to ask the same questions.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.683
Have I heard from you. and
where you might've gone.

01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:02.560
I gave them the same answer every time.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.263
No. and I don't know.

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:06.760
I've told them you were flying to Texas.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.040
but never came home.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.710
They said that they're
gonna come back again

01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:14.793
and that they may want me
to come downtown with them.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.763
I know what they may mean.

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:22.270
Worse Vincent. I'm not the
only one they're talking to.

01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:23.260
- I told you.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.760
The last time I saw him was
here. I was fixing his car.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.810
We were bullshitting about
the same old bullshit.

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:29.770
and that was it.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.053
Haven't seen him since.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.600
I mean. you got to ask yourself. right?

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.433
What do you do when you find out

01:19:35.433 --> 01:19:37.403
one of your friends is banging your wife?

01:19:38.622 --> 01:19:40.173
You might get a little pissed.

01:19:40.173 --> 01:19:43.103
So you're the cop. you tell me.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.873
-  Vincent. I think
they know about Keith and me.

01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:51.920
I didn't mention it the first
few times they came out.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.020
but I think they know.

01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:56.180
I'm scared. Vincent.

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.360
I think they're gonna arrest me.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.590
I know how this works.

01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:02.243
If they bring me in. I
believe they will arrest me.

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:06.553
I'm not sure how. when I'll
get to write you again.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:10.113
All my love. Roni.

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:18.456
- Senior.

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:28.383
Well. it's not exactly
like a pool or beachfront.

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:36.300
You are a smart man. what do you do?

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.850
You are lawyer?

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:39.380
Doctor?

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:40.530
- Neither.

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:45.397
I worked in the financial
industry. investments. bonds.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.483
- So you are a money man. huh?

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:52.763
This is not so bad.

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:57.295
You have a special person.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.003
Who care for you.

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:03.843
Is the one who puts the
money in the letters.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:07.953
No?

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.030
- Yes.

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.863
That is true.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:15.677
- I thought so.

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:18.432
- But now.

01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:21.063
You're stuck.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.630
Huh?

01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:25.263
You are to between Scylla

01:21:27.378 --> 01:21:28.545
and Charybdis.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.280
right?

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.130
- Why do you say that?

01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.963
- The letter.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:39.533
Eight months now you read over and over.

01:21:45.191 --> 01:21:47.858
- The person who's been writing.

01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:50.953
they're in trouble. I think.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:53.890
because of me.

01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.120
- And now.
- And now.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.803
you have not heard from
them for eight months.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:07.560
The last time you pay me the
rent was eight months ago.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.760
- Listen. Chano.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.773
- No. no. no. no.

01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:15.283
I break my rule for you.

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:19.610
I let you stay here for so long

01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:22.293
without pay because I trusted you.

01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:26.150
But this trust does not last forever.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:29.210
And your outstanding
debt is outweighing it.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.313
You are a money man.

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.543
I'm sure you understand what I am saying.

01:22:34.691 --> 01:22:36.070
- Chano.

01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:39.900
I will have the money soon. I will.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:44.070
It's just taking a little long. okay?

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.610
I'm sure it's all just being worked out.

01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:48.080
It's just a matter of a few weeks.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:48.930
- And you believe this?

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.490
- Yes.

01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:51.709
I do.

01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:53.260
- Well. the fact is.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.623
if you do not pay me soon.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:01.203
this is going to be
very difficult for you.

01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:09.863
- Oh and until you pay me.

01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:14.000
you will receive only one meal a day.

01:24:33.028 --> 01:24:34.445
Where's my money?

01:24:35.661 --> 01:24:36.566
Where is the money?

01:24:36.566 --> 01:24:38.024
Give me the American money?

01:24:38.024 --> 01:24:39.143
- I don't have any. it didn't come!

01:24:39.143 --> 01:24:40.900
What the fuck?

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.100
You know it didn't come.

01:24:44.524 --> 01:24:45.824
- You have to pay. senior.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.613
It better come today. or
tonight you have a big problem.

01:25:34.677 --> 01:25:36.010
- No money came?

01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:38.373
- No package.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.513
No money.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.483
- How do I know you
haven't been taking it?

01:25:48.917 --> 01:25:50.293
How do I know that?

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.603
- This I will forgive you.

01:25:57.222 --> 01:26:00.067
due to the delicate
nature of your situation.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.753
Do you remember when you first come to me?

01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:08.213
Everyone answers to someone.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.573
You will drink with me.

01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:36.223
To of all of life's great weigh stations.

01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:41.055
and to those whom they tally.

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:49.636
Drink.

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:51.471
Drink!

01:27:05.685 --> 01:27:08.540
The person who I answer to

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:11.133
is the owner of this fine establishment.

01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:14.297
He's my cousin. my
.

01:27:16.048 --> 01:27:16.881
Yes.

01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:19.453
Drink.

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.150
I know that you have in your life

01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:37.230
a person who you would do
anything for. sacrifice for.

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.503
Is not this the measure of a man?

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.730
How much he's willing to do for his family

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:50.083
and for the ones he loves?

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.273
Drink.

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.693
I could talk to my cousin.

01:28:06.548 --> 01:28:07.381
to my .

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.730
and he make an arrangement for you.

01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:16.573
You know how to handle money. finances.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.853
But he would value you. yes.

01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:22.723
Of course.

01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:28.603
that life has its costs.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:33.120
But your life would not be your own.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.167
You would not be your own man.

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.930
Everyone and everything that you knew.

01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:41.130
you will leave behind.

01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:43.070
You will never see ever again.

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:47.923
You must decide what man you want to be.

01:28:54.247 --> 01:28:55.080
Take.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.963
I'm tired of drinking.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.423
Tomorrow you will leave.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.330
One way or another.

01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:17.983
North or south. I don't care.

01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:28.843
What kind of man do you want to be?

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.823
You decide. amigo.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:43.780
-  Hello. my name is Elena.

01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:44.763
How may I help you?

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:49.430
- Listen. I'd like to
place a person to person

01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:53.818
collect call to the us for Bobby Diaz.

01:29:53.818 --> 01:29:55.680
-  And what is the number?

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.347
- It's 213 256 2262.

01:30:00.777 --> 01:30:02.227
-  And who is calling?

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.200
- An old poker buddy.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.435
-  Where are you?

01:30:08.435 --> 01:30:09.268
-  I'm in Mexico.

01:30:09.268 --> 01:30:10.101
-  Mexico?

01:30:10.101 --> 01:30:11.960
-  I need you to come and get me.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.670
-  I don't know. V.

01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:16.990
I can't just drop
everything I'm doing here.

01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:18.010
-  Bobby. come on.

01:30:18.010 --> 01:30:18.843
I don't know what else to do.

01:30:18.843 --> 01:30:20.880
-  Okay. okay. listen.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.233
Listen V. tell you what.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.920
is there a bus station
or something nearby?

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.760
-  Yeah. I think so.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.080
-  Okay. get there and call me.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.590
I'll buy you a ticket.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.744
It's the best I can do. man.

01:30:31.744 --> 01:30:33.635
-  Okay.

01:31:54.303 --> 01:31:56.390
- So just tell her you're
in the car. and that it?

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:57.223
- Yeah.

01:31:58.291 --> 01:31:59.810
And that I want to see her.

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:03.320
- I do this. you tell
me everything. right?

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.880
Because I can't be getting
caught up in this shit.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.003
- I'll tell you. I promise I will.

01:32:08.003 --> 01:32:10.010
But I have to talk to Roni first.

01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:40.803
- She's not there.

01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:43.120
Did you see anybody?

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.270
Did they say where she is?

01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:45.570
- There was nobody to say.

01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:50.200
The office is empty. man.
there was nobody there.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.050
- What?
- There's nothing.

01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:54.494
No furniture. lights.
shit on the wall. nothing.

01:32:54.494 --> 01:32:55.710
- No. no. no. no. no.

01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:57.210
Shit!
- Oh let it be.

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:58.810
enough man. I mean what the fuck?

01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:00.960
You gotta come clean
to me about this shit!

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:07.440
- You talked to Keith lately?

01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:09.550
- No. no man.

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.230
Not since around the time we played poker.

01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:12.620
That was about a year ago. I guess.

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.513
- Keith's dead.

01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.823
I did it.

01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:19.670
I killed Keith.

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:20.503
- What?

01:33:25.210 --> 01:33:27.733
That's why they were coming
around and asking for you.

01:33:32.434 --> 01:33:34.017
I don't understand.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.273
- Just drive. Bobby.

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:38.853
I'll show you.

01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:42.123
-  Where?

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:44.973
- The desert.

01:34:10.351 --> 01:34:12.250
- Man wait. what the hell?

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:13.083
Explain this shit to me!

01:34:13.083 --> 01:34:15.883
- He must be right here. I swear to God.

01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:21.283
I mean. the idea was
to let the scavengers.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.233
Gonna leave him out here.

01:34:23.233 --> 01:34:25.170
- Come on man. take it easy!

01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:27.283
- No. there should be something.

01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:31.280
It's barely over a year.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.850
Clothes. or the sheet we wrapped him in.

01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:35.683
Something.

01:34:35.683 --> 01:34:37.400
- Okay V. wait. wait.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.990
Explain all this. man!

01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:42.980
You killed him and you
brought him here a year ago?

01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:44.160
- Yes Bobby. yes.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.970
It was the bet. remember?

01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:49.240
That stupid fucking bet I
made with Mitch at poker.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.853
I didn't take it seriously.

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.650
I come home and Roni's in bed
with Keith. and I lost it.

01:34:56.650 --> 01:35:01.470
I shot him. and we dragged
him right here. right here.

01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:03.910
- I don't believe Keith is dead. man.

01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:05.060
- Believe it.

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.480
Keith is fucking dead.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.087
I shot him. I killed
him. and it was a mess.

01:35:10.087 --> 01:35:11.910
It was a bloody mess.

01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:14.690
And Roni and I. we took him.

01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:17.053
and we dragged him right here.

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:26.323
I think they arrested Roni.

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:33.820
And the only reason I came
back was to turn myself in.

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:36.733
But I wanted to tell her Roni
first. keep her out of it.

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:39.793
- Keith is not dead. man.

01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:41.633
He's not!

01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:47.000
Look. I told you I haven't
spoken to him. but Mitch has!

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.520
Well. Mitch spoke to his cousin anyway.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.680
- When?

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.913
- A few months ago!

01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:56.790
It's true!

01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:58.280
So I don't see how you
could have killed him

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.173
a year ago. man.

01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:02.373
Mitch is gone too.

01:36:03.704 --> 01:36:06.220
He just picked up and moved away.

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.320
Said he wanted a change.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.370
he was talking about Alaska or something.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.153
- Take me home.

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:56.213
- Hello. Vincent.

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.740
The reason you find
yourself standing there

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:03.690
perplexed as you are is
the result of your blind.

01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:07.960
relentless preconception that
everything with yourself.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:12.763
with us. had been. is and
would always be all right.

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.850
Built within this preconception
was your wrong-headed belief

01:37:17.850 --> 01:37:21.870
that there was only one way to
consider yourself a success.

01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:23.313
And it made you reckless.

01:37:24.210 --> 01:37:27.573
With us. with work. with your friends.

01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:31.520
Completely by chance. I
ran into Mitch and Keith

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.143
about a year and a half or
so ago at a bar downtown.

01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:38.160
After a few Macallans.

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.180
I guess I let it slip

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.500
that there wasn't much left
to our marriage anymore.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.590
And then Mitch started busting my chops

01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:47.290
about a prenup you were
always bragging about

01:37:47.290 --> 01:37:50.580
and how if we divorced.
I wouldn't get anything.

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.397
You know how Mitch is.
they laughed and so did I.

01:37:54.397 --> 01:37:57.380
And then I told them the one circumstance.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.000
according to that prenup

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.640
you lovingly insisted I sign.

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.490
the one situation that would
not only void the prenup.

01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:07.630
but would give me nearly everything.

01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:11.543
including your precious
trust fund. abandonment.

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:21.590
You caught your breath yet?

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:25.900
I'm sure you needed a moment.

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.713
You see Vincent. I know you so well.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:33.740
Not because of our
mediocre years together.

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:37.463
but because as a behavioral
psychologist. it's my job.

01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:41.090
I get to know people better
than they know themselves.

01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:45.500
Did you know Mitchell's
dream was to retire early

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.883
and explore the wilds of Alaska?

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:49.993
And Keith's.

01:38:50.850 --> 01:38:53.410
Keith wanted to see the world.

01:38:53.410 --> 01:38:55.260
He just never had the money to do it.

01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:57.773
Oh. and me.

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.313
I just wanted out.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.310
And to take from you what
you bragged over and over

01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:05.723
that I could never have.

01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:09.223
The question was. how?

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.323
How to get you to abandon me.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.610
Well. fortunately.

01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:19.750
I had a wide variety of clients.

01:39:20.588 --> 01:39:24.520
-  It's just that I
don't want to retire. doc.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.180
I told you that. I got
a lot left in the tank.

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.040
and I just don't want to.

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.770
- Gus. I'm curious. as a
special effects artist.

01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.800
is that the computer created stuff. the C?

01:39:36.135 --> 01:39:37.820
-  What CGI?

01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:39.733
Hell. no way. that crap's
killing the business.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:43.110
No. I do the real deal.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:46.330
Physical stuff. explosions. bullet hits.

01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:47.850
- Bullet hits?

01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:50.210
-  The real stuff. the real deal.

01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:54.140
- Gus. listen. a few of us
wanted to play a practical joke

01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.120
on one of our friends.

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.652
Would you be interested in
trading a few free sessions

01:39:57.652 --> 01:39:59.323
for your services?

01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:04.580
Vincent. I could have imagined that

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.120
had you made a sincere.
credible effort to change.

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.250
we would have still had a chance.

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:13.650
and I would have backed off.

01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:16.653
But that bet.

01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:20.580
Mitch never believed you would take it.

01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:21.823
I knew otherwise.

01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:26.530
And the galling. profoundly
hurtful that my husband

01:40:26.530 --> 01:40:30.670
was so open to the efforts
of another man seducing me

01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:32.673
made backing off impossible.

01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:36.300
So while you went speeding to the airport.

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.940
and I heard an angry voicemail

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.800
saying not to bother coming to Texas.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.523
I finally had a chance to
orchestrate your arrival.

01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:51.060
At the end of it. that you
would go for the weapon.

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:54.760
too traumatized to realize that
you didn't have lockbox key.

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.650
It was never a question.

01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:58.310
but you would have found the box locked

01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:59.863
and I needed it unlocked.

01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:02.999
So where did you keep the key?

01:41:02.999 --> 01:41:06.010
I heard somebody. somebody's in the house.

01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:07.163
I had to find out.

01:41:09.265 --> 01:41:10.182
- You sure?

01:41:12.739 --> 01:41:14.072
Okay. stay here.

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:23.120
- And remember. I was working late.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:27.063
When I got home. it was easy
to create cause for concern.

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.880
But the most troubling question
was how many blanks to use.

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:41.480
Gus needed to know so he could figure out

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.520
how many shots to tape on Keith.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.810
and Keith needed to know
so he knew how many times

01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:48.840
to trigger the bullet hits.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.800
And I needed to know
how many blanks to load.

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.210
Too few. and you would have wondered

01:41:53.210 --> 01:41:54.397
why there weren't as many rounds in there

01:41:54.397 --> 01:41:57.010
as you've always kept.

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:58.763
I calculated five.

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.530
Four for outright rage.

01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:06.980
and one more before you
came to your senses.

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:08.483
But you only shot four.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.033
That's why.

01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.903
Give me the gun.

01:42:13.903 --> 01:42:15.123
I wanted the gun.

01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:19.400
All you had to do is eventually
shoot it or check it.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.803
and it would have been all over.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.650
There was one last thing
that had to happen.

01:42:27.650 --> 01:42:29.130
and it had to be your idea.

01:42:29.130 --> 01:42:31.133
otherwise you would've been suspicious.

01:42:32.190 --> 01:42:35.040
My insurance was in knowing you.

01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:38.430
I knew that with no way out
of the very real prospect

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:41.840
of some muscle-bound. sweaty convict

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.240
breathing his hot breath
on the back of your neck

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.183
in some shitty state prison.

01:42:48.553 --> 01:42:49.510
- I have to leave.

01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:50.563
-  You'd run.

01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.260
And that's exactly what you did.

01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:00.523
You took too long. Vincent.

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.230
You constantly delayed and set us aside.

01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:07.130
refusing to address our needs.

01:43:07.130 --> 01:43:09.490
So I chose to act.

01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:11.350
And as I would with any other patient.

01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:15.023
I worked up a therapy
prescription and administered it.

01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:21.167
Now Vincent. with your
father's money out of the way

01:43:21.167 --> 01:43:25.140
and a woman you never truly
loved out of your life.

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:27.620
we both have a chance.

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.860
A chance to live as we see fit.

01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:34.780
and whatever future is stretched
out in front of us is ours.

01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:38.623
Our own. no one else's.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.643
Good luck. Vincent.

01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:43.793
I wish you well.

01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:46.303
Roni.

01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:07.196
- So you figured out what
you're gonna do. man?

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.760
- I don't know.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.010
No. I guess.

01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:14.903
Nothing maybe. I don't know.

01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:18.390
I got to get work and I know that.

01:44:19.534 --> 01:44:20.990
Ans it's not gonna be in
the securities business.

01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:22.290
not without a license. so.

01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:26.633
Maybe I'll start a business.

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.780
With what?

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.380
I mean. I'm not a pillar
of financial credibility.

01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:37.290
but damn man.

01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:39.500
Trading license has been revoked.

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.690
sanctioned by the SEC.

01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:44.570
Damn near doing time in some
white collar country club.

01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:46.120
which might not have been a bad thing.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.130
It's just. I don't think banks
are gonna to be lining up

01:44:49.130 --> 01:44:50.230
to give you a loan. V.

01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:55.120
- Roni left me the car. left me the house.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.800
paid it off free and clear once she left.

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.935
So I'm all right.

01:44:59.935 --> 01:45:01.770
- That's not what I'm talking about. man.

01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:03.420
You know that.

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.253
Roni.

01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:07.841
What you gonna do?

01:45:07.841 --> 01:45:10.000
You gonna go get her?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:10.903
I mean. find her?

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.023
- Roni was right.

01:45:16.882 --> 01:45:19.360
- What do you mean she was right?

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.213
She took your inheritance. man.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.400
- How many people get a
chance at a fresh start?

01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:34.483
Wipe the slate clean. write
something new on the board.

01:45:37.755 --> 01:45:39.193
What's that even worth?

01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.870
How much would you pay for that?
