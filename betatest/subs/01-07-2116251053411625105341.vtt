347

<i>Her enormous appetite propels her</i>

348
00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:43.701
<i>through thousands of miles of</i>
<i>open ocean to northern waters.</i>

349
00:31:57.415 --> 00:32:02.220
<i>Here the frozen seas have</i>
<i>started to melt and retreat.</i>

350
00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:09.294
<i>Wind and currents shift the</i>
<i>loosening ice and break it up.</i>

351
00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:15.867
<i>Forming pools across the ice's surface...</i>

352
00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:21.439
<i>opening new feeding grounds...</i>

353
00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:28.212
<i>and creating a pathway for new arrivals.</i>

354
00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:34.285
<i>Like the mysterious narwhal.</i>

355
00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:37.221
<i>who's been waiting</i>
<i>for this all year.</i>

356
00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:42.126
(light music playing)

357
00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:47.465
<i>Known as the unicorn of the sea</i>

358
00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:50.568
<i>because of its strange spiral tusk...</i>

359
00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:57.241
<i>The narwhal is one of the most</i>
<i>elusive animals on Earth.</i>

360
00:32:57.875 --> 00:33:00.445
(light music playing)

361
00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:06.718
<i>They follow along the cracks in the ice</i>
<i>to reach rich feeding grounds.</i>

362
00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:13.157
<i>Each summer they migrate to this area.</i>

363
00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.960
(light music playing)

364
00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:20.531
<i>Usually moving in groups</i>
<i>of two or three.</i>

365
00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:24.469
<i>But when fishing is good.</i>
<i>hundreds may come together.</i>

(light music playing)

367
00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:34.712
<i>These hunters take a risk.</i>

368
00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:37.148
<i>With the summer melt in full swing.</i>

369
00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:40.151
<i>the ice is still shifting.</i>

370
00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:43.988
<i>and like all whales.</i>
<i>they need air to breathe.</i>

371
00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:47.125
<i>At least every 25 minutes.</i>

372
00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:50.895
<i>If the ice closes. they could suffocate.</i>

373
00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:57.769
<i>They look for holes where they can surface</i>
<i>for a single breath.</i>

374
00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:01.072
(light music playing)

375
00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:08.913
<i>The farther they go. the harder</i>
<i>it is to find holes in the ice.</i>

376
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:15.486
<i>This pod snatches a quick</i>
<i>breath wherever they can.</i>

377
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:18.289
<i>But the problem is getting worse.</i>

378
00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:22.460
<i>Ahead the ice forms</i>
<i>an impenetrable barrier;</i>

379
00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:25.963
<i>but they've got a plan.</i>

380
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.233
<i>It is believed that they use</i>
<i>their heads and long tusk</i>

381
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.837
<i>to break the ice and</i>
<i>widen the breathing holes.</i>

382
00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:38.376
<i>Bobbing up and down.</i>

383
00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:42.013
<i>they're careful not to gore</i>
<i>each other with their tusk.</i>

384
00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:51.656
<i>And just as suddenly as the</i>
<i>crack closed. it opens again.</i>

385
00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:56.761
<i>releasing the trapped whales</i>
<i>into the open waters.</i>

386
00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:59.330
(soft music playing)

387
00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:11.809
<i>Here they can use their spiraled tusk</i>
<i>for its primary purpose: spearfishing.</i>

388
00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:19.050
<i>But it doesn't skewer their</i>
<i>prey as much as knock it out.</i>

389
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:24.122
<i>Like a taser. it stuns.</i>
<i>rendering the fish helpless.</i>

390
00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:27.358
(soft music playing)

391
00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:33.097

<i>The ocean offers a million ways to hunt.</i>

394
00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:55.520
<i>But sometimes the smartest way</i>
<i>is to let others do it for you.</i>

395

<i>Summer in Alaska has arrived.</i>

396
00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:04.262
<i>and so have our humpbacks.</i>

397
00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:09.467
<i>These icy waters are a buffet</i>
<i>to countless ocean wanderers.</i>

398
00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:14.105
<i>But their fates can also affect</i>
<i>the fortunes of those on land.</i>

399
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:19.744
<i>Here an astounding drama</i>
<i>is about to unfold.</i>

400
00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:24.682
<i>This huge brown bear's life</i>
<i>may depend on the outcome.</i>

401
00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:32.990
<i>He's lost nearly a third of his</i>
<i>body weight during hibernation.</i>

402

<i>He's not the only starving bear</i>
<i>hoping for a meal.</i>

(dramatic music playing)

404
00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:53.244
<i>So he parks himself in a prime spot.</i>

(dramatic music playing)

406
00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.952
<i>Right on schedule.</i>

407
00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:07.158
<i>orcas. the sea's top predators.</i>
<i>arrive from hundreds of miles away.</i>

408
00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:29.080
<i>The orcas are here</i>
<i>to hunt other whales.</i>

409
00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:34.185
<i>including humpbacks who've just arrived</i>
<i>to these feeding grounds.</i>

410
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:37.288
<i>It's the perfect place for an ambush.</i>

411

(dramatic music playing)

412
00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:44.362

<i>The hunters circle in for the kill.</i>
<i>separating a calf from its mother.</i>

415
00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:12.556
<i>From the grandstands.</i>
<i>the famished bears watch.</i>

416
00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:24.435
<i>The orcas hold the calf under...</i>

417
00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.671
<i>to drown it.</i>

418
00:38:45.856 --> 00:38:48.059
<i>The predators are hungry.</i>

419
00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:51.696
<i>but in a hurry to hunt for more.</i>

420
00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:54.865
<i>so they go for the easy pickings--</i>

421
00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:57.501
<i>the calf's tender tongue and lips.</i>

422
00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:03.774
(soft music playing)

423
00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:08.346
<i>Then. they do something extraordinary.</i>

424

<i>The cunning orcas</i>
<i>dismantle the carcass.</i>

425
00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.560
<i>and head to the bottom</i>

426
00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.664
<i>to store it for later.</i>

427
00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:47.485
<i>But not all goes as planned.</i>

438

<i>Renowned collaborators.</i>

444
