﻿1
00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:34.783
- Stop! Stop!

2
00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:43.375
No! No!

3
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.148
No!

4
00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:17.387
- Thank you. Max.

5
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.930
All right. ladies.

6
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.891
Next week's performance
is going to be big.

7
00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.978
Big. big. big.

8
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.499
I know you all have been
working really hard.

9
00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:29.565
but I need you to give me more.

10
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.775
I need you to focus more.

11
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.821
Exhaustion creates
genius. right?

12
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.700
Okay. I'm gonna go
home. get some lunch.

13
00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:41.012
and spend some
time with my baby.

14
00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.954
And I will see you back
here at 8:30 sharp.

15
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.833
And then we can start tech.

16
00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:48.877
Thank you. ladies.

17
00:03:01.182 --> 00:03:04.016
Brittney.
this car is a disaster.

18
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:06.538
Were you just going to drive
it until the engine went out?

19
00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:08.145
- I put gas in it.

20
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.023
I didn't know you had
to do more than that.

21
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.836
Oh. and I got an oil
change last year.

22
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.860
- Taylor. will you
grab me some oil?

23
00:03:22.453 --> 00:03:24.995
I meant motor oil. you dope.

24
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.496
- My mistake.

25
00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:28.602
Then again. I thought we
were going to the pool today.

26
00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:30.103
- And I thought we
were going shopping

27
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.836
because you definitely are
not wearing that to the party.

28
00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.214
- I haven't committed
to anything yet.

29
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.257
- What. why?

30
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:38.884
- Because Sam will be there?

31
00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.305
- Yes. because
Sam will be there.

32
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.350
- But you two are
ancient history.

33
00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:47.726
- Is three months ancient?

34
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.396
- It is to me.

35
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.709
- Well. right now.
we're not going anywhere

36
00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.192
'cause this car needs
a complete overhaul.

37
00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:56.755
- Honestly. April.
if I were you.

38
00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.987
I would just skip going
to college next week

39
00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:00.233
and open up a repair shop.

40
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.135
- I want to do more
than just repair cars.

41
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.867
I want to design them.

42
00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:05.619
So can you hand me a wrench?

43
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.182
- This could be the
last time we hang out

44
00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:10.332
before you and Taylor go off
to college and forget about me.

45
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.042
- You're going to college too.

46
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920
- I'm not sure anymore.

47
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.047
I want to travel and relax

48
00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.110
before I jump right
into school again.

49
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.842
so I'm taking a gap year.

50
00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:22.928
- A gap year?

51
00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:24.513
Wow.

52
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.931
You find that wrench yet?

53
00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:29.059
- No. but I found this.

54
00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.039
- Natalie.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.394
- We all used to be so close.

56
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:44.616
You guys talk to her lately?

57
00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:45.951
- Are you kidding?

58
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.514
- After Sam cheated
on you with her?

59
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:50.080
- Sam wasn't good
enough for you anyways.

60
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.768
- You know. I
expected it from Sam.

61
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.293
but not from Natalie.

62
00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.316
Oh!

63
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.465
- See? All better.

64
00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.135
- Now you just have to ignore
her at the party tonight.

65
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.054
- Natalie's going to the party?

66
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.850
Well then.

67
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:13.979
I am definitely not going.

68
00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:16.815
- Oh. come on. April.
- No. I'm not gonna go.

69
00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:18.150
- You have to come.

70
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:18.817
It's not gonna be
fun without you.

71
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:19.568
- Sam and Natalie?

72
00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.485
You're insane.

73
00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.007
- No.
- I'm not.

74
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.155
Please?

75
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.531
- I would not make you guys.

76
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.303
- It's not gonna be fun
if you're not there.

77
00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:28.247
I am not
going. you guys.

78
00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:29.347
I would never make
you guys do that.

79
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.851
- Hi. miss bishop.
- Hi.

80
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.456
Where are you not going?

81
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.333
April refuses to go

82
00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.877
to the last party of
the summer with us.

83
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:37.794
She
doesn't want to go

84
00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.087
because Sam is gonna be there.

85
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:41.465
- That's not the only reason.

86
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.508
- I hope that's
not a reason at all

87
00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.363
because I know I didn't
raise my only daughter

88
00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.472
to let some silly man dictate
how she spends her spare time.

89
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.848
Oh. it's that you don't want Sam

90
00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:51.328
to know how happy
you are without him?

91
00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:53.204
Honey. that is the
sweetest revenge.

92
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.873
I think your father
is still pissed off

93
00:05:54.897 --> 00:05:56.082
that I'm not moping around
and crying over him.

94
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.147
- Mom.

95
00:05:58.275 --> 00:05:59.275
- You know what?

96
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.234
You ladies need to
enjoy yourselves. okay?

97
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.591
You have the rest of your
lives to work all the time

98
00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:05.947
and not go to parties.

99
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.387
- I'm still not going.
- Yes. you are.

100
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.536
- No. take my mom.
- You are.

101
00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:12.622
No.

102
00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:16.041
- What about you?
- What about me?

103
00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.000
When was the last time

104
00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:19.006
you went out and
had a good time?

105
00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:21.963
- I enjoy my time
with you. dear.

106
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:23.340
Besides. with this show.

107
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.320
I have barely enough time
to go to the bathroom.

108
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.010
let alone go out.

109
00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:28.720
- Let's make a deal.

110
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:29.971
I'll go to the party

111
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:34.226
and face my ex boyfriend
and my ex best friend

112
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.561
if you ask Kent out.

113
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.855
- Ooh.
- Who's Kent?

114
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:41.358
- Just this gorgeous man who
owns the theater downtown.

115
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:45.695
- He is a respected
professional and just a friend.

116
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.282
- Mom?

117
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:51.910
I appreciate all
of the sacrifices

118
00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:54.079
that you've made for
me the past year.

119
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:58.083
but you have this amazing
opportunity with the show now

120
00:06:58.127 --> 00:07:00.752
and it's your dream.

121
00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:03.804
And I'm moving
out next week. so.

122
00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:05.715
- Don't remind me.

123
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:07.946
- It's time you stopped
hitting the pause button

124
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.219
on your love life.

125
00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.930
- I can't ask him out.

126
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.100
- Well then. I'm not
going to the party.

127
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.769
- Ms. Bishop. come on.

128
00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:19.207
- Is there gonna be any
alcohol at this party?

129
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:20.397
- No way.

130
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.585
If there is. we will
definitely not partake.

131
00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.276
- Oh. forget it.

132
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.945
My mom is way too scared to
ask Kent or anyone else out.

133
00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:28.488
- Oh. is that right?

134
00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:30.824
- Yeah. that's why
I made the bet.

135
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.577
- Well. you'd better get
ready to lose your money

136
00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.620
because I will ask him out.

137
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:37.122
- All right.

138
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.767
- Tonight.
- Okay.

139
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.419
- You just be home by midnight.

140
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.045
- I'll be home way before that.

141
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:46.151
My troops are earning
their engineering badges

142
00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:47.299
in the morning.

143
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.903
- I'll be at the
theater late tonight.

144
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.280
We have a new girl who
doesn't know the difference

145
00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:52.137
between a pique and a u-turn.

146
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.847
And we open in three days.

147
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:54.764
- Miss bishop.
when are you gonna

148
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.308
put me in one of your shows?

149
00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.478
- Taylor. you can't even twerk.

150
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.982
No. no. that was not.
- Wow.

151
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.320
- Well. thank god there will
be no twerking in this show.

152
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.731
You ladies just make sure
you keep my baby safe.

153
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.743
- I'll see you in the am. mom.

154
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.161
- I love you.

155
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.246
- Love you.

156
00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.289
- Okay.

157
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:20.832
Let's get you ready.

158
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.878
You can wear something of mine.

159
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.649
- We don't actually
have the same taste.

160
00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:27.839
- Oh. I know.

161
00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:30.133
So you'll actually
look good for once.

162
00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.220
- We're going to a party.

- Sure.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.852
- You look so good.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.125
- Good job by the way.

174
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.022
- If Sam talks to
me. I'm leaving.

175
00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.337
- Oh. come on!

176
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.505
- It won't be that hard.

177
00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:10.173

179
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.051
- Exactly. so you look good.

180
00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.095
What is that supposed to mean?

181
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.407
Wait. where'd that
purse come from?

182
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.223
- She's international boutique.

183
00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.391
- Oh. fancy.

184
00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.246
- These earrings keep
snagging my hair.

185
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.789
Well. if you'd
stop messing with them.

186
00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:24.415
I told you
they were too big.

187
00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.599
They look good.

188
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.443
- Drop this?

189
00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:35.907
Good to see you all.

190
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.450
- Can you believe this turnout?

191
00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:38.368
- Great idea.

192
00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:39.703
Look how many people are here.

193
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.266
I mean. they're all
gonna get a taste

194
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.370
of what real college
parties are gonna be like.

195
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.417
- You threw this party?

196
00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:48.773
I thought you weren't
going to college

197
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.714
because of your gap year.

198
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.549
- Sam just wanted more people.

199
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.135
If anyone knows how to
draw a crowd. it's me.

200
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.140
- I thought you
weren't talking to Sam.

201
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.348
- I'm not talking to Natalie.

202
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:02.392
I didn't think Sam
was off limits.

203
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.497
Wait. April. you're
not mad. are you?

204
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.645
- Of course not.

205
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.166
I just need to
find the bathroom.

206
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.274
I have this sudden urge to puke.

207
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.984
- Wait. April. don't go.

208
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.277
- I just need a minute.

209
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.196
- It's fine.

210
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.948
We can still drink. you know.

211
00:10:39.348 --> 00:10:40.348
- Hi. Natalie.

212
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.516
- Can we talk?

213
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:45.518
- You better get out there.

214
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:48.438
It seems like you have some
new competition for Sam.

215
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:49.814
- I don't want Sam.

216
00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:52.942
- He break up with you already?

217
00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:56.321
- Sam and I were never together.

218
00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:00.950
- But you slept with him.

219
00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:03.181
- Why would you even accuse
me of something like that?

220
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.412
- Just forget it.

221
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:05.747
- Now that high school

222
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:06.539
and all that dumb
drama's over with.

223
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:08.333
can we just start over?

224
00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:09.834
- Pretend it didn't happen?

225
00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.090
But it did happen.

226
00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.182
You were my best
friend. Natalie.

227
00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.910
And you threw me
away for some guy

228
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:26.309
who spends more time on
his hair than you do.

229
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:31.376
- Wait. April. if you'll
just listen to me.

230
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400
- I have.

231
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:36.027
And it doesn't get any better.

232
00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:38.113
- I miss you.

233
00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.489
- And I miss you.

234
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.493
But I can't trust you anymore.

235
00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:47.372
So have a good night.

236
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.381
- So. do you like to bartend?

237
00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.882
Yeah?

238
00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.509
April. where are you going?

239
00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:00.427
- Home!

240
00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.614
- But we drove in Taylor's car.

241
00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:02.699
Yeah. well.
I'll get a ride.

242
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.242
- Look. I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

243
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:05.466
I helped him plan the party.

244
00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.016
but I knew if you found out.

245
00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:10.228
you were gonna act like how
you're acting right now.

246
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.566
- Am I being a baby about this?

247
00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:17.736
- Yes. so drink
this and grow up.

248
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.904
- We told my mom
there'd be no drinking.

249
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.407
- One little shot
is barely drinking.

250
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:23.658
- I don't think my scouts

251
00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:24.929
will appreciate
their troop leader

252
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.286
being drunk in the morning.

253
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.538
- Fine. I'll get you
something kid friendly.

254
00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:40.383
Here you go. mom.

255
00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:41.718
Here's your ginger ale.

256
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:43.720
What's wrong now?

257
00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:45.555
- Taylor likes Sam now?

258
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.680
- I don't know. why?

259
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.851
Maybe they're just talking.

260
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.228
Sam doesn't just talk.

261
00:12:52.314 --> 00:12:53.314
- Here.

262
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.629
- You said this was ginger ale.

263
00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.446
- It is. among other things.

264
00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:05.909
- Screw it.

265
00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.152
Being the good girl all
the time is overrated.

266
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.124
- Come on. let's dance.

267
00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.168
- Okay.

268
00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:18.630
- Together. okay?

269
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:23.301
Five. six. seven. eight.

270
00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.509
You know. stop. just wait.

271
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.476
Take five. all right?

272
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.646
Go clear your heads. get
some water. do something.

273
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:37.398
Jeez.

274
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.149
- Well. it's looking good.

275
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.108
It's looking good.

276
00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.652
And you're almost sold out.

277
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.112
So. TGIF. huh?

278
00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:46.324
- Thank god it's Friday.

279
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:50.203
- Well. in our case. the
grind includes Friday. right?

280
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.288
- That it does.

281
00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.582
- So how are you feeling?

282
00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:55.792
How's rehearsal going?

283
00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:58.503
- It's. uh. it's going.

284
00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.506
- Yeah?

285
00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.654
Well I'm sure it's
gonna be great.

286
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.678
Your performances always are.

287
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:07.971
- Well. thank you.

288
00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.672
- Well. if you need anything.
I'll be up in my office.

289
00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:14.854
- Kent?

290
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.689
- Yeah?

291
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.694
- Are you working
tomorrow night?

292
00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.985
- No. are you?

293
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.529
- No. I gave the girls off.

294
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.365
Rehearsals with the full
cast start next week.

295
00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:28.700
Miss bishop.

296
00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.054
we're ready to run
the routine again.

297
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.203
- Okay. well let me
let you get to it.

298
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.706
Break a leg.

299
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.376
- I am too old for this.

300
00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:43.591
All right. ladies.

301
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:45.884
Let's take it from the top.

302
00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:49.721
And five. six. seven. and...

303
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:53.850
- Everything's so blurry.

304
00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.872
- Yeah. that's 'cause
you never drank before.

305
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:58.688
Come on. let's sit for a bit.

306
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.732
Are you okay?

307
00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:03.568
I don't feel good.

308
00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:04.755
- You just need a water.

309
00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:05.820
Stay here.

310
00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:10.909
Okay.

311
00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:33.765
- April.

312
00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:34.808
April. wait.

313
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.185
April. don't leave.

314
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:40.605
Here. here. hydrate.

315
00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:41.773
You'll feel better.

316
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.404
- Oh. that tastes like crap.

317
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.530
- It's just water.

318
00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.407
- I want to go home.

319
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.576
- But we're having so much fun.

320
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.119
- No. you're having so much fun.

321
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.371
I was just pretending.

322
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.124
I'll call a ride.

323
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.480
- Well. let's get some fresh air

324
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.963
while we wait for
your ride to get here.

325
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.006
- Thank you.

326
00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.885
- Sam sucks anyways.
- Yeah. he does suck.

327
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:12.220
You're too good for him.

328
00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.180
You knew that.

329
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:14.973
Yeah.

330
00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.474
Whatever.

331
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.184
Who cares?

332
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.977
- Yeah.

333
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.811
- Boop.

334
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:21.689
- Let's sit.

335
00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:30.113
- You don't have to wait for me.

336
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.322
- No way.

337
00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.843
You know how many freaks
come out at night?

338
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.076
I want to make sure you
get in the car okay.

339
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.620
I think that's your ride now.

340
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.124
- Has it been 20 minutes?

341
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.436
- He did get here kind of quick.

342
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.854
Let me make sure this
is the right guy.

343
00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:44.961
- Ride for April?

344
00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.295
- It's the right guy.

345
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.639
Let's go.

346
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.687
- Hi.

347
00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.981
I don't feel good.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey.

348
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.460
Let me help. let me help.
- No. I got her.

349
00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.524
- No. I'm just trying to help.
- I said I got her!

350
00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:11.696
- Whatever you say.

351
00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:14.032
- Hey. take it easy.

352
00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.553
Watch your step.
watch your step.

353
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:16.367
Hey. you'll be fine. okay?

354
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.036
Just sleep it off.

355
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.679
- Okay.
- Okay?

356
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.374
- Thank you. Brittney.

357
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.668
You're the best.

358
00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:29.942
- April. wait. maybe we should...

359
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.674
- Hey. can you close the door?

360
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.218
I need to get your friend home.

361
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.129
- Where's April going?

362
00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.422
- Home.

363
00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.924
She's just going home.

364
00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:15.843
My drinking buddies ditched me.

365
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.386
You want to hang?

366
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:19.764
- You want to be friends again?

367
00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:20.849
- Why not?

368
00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.767
Drinks are on me.

369
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:45.123
- Where's my phone?

370
00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:46.708
Sir?

371
00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:49.837
Excuse me?

372
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.046
Can we go back?

373
00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.760
I think I left my
phone with my friend.

374
00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.971
Can we go back
and get it please?

375
00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:01.931
- Can't. new policy.

376
00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:06.934
- Where are we going?

377
00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:11.315
What address do you have?

378
00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:16.654
- Just relax.

379
00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.323
We're almost there.

380
00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:09.624
- Where are we?

381
00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:10.709
- Relax.

382
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.214
- I don't live here.

383
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:18.425
- Get out.

384
00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:21.929
- Who are you?

385
00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.576
- You guys are just
taking a pit stop.

386
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.640
The Van broke down.

387
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.065
- Okay.

388
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.615
My seatbelt.

389
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.200
- Here. let me help you.

390
00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.914
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!

391
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:50.976
Are you kidding me?

392
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.750
- Help. help!

393
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.419
- Really?

394
00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:56.379
Why did you let
the money escape?

395
00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.838
- Why didn't you drug her more?

396
00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.804
- You want the
doctor to find out?

397
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:10.978
April!

398
00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:42.466
Oh no. you don't.

399
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.219
You got a brain in there. huh?
- Please. no!

400
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.782
- Let's find out if
you got a brain. huh?

401
00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.055
Huh. huh?

402
00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.201
Let's see if you
got a brain. huh?!

403
00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.141
- Okay. okay!

404
00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.809
- That's enough. man!

405
00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:53.561
Get up.

406
00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.187
I said. get up.

407
00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.148
- No. no. no. no. no!

408
00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.065
- Shut up!

409
00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.109
- No. please!

410
00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:03.196
No!

411
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:05.365
Let me go!

412
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.158
Let me go!

413
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:09.161
No!

414
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:12.663
Where are you taking me?

415
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.498
Where are you taking me?

416
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:15.624
Please!

417
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.834
No!

418
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:25.134
Don't put me in there!

419
00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:30.848
No! No!

420
00:22:34.937 --> 00:22:36.707
- I thought you said the
girl was gonna be easy.

421
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:37.855
- Calm down. dude.

422
00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:41.253
- Why wasn't she
drugged out more?

423
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:42.463
- Come on. we got
her. didn't we?

424
00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:44.570
You know. the next one
will just be easier.

425
00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:46.197
- What makes you so sure?

426
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.032
- Because you're gonna help me.

427
00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:08.511
Please!

428
00:23:25.613 --> 00:23:27.653
What are
you doing. Tracey?

429
00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:32.388
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

430
00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:35.246
I was just seeing if you need
anything before I head out.

431
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:37.957
but I didn't mean to
sneak up on you like that.

432
00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:39.208
- I don't mind.

433
00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:40.604
You could sneak up on
me anytime you like.

434
00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:42.461
- Oh. okay.

435
00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:44.130
- I mean. I didn't...

436
00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.132
- No. no. no. I
know what you meant.

437
00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:48.759
I know what you meant.

438
00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:52.096
But no. actually. as I reflect.

439
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.683
earlier today. you asked me
if I had to work tomorrow

440
00:23:55.768 --> 00:24:00.104
and I was wondering if. were
you trying to ask me out?

441
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.481
Were you checking me out?

442
00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:03.315
- Yes.

443
00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:04.608
- Yes?

444
00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:06.422
- That is if you
were gonna say yes.

445
00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:07.611
If you were gonna say no.

446
00:24:07.697 --> 00:24:09.216
then that conversation
never happened.

447
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.865
- Oh. really?

448
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.158
Okay.

449
00:24:12.243 --> 00:24:13.868
Well. do you even like bowling?

450
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:14.743
- No.

451
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:15.995
- No?

452
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.455
Me neither.

453
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.851
I mean. it's cool. but I
couldn't date an avid bowler.

454
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.791
You might want to join a league.

455
00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:23.252
arm wrestle at night.
something crazy.

456
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:24.497
- Well. how about dinner?

457
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:26.298
- Okay.

458
00:24:27.258 --> 00:24:29.300
Tomorrow night. seven o'clock.

459
00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:32.137
- Okay.

460
00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:35.264
I know this little
sweet Italian place.

461
00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.976
You do eat Italian. right?

462
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:39.852
- Oh yeah.

463
00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:40.644
Who doesn't love spaghetti?

464
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.645
A little mangia. mangia.

465
00:24:41.731 --> 00:24:43.647
A little vino on the side.

466
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:44.899
- Well. that's good.

467
00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.587
- And then after that.
a little salsa club.

468
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:47.943
a little dancing.

469
00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.320
Uh-oh.

470
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:50.966
- I didn't know you
knew how to salsa.

471
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.532
- There's a lot you don't
know about me. young lady.

472
00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:55.826
After a year's
time. a whole lot.

473
00:24:57.205 --> 00:24:59.205
- There's a lot I
need to find out.

474
00:25:08.174 --> 00:25:09.548
All right. ladies.

475
00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:10.758
That's good.

476
00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:13.010
Let's take it
again from the top.

477
00:25:13.054 --> 00:25:14.054
Thank you.

478
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.893
- Help. please!

479
00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:05.313
Please!

480
00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:26.376
Come on.

481
00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:47.605
No. no. no. no. no. no!

482
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.441
Come on.

483
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:54.111
- Excuse me.

484
00:26:55.573 --> 00:26:56.573
April?

485
00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:02.453
April. are you in here?

486
00:27:02.538 --> 00:27:04.246
Because your ride is here.

487
00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:08.167
which is news to me because I
thought I was taking you home.

488
00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:09.252
- Find her?

489
00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:10.169
- No.

490
00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:11.420
What did Brittney say?

491
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.340
- Nothing.

492
00:27:13.424 --> 00:27:14.798
She's gone too. so.

493
00:27:14.842 --> 00:27:15.842
- My god.

494
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:27.978
- Stop!

495
00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:29.064
No!

496
00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:09.562
Natalie?

497
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.527
What do you want from us?

498
00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:19.572
Answer me!

499
00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:25.786
Well at least just
turn off the freezer.

500
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.371
- Why did you turn it on?

501
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:28.475
- I didn't mean to.

502
00:28:28.499 --> 00:28:29.790
It was an accident.

503
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.292
- My dad always told me
to clean up my own messes.

504
00:28:32.378 --> 00:28:33.544
Same goes for you.

505
00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:35.547
No!

506
00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:38.466
No.

507
00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:42.010
- I thought he
was gonna kill me.

508
00:28:42.096 --> 00:28:43.887
- Natalie. stop crying.

509
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.390
- What are they
keeping us alive for?

510
00:28:46.434 --> 00:28:47.953
- Will you be quiet
so I can think?

511
00:28:47.977 --> 00:28:49.685
- Why are they keeping us alive?

512
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.415
- Your crying. it's
making me tense.

513
00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:52.855
- Well. excuse me.

514
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.441
How am I supposed to act?

515
00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:56.984
- Calm down.

516
00:28:57.069 --> 00:29:01.029
- I'll calm down as soon
as we get outta here.

517
00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:02.656
But one thing I won't do

518
00:29:02.742 --> 00:29:05.868
is be bossed and told how
I can and can't behave

519
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:08.537
by someone who can't even
stand the sight of me.

520
00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:14.501
- Whether I like you or not

521
00:29:14.587 --> 00:29:17.880
has nothing to do with
what is going on right now.

522
00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.465
We need to get over this crap

523
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.652
if we're gonna get out of here.

524
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.634
- Exactly where the hell are we?

525
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.261
- I don't know.

526
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:27.389
which is why I need you
to shut up so I can think!

527
00:29:35.566 --> 00:29:36.607
Thank you.

528
00:29:40.154 --> 00:29:42.154
We're gonna get out of here.

529
00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:43.447
There's always a way out.

530
00:29:43.491 --> 00:29:45.783
And I just need to find it.

531
00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:01.693
- I can't believe they left me.

532
00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:04.009
Taylor.
where are you going?

533
00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:05.594
- April and Brittney left me.

534
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:07.491
- Okay. let's go
back to the party.

535
00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:08.992
- No. Sam.
- Come on.

536
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:11.225
- They're not
answering their phone.

537
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.310
- What?

538
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:17.273
- My earring.

539
00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:20.901
I let April borrow
my big hoops tonight.

540
00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.737
Must have fallen
off when she left.

541
00:30:23.823 --> 00:30:24.883
- Yeah. they probably
just grabbed a ride

542
00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:26.114
with somebody else.

543
00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:26.740
When was the last
time you saw them?

544
00:30:26.826 --> 00:30:27.991
- I'm not sure.

545
00:30:28.077 --> 00:30:30.160
I got so caught up
with you that...

546
00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:36.667
She must have seen us
together dancing and...

547
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.522
- Yeah. and April got
upset and drove somewhere

548
00:30:38.546 --> 00:30:41.380
and then they talked
about what a jerk I am.

549
00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:42.567
- Well. you are a jerk.

550
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.569
- No. don't try to
make this my fault.

551
00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:46.593
I didn't force you
to dance with me.

552
00:30:48.097 --> 00:30:49.097
Where you going?

553
00:30:49.807 --> 00:30:51.473
- I have to find them.

554
00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:53.809
Hopefully April just
went back to her house.

555
00:30:53.894 --> 00:30:57.020
- Hey. wait. wait. wait.
- Sam. not now.

556
00:30:58.732 --> 00:30:59.523
- Look. hey.

557
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:02.234
I want to find her too. okay?

558
00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:03.964
I know you think
that I'm a jerk.

559
00:31:03.988 --> 00:31:05.529
but I'm a jerk who cares.

560
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:09.742
- Come on.

561
00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:15.706
About time you realized.

562
00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:09.969
- Come on.

563
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:24.403
That should help
with the bleeding.

564
00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:29.613
Where else does it hurt?

565
00:32:30.574 --> 00:32:31.740
- Why are you helping me?

566
00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:37.788
- Because if we do die. I
don't want to go to hell.

567
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:40.624
I'm kidding.

568
00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:43.627
We're not gonna die.

569
00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:46.964
Where else did he hurt you?

570
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:49.967
- My back mostly.

571
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.762
That's where he hit me
when I tried to run away.

572
00:32:55.683 --> 00:32:58.642
I knew I should've walked away
when I saw that Van pull up.

573
00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:01.521
- A Van?

574
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:03.814
A silver Van?

575
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.919
- But Brittney double-checked
and she made sure...

576
00:33:05.943 --> 00:33:06.943
- Brittney?

577
00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:09.965
Brittney helped me
into the Van too.

578
00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:12.614
which means that Brittney
can go to the police

579
00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:13.407
and tell them about...

580
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:14.492
- Brittney's dead.

581
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.749
- Natalie. tell
me what happened.

582
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:25.168
- So Brittney and I
drank and then we danced.

583
00:33:25.254 --> 00:33:27.879
And before I knew
it. I couldn't walk

584
00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:30.507
and Brittney had
ordered me a ride home.

585
00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:33.969
- Ride for Natalie?

586
00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:37.389
- But I didn't order a Van.

587
00:33:37.474 --> 00:33:38.181
- No. I checked the app.

588
00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:39.182
This is your ride.

589
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:39.933
Mike. right?

590
00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:41.685
- Yeah.

591
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.853
- You know what?

592
00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:44.856
I'm just gonna go
back into the party.

593
00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:47.357
- Listen.

594
00:33:47.401 --> 00:33:47.899
Hey. we want to make sure
you get home safe. okay?

595
00:33:47.985 --> 00:33:49.151
- No. it's okay.

596
00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:50.505
Natalie.
you're really drunk.

597
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:51.028
- I can just get a ride
from somebody else.

598
00:33:51.113 --> 00:33:51.987
No. I'm okay.

599
00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:52.612
- We're here.
- I'm okay.

600
00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:53.238
Stop it!

601
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:54.323
Let go of me!

602
00:33:55.951 --> 00:33:57.868
Wait. wait!

603
00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:16.595
No!

604
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.949
Help me. please!
- Calm down.

605
00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:19.222
Go. come on. come on!

606
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.430
Brittney!

607
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:29.775
- Did those men force
Brittney into the Van too?

608
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.735
- They left her outside.

609
00:34:33.447 --> 00:34:35.906
- You think they killed her?

610
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.784
No. no. no. no. no.

611
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:40.744
Brittney can't be dead.

612
00:34:40.788 --> 00:34:43.580
- But I heard them hitting her.

613
00:34:43.624 --> 00:34:45.332
- We can't think like that.

614
00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:47.918
Brittney's the last person
to see us get into the Van.

615
00:34:48.003 --> 00:34:49.252
She's the only person

616
00:34:49.296 --> 00:34:51.376
that could tell the others
what happened to us.

617
00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:54.925
- What if she's in on it?

618
00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:59.930
- Why would you even think that?

619
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.642
Brittney doesn't hurt people.

620
00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:05.847
She's not someone who
betrays her friends.

621
00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:09.439
- You mean she's not like me?

622
00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:14.945
- Brittney is alive.

623
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:15.737
- But what if...

624
00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:16.823
- No what if's.

625
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.281
I know Brittney.

626
00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:19.866
She went to get help.

627
00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:22.619
We just have to hang in
there until they get here.

628
00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:23.495
- Here?

629
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.622
We don't know where here is.

630
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:27.958
How will Brittney
or anyone else know?

631
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:51.648
- Hello.

632
00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:52.816
- Hi. miss bishop.

633
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:54.777
- Hi. Taylor.

634
00:35:55.863 --> 00:35:56.863
Sam.

635
00:35:57.865 --> 00:35:58.989
Got a new haircut.

636
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:02.951
- We just came by to see
if April made it home okay.

637
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.996
- I thought she was
riding with you.

638
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.955
- Sam was gonna take her home.

639
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.184
but then we got separated.

640
00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:09.408
- Well. she ordered a ride.

641
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:10.854
but the driver said she
never showed up. so.

642
00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:12.438
- And she's not
answering her phone.

643
00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:14.582
And I tried knocking and
I tried the doorbell.

644
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:15.922
but no one answers.

645
00:36:16.008 --> 00:36:17.277
- When is the last
time you saw her?

646
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:19.718
- I don't know. it's been a...
- Couple hours?

647
00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:20.844
- A couple of hours?

648
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:23.137
- I know. I'm sorry.

649
00:36:23.182 --> 00:36:24.284
I should've called you.

650
00:36:24.308 --> 00:36:25.891
I'm sure she's fine.

651
00:36:25.976 --> 00:36:27.350
She's gotta be. right?

652
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:32.856
April. April?

653
00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:40.238
- Oh. we gotta turn
off this freezer.

654
00:36:40.324 --> 00:36:41.865
- How?

655
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.117
- I don't know. but
we gotta find a way.

656
00:36:44.203 --> 00:36:45.410
- April. baby.

657
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:46.514
call me as soon as you
get this message. okay?

658
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:47.662
I'm not gonna be upset.

659
00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:49.586
I just need to
know where you are.

660
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.791
I need to go find her.

661
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:52.792
- Well. hey. let's track her
phone. find her that way.

662
00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:54.044
Yeah?

663
00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:55.148
It's pretty simple.

664
00:36:55.172 --> 00:36:56.252
Can I use your phone?

665
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:58.257
Okay.

666
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.471
- At least he's
good for something.

667
00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:05.889
- There's this app that
reverse tracks your phone. so.

668
00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:14.981
What's wrong?

669
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:16.566
What's wrong?

670
00:37:16.652 --> 00:37:17.692
- It's just...

671
00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:18.610
Sam!

672
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:20.403
- She's at layman family farms.

673
00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:25.700
- What is she doing there?

674
00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:26.744
Come on.

675
00:37:34.086 --> 00:37:35.961
- What happened? What's wrong?

676
00:37:36.046 --> 00:37:39.089
- Muscle spasm from
when I fell earlier.

677
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:52.019
Ow!

678
00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:54.437
- Sorry.

679
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:56.314
Did I hurt you?

680
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.441
- No. it's okay.
keep doing that.

681
00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:08.285
This reminds me
of the sleepovers

682
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.287
we used to have in middle school

683
00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:12.998
where we'd trade massages

684
00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:17.127
and your mom would help
us put on mud masks.

685
00:38:18.255 --> 00:38:20.463
- Like a sixth grader
needs a facial.

686
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:28.096
- Your mom was so cool.

687
00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:31.516
She was the best
dance teacher in town.

688
00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:33.643
She really should
have gone to Broadway.

689
00:38:34.563 --> 00:38:35.563
How is she?

690
00:38:36.148 --> 00:38:37.480
- I don't know.

691
00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:39.377
must be going out of
her mind right now.

692
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:43.987
- Good. then she'll call the
police and try and find us.

693
00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:50.327
I miss your mom.

694
00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:54.998
She always made me feel like
I was a part of your family.

695
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:58.169
That's until the
whole thing with Sam.

696
00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:03.381
April. I'm so sorry.

697
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:06.968
- Natalie. right
now is not the time.

698
00:39:07.054 --> 00:39:09.346
- Sam and I never
slept together.

699
00:39:13.185 --> 00:39:15.935
But I saw
you two in the hot tub.

700
00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:17.187
- Doing nothing.

701
00:39:18.482 --> 00:39:20.565
- Why didn't you deny it?

702
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:23.860
- I did. but you
didn't want to hear it.

703
00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:26.716
- Wouldn't you be insecure too

704
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.700
if your best friend
looked like you?

705
00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:32.077
- If anyone should
be jealous of anyone.

706
00:39:32.162 --> 00:39:33.870
it's me about you.
- Stop.

707
00:39:33.914 --> 00:39:36.206
- If you really think
I was gonna throw away

708
00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:37.874
our whole entire friendship

709
00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:39.729
over a one night
stand in a hot tub.

710
00:39:39.753 --> 00:39:42.712
then you never really
knew me at all.

711
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.928
- Sam was dancing
with Taylor all night.

712
00:39:51.264 --> 00:39:53.223
Listen. I know it's Sam.

713
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.060
But I thought I lost you.

714
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:05.902
I can't think about
this right now.

715
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:08.196
We just have to figure out
how to get out of here.

716
00:40:09.282 --> 00:40:11.241
We're just getting colder.

717
00:40:35.642 --> 00:40:37.725
- It says we're just
a quarter mile away.

718
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:40.603
Should be around that corner.

719
00:40:41.731 --> 00:40:42.939
- I'm sure she's okay.

720
00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:44.210
A lot of kids just like
to get freaky out here

721
00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:45.461
at the end of summer. you know?

722
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:49.612
- Sam. please. stop talking.

723
00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:51.866
- Stop.

724
00:40:54.286 --> 00:40:55.785
That's Brittney's car.

725
00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:14.679
- See. I told you.

726
00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:16.325
they're just out here
to have some fun.

727
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:17.807
- Well. where are they then?

728
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.312
Wait. let me get my flashlight.

729
00:41:34.743 --> 00:41:35.970
- The tracker says the signal

730
00:41:35.994 --> 00:41:37.874
is coming from
somewhere in there.

731
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.707
Come on.

732
00:41:42.792 --> 00:41:44.834
- I'm not going in there.

733
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.380
- Come on.

734
00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:10.652
- The tracker says the signal's
coming from over there.

735
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:12.403
April!

736
00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:15.240
- Wait. miss bishop. quiet.

737
00:42:15.325 --> 00:42:16.032
- April!

738
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:16.824
- Miss bishop. quiet.

739
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.326
- Don't shush me!

740
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:20.537
- No. maybe April
doesn't want to be found.

741
00:42:20.622 --> 00:42:23.039
Okay. maybe her and Brit-Brit
met some guys at the party

742
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.894
and they came back
here to keep partying.

743
00:42:24.918 --> 00:42:26.354
- Sam.
- You get it?

744
00:42:26.378 --> 00:42:27.522
- How long did you
date my daughter?

745
00:42:27.546 --> 00:42:29.190
- I don't know.
maybe five months.

746
00:42:29.214 --> 00:42:31.172
- Well. in that
maybe five months.

747
00:42:31.258 --> 00:42:33.716
did you learn anything
about who she is?

748
00:42:33.802 --> 00:42:35.385
Because if you did.

749
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:37.031
you would know that she
doesn't behave like this.

750
00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:39.847
Maybe you don't
know her the same way I do.

751
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.811
- Why don't you go
back to the car?

752
00:42:42.686 --> 00:42:44.622
Taylor and I can follow
the signal by ourselves.

753
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:45.728
You are not helping.

754
00:42:53.947 --> 00:42:54.947
April!

755
00:43:02.414 --> 00:43:03.871
- Damn it. April.

756
00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:05.155
you were a pain when we dated

757
00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:07.128
and you're even
more of a pain now.

758
00:43:09.296 --> 00:43:10.378
April!

759
00:43:12.257 --> 00:43:13.257
Brittney!

760
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:20.263
What a waste of time.

761
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:32.900
April!

762
00:43:38.408 --> 00:43:39.449
April!

763
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:07.977
- Did you hear that?

764
00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:09.063
- Hear what?

765
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.660
Come on.

766
00:44:23.745 --> 00:44:25.745
- I don't think we
should be over here.

767
00:44:27.499 --> 00:44:28.893
- What are you
talking about. Taylor?

768
00:44:28.917 --> 00:44:31.334
- We should go back.
- No.

769
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:33.002
We have to look. okay?

770
00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:35.338
You go look up there. okay?

771
00:44:35.382 --> 00:44:36.673
- What?

772
00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:39.801
- Just call me if
you see something.

773
00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:53.417
- Sorry.

774
00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:56.252
I didn't find anything.

775
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:08.932
Now what?

776
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:13.269
Maybe she's in there.

777
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:16.606
- Wait.

778
00:46:19.152 --> 00:46:21.611
If she's in there. I want
to be the one to find her.

779
00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:55.269
- Stay back!

780
00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:58.397
I'm not gonna let
you hurt her anymore!

781
00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:02.985
- No one's going to hurt you.

782
00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:06.280
You're in my hands now.

783
00:47:18.878 --> 00:47:20.169
Where are they?

784
00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:26.843
- Stupid app says
she's out here.

785
00:47:30.974 --> 00:47:32.598
- Miss bishop.

786
00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:35.518
does the app let you send
an alert to April's phone?

787
00:47:36.688 --> 00:47:37.688
- I don't know.

788
00:47:37.772 --> 00:47:39.188
Here. let's try.

789
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.528
It's coming from over there.

790
00:47:48.074 --> 00:47:49.074
April!

791
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:16.976
That's April's phone.

792
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:19.729
And that's
Brittney's Bylin tulip purse.

793
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:22.523
- They must've come here
after the party like Sam said.

794
00:48:24.944 --> 00:48:28.029
- Miss bishop. I think we
should call the police.

795
00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:29.572
- No. no.

796
00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:30.885
because if we call the police.

797
00:48:30.909 --> 00:48:32.011
that means something is wrong.

798
00:48:32.035 --> 00:48:33.576
and nothing is wrong.

799
00:48:33.661 --> 00:48:35.347
- Yeah. but if something did
happen to April and Brittney.

800
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:37.288
then we could be in danger too.

801
00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:40.082
- Just give me 15 more minutes
to try to find her. okay?

802
00:48:41.628 --> 00:48:45.254
Just 15 minutes. please.

803
00:48:47.425 --> 00:48:48.425
- Okay.

804
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.445
- This freezer shouldn't
even be on right now.

805
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:10.988
Turn it off please.

806
00:49:11.074 --> 00:49:12.448
- I'm not a handyman.

807
00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:17.828
- Okay. well.

808
00:49:17.914 --> 00:49:20.314
we'll just have to get this
over very quickly. won't we?

809
00:49:21.751 --> 00:49:23.668
- Get what over?

810
00:49:23.753 --> 00:49:24.460
- Just trust me.

811
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:25.670
Everything is okay.

812
00:49:25.755 --> 00:49:26.963
- Can I get some water?

813
00:49:28.174 --> 00:49:29.423
- I'll be with you soon.

814
00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:31.801
- I'm kind of thirsty too.

815
00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:36.347
- Lift up your top.

816
00:49:36.432 --> 00:49:38.140
- What. why?

817
00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:39.703
- I want to make
sure you weren't hurt

818
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:40.935
when they put you in here.

819
00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:43.646
- What is this examination for?

820
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:45.606
Please just let us go home.

821
00:49:45.692 --> 00:49:48.401
- Just do what the doctor says!

822
00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:49.486
- Please.

823
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.780
It's almost over.

824
00:50:17.432 --> 00:50:18.681
- I didn't pick her.

825
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:20.016
- Pick me for what?

826
00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:22.393
- Is this scar from
appendix surgery?

827
00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:23.664
Yes. when I was nine.

828
00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:24.562
Any
other surgeries?

829
00:50:24.647 --> 00:50:25.887
- No. and why are you asking?

830
00:50:26.983 --> 00:50:28.357
- I'll tell you everything

831
00:50:28.443 --> 00:50:30.403
after I make sure
your friend is okay.

832
00:51:19.494 --> 00:51:22.870
- Miss bishop. it's
been 10 minutes.

833
00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:27.291
- I said I needed 15 minutes.

834
00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:29.085
Just give me five more minutes.

835
00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:37.259
She's not here. is she?

836
00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:48.145
Oh my god.

837
00:51:48.231 --> 00:51:50.940
What's happening to my baby?

838
00:51:53.194 --> 00:51:54.777
- Come on. miss bishop.

839
00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:59.782
Let's go back to the
car and find Sam.

840
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:01.117
And we can call the police.

841
00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:03.869
Okay?

842
00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:04.620
Come on.

843
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:05.746
Come on. let's go.

844
00:52:11.379 --> 00:52:14.296
- It hurts too much
where he hit me.

845
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.640
- I didn't hit
her. Mike hit her.

846
00:52:18.344 --> 00:52:19.760
but she was trying to run.

847
00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:27.017
- Show me where it hurts.

848
00:52:27.103 --> 00:52:28.103
- Back here.

849
00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:35.819
- Run!

850
00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:38.989
Run!

851
00:52:41.534 --> 00:52:42.534
- Get her!

852
00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:48.455
That was a mistake!

853
00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:38.917
- Come on out. come on
out wherever you are.

854
00:55:39.003 --> 00:55:40.169
April. you here?

855
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:43.714
No. nowhere? Great.

856
00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.359
- Sam?
- Brittney?

857
00:55:47.136 --> 00:55:49.011
- Sam. what are you doing here?

858
00:55:49.055 --> 00:55:51.513
- Just looking
for you and April.

859
00:55:51.557 --> 00:55:53.724
- What makes you
think she's with me?

860
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.476
- We tracked her phone out here.

861
00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:56.519
- We?

862
00:55:57.313 --> 00:55:59.021
- What are you doing out here?

863
00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:00.147
My car broke down.

864
00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:02.316
I called my brother
to come get me.

865
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:03.192
- Oh. your car.

866
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:04.193
Well. couldn't April fix that?

867
00:56:04.278 --> 00:56:04.943
- No. she can't.

868
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:06.487
She's...

869
00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:09.198
Sam. I need you to leave
before he gets here.

870
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:10.677
- Well. I didn't even
know you had a brother.

871
00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:11.367
- He's been gone.

872
00:56:11.452 --> 00:56:12.910
He lives with my dad.

873
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:14.139
Sam. I'm gonna explain
everything tomorrow. okay?

874
00:56:14.163 --> 00:56:15.891
All I need you to do
right now is leave.

875
00:56:15.915 --> 00:56:17.809
- I'm not going anywhere
until I know where April is.

876
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:19.041
- Sam. get out of here.

877
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:21.210
- Why. what's wrong?
- Sam. run now.

878
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:22.211
- Why?
- No. Sam. please.

879
00:56:22.254 --> 00:56:23.003
My brother is crazy.

880
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:24.213
Please. Sam. now.

881
00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:25.089
Sam. he's crazy.

882
00:56:25.174 --> 00:56:26.485
Mike!
- Get away from her!

883
00:56:26.509 --> 00:56:28.550
Get off of her!

884
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:30.386
- Mike. stop. Mike!

885
00:56:31.222 --> 00:56:32.471
Mike!

886
00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:33.722
Mike. stop it!

887
00:56:33.808 --> 00:56:34.808
Stop. Mike!

888
00:56:37.645 --> 00:56:39.061
Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike. stop!

889
00:56:39.146 --> 00:56:40.979
Mike. stop. please. please!

890
00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:41.814
You'll kill him!

891
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:43.065
Mike. please!

892
00:56:50.783 --> 00:56:51.802
Mike. why did you do that?

893
00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:52.866
Why did you do that?

894
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.785
Sam didn't know anything.

895
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.098
- I couldn't take that chance.

896
00:56:56.122 --> 00:56:57.037
Come on. help me
get him to the Van.

897
00:56:57.123 --> 00:56:58.205
- No. no. no. no.

898
00:56:58.249 --> 00:56:59.081
I did my part. I did my part.

899
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:00.352
I got you April and Natalie

900
00:57:00.376 --> 00:57:01.208
and I put their stuff
in the boathouse.

901
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:02.793
- Brittney. Brittney. Brittney.

902
00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:04.022
what did you think was gonna
happen to your little friends

903
00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:05.565
when the doc cut 'em
open. huh. huh. huh?

904
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:06.422
- You said that it was gonna
look like a boating accident.

905
00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:07.673
but they'd still live. Mike.

906
00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:08.799
they'd still live!

907
00:57:08.884 --> 00:57:10.070
They weren't supposed
to die. Mike!

908
00:57:10.094 --> 00:57:11.254
- Just stop freaking out!

909
00:57:11.303 --> 00:57:12.697
Would you please
stop freaking out?!

910
00:57:12.721 --> 00:57:13.303
- I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

911
00:57:13.389 --> 00:57:14.263
- calm down!

912
00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:15.450
I don't want to do this please.

913
00:57:15.474 --> 00:57:16.674
I don't want anyone to die.

914
00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:18.809
Please. please. Mike.

915
00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:19.643
I don't want to do this.

916
00:57:19.728 --> 00:57:21.145
I don't want to do this.

917
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.979
Hey!

918
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:24.148
- Don't be scared.

919
00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:25.399
I got you. okay?

920
00:57:25.443 --> 00:57:27.609
Listen. I got you.
I got you. okay?

921
00:57:27.695 --> 00:57:29.214
Listen. listen to me.
listen to me. listen to me.

922
00:57:29.238 --> 00:57:31.780
Tomorrow. tomorrow. tomorrow.
we're gonna be on a plane.

923
00:57:31.866 --> 00:57:32.656
We're gonna be in a new city.

924
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:33.760
There's gonna be new faces.

925
00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:34.533
No one's gonna know us.

926
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:35.784
Nobody's gonna know us.

927
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:36.785
Does that sound nice. huh?
- Yeah.

928
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:37.619
- Huh?
- Yeah.

929
00:57:37.663 --> 00:57:39.224
- Yeah?
- Yeah. yeah.

930
00:57:39.248 --> 00:57:40.289
- Okay. okay.

931
00:57:40.374 --> 00:57:42.040
Right. okay. so.

932
00:57:42.126 --> 00:57:45.085
help me get him
in the Van. okay?

933
00:57:45.171 --> 00:57:47.212
- Yeah. yeah.
- Okay? Okay?

934
00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:49.465
Come on. come on. come on.

935
00:57:57.016 --> 00:57:58.016
Mike.

936
00:58:14.241 --> 00:58:15.824
- I'm sorry I tried.

937
00:58:17.244 --> 00:58:18.827
I couldn't. I tried.

938
00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:21.830
- Why isn't Mike back?

939
00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:25.334
Do I have to do everything?

940
00:58:33.552 --> 00:58:34.885
- No.

941
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.303
- I just want you to know

942
00:58:36.388 --> 00:58:38.847
what I'm about to
do is your fault.

943
00:58:44.605 --> 00:58:46.313
- No. please!

944
00:58:46.398 --> 00:58:48.524
Don't close the door!
- No!

945
00:58:49.735 --> 00:58:52.694
We won't tell anybody
that you did this!

946
00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:56.990
- Focus. okay.

947
00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:57.824
Come on.

948
00:58:57.868 --> 00:58:59.201
Focus.

949
00:59:16.345 --> 00:59:17.447
- What are you looking at?

950
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:18.471
- Nothing.

951
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:21.765
- You sure no one
else is with him?

952
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:22.850
Yeah.

953
00:59:24.353 --> 00:59:25.394
Let's get going.

954
01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.987
- Are they coming back for us?

955
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.658
- When they do. we'll be ready.

956
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.355
- What is that for?

957
01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:35.941
- Insulation.

958
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.359
Come on.

959
01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:49.371
- Miss bishop. this is crazy.

960
01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:50.872
We can't just follow them.

961
01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.519
- That's the only way
we're gonna find her.

962
01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:54.710
- Yeah. but the police
should handle this.

963
01:01:56.505 --> 01:02:00.841
Hello. hello. is anybody there?

964
01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.259
Damn it.

965
01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:03.446
- What's the matter.
you can get through?

966
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.387
- No. it just keeps cutting out.

967
01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.367
The service out here is
practically nonexistent.

968
01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.058
How does anybody out
here use their phone?

969
01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.184
- Maybe they don't.

970
01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.415
Maybe that's why they
brought her out here

971
01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.313
so that she can't.

972
01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.710
- Well then the police
should handle this.

973
01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.586
Can't you just drive to
a station or something?

974
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.527
- Taylor. the police
cannot find her

975
01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:22.404
if they don't know where she is!

976
01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.407
Just keep calling.

977
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.532
You'll get through.

978
01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.783
- To keep your body heat.

979
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:35.477
- Who taught you how
to do this stuff?

980
01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:39.815
- 10-year old.

981
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.404
One of the scouts in my troop.

982
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.659
- Smart kid.

983
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.207
- I was supposed to take her

984
01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:01.586
and the others hiking
tomorrow morning.

985
01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:13.098
- What did you see when
you tried to run away?

986
01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:21.356
- It's like

987
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.526
a broken down warehouse.

988
01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:31.324
There's this weird room
with surgical supplies

989
01:04:32.578 --> 01:04:34.536
and a hospital bed.

990
01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:41.877
- Are they gonna operate on us?

991
01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.671
What for?

992
01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:47.133
- No.

993
01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:51.553
We're not gonna find out.

994
01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:53.680
When they open that door.

995
01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:58.518
I'm gonna make a
run for it again.

996
01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:00.979
I don't care if he has a bat.

997
01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.064
Okay?

998
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:06.568
- I'll bust his balls.

999
01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:20.749
No one's coming to
save us. are they?

1000
01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:24.044
- I don't know.

1001
01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:35.221
- Well if we aren't gonna
make it out of here.

1002
01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.724
I have to tell you something.

1003
01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.480
- Natalie.

1004
01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.857
Who cares about that right now?

1005
01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.277
- I bet you're thinking

1006
01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:54.950
if I had to die with someone.

1007
01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:02.624
I'd rather it be anyone
other than Natalie.

1008
01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.262
- I don't think that.

1009
01:06:19.226 --> 01:06:21.101
I'm glad I'm not alone.

1010
01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:25.647
I'm glad you're here with me.

1011
01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:29.734
They're not gonna kill us.

1012
01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:33.571
We can fight back.

1013
01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:35.490
Okay?

1014
01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:36.534
- Okay.

1015
01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.929
- What if she's already dead?

1016
01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:01.725
I'm going in there.

1017
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.310
- No.

1018
01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.104
- Still be alive.

1019
01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.314
- Miss bishop.
what are you doing?

1020
01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.816
- Let go of the door. Taylor.

1021
01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.734
- What are you doing?

1022
01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:12.110
You can't leave me out here.

1023
01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.611
- Listen to me.

1024
01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:14.529
Call the police.

1025
01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:15.864
- I tried.

1026
01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.844
- Keep trying until
you get through.

1027
01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:19.784
If anything happens. just run.

1028
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.661
- And just leave you here?

1029
01:07:21.747 --> 01:07:23.788
- I can't just stay here. Move.

1030
01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:28.668
Keep trying.

1031
01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:29.878
I gotta go.

1032
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:37.886
- We can get jobs on the beach.

1033
01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:43.058
A very hot beach.

1034
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.731
I don't even care if it's humid.

1035
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:54.402
just not like this.

1036
01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.243
What do you think. Nat?

1037
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500
Natalie?

1038
01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:09.834
Come on.

1039
01:08:13.048 --> 01:08:14.048
Come on.

1040
01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:15.757
Pick.

1041
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.513
Key west or Mexico?

1042
01:08:26.686 --> 01:08:27.936
Natalie. come on!

1043
01:08:28.897 --> 01:08:29.938
Wake up!

1044
01:08:32.025 --> 01:08:34.692
I told you not to fall asleep.

1045
01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:41.242
Come on!

1046
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.959
I wasn't really mad at you.

1047
01:08:52.838 --> 01:08:55.922
I just wanted you
to feel how I felt.

1048
01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:04.472
I know that's some
passive aggressive bs. but

1049
01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.812
wake up and tell
me what a stupid.

1050
01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:15.233
stubborn idiot I am
for not believing you.

1051
01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.320
You can even hit me if you want.

1052
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:21.991
Please!

1053
01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:24.743
Wake up.

1054
01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:33.585
Don't leave me alone here.

1055
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:55.982
- You can still use him. right?

1056
01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:59.944
- Maybe. if you hadn't
beat him so severely.

1057
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.987
- It wasn't my fault.

1058
01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:01.863
He showed up.

1059
01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.865
- And how did he just show up?

1060
01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:05.200
Was anyone with him?

1061
01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:06.512
- No. No.
- You sure?

1062
01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.702
- Yes.

1063
01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:08.703
Okay. Brittney said
that it was just...

1064
01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:10.016
- I should believe your sister?

1065
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:10.872
- Uh. yes. Sam was
a friend of mine.

1066
01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:13.291
- Brittney. stay out of this.

1067
01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.687
- How did he know
where to find you?

1068
01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:15.960
- Okay. leave her out of this.

1069
01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:17.481
Brittney. go wait
in the hallway.

1070
01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:18.796
Go! Now!

1071
01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.904
- Your sister looks a
little bit unstable.

1072
01:10:22.928 --> 01:10:24.614
I thought you said
I could trust her.

1073
01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:26.054
- You can.

1074
01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.378
Okay. Brittney will do whatever
the hell I tell her to do.

1075
01:10:34.606 --> 01:10:39.400
- Do you know how long it
took me to work all this up?

1076
01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:43.905
The plane. the buyers.

1077
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.908
- I did exactly as you asked
and got exactly what you need.

1078
01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:48.112
Very. very specific girls

1079
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.931
that nobody would notice
if they went missing.

1080
01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:51.162
And it was really easy to do

1081
01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:53.142
because all my sister's
friends are losers.

1082
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:54.727
- I am not going
back to prison again.

1083
01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.960
- You think I want
to go back there?

1084
01:10:57.045 --> 01:11:00.588
- Your sister gets a conscience
and runs to the police.

1085
01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:01.674
we both could.

1086
01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:06.511
- I told you I can handle her.

1087
01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.230
What about him?

1088
01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:22.026
- Maybe 10k for his corneas.

1089
01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:24.320
The rest of him is
pretty much junk.

1090
01:11:24.406 --> 01:11:28.074
Right now. we need to
focus on the real money.

1091
01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.534
Put him in the back.

1092
01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.255
- I wasn't gonna let them out.

1093
01:11:51.308 --> 01:11:53.808
- Don't you lie to me!

1094
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.746
- I just want to make
sure they're okay.

1095
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.645
Mike. please don't hurt me!

1096
01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:04.171
You wouldn't let that doctor
do anything bad to me.

1097
01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:05.111
would you?

1098
01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:05.903
- That depends.

1099
01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:07.572
You gonna behave?

1100
01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.282
- I did what you asked.

1101
01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:10.950
I got the girls.

1102
01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:12.327
I even helped you with Sam.

1103
01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:14.620
- You did.

1104
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.788
I'm really proud of you.

1105
01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.018
What we did tonight
took real guts.

1106
01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:18.166
- So you won't hurt me?

1107
01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:21.419
- Do you love me. Brittney?

1108
01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:23.881
- Yes.

1109
01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.050
- Prove it.

1110
01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.969
Now. go wait outside
and get some fresh air.

1111
01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:37.185
Let the doc and I
finish up. okay?

1112
01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:07.382
- Don't scream or
so help me god.

1113
01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:10.051
- Miss bishop.
- Where is she?

1114
01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:19.644
- Jeez. why is it
so cold in here?

1115
01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:22.063
- The fans are on.

1116
01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:23.981
- Why didn't you turn them off?

1117
01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:25.566
- They broke it

1118
01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:27.892
and I figured they just
needed to learn a lesson.

1119
01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:29.146
- Ladies. who's first. huh?

1120
01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:30.863
Come on. wake 'em up.

1121
01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:31.949
Let's go.

1122
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:34.367
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

1123
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:35.576
Let's go. come on.

1124
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.334
What?

1125
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:45.920
- They're not breathing.

1126
01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.465
- What. no.

1127
01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:54.971
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1128
01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:57.890
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1129
01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:01.102
- Miss bishop.

1130
01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:01.936
- Is April in there?

1131
01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:03.271
- Miss bishop. please.

1132
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.731
- You need to tell me
where she is right now.

1133
01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.942
What is going on?

1134
01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:08.986
- I can't.

1135
01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.112
- I'm going.

1136
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.113
- Miss bishop. you can't.
- Let go of me!

1137
01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.448
- Miss bishop.

1138
01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:14.677
my brother's gonna kill
you if you go in there.

1139
01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:15.761
He's gonna kill you
just like he killed Sam.

1140
01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.096
Miss bishop. you
can't go in there.

1141
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.139
I didn't want to do this.

1142
01:14:18.163 --> 01:14:19.245
He made me do this.

1143
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:20.975
I didn't want to
do it. miss bishop.

1144
01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:22.206
He made he do it.

1145
01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:22.790
- Didn't want to
do what. Brittney?

1146
01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:23.834
- I can't.

1147
01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.086
- We make our own choices.

1148
01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.048
We make good choices
and we make bad choices.

1149
01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.592
but they're ours to make.

1150
01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:34.302
Now. I don't know what you did

1151
01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:37.366
to get April involved
with your brother tonight.

1152
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.098
but it's not too late.

1153
01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.433
We can fix this.

1154
01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.518
You need to help me
find my daughter.

1155
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:44.980
Do you hear me?

1156
01:14:46.024 --> 01:14:47.024
- I can't.

1157
01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:53.654
- I need to find my daughter.

1158
01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:54.698
- I'm sorry.

1159
01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.290
Miss bishop. wait.

1160
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.417
Miss bishop. you don't
know where she is.

1161
01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:10.839
But I do.

1162
01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.406
They
gonna be okay. doc?

1163
01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.361
- They're both breathing.

1164
01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:36.906
but the girl with the appendix
scar has a very low pulse.

1165
01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:38.677
- Should we get them
out of the freezer?

1166
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:39.909
- And put them where. huh?

1167
01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:41.263
This is the only secure
place in the warehouse

1168
01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:42.495
we can lock them up.

1169
01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:44.350
- We're not taking
anyone anywhere.

1170
01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:45.706
I am not leaving here tonight

1171
01:15:45.792 --> 01:15:47.712
without something
to show for it.

1172
01:15:47.794 --> 01:15:49.396
- I was only
looking out for you.

1173
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.003
- By freezing them to death?

1174
01:15:51.089 --> 01:15:52.191
- I didn't know it was
gonna get so cold in here.

1175
01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.756
- It is sub zero temperatures.

1176
01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:55.152
They are human bodies.
- Hey. guys.

1177
01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.342
Will you shut up?

1178
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:05.309
- April. April. April. wake up.

1179
01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:31.646
- Understood. we'll be there.

1180
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.338
The jet is fueled and
ready for takeoff.

1181
01:17:37.362 --> 01:17:39.131
I figure two hours
for the surgeries.

1182
01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:41.405
one hour to dispose
of the bodies.

1183
01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:44.575
We should be on our
way to Mexico by dawn.

1184
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.329
And then we never have
to see each other again.

1185
01:17:48.373 --> 01:17:49.533
- After we get our money.

1186
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:51.750
- Of course.

1187
01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.420
How are her vitals?

1188
01:17:58.049 --> 01:17:59.465
- Pulse is steady.

1189
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.550
The oxygen worked.

1190
01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:02.926
- Then let's begin.

1191
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.530
- Oh my god. my baby.

1192
01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:26.493
My baby.

1193
01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:31.122
What is going on?

1194
01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:33.541
Where is April?

1195
01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.396
- I begged them
to take me first.

1196
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.294
but they took April.

1197
01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.843
- Where is she?
- They took April instead.

1198
01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:48.556
- I knew I couldn't trust you!

1199
01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:06.490
Let go!

1200
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.149
- Get his arms.

1201
01:19:40.193 --> 01:19:42.296
Get his arms so we can
put him in the freezer.

1202
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.652
Help us. Brittney.

1203
01:19:43.738 --> 01:19:45.196
Grab his feet.

1204
01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.906
Brittney. grab his feet!

1205
01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:52.536
Brittney. help us.

1206
01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.622
Help us!

1207
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:15.518
Brittney. come on.

1208
01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:16.603
Brittney!

1209
01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.146
- Close the door.

1210
01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:20.940
- Brittney. come on!

1211
01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.942
- Please.

1212
01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:24.527
Brittney. please.

1213
01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:25.903
- Close it now!

1214
01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:33.285
- Brittney. please. please.

1215
01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:47.341
- What's taking so long?

1216
01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:49.510
My friend is dead.

1217
01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:51.971
Just please get here.

1218
01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:57.726
- Relax.

1219
01:20:57.812 --> 01:21:00.145
This will all be over
in a few minutes.

1220
01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:19.123
- She's not unconscious yet.

1221
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.352
- We're running late already.

1222
01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.478
I can't wait any longer.

1223
01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:22.502
Hold her down.

1224
01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:35.742
Get away
from my daughter!

1225
01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:36.533
- You win.

1226
01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:38.410
Do it. kill me.

1227
01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:42.122
What are you waiting for?!

1228
01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:44.751
Kill me.

1229
01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:50.422
- No. I want you to pay for
what you've done and everyone...

1230
01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:57.221
- Oh god. baby.

1231
01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:03.978
Why?

1232
01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:06.563
Why did you do this?

1233
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:07.649
Why her?

1234
01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:11.266
- I told them to get me
girls that didn't matter.

1235
01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:14.196
girls that no one
would really miss.

1236
01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:23.330
Nobody cares about
girls like her!

1237
01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:45.887
- He can't hurt me anymore.

1238
01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:49.690
He can't hurt anyone anymore.

1239
01:24:36.614 --> 01:24:37.654
Brittney?

1240
01:24:38.866 --> 01:24:40.026
- What are you doing here?

1241
01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.244
- We came to see our friend.

1242
01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:46.998
- Friend.

1243
01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:49.770
I thought you'd never
want to see me again.

1244
01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:52.086
- We just wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

1245
01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:55.965
- I'm okay.

1246
01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:59.009
I hate myself most days.

1247
01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:01.095
Plenty enough for all of you.

1248
01:25:02.807 --> 01:25:04.047
- We don't hate you. Brittney.

1249
01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:08.060
If it wasn't for you.
we wouldn't be alive.

1250
01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:10.271
- Thank you.

1251
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:17.903
- Of course. it's gonna take
some time for forgiveness.

1252
01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:21.365
- But true friendship
is worth fighting for.

1253
01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:26.286
We brought you something.

1254
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:35.462
- You're stronger
than you think.

1255
01:25:35.506 --> 01:25:38.799
- Yeah. we all are.

1256
01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:42.697
April and I would
have never been put at risk

1257
01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:45.430
if it wasn't for the surgeon
hired to take our organs.

1258
01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:46.890
That's why we ask you

1259
01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:48.976
to keep a close
on your colleagues

1260
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:50.956
or any others in
the medical field

1261
01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.063
tempted to get
involved in this crime.

1262
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:55.983
- If there are no surgeons
to perform these operations.

1263
01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:59.653
then we can derail new
instances of organ trafficking.

1264
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:03.073
The traffickers
specifically target

1265
01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:05.075
women like Natalie and me.

1266
01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:06.618
- Women of color.

1267
01:26:06.704 --> 01:26:08.745
- People no one
thinks will be missed.

1268
01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.539
Natalie and I were lucky

1269
01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:13.625
because we had
the love of my mom

1270
01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:17.963
and our friends to not
let us be a statistic.
