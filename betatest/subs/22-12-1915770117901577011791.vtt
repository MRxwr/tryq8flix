1
00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.210
This is Zane
Kowalski with highlights

2
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.462
from the Orange Bowl
Stadium in Miami.

3
00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:17.925
Wearing white jerseys we have
the Army. with Navy in red.

4
00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:20.177
So we have a first
down for the sailors.

5
00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:22.805
Center hike to Jim Hooper.
Navy's all-star quarterback.

6
00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:24.723
Let's go Army!

7
00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:28.268
Navy six. Army
zero as Army kicks to Navy.

8
00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:31.064
It's a long. high kick
almost to the 20 yard line.

9
00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:34.150
received by number
45. Navy fastback.

10
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.152
And look at him go!

11
00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:39.406
He's at the 50 yard line.
down to Army's 30. 20.

12
00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:43.035
he's going to score
and there it is!

13
00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:44.078
Yay!

14
00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:45.412
Touchdown. Army.

15
00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:49.291
That was an 80 yard run
by this boy who was born

16
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.463
in Venice. Italy who holds
the season league record.

17
00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:55.298
Place your money on
Army. take it from me.

18
00:02:55.298 --> 00:02:57.635
I got inside information.

19
00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.720
Navy's just a bunch of cripples.

20
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.559
Never got the point in
beating a dead horse.

21
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.060
Now it's
Army fighting back

22
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.979
and we have a first down
on Navy's 10 yard line

23
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.648
and center hikes to Army's
quarterback Casey Johnson

24
00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.275
and he's going to run it.

25
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:14.487
He's across the 10 and it's
Navy's fullback Bruce Navis

26
00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:16.156
who blocks him

27
00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:18.074
and he comes down with
less than a yard to go.

28
00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:19.742
What a game. ladies
and gentlemen.

29
00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:22.872
It's another first down for
Army on Navy's foot yard line.

30
00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:26.041
Center hikes number 12.
Johnson gets the ball

31
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.210
to Donnie Brown
and he fumbles it!

32
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.629
After a great season. Army
seems to be falling apart.

33
00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.339
Navy's in complete
control of the game.

34
00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.134
In 20 years of sportscasting
I've never seen

35
00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:35.760
such a one-sided contest.

36
00:03:39.473 --> 00:03:42.601
What's eating
you. Sister Suzanne?

37
00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:46.272
You didn't want Navy to win. eh?

38
00:03:46.272 --> 00:03:49.775
Oh Johnny. it's just that
I bet 10 dollars on Army.

39
00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:51.235
They told me it was a sure way

40
00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:52.612
to raise funds
for the orphanage.

41
00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:54.155
Right.

42
00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:56.700
It's better to
bet on St. Joseph.

43
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.535
Gambling never pays. kid.

44
00:03:58.535 --> 00:03:59.787
Is that for real. Charlie?

45
00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:01.413
Don't you gamble?

46
00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:02.456
Never.

47
00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:04.166
People that gamble lose.

48
00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:06.378
Personally I like to win.

49
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:43.043
This is no
Sunday trip around the bay.

50
00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:45.504
Those  are moving
and have been taking off

51
00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:46.380
for hours.

52
00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:49.884
The contest is now over.

53
00:04:49.884 --> 00:04:54.889
Second and third
place. .

54
00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.934
He has the race in
his back pocket.

55
00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:01.188
Magnificent.

56
00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:02.481
We're gonna win again.

57
00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:04.567
Ah. wish I could
be so sure. sir.

58
00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:05.860
What do you mean by that?

59
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.153
What does he mean
by that. Sullivan?

60
00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:08.696
Look. our man's in
front out there.

61
00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:12.409
I know he's in front sir.
but he hasn't won yet.

62
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:24.548
Hey .
something ain't working.

63
00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:26.967
the wrong guy's winning.

64
00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:27.801
Get on it.

65
00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:31.931
Hey. greaseball.

66
00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.226
Something ain't working.

67
00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:36.853
The wrong guy's winning.

68
00:05:36.853 --> 00:05:39.439
You know what's gonna happen
if the wrong guy wins.

69
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.149
No. I did everything
like you told.

70
00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:42.610
just wait to see.

71
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:53.330
We
have an upset. folks.

72
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.667
Number 96 the favorite
is out of the race.

73
00:05:57.667 --> 00:05:59.294
It's a real pity his
boat broke down. huh?

74
00:05:59.294 --> 00:06:01.838
Favorite's out of the race.

75
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.427
Damn.

76
00:06:11.224 --> 00:06:12.767
Where is he?

77
00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:14.102
Where is he?

78
00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:15.103
I'll kill him.

79
00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.189
Come on out. let's see ya!

80
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.484
Hey. have you seen
a guy in overalls

81
00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:22.569
with grease on his face?

82
00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.656
Why don't you
go find a mirror?

83
00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:26.200
Hey. I know you.

84
00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:33.040
You're the guy who brought my
boat down here. aren't you?

85
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.583
What's it to you?

86
00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:36.628
What's it. someone's been
fooling with the engine!

87
00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:38.588
I couldn't care less.

88
00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:46.806
Is that beans and onions?

89
00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.724
No.
it's fish and chips.

90
00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:51.227
I like beans and onions.

91
00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:52.728
Hey. you wanna
flip a coin for it?

92
00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:55.398
Heads I win. tails we share it.

93
00:06:59.778 --> 00:07:01.405
I don't gamble.

94
00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:05.200
What's more. I don't like guys
that try to help themselves

95
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.243
to my beans.

96
00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:13.334
Hey. wait a minute. you're
the guy I'm looking for!

97
00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.178
You're the turkey messed
up my engine. aren't you?

98
00:07:22.178 --> 00:07:24.847
Your beef is with those guys.

99
00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:38.488
Stand aside. Samuel.

100
00:07:38.488 --> 00:07:40.199
You were warned to
keep your trap shut!

101
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.575
Hey just a second...

102
00:07:41.575 --> 00:07:43.785
Mind your own business!

103
00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:48.790
Hey. hey come back here!

104
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:54.088
That clown a friend of yours?

105
00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:56.424
I don't have any friends.

106
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.302
Hey. that smells good.

107
00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:00.803
Beans and onions.

108
00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:03.808
I like beans and onions.

109
00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:07.812
Sorry pal. they're mine.

110
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:28.835
I like beans and onions.

111
00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:33.924
Come back here. you stop!

112
00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:38.720
I'm gonna teach you to go
messing around with my motor.

113
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.097
Excuse me Lieutenant.
Admiral O'Connor wants

114
00:08:40.097 --> 00:08:41.933
to speak to you
sir. it's urgent.

115
00:08:41.933 --> 00:08:44.478
Okay. here. put
him in the brig.

116
00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:45.521
Move it.

117
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:48.732
Let him .

118
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.909
Your personal record is
impressive. Lieutenant.

119
00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:01.913
Anapolis. graduated cum laude
in infinitesimal calculus.

120
00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:03.456
winner of last year's
California Classic.

121
00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:06.836
all-American football.
interstate soccer.

122
00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:08.629
Now I don't get this runner
up in the inter-American

123
00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:10.631
middle weight boxing tournament.

124
00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:12.800
How come you didn't
come in first?

125
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.137
Well sir. Carlos
Muzon was first.

126
00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:17.139
Oh. well.

127
00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:22.352
Lieutenant. what I'm about
to say to you is to be

128
00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:24.730
considered top secret.

129
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.317
Now you're probably unaware
that organized crime

130
00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.320
has become a serious threat
to the Navy sports program

131
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.237
in Florida.

132
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:38.913
Unfortunately the local
police force is. well.

133
00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:41.332
not up to our standards.

134
00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:43.417
So we've decided to
clear decks. Lieutenant.

135
00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:45.586
and help out and our personnel
computer has selected

136
00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.671
you for the job.

137
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.424
It'll be risky. yes.

138
00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:52.428
Now. you'll need someone
who knows the ropes

139
00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:56.807
and we found just the man
to use to our advantage.

140
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.607
I've got a feeling I know him.

141
00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:06.193
Well. we're off to
a good start then.

142
00:10:06.193 --> 00:10:08.111
Well he sure didn't
look that pretty.

143
00:10:08.111 --> 00:10:09.780
You mind if I?

144
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.159
Go right
ahead Lieutenant.

145
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:20.291
Yeah. that's him.

146
00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:36.893
Thanks so much. Charlie.

147
00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:38.395
God will reward you.

148
00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:39.688
If it were not for you.

149
00:10:39.688 --> 00:10:42.984
I'd never be able to
get around like this.

150
00:10:42.984 --> 00:10:45.486
Ah it's okay. it's
a pleasure. Sister.

151
00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:47.113
Anything I can do to help you.

152
00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:48.155
You're an angel.

153
00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:49.031
I know.

154
00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:01.796
Look. it's none of my business
but even though the orphanage

155
00:11:01.796 --> 00:11:04.633
is in financial difficulty.

156
00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:06.552
when you get to the race
track don't take a tip

157
00:11:06.552 --> 00:11:08.888
from the first 
who comes along.

158
00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:10.806
Make more selling rosaries.

159
00:11:10.806 --> 00:11:12.975
The Lord moves
in mysterious ways.

160
00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:17.230
Yeah. so do horses when
you get the right odds.

161
00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:21.568
There you go.

162
00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:22.694
Oh wait. Charlie!

163
00:11:22.694 --> 00:11:23.737
Yeah?

164
00:11:23.737 --> 00:11:25.865
How is it you never married?

165
00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:28.075
Well. I. how about you?

166
00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:33.706
Oh. well I married Christ.

167
00:11:33.706 --> 00:11:36.125
You mean I should
marry the boss?

168
00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:37.461
Oh.

169
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:39.713
Right. he's not my type.

170
00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:43.383
Bye. sister.

171
00:11:43.383 --> 00:11:44.426
Bye!

172
00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:45.802
Wave to Charlie!

173
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.976
Bye!

174
00:12:03.197 --> 00:12:04.281
Okay. okay.

175
00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.992
You getting hungry. eh?

176
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.288
Let me pop in this diner
and get something to eat

177
00:12:09.288 --> 00:12:10.748
just down the road.

178
00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:54.588
Hiya. Bob.

179
00:12:55.881 --> 00:12:57.215
Hiya Charlie.

180
00:12:58.175 --> 00:12:59.634
You got any fresh fish?

181
00:12:59.634 --> 00:13:01.303
Yes. we got fish.

182
00:13:12.064 --> 00:13:16.278
He's been playing that same
ball for the past 45 minutes.

183
00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:17.155
Eh.

184
00:13:18.448 --> 00:13:20.158
Give me 35 pounds.

185
00:13:22.327 --> 00:13:24.246
35 pounds of fish?

186
00:13:24.246 --> 00:13:25.664
You heard the man.

187
00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:27.124
And I bet he wants it raw.

188
00:13:27.124 --> 00:13:28.667
Raw?

189
00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:30.753
Is that right. Charlie?

190
00:13:30.753 --> 00:13:33.380
Yeah. I want it raw.

191
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.801
I also want a triple
hamburger and three beers.

192
00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:40.597
And cake with lots
of whipped cream.

193
00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:42.766
Funny. I didn't know that.

194
00:13:42.766 --> 00:13:45.686
You
didn't know what?

195
00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:47.939
That raw fish goes with beer.

196
00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:51.901
I would have chosen a
nice chilled white wine.

197
00:13:55.613 --> 00:13:56.865
Oh. I'm sorry.

198
00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:10.213
Hi.

199
00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.402
Oops!

200
00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:30.319
Good catch.

201
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:34.073
You like onions
and beans. don't you?

202
00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.492
Here you are. Charlie.

203
00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:37.910
Here's your triple hamburger.

204
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.786
Nice.

205
00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:40.998
Hey. how about that.

206
00:14:40.998 --> 00:14:42.374
About what?

207
00:14:42.374 --> 00:14:43.959
I'm up to eight
million points.

208
00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:45.335
Don't you think I deserve a
discount for orange juice?

209
00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:48.630
Yeah sure why not.
10 cents a glass.

210
00:14:56.598 --> 00:14:58.474
Hey. you wanna bet a nickel...

211
00:14:58.474 --> 00:15:00.936
I don't gamble. blue eyes.

212
00:15:06.025 --> 00:15:08.485
I'll bet you a nickel that
I can drink more orange juice

213
00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:10.279
than you can squeeze.

214
00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:12.282
That's impossible.

215
00:15:12.282 --> 00:15:14.034
Impossible!

216
00:15:14.034 --> 00:15:15.577
Come on. I'll bet you a nickel.

217
00:15:15.577 --> 00:15:17.412
Okay. the bet's on.

218
00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.753
I'm full. that's enough. Bob.

219
00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:02.796
You win.

220
00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:03.672
Here.

221
00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:09.178
I'm going back to
the pinball machine.

222
00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:10.429
See that Charlie?

223
00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:13.683
Anyway man. I should
have doubled the stakes.

224
00:16:13.683 --> 00:16:15.477
How many oranges you squeeze?

225
00:16:15.477 --> 00:16:17.062
I don't know.
about 10 I guess.

226
00:16:17.062 --> 00:16:20.315
For five cents. you
got a lot of smarts.

227
00:16:21.483 --> 00:16:22.359
Oy vey.

228
00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:35.081
Two of you stay here.

229
00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:38.502
You two come with me.

230
00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:24.428
Listen you half-assed
little monkey. I've been told

231
00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:28.432
you refuse to have one of our
slot machines in your joint.

232
00:17:28.432 --> 00:17:29.558
You're darn right. I
got a pinball machine.

233
00:17:29.558 --> 00:17:31.102
don't need one.

234
00:17:31.102 --> 00:17:33.563
And pinball machines don't
have our seal of approval.

235
00:17:33.563 --> 00:17:35.815
Talk to them other guys.

236
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.240
Out of the way. you.

237
00:17:44.534 --> 00:17:45.493
Hey sorry.

238
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.082
Hey. hey stop that!

239
00:17:51.082 --> 00:17:53.002
Stop. please. you're
breaking up my business!

240
00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:54.629
How am I gonna explain that?

241
00:17:54.629 --> 00:17:56.005
It's a rented machine!

242
00:17:56.005 --> 00:18:00.051
You broke it. how am
I gonna explain that?

243
00:18:07.977 --> 00:18:09.520
Here you are. Bob.

244
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.813
Thanks. Charlie.

245
00:18:10.813 --> 00:18:12.690
I really wish you
hadn't done that.

246
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.736
It ain't fair to shove the
little guy's face into the cake.

247
00:18:16.736 --> 00:18:19.573
especially when
the cake is mine.

248
00:18:21.658 --> 00:18:22.742
Shh.

249
00:18:22.742 --> 00:18:23.785
Shut up.

250
00:18:23.785 --> 00:18:24.829
Talking to me?

251
00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:25.872
Yeah.

252
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.341
It's a wiseass.

253
00:18:36.341 --> 00:18:37.593
Stick 'em up.

254
00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:40.220
Or you'll look
like Swiss cheese.

255
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.513
You turkeys!

256
00:18:41.513 --> 00:18:43.015
He's holding the
pool cues on you!

257
00:19:12.173 --> 00:19:16.052
Hey blue
eyes. get me a cue ball.

258
00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:26.730
Your nails are filthy.

259
00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.121
Bad boy!

260
00:19:41.121 --> 00:19:41.997
Bad boy!

261
00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:32.845
Let's get the
hell out of here!

262
00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:34.097
Alright already.

263
00:20:34.097 --> 00:20:36.766
I just got smacked.
come on. go go go!

264
00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:39.519
Who put
the phone box there?

265
00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:42.105
Look over your shoulder.
come on. come on!

266
00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:44.066
We're making
a getaway. this isn't

267
00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:45.735
a demolition derby.

268
00:20:47.612 --> 00:20:50.907
I forgot
it wasn't a truck.

269
00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:59.625
Hey. jackpot!

270
00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:03.879
Now you can
pay for the orange juice.

271
00:21:08.343 --> 00:21:09.969
My name's Johnny.

272
00:21:11.262 --> 00:21:13.514
My name's Charlie Firpo.

273
00:21:14.766 --> 00:21:16.142
Charlie Firpo?

274
00:21:17.937 --> 00:21:20.732
The famous Charlie Firpo?

275
00:21:20.732 --> 00:21:23.151
The number one gambler
on the Gulf Coast?

276
00:21:23.151 --> 00:21:24.819
Pleased to meet ya!

277
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:27.490
The pleasure's all yours.

278
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.408
Bob. give me the fish.

279
00:21:30.743 --> 00:21:32.078
Here you are. Charlie.

280
00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:33.371
No. you don't have to do that.

281
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:34.413
Come on. take it.

282
00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:35.998
Okay.

283
00:21:35.998 --> 00:21:38.502
Mr. Firpo. would you mind
giving me a lift to Miami?

284
00:21:38.502 --> 00:21:40.921
I'm going there too.

285
00:21:40.921 --> 00:21:42.589
How'd you know
I'm going to Miami?

286
00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:43.882
Huh?

287
00:21:43.882 --> 00:21:45.509
'Cause that's where
they have the aquarium

288
00:21:45.509 --> 00:21:48.888
with the dolphin and you're
transporting dolphins. so.

289
00:21:48.888 --> 00:21:50.974
How do you know what
I'm carrying in my rig?

290
00:21:50.974 --> 00:21:52.475
How do I know?

291
00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:54.102
Hmm.

292
00:21:54.102 --> 00:21:55.728
By simple deduction.

293
00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:58.731
I figured no matter how
big and ugly you are

294
00:21:58.731 --> 00:22:02.903
you couldn't possibly eat
35 pounds of raw fish.

295
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.824
You're really on
the ball. ain't you?

296
00:22:06.824 --> 00:22:08.075
Well.

297
00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:11.871
How come you don't
know I gave up gambling?

298
00:22:11.871 --> 00:22:14.416
And I don't give
lifts to strangers.

299
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.042
Have a nice walk.

300
00:22:16.042 --> 00:22:17.502
Charlie?

301
00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.921
Wanna bet you're
gonna give me a lift?

302
00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:24.051
I'll put up all I got
from the slot machine.

303
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:26.470
That money's all for Bob.

304
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.888
To cover the damage.

305
00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.182
You're right.

306
00:22:35.565 --> 00:22:37.525
About your offer.

307
00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:41.112
I took the pledge. gave
up betting for good.

308
00:22:41.112 --> 00:22:43.157
But this time I'll
make an exception.

309
00:22:43.157 --> 00:22:44.533
Oh yeah?

310
00:22:44.533 --> 00:22:47.536
If you get me to
give you a lift.

311
00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:53.460
I promise you I'll swallow all
35 pounds of this raw fish.

312
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.502
That's a deal.

313
00:22:54.502 --> 00:22:55.378
Okay.

314
00:22:56.254 --> 00:22:57.881
Bye bye. blue eyes.

315
00:23:07.183 --> 00:23:09.060
You don't like beans and onions?

316
00:25:32.551 --> 00:25:33.886
Got the bags?

317
00:25:55.662 --> 00:25:58.623
Sister I bet you knew I'd show.

318
00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:01.668
Didn't you swear you
wouldn't bet anymore?

319
00:26:01.668 --> 00:26:02.544
Hi there.

320
00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:13.389
Okay ball breaker.

321
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.270
You gonna get out by yourself
or am I gonna throw you out?

322
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.772
I'm surprised at
you. Charlie Firpo.

323
00:26:20.772 --> 00:26:22.274
When a gambler loses
he respects the rules

324
00:26:22.274 --> 00:26:25.027
and I won the bet. didn't I?

325
00:26:25.027 --> 00:26:28.156
I won
the bet. didn't I?

326
00:26:46.133 --> 00:26:47.009
Hold it!

327
00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:51.890
Alright. I haven't
got the heart.

328
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.475
Anyway. it isn't fair
to deprive the dolphins

329
00:26:53.475 --> 00:26:55.226
of their daily bread.

330
00:26:55.226 --> 00:26:56.811
I mean daily fish.

331
00:27:30.683 --> 00:27:34.604
Hey. they're saying
the fish is not fresh!

332
00:27:34.604 --> 00:27:37.148
Don't get mad. I'm
just the interpreter.

333
00:27:37.148 --> 00:27:39.025
I really speak their language.

334
00:27:39.025 --> 00:27:39.901
Wanna see?

335
00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:46.742
Hi there.

336
00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:58.714
No kidding. she says your
driving makes her seasick.

337
00:28:01.258 --> 00:28:02.801
Have a nice day.

338
00:28:02.801 --> 00:28:04.094
Listen blue eyes. you
can talk to the trees

339
00:28:04.094 --> 00:28:05.847
for all I care.

340
00:28:05.847 --> 00:28:08.725
What I'd like to know is
why are you sticking to me

341
00:28:08.725 --> 00:28:10.977
like I was fly paper?

342
00:28:10.977 --> 00:28:14.273
My gypsy granny used to say
it's all written on your hand.

343
00:28:14.273 --> 00:28:15.233
Let me see.

344
00:28:16.568 --> 00:28:17.611
Aha.

345
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:19.863
Born under the sign of Taurus.

346
00:28:19.863 --> 00:28:22.741
Irish father and unknown mother.

347
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:25.995
Bachelor. you're very
shrewd and resourceful.

348
00:28:25.995 --> 00:28:28.789
You've got a kind heart
and you've got a scar

349
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:30.124
on your bottom.

350
00:28:33.085 --> 00:28:36.005
Okay now you
hear this. wiseguy.

351
00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:38.300
You so goldarn smart
then you oughta know

352
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.053
you're running one
heck of a risk.

353
00:28:41.053 --> 00:28:44.014
You quit polluting
my environment.

354
00:28:47.852 --> 00:28:49.771
Look. take it easy.

355
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:51.606
I'm not trying to be funny.

356
00:28:51.606 --> 00:28:53.483
I'm trying to help
you. Charlie Firpo.

357
00:28:53.483 --> 00:28:55.193
Help me?

358
00:28:55.193 --> 00:28:56.027
You bet.

359
00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:00.199
Wanna know something?

360
00:29:00.199 --> 00:29:01.825
No.

361
00:29:01.825 --> 00:29:03.869
I'll tell you anyway.

362
00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:05.204
I read on the palm of your hand

363
00:29:05.204 --> 00:29:08.165
that one of these nights

364
00:29:08.165 --> 00:29:11.211
they are going to
steal your truck.

365
00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:19.052
When it happens. don't go
around saying I didn't warn you.

366
00:29:19.052 --> 00:29:21.890
Now listen. this is
between you and me.

367
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.183
Anyone tries to rip off my truck

368
00:29:23.183 --> 00:29:26.144
and they're in for
a big surprise.

369
00:30:09.692 --> 00:30:10.985
Where are we?

370
00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:15.824
For you it's the
end of the line.

371
00:30:15.824 --> 00:30:19.453
I'm tired. it's my
turn to sleep now.

372
00:30:19.453 --> 00:30:20.954

schedule to Miami.

374

00:30:30.506 --> 00:30:32.593
You're on my pillow.

00:30:32.593 --> 00:30:34.595
Get out. get out.

379
00:30:34.595 --> 00:30:35.847

380
00:30:35.847 --> 00:30:37.140
I'm wide awake?

381
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.851
Why don't you read your palm?

382
00:30:41.978 --> 00:30:43.772
Great. thanks a lot pal.

383
00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:45.148

Are you going to play that beer?

00:32:14.706 --> 00:32:16.416
Actually I like cards better.

391
00:32:16.416 --> 00:32:18.126
Like poker.

392
00:32:18.126 --> 00:32:20.462

How'd it go?

449
00:36:30.907 --> 00:36:31.949
Huh?

450
00:36:31.949 --> 00:36:33.117

452
00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:41.669
Yeah plus the $10.000
you still owe us.

453
00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:42.878
I'm so sorry.

454
00:36:42.878 --> 00:36:45.673
Look. I told you
guys. I haven't got it.

455
00:36:45.673 --> 00:36:47.299
Would you take an IOU?

456
00:36:47.299 --> 00:36:50.135
Oh no. you're gonna
pay in cash. right now.

457
00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:51.346
'Cause if you don't.
you're gonna end up

458
00:36:51.346 --> 00:36:52.806
like Joe Damiro.

459
00:36:52.806 --> 00:36:55.308
Remember Joe Damiro
in his cement shoes?

460
00:36:55.308 --> 00:36:56.518
Joe Damiro?

461
00:36:56.518 --> 00:36:58.269
Not really.

462
00:36:58.269 --> 00:37:01.439
I've always been bad with names.

463
00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:03.567
Jog his memory.

464
00:37:03.567 --> 00:37:04.777
Move your trousers. baby doll.

465
00:37:04.777 --> 00:37:07.488
Hey now you
guys. take it easy.

466
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.658
Listen to me.

467
00:37:10.658 --> 00:37:13.120
I've got a truck outside
that's worth much more

468
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.246
than $10.000.

469
00:37:15.455 --> 00:37:17.332
Why don't I pay
you off with that?

470
00:37:17.332 --> 00:37:19.584
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

471
00:37:19.584 --> 00:37:22.004
Why sure. I saw
a truck outside.

472
00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:22.838
See?

473
00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:26.343
Okay.

474
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.679
Now what you're
gonna do is sign us

475
00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:31.098
a transfer of ownership
and don't forget

476
00:37:31.098 --> 00:37:33.685
your phone number and
the truck's registration.

477
00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:35.270
Sure thing.

478
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.939
Oh yeah and make it out in
favor to Nynfus Corporation.

479
00:37:37.939 --> 00:37:41.818
Wait a minute. who's
this corporation?

480
00:37:41.818 --> 00:37:43.862
Bugsy. you're a jerk.

481
00:37:56.585 --> 00:37:58.587
It's all yours.

482
00:37:58.587 --> 00:38:01.089
Take this and put
it away in the safe.

483
00:38:01.089 --> 00:38:02.674
Hey you're a real crook.

484
00:38:02.674 --> 00:38:05.010
Truck's worth
twice what he owes.

485
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.596
What do you got
rocks in your head?

486
00:38:06.596 --> 00:38:08.139
Mind your own business!

487
00:38:08.139 --> 00:38:10.725
Excuse me. but this
beautiful young lady's

488
00:38:10.725 --> 00:38:12.727
got a point there.

489
00:38:12.727 --> 00:38:14.687
I mean. it's not a four wheeler.

490
00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:16.522
Could you just give me
a couple hundred dollars

491
00:38:16.522 --> 00:38:18.859
so I could rent a car?

492
00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:19.735
Okay.

493
00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:24.031
Thank you.

494
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:24.990
Let's go.

495
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.161
Hey. just a minute.

496
00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:29.454
I guess I should
warn you I left a bum

497
00:38:29.454 --> 00:38:32.123
sleeping in the
cab of the truck.

498
00:38:32.123 --> 00:38:34.251
I picked him up along the way.

499
00:38:34.251 --> 00:38:38.089
If he should make a
fuss. just throw him out.

500
00:38:40.008 --> 00:38:41.259
Don't worry.

501
00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.312
Thanks baby.
I'll remember that.

502
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.983
And I'll always
remember you. rough stuff.

503
00:38:55.983 --> 00:38:57.527
What's wrong with Johnny?

504
00:38:57.527 --> 00:39:01.198
It's an okay name I guess.
just like rough stuff.

505
00:39:01.198 --> 00:39:03.617
'Cause I think you're sweet.

506
00:39:09.707 --> 00:39:11.501
I wonder what he's
carrying in the trailer.

507
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:12.544
What's the difference?

508
00:39:12.544 --> 00:39:14.004
We only want the truck.

509
00:39:14.004 --> 00:39:15.338
Can I drive. boys?

510
00:39:15.338 --> 00:39:17.841
Bugsy. you're a jerk.

511
00:39:17.841 --> 00:39:20.802
This thing's worth
about 40 grand.

512
00:39:23.764 --> 00:39:26.434
Rise and shine buddy.
let's get out of the truck.

513
00:39:26.434 --> 00:39:28.394
It's okay officer. all
the papers are in order.

514
00:39:28.394 --> 00:39:31.522
Brakes. lights. all
okay. goodnight.

515
00:39:34.192 --> 00:39:35.527
Pull him out.

516
00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:40.657
Hey you. out huh!

517
00:39:42.535 --> 00:39:43.996
Why?

518
00:39:43.996 --> 00:39:45.622
Why? He says why.

519
00:39:47.124 --> 00:39:49.626
'Cause it now belongs to us
and we want to take it home.

520
00:39:49.626 --> 00:39:50.669
Hey...

521
00:39:50.669 --> 00:39:52.129
'Cause it now belongs to us

522
00:39:52.129 --> 00:39:54.799
and we wanna take it home. see?

523
00:39:56.551 --> 00:39:57.427
Where?

524
00:39:59.721 --> 00:40:01.973
He says where.

525
00:40:01.973 --> 00:40:05.394
It's none of your business.
now step out of there.

526
00:40:05.394 --> 00:40:08.606
Move or I'll pull
you out by the beard.

527
00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.524
Getting very impatient.

528
00:40:10.524 --> 00:40:12.234
You get the picture?

529
00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:17.157
What's he doing?

530
00:40:24.873 --> 00:40:25.750
First.

531
00:40:27.293 --> 00:40:30.421
I'm sleeping and somebody
wakes me up abruptly.

532
00:40:30.421 --> 00:40:31.547
I always cry.

533
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.424
Second.

534
00:40:34.676 --> 00:40:37.971
When I cry I get upset
and when I get upset.

535
00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:40.432
then I gotta get up.

536
00:40:40.432 --> 00:40:42.810
And when I get up I get mad.

537
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:51.069
And when I get mad. I gotta
get it out of my system.

538
00:40:53.864 --> 00:40:56.575
If you didn't cry.
it wouldn't get to you!

539
00:41:09.048 --> 00:41:11.009
Oh. I'm sorry boss...

540
00:41:11.009 --> 00:41:12.427
You're a jerk!

541
00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:50.634
Hey you. wait a minute!

542
00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:52.304
Right.

543
00:41:52.304 --> 00:41:53.555
Wait a second.

544
00:42:23.129 --> 00:42:25.633
See you around. Charlie Firpo.

545
00:42:25.633 --> 00:42:27.635
Hey. where you going?

546
00:42:29.387 --> 00:42:31.389
Hey. you can't do that!

547
00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.691
My rig. my rig!

548
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.980
Yeah. easy for you to say.

549
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.856
Sure.

550
00:43:18.358 --> 00:43:20.318
As least you're
covered by insurance.

551
00:43:20.318 --> 00:43:21.862
and the dolphins too.

552
00:43:21.862 --> 00:43:25.115
How am I supposed to
work now without my rig?

553
00:43:25.115 --> 00:43:26.158
Yeah.

554
00:43:26.158 --> 00:43:27.034
Yeah.

555
00:43:28.494 --> 00:43:30.705
Yeah. I saw who it was.

556
00:43:30.705 --> 00:43:34.250
The only thing I know is
that his name is Johnny.

557
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.670
No. the guy 
is called Johnny.

558
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:40.299
There's at least 10 million
people in this country

559
00:43:40.299 --> 00:43:41.842
called Johnny.

560
00:43:41.842 --> 00:43:43.927
Yeah. 10 million people.

561
00:43:50.101 --> 00:43:51.269
Give me a beer.

562
00:43:51.269 --> 00:43:52.562

Is there a big guy here
named Charlie with a beard

566
00:44:11.833 --> 00:44:13.043
who looks mad?

567
00:44:13.043 --> 00:44:14.586
Just a minute.

568
00:44:14.586 --> 00:44:16.004
Hey Charlie.

569
00:44:16.004 --> 00:44:17.506
It's for you.

570
00:44:17.506 --> 00:44:21.135
You wanna take it on the
phone you just called from?

571
00:44:21.135 --> 00:44:22.596
Yeah. who's speaking?

572

And how'd you know I was here?

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.810
You're not carrying
a grudge. I hope.

You've got it.

622
00:46:31.988 --> 00:46:33.198
Hey. you need a mechanic?

623
00:46:33.198 --> 00:46:35.534
I could fix any kind of car.

624
00:46:35.534 --> 00:46:38.454
We don't fix cars here.
we smash 'em up. buddy.

625
00:46:38.454 --> 00:46:40.415
I'm the best wrecker
in the business.

626
00:46:40.415 --> 00:46:41.959
Yeah. you wanna
drive for my team?

627
00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:44.294
My best boy broke
his leg this morning.

628
00:46:44.294 --> 00:46:45.337
Give you $50.

629
00:46:45.337 --> 00:46:47.214
Just be sure you don't win.

630
00:46:47.214 --> 00:46:48.257
Come on. I'll
show you the car.

631
00:46:48.257 --> 00:46:50.592

632
00:46:52.804 --> 00:46:54.264

633
00:46:54.264 --> 00:46:55.974

143.

636
00:47:03.649 --> 00:47:05.234
No one's betting on
you today so we souped up

637
00:47:05.234 --> 00:47:06.277
your machine.

638
00:47:06.277 --> 00:47:07.903
You'll be impossible to beat.

639
00:47:07.903 --> 00:47:10.072
The boys have spoken
to the other drivers.

640
00:47:10.072 --> 00:47:12.199
The track'll be like
cruising down the freeway.

641
00:47:12.199 --> 00:47:15.245
You get one of these
when you win. okay?

642
00:47:15.245 --> 00:47:16.496
It's fine with me.

643
00:47:16.496 --> 00:47:18.165
Ladies and gentlemen.

Yeah. it looks like it's
gonna be a great race.

649
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:32.263
Cars are out on the track.

650
00:47:32.263 --> 00:47:34.098
the promotion lap.

651
00:47:34.098 --> 00:47:36.143
And here they come.

652
00:47:36.143 --> 00:47:38.604
they line up on starting grid.

653
00:47:38.604 --> 00:47:41.440
With just under
60 seconds to go.

654
00:47:42.566 --> 00:47:44.777
And we have a
latecomer. number 26.

00:47:44.777 --> 00:47:46.906
sponsored by Tom's Tires.

656
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:50.367
Grabbing a space in
time for the lineup.

657
00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:57.292
Hey. you miserable
little runt!

658
00:47:57.292 --> 00:47:58.335
Where's my rig?

659
00:47:58.335 --> 00:47:59.920
Oh say. it's Charlie Firpo!

660
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.380
I'm glad to see ya!

661
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.465
Now darnit I asked
you a question.

662
00:48:03.465 --> 00:48:04.841
where's the dolphins and my rig?

663
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:06.718
Oh. I turned 'em loose!

664
00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:09.514
You know. I felt sorry for 'em.

665
00:48:09.514 --> 00:48:11.474
Start of the race.

666
00:48:22.903 --> 00:48:25.572
First turn. number 26

667
00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:29.285
he's got it. sixth place.
number 37. right behind 26

668
00:48:29.285 --> 00:48:34.040
who's moving up on third
place followed by 37.

669
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.794
Bumper to bumper.
26 has the lead.

670
00:48:37.794 --> 00:48:40.840
look out he's sideways.
he's gonna lose it.

671
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.760
37 is gaining ground.
moving up on the outside.

672
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.513
They've left the traffic behind.

673
00:48:56.149 --> 00:48:57.275
Okay blue
eyes. where's my rig?

674
00:48:57.275 --> 00:48:58.151
What?

675
00:48:58.151 --> 00:48:59.026
My rig!

676
00:48:59.026 --> 00:49:00.278
What?

677
00:49:00.278 --> 00:49:01.113
I'm warning you.
where's my rig?

678
00:49:01.113 --> 00:49:02.072
You drove off in it.

679
00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:03.574
Oh. your truck.

680
00:49:05.033 --> 00:49:06.869
I lost it playing poker.

681
00:49:06.869 --> 00:49:07.953
You know how it is.

682
00:49:07.953 --> 00:49:09.788
Easy come easy go. Charlie.

683
00:49:09.788 --> 00:49:11.916
What were you doing
gambling with my truck?

684
00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:15.295
I want something to
win and buy one myself

685
00:49:15.295 --> 00:49:16.296
and work with you!

686
00:49:16.296 --> 00:49:17.380
Great idea. blue eyes.

687
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.215
26 is staying right with him.

688
00:49:19.215 --> 00:49:21.176
you'd think they were married.

689
00:49:21.176 --> 00:49:25.347
Hey. you know .

690
00:49:25.347 --> 00:49:27.391
Look at that 37!

691
00:49:27.391 --> 00:49:28.642
What the hell is going on?

692
00:49:28.642 --> 00:49:29.643
Don't ask me. you were
the one that told him

693
00:49:29.643 --> 00:49:30.978
he should lose.

694
00:49:30.978 --> 00:49:32.438
58 is trying to
put up a challenge

695
00:49:32.438 --> 00:49:34.733
but he ain't got a
snowball's chance in hell.

696
00:49:34.733 --> 00:49:36.026
This is neck and neck.

697
00:49:36.026 --> 00:49:37.319
Did 37 get the word?

698
00:49:37.319 --> 00:49:39.863
Hey I told him boss.
just like you said.

699
00:49:39.863 --> 00:49:41.364
That 26 was to win.

700
00:49:41.364 --> 00:49:42.240
This is a double-cross.
someone'll pay.

701
00:49:53.836 --> 00:49:56.465
37 is back in first place.

702
00:49:56.465 --> 00:49:59.009
26 is pulling back on the track.

703
00:49:59.009 --> 00:50:03.264
He comes past the stands with
seven laps to go in this race.

704
00:50:04.557 --> 00:50:08.562
it's 37 out in front.
he's about all sewed up.

705
00:50:14.944 --> 00:50:17.614
It's 26 and he's
driving his heart out.

706
00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:20.534
Moving up the track. passing
one car after another.

707
00:50:20.534 --> 00:50:23.328
33. seven. moving up towards 62.

708
00:50:28.584 --> 00:50:31.379
Coming around 
out of control.

709
00:50:31.379 --> 00:50:33.714
they're all taking the curve.

710
00:50:50.108 --> 00:50:51.443
26 just keeps moving
up. look at him go.

711
00:50:51.443 --> 00:50:54.404
He's fourth. he's third.
he's second. he's right

712
00:50:54.404 --> 00:50:56.865
on the bumper of 37!

713
00:50:56.865 --> 00:50:58.616
And he makes another turn.

714
00:50:58.616 --> 00:51:00.661
They're running neck and neck!

715
00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:02.663
Hey. meet me off the
track and I'll kick your ass

716
00:51:02.663 --> 00:51:03.998
.

717
00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:04.999
I'm ready.

718
00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:07.084
37 is taking no slack.

719
00:51:09.795 --> 00:51:12.049
How long can he
keep up this pace?

720
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:13.634
Wait a minute. where they going?

721
00:51:13.634 --> 00:51:14.761
Stop. stop!

722
00:51:28.442 --> 00:51:30.069
Let's go get him.

723
00:52:25.923 --> 00:52:30.261
Alright fatso. now I'm
gonna trim you down to size.

724
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.099
Look out. it's an earthquake!

725
00:52:35.099 --> 00:52:36.893
Hey. that fat
ox made you lose.

726
00:52:36.893 --> 00:52:38.979
Why you taking his side?

727
00:52:40.063 --> 00:52:41.690
That fat ox. huh?

728
00:52:42.983 --> 00:52:46.153
That fat ox happens
to be my brother.

729
00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.091
You have pistachio?

730
00:53:06.091 --> 00:53:07.509
Pistachio's melted.

731
00:53:07.509 --> 00:53:09.387
Tutti frutti or caramel toffee.

732
00:53:09.387 --> 00:53:10.638
Tutti frutti.

733
00:53:12.807 --> 00:53:15.560
Charlie. how could
I tell you right away

734
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.353
I was your brother?

735
00:53:17.353 --> 00:53:20.608
You might have. you might
have held it against me.

736
00:53:20.608 --> 00:53:22.818
I wanted us to be friends first.

737
00:53:22.818 --> 00:53:27.364
You know. you always blame
me. you always blame me

738
00:53:27.364 --> 00:53:32.455
'cause our father left
your mother to marry mine.

739
00:53:32.455 --> 00:53:34.540
Nice guy. your father.

740
00:53:35.792 --> 00:53:38.544
Like a sailor with a
woman in every port.

741
00:53:38.544 --> 00:53:39.420
Hey!

742
00:53:41.882 --> 00:53:45.511
How could you say such
a think about our papi?

743
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:46.553
Know what?

744
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.765
I've done some figuring.

745
00:53:49.765 --> 00:53:53.144
I only need to sell
137 million of these.

746
00:53:53.144 --> 00:53:54.479
Thank you. kid.

747
00:53:54.479 --> 00:53:56.898
Before I raise enough
for the down payment.

748
00:53:56.898 --> 00:53:58.775
Why wait. Charlie?

749
00:53:58.775 --> 00:54:03.572
I mean. a guy like you.
a real genius at cards.

750
00:54:03.572 --> 00:54:04.949
You got it made.

751
00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:07.493
In one month you can
make enough money

752
00:54:07.493 --> 00:54:09.787
to buy yourself 10 trucks.

753
00:54:11.038 --> 00:54:12.874
Gambling's for suckers.

754
00:54:12.874 --> 00:54:14.793
The house want you to drop
a bundle it don't matter

755
00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:16.128
how good you are.

756
00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:17.796
I got an education.

757
00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:19.923
When I was dealing in
that casino for Paragoulis.

758
00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.633
The Greek in Havana.

759
00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:25.138
Your eyes would have turned
green at the crookings.

760
00:54:25.138 --> 00:54:28.141
I smashed everything there
to little pieces and left.

761
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:31.769
I heard you broke
The Greek's nose. too.

762
00:54:34.481 --> 00:54:35.983
Hey.

763
00:54:35.983 --> 00:54:37.443
Pass me a cone. will you?

764
00:54:37.443 --> 00:54:38.735
Tutti frutti or
caramel toffee?

765
00:54:38.735 --> 00:54:39.821
Pistachio.

766
00:54:40.738 --> 00:54:42.365
Pistachio melted.

767
00:54:43.533 --> 00:54:45.536
Vanilla. tutti frutti.
caramel toffee.

768
00:54:45.536 --> 00:54:47.204
bitter egg. and coffee.

769
00:54:47.204 --> 00:54:51.542
Okay. then give me a
vanilla cone with pistachio.

770
00:54:54.044 --> 00:54:56.089
The pistachio melted.

771
00:54:57.215 --> 00:54:59.426
Vanilla. caramel
toffee. tutti frutti.

772
00:54:59.426 --> 00:55:02.095
bitter egg. and coffee.

773
00:55:02.095 --> 00:55:05.766
Okay look. just give
me a chocolate cone

774
00:55:08.019 --> 00:55:09.979
with a little pistachio.

775
00:55:09.979 --> 00:55:11.773
What are you. deaf?

776
00:55:14.025 --> 00:55:16.402
The pistachio's melted and
I didn't say chocolate.

777
00:55:16.402 --> 00:55:18.447
Wow. don't get so excited.

778
00:55:18.447 --> 00:55:20.157
I was just asking.

779
00:55:20.157 --> 00:55:22.951
Alright. what do you have again?

780
00:55:24.369 --> 00:55:27.164
We have vanilla. tutti
frutti. caramel toffee.

781
00:55:27.164 --> 00:55:29.167
bitter egg. and coffee.

782
00:55:30.335 --> 00:55:31.961
Oh I got it.

783
00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:34.714
Then give me a big mix. grandma.

784
00:55:36.883 --> 00:55:40.888
Tutti frutti. caramel
toffee. vanilla. bitter egg.

785
00:55:40.888 --> 00:55:41.889
and coffee.

786
00:55:50.942 --> 00:55:52.652
Tutti frutti.

787
00:55:52.652 --> 00:55:55.613
Hey. don't forget
the pistachio.

788
00:56:12.006 --> 00:56:14.509
Hey salami. guess
what I got for you?

789
00:56:14.509 --> 00:56:16.469
Oh. thanks.

790
00:56:16.469 --> 00:56:17.971
I thought you said it melted.

791
00:56:17.971 --> 00:56:19.430
I changed my mind now.

792
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.182
What'd you say?

793
00:56:21.182 --> 00:56:23.269
I said I love pistachio.

794
00:56:23.269 --> 00:56:25.104
Bet your sweet ass.

795
00:56:26.647 --> 00:56:28.816
You know everything about me.

796
00:56:28.816 --> 00:56:30.818
Let's hear a little about you.

797
00:56:30.818 --> 00:56:33.196
How come you learned to
converse with the fishes?

798
00:56:33.196 --> 00:56:34.990
Well I've done just
about everything.

799
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:36.867
I've been a waiter.
salesman. dockworker.

800
00:56:36.867 --> 00:56:39.536
shoe repairman. mason.
halfback. I've been...

801
00:56:39.536 --> 00:56:42.497
Instructor. yeah. I
know. jack of all trades.

802
00:56:42.497 --> 00:56:43.666
master of none.

803
00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:44.917
I had to do it.

804
00:56:44.917 --> 00:56:46.794
I had to do it for papi.

805
00:56:46.794 --> 00:56:48.045
You walked out on him.

806
00:56:48.045 --> 00:56:49.589
Who do you think
took care of him?

807
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:52.467
Don't speak to me about him.

808
00:56:52.467 --> 00:56:55.554
Made life miserable
for me and mama.

809
00:56:55.554 --> 00:56:58.516
Lousy bum couldn't
even get a job.

810
00:56:58.516 --> 00:57:00.810
10 years ago I
walked out on him.

811
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.854
So help me one of these days
he crosses my path again.

812
00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:04.147
I'll show him.

813
00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:05.649
Save your breath.

814
00:57:05.649 --> 00:57:07.485
You won't be able to show
him anything no more.

815
00:57:07.485 --> 00:57:09.028
Why?

816
00:57:09.028 --> 00:57:09.987
'Cause...

817
00:57:12.948 --> 00:57:14.992
Come on. why?

818
00:57:14.992 --> 00:57:17.245
'Cause papi's blind now.

819
00:57:38.101 --> 00:57:40.229
I sold it to pay for an
eye operation for him.

820
00:57:40.229 --> 00:57:42.105
that's why I stole it. Charlie.

821
00:57:42.105 --> 00:57:44.566
But then I lost all
the money gambling.

822
00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:45.984
I must have been
taken by every shark

823
00:57:45.984 --> 00:57:47.987
from Mexico to Florida.

824
00:57:49.364 --> 00:57:50.865
Hey. there he is.

825
00:58:05.005 --> 00:58:08.635
Where did he learn those
words from. your mother?

826
00:58:08.635 --> 00:58:11.472
Believe me. I've always
done my best to give him

827
00:58:11.472 --> 00:58:12.974
enough to live on.

828
00:58:12.974 --> 00:58:14.809
But he wants to sing.

829
00:58:17.645 --> 00:58:21.191
It makes him feel
he's on his own.

830
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:23.026
He's hard-headed.

831
00:58:23.026 --> 00:58:25.612
He thinks he has a nice voice.

832
00:58:27.656 --> 00:58:29.324
Papi!

833
00:58:29.324 --> 00:58:30.200
Papi!

834
00:58:31.494 --> 00:58:32.537
Who's that. my boys?

835
00:58:32.537 --> 00:58:33.580
Papi!

836
00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.248
My boys. my boys!

837
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.627
Hi Papi. I
brought you Charlie!

838
00:58:39.627 --> 00:58:40.920
It's me and Charlie!

839
00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.590
My boys. my boys!

840
00:58:45.468 --> 00:58:47.803
Charlie. Charlie. it's
Charlie. oh Charlie

841
00:58:47.803 --> 00:58:50.806
you feel more like
your mother every day.

842
00:58:50.806 --> 00:58:53.393
Oh Charlie. Charlie. my boys.

843
00:58:53.393 --> 00:58:55.020
Come on. come on!

844
00:59:03.446 --> 00:59:04.697
Charlie's right. Papi.

845
00:59:04.697 --> 00:59:06.115
You'll be happy here.

846
00:59:06.115 --> 00:59:08.493
Everything is so beautiful.

847
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:11.454
I only wish you could see it.

848
00:59:11.454 --> 00:59:14.583
Sister Suzanne will
take good care of you.

849
00:59:14.583 --> 00:59:16.127
And Johnny and me'll find
a way to raise the money

850
00:59:16.127 --> 00:59:19.005
for your eye operation.
don't you worry.

851
00:59:19.005 --> 00:59:20.548
Thanks. Charlie.

852
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.635
You see what those
bastards done to me?

853
00:59:23.635 --> 00:59:25.513
Charlie. that's
when he went blind.

854
00:59:25.513 --> 00:59:26.806
After they beat him up.

855
00:59:26.806 --> 00:59:29.183
And only because
I'm your father.

856
00:59:29.183 --> 00:59:31.352
I'll give you back
your sight. Papi.

857
00:59:31.352 --> 00:59:34.188
if it's the last
thing I ever do.

858
00:59:35.899 --> 00:59:38.652
How much this operation cost?

859
00:59:38.652 --> 00:59:40.737
Oh not much. $100.000.

860
00:59:41.822 --> 00:59:43.615
$100.000?

861
00:59:43.615 --> 00:59:45.408
Does that including
green stamps?

862
00:59:45.408 --> 00:59:48.162
It's a very
difficult operation.

863
00:59:48.162 --> 00:59:50.665
Besides. Papi wants blue eyes.

864
00:59:50.665 --> 00:59:53.543
and you know blue
eyes cost more.

865
00:59:54.919 --> 00:59:57.631
Hey Papi. how about
some other color?

866
00:59:57.631 --> 00:59:59.174
You see just as good. eh?

867
00:59:59.174 --> 01:00:01.176
It's that or nothing.

868
01:00:03.929 --> 01:00:06.014
Like father. like son.

869
01:00:07.267 --> 01:00:09.769
Ah. the prettiest nun
since Jennifer Jones.

870
01:00:09.769 --> 01:00:11.354
In For Whom The Bell Tolls?

871
01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:13.523
No. that's Gary Cooper.

872
01:00:15.483 --> 01:00:16.818
Hiya. Sister.

873
01:00:16.818 --> 01:00:18.112
I thought you'd
all like some tea.

874
01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:19.363
Let me pour you
a cup. Mr. Firpo.

875
01:00:19.363 --> 01:00:22.700
No no no no. I
want to serve myself.

876
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.119
I'm self-sufficient.

877
01:00:24.119 --> 01:00:25.162
Certainly are. Papi.

878
01:00:25.162 --> 01:00:26.163
Here. let me help you.

879
01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:27.372
This is the teapot.

880
01:00:27.372 --> 01:00:28.833
And this is the cup.

881
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:29.917
Now there you are.

882
01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.294
Hold the cup nice and steady.

883
01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.378
Is it good and hot. Sister?

884
01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:33.421
It is?

885
01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:34.881
Ah. Papi. Papi!

886
01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:40.471
That's it. that's fine.

887
01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.186
Milk or lemon?

888
01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:48.520
Lemon. lemon.

889
01:00:50.482 --> 01:00:52.734
Let me do it. let me
do it. let me do it.

890
01:00:52.734 --> 01:00:54.402
Papi. please.

891
01:00:54.402 --> 01:00:58.740
I think it's better somebody
else squeezes your lemon.

892
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:02.286
Oh I do hope your
father can stay here until

893
01:01:02.286 --> 01:01:04.079
the operation
because as I told you

894
01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:07.791
in about a month we will
have to move from here.

895
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.252
How we gonna raise $100.000?

896
01:01:10.252 --> 01:01:12.672
That ain't easy in
the best of times.

897
01:01:12.672 --> 01:01:13.882
We'll make it. Charlie.

898
01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:17.469
'Cause we'll do it
together. like brothers.

899
01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:22.850
Papi. Charlie will
teach me to become

900
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:25.102
as great a gambler as he is.

901
01:01:25.102 --> 01:01:29.190
We'll go to all the legal
gambling spots in town.

902
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:32.193
And if that isn't enough to
make the $100.000 we need.

903
01:01:32.193 --> 01:01:34.864
Charlie can always introduce
me to Paragoulis The Greek.

904
01:01:34.864 --> 01:01:37.700
He's the one who roughed
up Papi. you know.

905
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.286
He knows where he
hangs out. don't you?

906
01:01:40.286 --> 01:01:43.206
Yeah. well. yeah.
I know where he is.

907
01:01:43.206 --> 01:01:46.377
but you don't know
Paragoulis The Greek.

908
01:01:46.377 --> 01:01:49.421
He's too much for you to
handle. he's dangerous.

909
01:01:49.421 --> 01:01:52.716
Nothing is too dangerous
for the Firpo brothers.

910
01:01:52.716 --> 01:01:55.220
And Papi's worth it. right?

911
01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.017
Okay. okay. so okay. we
win enough for the operation.

912
01:02:02.144 --> 01:02:04.229
And a new truck for me.

913
01:02:04.229 --> 01:02:05.898
And after that we quit. right?

914
01:02:05.898 --> 01:02:07.817
Right. right good.

915
01:02:07.817 --> 01:02:09.068
And Papi loves Firpo brothers.

916
01:02:09.068 --> 01:02:10.361
Right!

917
01:02:10.361 --> 01:02:11.904
Bye bye.

918
01:02:11.904 --> 01:02:13.865
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

919
01:02:13.865 --> 01:02:15.324
I'm happy to be able
to return the favor

920
01:02:15.324 --> 01:02:16.910
after all you've done for me.

921
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:18.912
We will take good care of him.

922
01:02:18.912 --> 01:02:22.624
Come on. Mr. Firpo. I'll
show you to your room.

923
01:02:22.624 --> 01:02:23.667
Thanks.

924
01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:25.002
This way.

925
01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:28.756
But I can get out of
here sometimes can I?

926
01:02:28.756 --> 01:02:30.425
I mean quite often?

927
01:02:31.593 --> 01:02:33.136
Of course you can. Mr. Firpo.

928
01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:34.554
this is not a prison.

929
01:02:34.554 --> 01:02:38.267
Ah. that is exactly
what I wanted to hear.

930
01:02:38.267 --> 01:02:39.268
Oh. and Sister?

931
01:02:39.268 --> 01:02:40.895
Yes?

932
01:02:40.895 --> 01:02:42.439
Could I please
have a television set
in my room please?

933
01:02:42.439 --> 01:02:43.482
Of course you can.

934
01:02:43.482 --> 01:02:44.691
What did you say?

935
01:02:44.691 --> 01:02:46.276
A television?

936
01:02:46.276 --> 01:02:49.530
Oh yes. I love to listen
to the dog races on TV.

937
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:57.663
Now here's what we do.

938
01:02:57.663 --> 01:03:00.125
Sixth race we bet
$100 on a favorite.

939
01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.877
But shouldn't we pick a
horse that gives better odds?

940
01:03:01.877 --> 01:03:03.170
The race is fixed.

941
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.630
If you want to learn.
don't ask questions.

942
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.091
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

943
01:03:09.677 --> 01:03:11.721
See the guy in the
checked jacket?

944
01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.598
That's what's called a bookie.

945
01:03:13.598 --> 01:03:15.850
At racetracks they come
out of the woodwork.

946
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.102
And they all work
for the syndicate.

947
01:03:18.102 --> 01:03:19.938
Now I will approach one
of them and put the $100

948
01:03:19.938 --> 01:03:21.565
on the favorite.

949
01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:24.151
Then we make sure
the favorite wins.

950
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:25.402
You wait here.

951
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.169
Hiya Charlie. it's
good to see you again.

952
01:03:41.169 --> 01:03:42.964
Can I buy you a drink?

953
01:03:42.964 --> 01:03:44.340
I'm gonna show my friend
that betting with you

954
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.842
is better than at the window.

955
01:03:45.842 --> 01:03:47.426
Good.

956
01:03:47.426 --> 01:03:49.762
You're gonna take $100 on
Lightning Rod. number seven.

957
01:03:49.762 --> 01:03:52.684
And instead of two to
one. I'll take 11 to one.

958
01:03:52.684 --> 01:03:53.726
11 to one?

959
01:03:53.726 --> 01:03:54.602
Yeah.

960
01:04:01.401 --> 01:04:05.531
Okay. but what should
I do with this ticket?

961
01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.615
Why don't you eat 'em?

962
01:04:06.615 --> 01:04:07.658
Eat 'em?

963
01:04:07.658 --> 01:04:08.534
Yeah.

964
01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:15.876
A beer.

965
01:04:17.836 --> 01:04:18.879
Hey there.

966
01:04:20.213 --> 01:04:21.840
Hey yourself.

967
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.759
What are you doing
here. betting on the nags?

968
01:04:24.759 --> 01:04:27.180
Only on the ones that win.

969
01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:29.849
I got a sure tip for you.

970
01:04:29.849 --> 01:04:32.185
There's a killing to be
made on the sixth race.

971
01:04:32.185 --> 01:04:33.811
Lightning Rod.

972
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:36.523
No. Lightning Rod's the
favorite. but he won't win.

973
01:04:36.523 --> 01:04:39.568
Bet on Cookie. he'll come in
first. it's all taken care of.

974
01:04:39.568 --> 01:04:41.528
They had a word with the
jockeys. if you understand.

975
01:04:41.528 --> 01:04:43.280
Thank you.

976
01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.490
Catch you later.

977
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:45.908
Yeah. you bet.

978
01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:48.953
It's just like you said.

979
01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:50.205
they're clamoring to put
money on Lightning Rod.

980
01:04:50.205 --> 01:04:51.998
over 50 grand so far.

981
01:04:51.998 --> 01:04:54.209
What'd you expect.
he's the favorite.

982
01:04:54.209 --> 01:04:55.460
You bet he's the favorite.

983
01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.171
And that nag had better not win.

984
01:04:57.171 --> 01:04:58.881
or we'll be up the creek.

985
01:04:58.881 --> 01:05:00.300
Don't worry. the driver
knows the life of his little

986
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.177
baby's at stake.

987
01:05:02.177 --> 01:05:05.263
He'd break the
horse's legs first.

988
01:05:08.142 --> 01:05:09.477
Why don't we go now?

989
01:05:09.477 --> 01:05:12.063
What do you mean. go?

990
01:05:12.063 --> 01:05:13.397
If we hurry we just have
time to throw ourselves

991
01:05:13.397 --> 01:05:16.526
under the Miami New
Orleans express.

992
01:05:16.526 --> 01:05:18.444
The tracks are about
50 yards from here.

993
01:05:18.444 --> 01:05:19.863
What is it. you
think that's funny?

994
01:05:19.863 --> 01:05:21.240
Come on.

995
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.783
You think it's funny?

996
01:05:22.783 --> 01:05:26.328
That you're gonna lose all
the cash we have to our name?

997
01:05:26.328 --> 01:05:29.122
My fairy godmother
just gave me a hot tip.

998
01:05:29.122 --> 01:05:32.335
Lightning Rod is not gonna win.

999
01:05:32.335 --> 01:05:33.211
Yeah?

1000
01:05:36.381 --> 01:05:39.676
Well you wait and
see who's gonna win.

1001
01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:43.180
Well. what do you want?

1002
01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.810
Lightning Rod's driver.

1003
01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.478
Hold on a second.

1004
01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:50.981
Hey. are you Lightning
Rod's driver?

1005
01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.274
Yeah. why?

1006
01:05:52.274 --> 01:05:55.026
You're wanted
on the telephone.

1007
01:05:59.114 --> 01:06:01.659
Jeez. I hope nothing's
happened to the kid.

1008
01:06:01.659 --> 01:06:02.702
Hello?

1009
01:06:02.702 --> 01:06:03.744
Who's calling?

1010
01:06:03.744 --> 01:06:05.329
Hello. hello?

1011
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:09.543
Just sit back.
leave the driving to us.

1012
01:06:33.277 --> 01:06:34.946
Hey. that doesn't look
like Lightning Rod's

1013
01:06:34.946 --> 01:06:36.114
usual driver.

1014
01:06:38.158 --> 01:06:40.410
Sure it's him. what
do you think it is?

1015
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:42.454
Hey. what you smiling at?

1016
01:06:42.454 --> 01:06:46.083
I'll smile at whatever
the hell I want to.

1017
01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:47.877
They're
lining up behind

1018
01:06:47.877 --> 01:06:48.920
the starting line folks

1019
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.087
for this evening's sixth race.

1020
01:06:50.087 --> 01:06:51.464
Look at those
drivers. they're all...

1021
01:06:51.464 --> 01:06:53.341
Hey buddy. you're
not Sam Stallion.

1022
01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:58.430
Of course I'm Sam Stallion.
don't you recognize me?

1023
01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:02.476
I'm not that stupid.
you're not Sam!

1024
01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:05.062
Why don't you call me
and see if I answer you?

1025
01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:06.272
Hey Sam hi.

1026
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.315
Oh hi!

1027
01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.566
See?

1028
01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:12.028
And
they're off and running!

1029
01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.074
The favorite. Lightning
Rod. is on the inside.

1030
01:07:26.336 --> 01:07:28.840
Lightning Rod seems to have
gotten himself boxed in.

1031
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.884
Cayenne Pepper's still at the
front. followed by .

1032
01:07:31.884 --> 01:07:35.888
Positions are unchanged as
they go into the first turn.

1033
01:07:35.888 --> 01:07:38.475
is challenging
Cayenne Pepper.

1034
01:07:38.475 --> 01:07:40.936
There's quite a tussle
going on out there.

1035
01:07:40.936 --> 01:07:43.230
In the back stretch it's
still anybody's race.

1036
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.482
But now it's Lightning
Rod is making his move.

1037
01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.526
He's gaining gradually
from the inside.

1038
01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:49.612
Cayenne Pepper
has broken stride.

1039
01:07:49.612 --> 01:07:50.989
Lightning Rod's
alongside to

1040
01:07:50.989 --> 01:07:51.865
and he's taking the lead.

1041
01:07:51.865 --> 01:07:52.740
Come on. come on!

1042
01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.616
Shut up!

1043
01:07:53.616 --> 01:07:54.450
Come on!

1044
01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:55.451
You shut up!

1045
01:07:55.451 --> 01:07:58.413
Hey. what's that fool up to?

1046
01:07:58.413 --> 01:07:59.790
Hey!

1047
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.584
Hold him back. Sam!

1048
01:08:01.584 --> 01:08:04.461
I can't help it.
he's going too fast!

1049
01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:07.548
Hey. you're going too fast!

1050
01:08:07.548 --> 01:08:10.427

is fighting back.

1051
01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:11.970
With Lightning Rod...

1052
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:13.638
Hey boss. I took a bet on
that horse for 11 to one odds.

1053
01:08:13.638 --> 01:08:14.681
11 to one?

1054
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:15.932
You jerk. Bugsy!

1055
01:08:15.932 --> 01:08:17.559
What are you
picking on me for?

1056
01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:18.935
It was you said Lightning
Rod was going to get beat.

1057
01:08:18.935 --> 01:08:20.520
But look!

1058
01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.731
Home stretch
it's still lightning rod

1059
01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.232
with 
fighting all the way.

1060
01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.984
But Lightning Rod isn't
taking any chances.

1061
01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:26.570
And as they past the post...

1062
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:27.738
Hey!

1063
01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:36.206
Go to the house of that
dumb bastard Sam Stallion.

1064
01:08:36.206 --> 01:08:37.874
you know what to do.

1065
01:08:37.874 --> 01:08:39.709
And if he ain't there
then give it to his baby.

1066
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:40.793
Understand?

1067
01:08:40.793 --> 01:08:41.753
Let's go.

1068
01:08:43.505 --> 01:08:44.715
Now what were the
odds you said you gave

1069
01:08:44.715 --> 01:08:45.799
on Lightning Rod?

1070
01:08:45.799 --> 01:08:46.926
11 to one.

1071
01:08:48.719 --> 01:08:51.847
One. two. three.
four. five. six...

1072
01:09:07.156 --> 01:09:10.034
You heard what the boss
said about if he's not there.

1073
01:09:10.034 --> 01:09:13.871
And the boss's orders
are the boss's orders.

1074
01:09:23.465 --> 01:09:25.802
You go up and get the baby.

1075
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:44.656
Hey George. there's
something here

1076
01:09:44.656 --> 01:09:46.491
that ain't quite kosher.

1077
01:09:46.491 --> 01:09:48.995
Stop being a turkey.

1078
01:09:48.995 --> 01:09:50.037
Throw the kid out the window

1079
01:09:50.037 --> 01:09:51.664
and let's get out of here.

1080
01:09:51.664 --> 01:09:55.251
You ever picked
up a kid before?

1081
01:09:55.251 --> 01:09:56.252
Ready?

1082
01:09:56.252 --> 01:09:58.005
Coochie coochie coo.

1083
01:10:04.094 --> 01:10:05.053
Hey George. doesn't that kid

1084
01:10:05.053 --> 01:10:05.971
look like someone we know?

1085
01:10:05.971 --> 01:10:08.056
All babies look alike.

1086
01:10:19.361 --> 01:10:22.114
Next time pick on
a kid your own side.

1087
01:10:22.114 --> 01:10:23.324
Got that?

1088
01:10:33.793 --> 01:10:36.463
Head for the royal flush.

1089
01:10:36.463 --> 01:10:38.715
Then comes four of a kind.

1090
01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:44.806
Then a full house. three of
a kind. two pair. and a pair.

1091
01:10:44.806 --> 01:10:46.433
You remember where the
ordinary flush and straight go.

1092
01:10:46.433 --> 01:10:47.309
right?

1093
01:10:48.227 --> 01:10:50.479
Now what's that?

1094
01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.607
Four of a kind.

1095
01:10:52.607 --> 01:10:55.026
Hey. that's a pretty good hand.

1096
01:10:55.026 --> 01:10:56.736
In more ways than one.

1097
01:10:56.736 --> 01:10:58.446
What else. master?

1098
01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:01.908
Then you got IF.

1099
01:11:01.908 --> 01:11:02.993
I never heard of that.

1100
01:11:02.993 --> 01:11:04.328
The luck factor.

1101
01:11:04.328 --> 01:11:06.330
When lady luck decides
you're high on a list

1102
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:10.501
and you ain't a bad player.
nobody can beat you.

1103
01:11:11.502 --> 01:11:13.004
Let me see now.

1104
01:11:13.004 --> 01:11:15.507
In American poker using all
52 cards with no jokers.

1105
01:11:15.507 --> 01:11:18.176
you've got one point 75
probabilities in a million

1106
01:11:18.176 --> 01:11:19.678
of coming up with
the royal flush.

1107
01:11:19.678 --> 01:11:21.513
Three point 75 four of a kind.

1108
01:11:21.513 --> 01:11:23.139
11 point nine for a straight.

1109
01:11:23.139 --> 01:11:26.852
64 for a full house.
186 for three of a kind.

1110
01:11:26.852 --> 01:11:30.439
275 for a pair. but
none of it is of any use

1111
01:11:30.439 --> 01:11:32.608
unless you've got the IF.

1112
01:11:34.277 --> 01:11:36.196
How's that. Mr. Firpo?

1113
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:40.576
Arithmetic ain't
my strong point.

1114
01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:49.502
Let's see your money. boys.

1115
01:11:49.502 --> 01:11:51.379
Here's two tens.

1116
01:11:51.379 --> 01:11:53.256
Ah baby come to daddy.

1117
01:11:56.511 --> 01:11:58.722
Hey Mike Firpo.

1118
01:11:58.722 --> 01:12:00.557
You seem pretty happy.

1119
01:12:00.557 --> 01:12:01.641
You see that?

1120
01:12:01.641 --> 01:12:03.101
I won!

1121
01:12:03.101 --> 01:12:06.396
Yeah but you're
playing in our territory.

1122
01:12:10.568 --> 01:12:11.444
Go on.

1123
01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.991
Hey. your blind stuff
won't work with me.

1124
01:12:16.991 --> 01:12:20.329
Now we told you to
keep out of here.

1125
01:12:20.329 --> 01:12:21.705
Well yeah.

1126
01:12:30.381 --> 01:12:32.884
I'll raise you two bananas.

1127
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:36.346
Hey.

1128
01:12:37.722 --> 01:12:38.848
That's Papi.

1129
01:12:38.848 --> 01:12:40.601
Oh come on. that's impossible.

1130
01:12:40.601 --> 01:12:43.520
Well take a look.
there he goes!

1131
01:12:57.869 --> 01:12:59.287
There he goes!

1132
01:13:11.427 --> 01:13:13.304
He's gotta be down
here. I know I saw him.

1133
01:13:13.304 --> 01:13:14.556
Let's take a look.

1134
01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.267
But I think you're
nuts. Charlie.

1135
01:13:19.852 --> 01:13:22.565
I don't see him.
but I know I saw him.

1136
01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:26.860
Come on Charlie. I've
still got a lot to learn.

1137
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:30.030
Gosh darnit I tell
you I'm sure I saw him.

1138
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.241
Let's go back upstairs. huh?

1139
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.578
Come here. come here!

1140
01:13:34.578 --> 01:13:36.162
Now who were
you running after?

1141
01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.957
You were running after our papi.

1142
01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:41.126
Come on. knock it off.

1143
01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:42.961
You know our father's blind.

1144
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.755
Don't go telling
me the old coot's...

1145
01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:51.929
Whatever you're doing that'll
teach you not to do it. huh?

1146
01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:53.431
Right Charlie?

1147
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:56.226
Oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

1148
01:13:58.812 --> 01:14:01.690
Listen blue eyes. if you
and Papi are putting me on.

1149
01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:03.275
I'll smash your face.

1150
01:14:03.275 --> 01:14:06.404
Go on. why don't you
say what you really mean?

1151
01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:08.573
That you don't believe
your own flesh and blood?

1152
01:14:08.573 --> 01:14:09.741
Your own.

1153
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.912
your own father.

1154
01:14:12.912 --> 01:14:17.584
Give you your most precious
gift. your existence.

1155
01:14:17.584 --> 01:14:19.836
And you don't even believe me.

1156
01:14:19.836 --> 01:14:21.296
Your own brother!

1157
01:14:21.296 --> 01:14:23.673
Was trying to help
you find a purpose!

1158
01:14:23.673 --> 01:14:27.136
Your aimless.
empty. wasted life!

1159
01:14:30.014 --> 01:14:32.141
See he really made
me catch a cold.

1160
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:33.559
Are you happy now?

1161
01:14:33.559 --> 01:14:34.477
Well. I...

1162
01:14:35.937 --> 01:14:37.522
That's okay.

1163
01:14:37.522 --> 01:14:39.441
Let's just keep our minds
on how we can make the money

1164
01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.985
we need. come on. Charlie.

1165
01:14:41.985 --> 01:14:44.279
I know there's so much
more you can teach me.

1166
01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:48.660
Let's go back upstairs and
start all over again. okay?

1167
01:14:56.751 --> 01:14:59.255
Sweat blood to put this
little stake together.

1168
01:14:59.255 --> 01:15:01.549
Now we're gonna use it.

1169
01:15:01.549 --> 01:15:03.884
You take it and bet it all
on the guy I told you too.

1170
01:15:03.884 --> 01:15:05.761
Sure okay. Charlie.

1171
01:15:07.054 --> 01:15:08.264
I'll see ya.

1172
01:15:09.683 --> 01:15:11.184
Okay. let's go.

1173
01:15:18.483 --> 01:15:21.196
Hey. where's the famous
Jai Alai world champion?

1174
01:15:21.196 --> 01:15:22.906
Jamon Serrano?

1175
01:15:22.906 --> 01:15:24.157
Charlie Firpo?

1176
01:15:24.157 --> 01:15:25.367
Hey. amigo!

1177
01:15:25.367 --> 01:15:27.119
Hola amigo mio.

1178
01:15:27.119 --> 01:15:28.662
Hey. caught you with
your girdle off. eh?

1179
01:15:28.662 --> 01:15:31.165
Ah. don't make fun of
me. I'm not what I once was

1180
01:15:31.165 --> 01:15:32.834
when you and I played together.

1181
01:15:32.834 --> 01:15:34.586
Look what I have to
do to look younger.

1182
01:15:34.586 --> 01:15:35.962
Ah. you look terrific.

1183
01:15:35.962 --> 01:15:36.838
I know.

1184
01:15:38.256 --> 01:15:40.967
To tell the truth I can hardly
follow the ball anymore.

1185
01:15:40.967 --> 01:15:42.761
it's kind of embarrassing.

1186
01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:44.638
But it's not all my fault.

1187
01:15:44.638 --> 01:15:47.808
Had plebitus in the leg
here. touch of arthritis.

1188
01:15:47.808 --> 01:15:49.143
Arthritis?

1189
01:15:49.143 --> 01:15:51.478
Here. tell me the good
news over one of these.

1190
01:15:51.478 --> 01:15:53.690
I think tonight'll
be my last match.

1191
01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:55.400
They hire me
because I'm a clown.

1192
01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.903
But the time has
come to give it up.

1193
01:15:57.903 --> 01:16:00.989
No more pelota. getting too old.

1194
01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:02.532
Don't give me that.

1195
01:16:02.532 --> 01:16:03.743
Tomorrow all the papers'll
be talking about you

1196
01:16:03.743 --> 01:16:06.037
just like in the good old days.

1197
01:16:06.037 --> 01:16:07.288
How I wish.

1198
01:16:07.288 --> 01:16:08.956
But the bookies are
giving 10 to one odds.

1199
01:16:08.956 --> 01:16:11.083
you know what that means.

1200
01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:15.255
Would you believe my brother's
betting $50.000 on you?

1201
01:16:15.255 --> 01:16:16.715
$50.000?

1202
01:16:16.715 --> 01:16:18.342
Your brother's loco. you
better get him to the nut house

1203
01:16:18.342 --> 01:16:19.593
right away.

1204
01:16:19.593 --> 01:16:22.137
Yeah. I know. he's
been that way for years.

1205
01:16:22.137 --> 01:16:24.641
I'm the guy they gotta watch.

1206
01:16:29.355 --> 01:16:33.234
Would you please make an
offering for the orphans?

1207
01:16:33.234 --> 01:16:34.818
Thank you very much.

1208
01:16:34.818 --> 01:16:37.906
Would you please.
an offering please?

1209
01:16:37.906 --> 01:16:40.367
Will you make a donation please?

1210
01:16:40.367 --> 01:16:41.451
Hey.

1211
01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:42.953
Fine. I'm coming.

1212
01:16:42.953 --> 01:16:43.995
Go inside.

1213
01:16:54.507 --> 01:16:55.883
Hey there.

1214
01:16:55.883 --> 01:16:57.844
Want a candy?

1215
01:16:57.844 --> 01:16:59.137
Hey. rough stuff.

1216
01:16:59.137 --> 01:17:00.472
I'm really glad
to see you again.

1217
01:17:00.472 --> 01:17:02.057
I'm glad to see you too.

1218
01:17:02.057 --> 01:17:03.517
By the way. thanks for
the tip you gave me

1219
01:17:03.517 --> 01:17:05.602
at the race track. remember?

1220
01:17:05.602 --> 01:17:08.606
I do the same
for all my friends.

1221
01:17:10.066 --> 01:17:13.027
Hey those guys over there
are your friends. huh?

1222
01:17:13.027 --> 01:17:15.154
Not in the sense you mean.

1223
01:17:15.154 --> 01:17:16.447
I belong to me.

1224
01:17:18.116 --> 01:17:20.911
You'd be the only one
I could really go for.

1225
01:17:20.911 --> 01:17:21.954
Oh really?

1226
01:17:21.954 --> 01:17:23.747
I'll remember that.

1227
01:17:23.747 --> 01:17:26.000
What are the odds
on Jamon Serrano?

1228
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.585
10 to one.

1229
01:17:27.585 --> 01:17:31.381
Well. I'm gonna put the
whole wad on him. $50.000.

1230
01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.925
Are you crazy?

1231
01:17:33.925 --> 01:17:36.094
Jamon Serrano's
finished. he's run down.

1232
01:17:36.094 --> 01:17:38.222
Nobody bets on him.

1233
01:17:38.222 --> 01:17:40.350
Nynfus and the gang
are giving those odds

1234
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:42.227
'cause they know he won't win.

1235
01:17:42.227 --> 01:17:43.979
Well I like risks.

1236
01:17:45.147 --> 01:17:46.023
Ha ha.

1237
01:17:47.357 --> 01:17:48.400
Hey. remember me?

1238
01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.068
Hey. wanna place a bet?

1239
01:17:50.068 --> 01:17:50.904
Yes sir.

1240
01:17:59.454 --> 01:18:00.955
One minute to game time.

1241
01:18:00.955 --> 01:18:04.293
take your seats.
ladies and gentlemen.

1242
01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:15.722
Ladies and gentlemen. we're
coming up to the last match

1243
01:18:15.722 --> 01:18:18.391
of this evening's main event.

1244
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:20.060
Players are on the court.

1245
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:25.066
And in first post we have
number 24. Arrina Padilla.

1246
01:18:25.066 --> 01:18:28.736
Post two. number 32.

Post eight. number
51. Luis Del Rey.

1254
01:18:51.178 --> 01:18:54.223
There you are ladies
and gentlemen. let's
start the match.

1255
01:18:54.223 --> 01:18:57.435
The first encounter is
between Arrina in red

1256
01:18:57.435 --> 01:19:00.230
and Mendez in light blue.

1257
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:02.857
In this particular contest.
the individual player

1258
01:19:02.857 --> 01:19:07.697
gains points by outplaying
and eliminating his opponent.

1259
01:19:07.697 --> 01:19:09.365
And the first match has begun.

1260
01:19:09.365 --> 01:19:12.577
Players must throw the ball.
or pelota. in such a way

1261
01:19:12.577 --> 01:19:15.621
that his opponent cannot return.

1262
01:19:15.621 --> 01:19:18.709
And there you have it.
Arrina is the loser.

1263
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:22.879
Now. Mendez must face
Ramon Jamon Serrano

1264
01:19:22.879 --> 01:19:24.590
in the white jersey.

1265
01:19:44.486 --> 01:19:46.488
Terrific throw by
the veteran Serrano

1266
01:19:46.488 --> 01:19:48.449
eliminates Mendez.

1267
01:19:48.449 --> 01:19:51.661
In spite of his courageous
attempt to recover the ball.

1268
01:19:51.661 --> 01:19:54.205
Now out on the court
comes Ruez El Toto.

1269
01:19:54.205 --> 01:19:56.500
As you may know. the ball
can bounce off the end

1270
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.630
and side walls. but can only
bounce once on the floor

1271
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:04.009
before it must be returned
by the opposing player.

1272
01:20:18.316 --> 01:20:21.403
After a fine volley. Ruez
fails to return the ball.

1273
01:20:21.403 --> 01:20:23.447
Number three wins again.

1274
01:20:23.447 --> 01:20:26.575
He now has two points and
it's one time world champion

1275
01:20:26.575 --> 01:20:30.037
Salazar. he gets the
ball off the wall

1276
01:20:30.037 --> 01:20:32.123
and returns it at high
speed. but Serrano

1277
01:20:32.123 --> 01:20:34.209
curls it back into play.

1278
01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:39.256
Salazar goes up on the wall
again but loses his balance.

1279
01:20:39.256 --> 01:20:40.215
Outclassed.

1280
01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:45.513
Serrano now has won three
games. he faces Carlo Primero.

1281
01:20:51.894 --> 01:20:54.147
Primero goes up but
can't reach high enough

1282
01:20:54.147 --> 01:20:58.235
and Jamon Serrano wins
his fourth straight game.

1283
01:20:58.235 --> 01:21:00.696
Now it's Gonzalez's
turn to try and stop

1284
01:21:00.696 --> 01:21:03.156
this amazing winning streak.

1285
01:21:10.874 --> 01:21:14.504
Serrano continues to win
and now has five points.

1286
01:21:14.504 --> 01:21:17.090
He must now face Luis Del Rey.

1287
01:21:36.945 --> 01:21:38.655
This is sensational!

1288
01:21:38.655 --> 01:21:42.993
Ramon Serrano. the Jamon.
has proved he can still win!

1289
01:21:56.215 --> 01:21:57.216
He's done it!

1290
01:21:57.216 --> 01:21:58.302
He's won the match!

1291
01:21:58.302 --> 01:22:00.179
He is the new champion!

1292
01:22:00.179 --> 01:22:01.639
Jamon!

1293
01:22:01.639 --> 01:22:02.514
Bravo!

1294
01:22:04.642 --> 01:22:05.517
Hey hey!

1295
01:22:07.353 --> 01:22:08.647
But
tonight he has come back

1296
01:22:08.647 --> 01:22:11.983
to beat some of the
world's best players.

1297
01:22:15.446 --> 01:22:17.615
So Serrano ain't worth a
dime but with his .

1298
01:22:17.615 --> 01:22:20.202
his beer drinking.
his slipped disk.

1299
01:22:20.202 --> 01:22:22.329
But you Bugsy. you're
a jerk. a numbskull.

1300
01:22:22.329 --> 01:22:24.373
you got a pea brain Bugsy.

1301
01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:26.875
The wager's gonna cost a
half a million dollars.

1302
01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.252
And who's gonna break
the news to The Greek?

1303
01:22:29.252 --> 01:22:30.880
I will.

1304
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.259
Just take me to his place
and I'll be glad to tell him.

1305
01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:37.011
I'll put up $500.000 you
owe me for this match

1306
01:22:37.011 --> 01:22:41.183
in a poker game. but I
only want to play with him.

1307
01:22:41.183 --> 01:22:42.810
Paragoulis The Greek.

1308
01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:44.353
Huh?

1309
01:22:44.353 --> 01:22:45.896
Hey listen boss.

1310
01:22:47.106 --> 01:22:49.400
You know. this guy's
a real nerd at cards.

1311
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.026
Remember when we
played with him before?

1312
01:22:51.026 --> 01:22:52.946
He lost his shirt.

1313
01:22:52.946 --> 01:22:55.031
Believe me. against The Greek
he won't even have a chance

1314
01:22:55.031 --> 01:22:56.074
at winning.

1315
01:22:56.074 --> 01:22:58.743
He's right you know.

1316
01:22:58.743 --> 01:22:59.995
The boss'll take
him to the cleaners

1317
01:22:59.995 --> 01:23:02.540
and he'll lose it all anyway.

1318
01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:05.459
It's a deal.

1319
01:23:05.459 --> 01:23:07.336
Consider yourself
invited to The Greek's.

1320
01:23:07.336 --> 01:23:11.090
For a friendly little
family game. alright?

1321
01:23:13.385 --> 01:23:17.931
Would you mind giving
me the money first?

1322
01:23:17.931 --> 01:23:18.807
Pay him.

1323
01:23:26.108 --> 01:23:27.067
$100.000.

1324
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:29.737
200. 300. 400. 500.

1325
01:23:35.827 --> 01:23:37.579
Everything is
going as planned.

1326
01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:40.790
Lieutenant Firpo is
close to pinpointing

1327
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:43.001
the location of The Greek.
the man we've been after.

1328
01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:46.088
thanks to the help he's had
from his father. Mike Firpo.

1329
01:23:46.088 --> 01:23:48.132
Admiral. as you requested.
we arranged to have

1330
01:23:48.132 --> 01:23:50.343
the police drop the charges
against Firpo's father.

1331
01:23:50.343 --> 01:23:52.345
They were after him for
everything from bouncing

1332
01:23:52.345 --> 01:23:54.513
bad checks to raising mayhem.

1333
01:23:54.513 --> 01:23:55.807
Raising mayhem?

1334
01:23:55.807 --> 01:23:56.600
I thought you got
a medal for that.

1335
01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:59.102
Admiral O'Connor.

1336
01:23:59.102 --> 01:24:00.145
Hello?

1337
01:24:00.145 --> 01:24:01.563
I'm calling for Johnny Firpo.

1338
01:24:01.563 --> 01:24:03.398
He said to tell you
that he's on his way

1339
01:24:03.398 --> 01:24:04.942
to the place he has
been looking for

1340
01:24:04.942 --> 01:24:06.736
and that you should follow him

1341
01:24:06.736 --> 01:24:08.905
as you had arranged to.

1342
01:24:08.905 --> 01:24:11.366
No. that's all he said.

1343
01:24:11.366 --> 01:24:12.700
You're welcome.

1344
01:24:14.452 --> 01:24:15.536
Hiya Sister.

1345
01:24:15.536 --> 01:24:16.955
Oh. hello Charlie.

1346
01:24:16.955 --> 01:24:18.248
You seen my
brother around here?

1347
01:24:18.248 --> 01:24:20.626
Oh yes. he said
to say hello to you.

1348
01:24:20.626 --> 01:24:22.086
He won a lot of money.

1349
01:24:22.086 --> 01:24:23.128
He gave me enough for...

1350
01:24:23.128 --> 01:24:25.297
Hey what are you doing?

1351
01:24:26.507 --> 01:24:27.549
Put that .

1352
01:24:27.549 --> 01:24:28.885
Anything else?

1353
01:24:28.885 --> 01:24:31.346
Oh yes. he also said
to give you this note.

1354
01:24:31.346 --> 01:24:32.807
How are you. Charlie?

1355
01:24:32.807 --> 01:24:34.058
I'm gonna put up
all the money we won

1356
01:24:34.058 --> 01:24:37.228
in a poker game since
you're my master.

1357
01:24:37.228 --> 01:24:39.606
I bet I beat the
pants off The Greek.

1358
01:24:39.606 --> 01:24:43.193
You and Papi and Sister Suzanne
and the orphans too. huh?

1359
01:24:43.193 --> 01:24:44.987
Please root for me?

1360
01:24:44.987 --> 01:24:46.029
Thanks.

1361
01:24:46.029 --> 01:24:48.824
Yours forever. your brother.

1362
01:24:48.824 --> 01:24:50.827
PS. don't get mad. huh?

1363
01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:52.829
Good news?

1364
01:24:54.205 --> 01:24:55.665
Very bad news.

1365
01:24:55.665 --> 01:24:56.833
He's alive.

1366
01:24:56.833 --> 01:24:57.709
But?

1367
01:25:16.354 --> 01:25:18.064
This way. we're
taking a boat ride.

1368
01:25:18.064 --> 01:25:19.524
Where we going?

1369
01:25:19.524 --> 01:25:21.109
Didn't you tell me you
wanted to play with Paragoulis?

1370
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:22.320
Well let's go.

1371
01:25:54.272 --> 01:25:55.815
There's still time.

1372
01:25:55.815 --> 01:25:57.192
For what?

1373
01:25:57.192 --> 01:25:58.401
To pull out.

1374
01:25:59.611 --> 01:26:02.656
I'll jump in the water.
you jump into save me.

1375
01:26:02.656 --> 01:26:06.827
we'll swim back to shore
and then you beat it.

1376
01:26:06.827 --> 01:26:08.955
What do we have
to do all that for?

1377
01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:11.040
'Cause I don't
want you ruined.

1378
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.627
I saw how you play. like a baby.

1379
01:26:14.627 --> 01:26:18.048
Paragoulis is the biggest
card shark around.

1380
01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:23.178
Listen to me. rough stuff. just
keep your money and beat it.

1381
01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.013
Your plan wouldn't work. baby.

1382
01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.891
But I like the part about the
mouth to mouth resuscitation

1383
01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:28.434
to save your life.

1384
01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:31.729
Well. no need for that.

1385
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:37.945
Hey. what are those two doing?

1386
01:26:41.907 --> 01:26:43.492
Bugsy. you know what you are?

1387
01:26:43.492 --> 01:26:45.953
Yeah. I'm a jerk.

1388
01:27:08.603 --> 01:27:11.107
Hey. looks like we got
a big bird in the sky

1389
01:27:11.107 --> 01:27:12.483
for an escort.

1390
01:27:17.822 --> 01:27:19.282
Navy command. navy
command. this is

1391
01:27:19.282 --> 01:27:23.120
condor eight zero two
zero. calling navy command.

1392
01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.788
Admiral. the launch
is going outside

1393
01:27:24.788 --> 01:27:26.749
territorial waters.

1394
01:27:26.749 --> 01:27:30.210
So it's impossible to
pursue any further.

1395
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:31.087
Damnit.

1396
01:27:32.464 --> 01:27:33.923
Now we can't intervene.

1397
01:27:33.923 --> 01:27:36.509
The launch has gone
outside territorial waters.

1398
01:27:36.509 --> 01:27:38.053
That means Lieutenant
Firpo will find himself

1399
01:27:38.053 --> 01:27:39.721
alone without help in the
hands of the underworld

1400
01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.223
somewhere at sea.

1401
01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:43.559
Our whole plan will fail.

1402
01:27:52.069 --> 01:27:54.404
You listen to me. friend.

1403
01:27:57.407 --> 01:28:01.329
Never trust people
that got blue eyes.

1404
01:28:01.329 --> 01:28:02.205
Never.

1405
01:28:07.044 --> 01:28:09.838
Especially if they your brother.

1406
01:28:33.739 --> 01:28:35.242
Get on the line.

1407
01:28:39.579 --> 01:28:41.832
They got here.

1408
01:28:55.888 --> 01:28:57.641
Nice place. huh?

1409
01:28:57.641 --> 01:28:58.517
After you.

1410
01:29:10.281 --> 01:29:12.908
And we have 24. black. even.

1411
01:29:15.202 --> 01:29:17.413
Sorry about that ma'am.

1412
01:29:17.413 --> 01:29:20.250
I'd like to play
just black this time.

1413
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:21.501
Okay.

1414
01:29:21.501 --> 01:29:22.961
Let's stay here
for a minute. please.

1415
01:29:22.961 --> 01:29:24.796
There you are. sir.

1416
01:29:24.796 --> 01:29:26.089
Two was the last
number. right?

1417
01:29:26.089 --> 01:29:27.591
Yes. two was the last number.

1418
01:29:27.591 --> 01:29:28.467
Right.

1419
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:31.554
That's 100 on 11 please.

1420
01:29:31.554 --> 01:29:33.806
One two three four five.

1421
01:29:35.475 --> 01:29:37.727
Okay. $10.000 on the nine.

1422
01:29:39.103 --> 01:29:41.732
The  and dust.

1423
01:29:41.732 --> 01:29:46.070
$3.000 on the column
 and $2.000 on red.

1424
01:29:47.279 --> 01:29:50.992
Watch this guy.
he's really something.

1425
01:29:50.992 --> 01:29:53.244
No more bets please.

1426
01:29:53.244 --> 01:29:54.204
Here we go.

1427
01:30:02.213 --> 01:30:03.839
And we have a nine!

1428
01:30:05.383 --> 01:30:06.592
Not bad. eh?

1429
01:30:06.592 --> 01:30:07.927
I'm a wizard in
infinitesimal calculus.

1430
01:30:07.927 --> 01:30:10.763
I just worked out
the probabilities.

1431
01:30:10.763 --> 01:30:11.807
Thanks ma'am.

1432
01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:13.100
What number should I play now?

1433
01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.685
Please advise me.

1434
01:30:14.685 --> 01:30:16.520
Well you have to wait for
your mathematical probability

1435
01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.022
to come around again.

1436
01:30:18.022 --> 01:30:21.943
And with this wheel
it'll be in 90. 822 turns.

1437
01:30:21.943 --> 01:30:23.821
What do you mean I
have to wait that long?

1438
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:25.239
Just have to be patient.

1439
01:30:25.239 --> 01:30:26.407
This the creep who
won all that money

1440
01:30:26.407 --> 01:30:27.825
which you guys owe to me?

1441
01:30:27.825 --> 01:30:29.284
Yeah. that's him.

1442
01:30:29.284 --> 01:30:30.661
He's trying to bankrupt us.

1443
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:31.954
He won a half million at pelota

1444
01:30:31.954 --> 01:30:35.000
and now 154.000 in
one go at roulette.

1445
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.127
On board my boat
no one is allowed

1446
01:30:37.127 --> 01:30:39.462
to get away with that.

1447
01:30:39.462 --> 01:30:41.464
Some way he must be
made to understand

1448
01:30:41.464 --> 01:30:44.927
that winning will be
very bad for his health.

1449
01:30:44.927 --> 01:30:46.846
I've been doing
some thinking. boss.

1450
01:30:46.846 --> 01:30:49.056
You know that guy is
real lucky when it comes

1451
01:30:49.056 --> 01:30:50.349
to picking winners.

1452
01:30:50.349 --> 01:30:51.517
But when it comes
to playing poker

1453
01:30:51.517 --> 01:30:53.019
he's a babe in arms.

1454
01:30:53.019 --> 01:30:55.564
While you are the sharpest
in the whole world.

1455
01:30:55.564 --> 01:30:57.649
And in outer space.

1456
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:59.401
In the
whole universe. boss.

1457
01:30:59.401 --> 01:31:00.902
Okay. we clip
his wings in poker.

1458
01:31:00.902 --> 01:31:01.778
Call him.

1459
01:31:03.447 --> 01:31:04.573
Nice truck.

1460
01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.202
I had a truck once too.

1461
01:31:09.329 --> 01:31:10.246
Nice truck.

1462
01:31:11.831 --> 01:31:13.916
But my brother stole it.

1463
01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:17.254
My brother stole my truck.

1464
01:31:19.048 --> 01:31:20.758
Your brother took your truck?

1465
01:31:20.758 --> 01:31:21.800
Yep.

1466
01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.385
You're lucky.

1467
01:31:23.385 --> 01:31:25.471
My brother took my wife.

1468
01:31:29.143 --> 01:31:32.480
I'm glad to make your
acquaintance. Johnny Firpo.

1469
01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.940
That is your name. isn't it?

1470
01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:38.236
A name that's not
completely new to me.

1471
01:31:38.236 --> 01:31:39.488
Not as new as
that nose of yours

1472
01:31:39.488 --> 01:31:41.823
that my brother Charlie
rearranged for you.

1473
01:31:41.823 --> 01:31:43.950
So you're Charlie
Firpo's brother?

1474
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:45.535
You bet.

1475
01:31:45.535 --> 01:31:49.707
He's strong with cards
and tough with his fists.

1476
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:58.591
But they tell me
you're better at cards.

1477
01:31:58.591 --> 01:31:59.551
That right?

1478
01:32:01.261 --> 01:32:06.100
Well I have learned to play
the game. Mr. Paragoulis.

1479
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.893
Well now we'll see.

1480
01:32:10.063 --> 01:32:10.939
Cut.

1481
01:32:29.166 --> 01:32:30.001
A grand.

1482
01:32:31.503 --> 01:32:34.214
A full pot makes me hot.

1483
01:32:34.214 --> 01:32:36.759
I hate smart remarks
when I play poker.

1484
01:32:36.759 --> 01:32:38.302
they make me very nervous.

1485
01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:39.345
Me too.

1486
01:32:39.345 --> 01:32:40.722
I'm in.

1487
01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:41.974
How many?

1488
01:32:41.974 --> 01:32:44.435
The pot's still light.

1489
01:32:53.486 --> 01:32:54.696
Three cards.

1490
01:32:56.364 --> 01:32:57.324
The same.

1491
01:32:59.034 --> 01:32:59.868
One.

1492
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:05.875
Take three.

1493
01:33:26.606 --> 01:33:28.524
Anybody want a bite?

1494
01:33:30.735 --> 01:33:33.946
An apple a day keeps
the doctor away.

1495
01:33:33.946 --> 01:33:37.493
It's a six. I can do
it with my eyes closed.

1496
01:33:37.493 --> 01:33:38.369
See that?

1497
01:33:41.372 --> 01:33:45.335
Now I will show you
Firpo's most famous shot.

1498
01:33:45.335 --> 01:33:48.714
Known as the Firpo double
whammy which succeeds

1499
01:33:48.714 --> 01:33:50.966
only one time in a hundred

1500
01:33:52.134 --> 01:33:54.512
and I'm gonna do it backwards.

1501
01:33:56.889 --> 01:33:57.766
Charlie!

1502
01:33:59.935 --> 01:34:01.561
I can see you!

1503
01:34:01.561 --> 01:34:03.021
Charlie!

1504
01:34:03.021 --> 01:34:05.107
I can see you!

1505
01:34:05.107 --> 01:34:05.982
Yes!

1506
01:34:07.234 --> 01:34:08.653
It's a miracle!

1507
01:34:08.653 --> 01:34:11.030
It's a miracle. Charlie!

1508
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:12.448
A miracle. eh?

1509
01:34:13.324 --> 01:34:14.200
A miracle!

1510
01:34:20.791 --> 01:34:22.668
Hey man. what are
you doing to my place?

1511
01:34:22.668 --> 01:34:23.752
Shut up.

1512
01:34:23.752 --> 01:34:26.213
It was a favor for Johnny.

1513
01:34:37.142 --> 01:34:38.727
I've had enough!

1514
01:34:43.065 --> 01:34:45.651
Charlie. what are you doing?

1515
01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.249
I was happy driving my truck.

1516
01:35:21.775 --> 01:35:23.361
Go find blue eyes.

1517
01:35:27.156 --> 01:35:28.199
Straight.

1518
01:35:28.199 --> 01:35:29.533
Ah shit.

1519
01:35:29.533 --> 01:35:31.118
I'd sure like to know
how the hell you managed

1520
01:35:31.118 --> 01:35:32.870
to win all the time.

1521
01:35:34.206 --> 01:35:37.709
I got a whole
orphanage praying for me.

1522
01:35:45.843 --> 01:35:47.220
10.

1523
01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.263
No shame in a friendly game.

1524
01:35:49.263 --> 01:35:50.682
Just stop with the
wisecracks. they're not funny

1525
01:35:50.682 --> 01:35:52.392
and we're not amused.

1526
01:35:52.392 --> 01:35:55.269
Me neither. me neither.

1527
01:35:55.269 --> 01:35:57.356
How many cards?

1528
01:35:57.356 --> 01:35:58.232
Four.

1529
01:36:02.737 --> 01:36:03.613
Three.

1530
01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:06.325
Two.

1531
01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:09.954
And the dealer takes three.

1532
01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:14.166
Two grand.

1533
01:36:15.126 --> 01:36:16.752
I'll raise you double.

1534
01:36:16.752 --> 01:36:17.587
I'm out.

1535
01:36:19.172 --> 01:36:20.507
Double again.

1536
01:36:22.968 --> 01:36:24.177
Ah. alright.

1537
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:28.057
I'll see you.

1538
01:36:31.102 --> 01:36:32.228
Full house.

1539
01:36:35.273 --> 01:36:36.649
Ah. good hand.

1540
01:36:38.402 --> 01:36:39.945
Excuse me. excuse me.

1541
01:36:39.945 --> 01:36:43.240
I've got a five. a six. a
seven. an eight. and a nine.

1542
01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.575
All hearts.

1543
01:36:44.575 --> 01:36:45.325
I guess that beats
a full house. huh?

1544
01:36:45.325 --> 01:36:46.785
Right?

1545
01:36:46.785 --> 01:36:48.579
I don't believe it.

1546
01:36:48.579 --> 01:36:50.790
You took four cards.
how did you do it?

1547
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:53.585
Don't ask me. ask the orphans.

1548
01:36:55.628 --> 01:36:56.629
Let's play again.

1549
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:57.505
Okay.

1550
01:37:05.389 --> 01:37:06.265
Cut.

1551
01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:53.025
Well. what are we
gonna play for?

1552
01:37:53.025 --> 01:37:55.195
I put up the boat. the
casino. and everything

1553
01:37:55.195 --> 01:37:56.780
that goes with it.

1554
01:37:58.573 --> 01:38:02.911
But first. you'll have to
excuse me for a double P.

1555
01:38:04.205 --> 01:38:05.415
What's that?

1556
01:38:08.292 --> 01:38:10.002
A double P.

1557
01:38:10.002 --> 01:38:10.878
Pee pee.

1558
01:38:13.214 --> 01:38:15.300
I'll be back in a flash.

1559
01:38:17.636 --> 01:38:18.512
Excuse me.

1560
01:38:19.764 --> 01:38:22.684
Would you hold this please?

1561
01:38:22.684 --> 01:38:23.560
Thank you.

1562
01:38:25.437 --> 01:38:26.564
There you go.

1563
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:31.861
You know it's not that
I don't trust you folks.

1564
01:38:31.861 --> 01:38:33.320
I always do this.

1565
01:38:36.742 --> 01:38:37.617
Thank you.

1566
01:38:39.828 --> 01:38:40.662
Oh.

1567
01:38:51.257 --> 01:38:52.842
Hey. where is everybody?

1568
01:38:52.842 --> 01:38:53.885
Sleeping.

1569
01:38:53.885 --> 01:38:54.927
Already?

1570
01:38:54.927 --> 01:38:55.803
Yeah.

1571
01:38:58.599 --> 01:38:59.600
Hey!

1572
01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.642
Thank you.

1573
01:39:03.187 --> 01:39:04.730
Gonna wait for me?

1574
01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:08.735
Wouldn't want you to get lost.

1575
01:39:49.988 --> 01:39:52.409
Oh. did you want to come in?

1576
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:54.953
Yeah.

1577
01:39:54.953 --> 01:39:56.162
Sorry.

1578
01:39:56.162 --> 01:39:57.622
Hey. what's going on?

1579
01:39:57.622 --> 01:39:59.082
Aren't you guys gonna play?

1580
01:39:59.082 --> 01:40:02.001
No. Johnny Firpo.

1581
01:40:02.001 --> 01:40:02.837
Why not?

1582
01:40:04.839 --> 01:40:07.007
'Cause now it's
just between us two.

1583
01:40:07.007 --> 01:40:09.176
One to one. face to face.

1584
01:40:10.845 --> 01:40:13.932
And we're gonna play
five card stud. alright?

1585
01:40:13.932 --> 01:40:16.101
Sure. that's fine with me.

1586
01:40:16.101 --> 01:40:16.977
Get out.

1587
01:40:24.152 --> 01:40:25.194
Good luck.

1588
01:40:25.194 --> 01:40:26.529
Thanks. baby.

1589
01:40:28.823 --> 01:40:30.450
Should we put a value
on this old tub?

1590
01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:34.078
This old tub cost me more
than a million dollars.

1591
01:40:34.078 --> 01:40:35.581
You got ripped off.

1592
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:37.751
I've always had a pretty
good nose for a deal.

1593
01:40:37.751 --> 01:40:40.837
Maybe. before
you met my brother.

1594
01:40:40.837 --> 01:40:43.965
Let's say it's worth
half a million.

1595
01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:54.226
The top on the first card.
you won't have much left

1596
01:40:54.226 --> 01:40:55.728
for the others.

1597
01:40:59.733 --> 01:41:01.026
Hey!

1598
01:41:01.026 --> 01:41:04.112
When I give you the
signal. cut me loose!

1599
01:41:04.112 --> 01:41:07.492
Alright my
boy. but be careful!

1600
01:41:13.706 --> 01:41:14.791
Your pants.

1601
01:41:16.334 --> 01:41:17.377
What?

1602
01:41:17.377 --> 01:41:18.504
Your pants.

1603
01:41:20.923 --> 01:41:22.216
You're bluffing.

1604
01:41:22.216 --> 01:41:23.926
You can't be serious.

1605
01:41:23.926 --> 01:41:25.219
You've got to be bluffing.

1606
01:41:25.219 --> 01:41:26.887
If you want to
see you got to pay

1607
01:41:26.887 --> 01:41:28.890
and you're short $3.000.

1608
01:41:28.890 --> 01:41:32.394
And $3.000 for a pair of
pants is not a bad deal.

1609
01:41:32.394 --> 01:41:33.770
What else have you got?

1610
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:35.397
The upper hand.

1611
01:41:35.397 --> 01:41:37.065
Ho ho ho.

1612
01:41:37.065 --> 01:41:38.108
Let me see.

1613
01:41:38.108 --> 01:41:39.360
That's not enough.

1614
01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.113
This isn't worth more than $300.

1615
01:41:44.156 --> 01:41:45.616
Come on. come on. your pants.

1616
01:41:45.616 --> 01:41:46.743
What are you guys waiting for?

1617
01:41:46.743 --> 01:41:47.994
Throw him to the sharks!

1618
01:41:47.994 --> 01:41:50.123
Hey. hold it. hold
it. take it easy. guys.

1619
01:41:50.123 --> 01:41:54.460
Let's not get uptight about a
little game between friends.

1620
01:42:01.301 --> 01:42:03.011
I'll tell you what.
Mr. Paragoulis.

1621
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:05.180
What if we do it this way?

1622
01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.766
You take me to shore on
this nice beautiful boat

1623
01:42:07.766 --> 01:42:10.018
and you can have it all back.

1624
01:42:10.018 --> 01:42:14.357
It's all yours. here. it's
all yours. Mr. Paragoulis.

1625
01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:22.324
First I want to see
if you were bluffing.

1626
01:42:26.746 --> 01:42:28.164
Push the joker in the water.

1627
01:42:28.164 --> 01:42:29.081
Geronimo!

1628
01:42:37.674 --> 01:42:39.426
Hey. look who's here!

1629
01:42:39.426 --> 01:42:40.677
Charlie's here.

1630
01:42:44.599 --> 01:42:45.850
Shut up.

1631
01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:46.726
Peace.

1632
01:42:48.561 --> 01:42:50.730
What a nice surprise!

1633
01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:52.523
Did you come to gamble?

1634
01:42:52.523 --> 01:42:56.780
I come to get a pair of
blue eyes for our papi.

1635
01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:05.581
Great punch.

1636
01:43:08.501 --> 01:43:09.376
Charlie.

1637
01:43:39.493 --> 01:43:40.327
Johnny.

1638
01:43:42.454 --> 01:43:44.665
Now take it easy
Charlie. calm down.

1639
01:43:44.665 --> 01:43:46.417
I know when you're
nervous it's hard for you

1640
01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:50.088
to understand but
let me explain. I can
explain everything.

1641
01:43:52.799 --> 01:43:54.050
Charlie. remember
when we were kids.

1642
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:56.636
united we'd stand and
divided we'd fall?

1643
01:43:56.636 --> 01:44:00.057
And remember how together we
used to beat everybody. right?

1644
01:44:00.057 --> 01:44:00.933
Huh?

1645
01:44:12.864 --> 01:44:14.866
Oh gosh. I'm
sorry. don't get mad.

1646
01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.244
Not again. poor guy.

1647
01:44:18.244 --> 01:44:19.454
It's just not my day.

1648
01:44:19.454 --> 01:44:20.497
Hey buddy.

1649
01:44:20.497 --> 01:44:21.957
Yeah?

1650
01:44:21.957 --> 01:44:22.791
Are you fighting
yourselves or against us?

1651
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:25.085
You didn't get it yet?

1652
01:44:25.085 --> 01:44:26.128
No.

1653
01:44:26.128 --> 01:44:27.212
I'll explain it to you.

1654
01:44:27.212 --> 01:44:28.255
Good.

1655
01:45:17.352 --> 01:45:18.770
It's your lucky night.

1656
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:19.854
One for you. one for you.

1657
01:45:19.854 --> 01:45:21.106
Hey. buzz off.

1658
01:46:08.908 --> 01:46:10.493
My hand slipped.

1659
01:47:13.271 --> 01:47:14.564
Hey I want to
show you something.

1660
01:47:14.564 --> 01:47:17.651
Hey. come up to the
bar. it's on me.

1661
01:47:22.447 --> 01:47:23.574
Hey. what do you want?

1662
01:47:23.574 --> 01:47:24.617
Coke.

1663
01:47:24.617 --> 01:47:25.660
This okay?

1664
01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:27.245
Yeah. it's fine.

1665
01:47:48.853 --> 01:47:52.148
Hey. slim. you keeping
your nails clean?

1666
01:47:52.148 --> 01:47:53.524
Don't worry. I'm not
going to use this.

1667
01:47:53.524 --> 01:47:54.859
Look.

1668
01:47:54.859 --> 01:47:55.735
Let's see.

1669
01:48:25.768 --> 01:48:26.935
Oh. that smarts.

1670
01:48:26.935 --> 01:48:27.979
You want a hit?

1671
01:48:27.979 --> 01:48:29.105
Yes please.

1672
01:48:30.648 --> 01:48:31.733
Thank you very much.

1673
01:48:40.744 --> 01:48:42.245
Hey Greek. wait a minute.

1674
01:48:42.245 --> 01:48:43.288
Forgot this.

1675
01:48:49.087 --> 01:48:51.089
Learned your
lessons. have you?

1676
01:48:51.089 --> 01:48:53.091
Nothing like
working together. huh?

1677
01:48:53.091 --> 01:48:55.259
Yeah. behind you.

1678
01:48:55.259 --> 01:48:56.719
Hey.

1679
01:48:59.097 --> 01:49:00.641
Watch out.

1680
01:49:00.641 --> 01:49:04.186
You'd think they'd have
learned. wouldn't you?

1681
01:49:04.186 --> 01:49:05.229
Why don't you hit him?

1682
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:06.105
That one?

1683
01:49:07.564 --> 01:49:09.358
Let's get 'em all up.

1684
01:49:26.627 --> 01:49:27.670
Nice going.

1685
01:49:27.670 --> 01:49:29.046
Hey. Nynfus. come here.

1686
01:49:29.046 --> 01:49:30.631
Yeah sure. sure.

1687
01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:37.931
Now the joker's on the table.

1688
01:49:39.808 --> 01:49:43.771
Folks will you look
at that. forgot one.

1689
01:49:43.771 --> 01:49:46.816
Hold on friend.
help is on its way.

1690
01:49:49.486 --> 01:49:50.988
You'll never get
the boat to land.

1691
01:49:50.988 --> 01:49:51.989
Who says?

1692
01:50:01.791 --> 01:50:04.086
He's right. we gotta find
a way to get this tub

1693
01:50:04.086 --> 01:50:05.546
back to land.

1694
01:50:05.546 --> 01:50:06.380
Huh.

1695
01:50:09.633 --> 01:50:10.843
No we don't.

1696
01:50:16.099 --> 01:50:19.102
Okay men. get
them on their feet

1697
01:50:19.102 --> 01:50:21.271
and get them out of here.

1698
01:50:22.481 --> 01:50:24.524
Hey. how'd you do that?

1699
01:50:24.524 --> 01:50:25.401
Simple.

1700
01:50:31.699 --> 01:50:34.285
Actually it was them. I
only told them what to do.

1701
01:51:13.579 --> 01:51:16.207
What were you
guys talking about?

1702
01:51:16.207 --> 01:51:18.501
Why don't you learn
how to speak dolphinese?

1703
01:51:18.501 --> 01:51:20.420
It comes in handy on
occasions like this.

1704
01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:24.424
I also speak turtlese.
crocodilese. hippopotomese.

1705
01:51:24.424 --> 01:51:25.425
Hey rough stuff.

1706
01:51:25.425 --> 01:51:27.052
Oh hey.

1707
01:51:27.052 --> 01:51:28.137
Hi.

1708
01:51:28.137 --> 01:51:29.179
Hey yourself.

1709
01:51:29.179 --> 01:51:30.432
Here's a souvenir.

1710
01:51:30.432 --> 01:51:31.474
Thanks.

1711
01:51:31.474 --> 01:51:32.767
Come see me in the clink?

1712
01:51:32.767 --> 01:51:34.310
I don't have to do that.

1713
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:36.229
I'm gonna pay your bail and
take you out to dinner tonight.

1714
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:37.272
What do you say. huh?

1715
01:51:37.272 --> 01:51:38.314
That sounds even better.

1716
01:51:38.314 --> 01:51:39.524
Johnny.

1717
01:51:39.524 --> 01:51:40.860
See you later.

1718
01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.361
My boys!

1719
01:51:42.361 --> 01:51:43.195
Johnny!

1720
01:51:44.238 --> 01:51:46.115
And Charlie!

1721
01:51:46.115 --> 01:51:47.533
I'm proud of you.

1722
01:51:49.034 --> 01:51:51.913
Admiral. I hope you
keep your promise.

1723
01:51:51.913 --> 01:51:53.748
Admirals always
keep their promises.

1724
01:51:53.748 --> 01:51:55.584
And I wanna make
one thing clear.

1725
01:51:55.584 --> 01:51:57.127
This mission would not
have been successful

1726
01:51:57.127 --> 01:51:59.504
without the help of
your son Charlie Firpo

1727
01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:02.508
to whom the United States
Navy wishes to offer

1728
01:52:02.508 --> 01:52:04.051
a brand new truck.

1729
01:52:05.136 --> 01:52:06.721
And it's got the works.

1730
01:52:06.721 --> 01:52:10.601
CB radio. automatic shift.
radial tires. you name it.

1731
01:52:10.601 --> 01:52:12.979
As for your other son.
there'll be a decoration.

1732
01:52:12.979 --> 01:52:16.441
Congratulations.
Lieutenant Firpo.

1733
01:52:16.441 --> 01:52:18.401
What's this. Lieutenant Firpo?

1734
01:52:18.401 --> 01:52:19.611
You putting me on?

1735
01:52:19.611 --> 01:52:22.947
No. not this time. Charlie.

1736
01:52:22.947 --> 01:52:27.286
Admiral. I'd like to make a
last bet with my brother. sir.

1737
01:52:28.245 --> 01:52:29.079
A bet?

1738
01:52:31.957 --> 01:52:36.213
Gentlemen. what do you say
we look over this ship?

1739
01:52:38.757 --> 01:52:39.633
Okay.

1740
01:52:40.926 --> 01:52:43.595
Let's make the
bet of a lifetime.

1741
01:52:43.595 --> 01:52:46.015
We got a cool million
dollars between us.

1742
01:52:46.015 --> 01:52:47.809
all from gambling.

1743
01:52:47.809 --> 01:52:49.977
What do you say we flip for it?

1744
01:52:49.977 --> 01:52:51.020
Heads or tails?

1745
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:52.605
Boys. boys. what about me?

1746
01:52:52.605 --> 01:52:54.107
What about me?

1747
01:52:54.107 --> 01:52:56.777
What about your poor old
father who loves you so?

1748
01:52:56.777 --> 01:52:58.821
Don't worry. don't worry papi.

1749
01:52:58.821 --> 01:53:01.198
I'll decide how we do this.

1750
01:53:02.449 --> 01:53:05.369
Heads it's all for you. okay?

1751
01:53:05.369 --> 01:53:06.621
Uh huh.

1752
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:10.416
Tails it's half for
Papi. half for me.

1753
01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:13.336
If it's neither heads
or tails. it all goes

1754
01:53:13.336 --> 01:53:16.465
to Sister Suzanne
and the orphanage.

1755
01:53:22.597 --> 01:53:23.473
Deal.

1756
01:53:26.268 --> 01:53:28.020
Papi. you flip it.

1757
01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:32.483
Like you used to do on
the beach when we were kids.

1758
01:53:32.483 --> 01:53:33.526
Okay boys.

1759
01:53:52.464 --> 01:53:54.132
You see that?

1760
01:53:54.132 --> 01:53:57.802
Neither heads nor tails. it
all goes to the orphanage.

1761
01:53:57.802 --> 01:54:00.389
How did you do that?

1762
01:54:00.389 --> 01:54:01.599
You know what that was?

1763
01:54:01.599 --> 01:54:03.851
Jonathan Livingston Firpo.

1764
01:54:11.651 --> 01:54:13.111
* When I wake up in the morning

1765
01:54:13.111 --> 01:54:17.491
* I find out that I'll
be crying all night long

1766
01:54:18.992 --> 01:54:20.994
* As I cross the doorway

1767
01:54:20.994 --> 01:54:23.206
* I realize I'm
down in the street

1768
01:54:23.206 --> 01:54:25.626
* Had to go

1769
01:54:27.586 --> 01:54:29.254
* You're wrecking out my days

1770
01:54:29.254 --> 01:54:31.465
* And you're wrecking
out my nights

1771
01:54:31.465 --> 01:54:35.553
* And there's nothing
I can do for now

1772
01:54:35.553 --> 01:54:37.347
* People think I'm mad

1773
01:54:37.347 --> 01:54:39.390
* If I don't seem so sad

1774
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:43.771
* And there's nothing
I can do for now

1775
01:54:43.771 --> 01:54:44.772
* Brotherly love

1776
01:54:44.772 --> 01:54:46.065
* I don't know what to do

1777
01:54:46.065 --> 01:54:47.149
