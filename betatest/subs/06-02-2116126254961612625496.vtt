Hmm?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.009
It looks like this is a note
from whoever left the baby.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.129
"Got the other 12 witches

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.210

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.069
"Earwig"?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.050
If it's true
that this child's mother

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.039
has associated with 12 witches.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180
then it follows
she must also be a witch.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.090
I wonder
what she might have done

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.030
to anger all the other witches
in her coven.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.139
Witches. is it?
Bunch of rubbish!

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.069

little child is a witch as well.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.169

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.220
I bet they're going to put you
in a full nelson

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.220
when they grab you
with their eight arms.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.169

game over for you.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.090

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.230

They have three.

(scoffs) Three or eight--
who cares. Custard?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.120

that ridiculous name.

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:13.150

I'm not your slave!

I agreed to assist you.
and you agreed that you were

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:28.019

everything you knew about magic.

Of course I won't.
Why would I bother?

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:16.180
(groaning softly)

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:18.159
When can I read more?

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:21.020
-(steam whistling)
-I'll get right to it.

01:17:21.039 --> 01:17:23.029
(grunting)

01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:24.050
EARWIG:
Even the demons.

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:25.100
who are only loyal
to the Mandrake.

01:17:25.119 --> 01:17:27.180
are starting to do
my bidding now.

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:29.180
-(fingers snap)
-Oh. Demon!

01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:36.119
You summoned me. my most
beautiful and splendid mistress?

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.109
The Mandrake and I
will have the mixed grill.

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:40.140
and Bella Yaga...

01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:42.119
Even so. there's still one thing

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.079
I just can't
get to seem to go my way.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:49.119
No matter what I do.
Custard won't come to visit.

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.000
-BELLA YAGA: Open it for me.
-Mm-hmm.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.020
EARWIG:
He says he's

01:17:52.039 --> 01:17:53.020
much too afraid
of the Mandrake

01:17:53.039 --> 01:17:56.020
to come anywhere near the house.

01:17:56.039 --> 01:17:59.069
(Mandrake growling angrily)

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:03.189
But it's all right.

01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:05.229
Just like I made things
go my way at my new home.

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:10.069
I'm sure I'll eventually be able
to make Custard do what I want.

01:18:11.069 --> 01:18:12.100
(grunts softly)

01:18:12.119 --> 01:18:13.170
(vehicle approaching)

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.180
(shudders. gasps)

01:18:22.079 --> 01:18:24.020
-(doorbell buzzing)
-He's here!

01:18:24.039 --> 01:18:25.119
(Bella Yaga chuckles)

01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:29.010
(shivering)

01:18:29.029 --> 01:18:30.199
Hmm?

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.119
(lock clicking)

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.180
Custard! You...

01:18:34.199 --> 01:18:36.039
(gasps)

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:40.159
Merry Christmas. Earwig.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.170
(upbeat song playing)

01:18:59.189 --> 01:19:01.170
(singers harmonizing)

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.170
(woman singing in Japanese)

01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:43.189
