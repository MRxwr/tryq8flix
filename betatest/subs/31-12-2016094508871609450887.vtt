[harp glissando]

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:46.601
- [Narrator] Our
ancestors originally came

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:48.168
from the tropical rainforest.

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.606
So. the tropical
rainforest in a sense.

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:55.262
is our Garden of Eden.
And the gardeners

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.310
in the Garden of Eden are the
megafauna: the orangutans.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.967
the elephants. and
occasionally the rhinoceros.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:06.011
believe it or not.

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:09.972
The fate of tropical rainforest

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.584
is inextricably tied to the
fate of these megafauna.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.935
[elephant trumpeting]

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:19.024
So. do we need rainforests?

00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:21.244
Of course we need rainforests.

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.942
We need oxygen.
we need to breath.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.729
It's a clichÃ© to say
by saving orangutans

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.514
or by saving elephants.
we are saving ourselves.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.388
But it's actually true if
we look at the longterm.

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:38.218
Humans are very bad at
looking at the long term.

00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:39.567
We want it now.

00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:44.398
- Yes. it's always very
difficult in our terribly busy.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.619
frantic. and dangerous world
to focus on non-human issues.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.671
But nevertheless there is
a massive crisis going on

00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:58.499
with wildlife around the world.

00:03:58.586 --> 00:03:59.935
And it's not just the
charismatic species

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:01.197
that we're talking about.

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.243
[cub growling]

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.809
There are a ton
of smaller species

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:07.856
that are also under
massive threat and species

00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:10.162
that we don't favor
quite so much.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.861
[hyena cackling]

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:15.167
Evolution. or evolutionary
biologists. some might say.

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:18.258
and certainly
creationists might say.

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:23.088
and certainly religions might
say. that the human being

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:26.527
is the pinnacle of evolution.

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:29.312
[engine roaring]

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.357
[baboon screeching]

00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:31.793
Well. if it is. we are one

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.230
of the stupidest
species on the planet.

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:38.365
Because I cannot think
of any other species

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:42.847
that goes around intentionally
trashing its own home.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:47.287
So. if we're the
apex of evolution.

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:50.159
then if there is a God.
He made a real mistake.

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:57.079
- Once you understand there's
no sharp line dividing us

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.908
from the rest of the animal
kingdom and that we are part

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:03.041
of the animal kingdom and
not as we arrogantly suppose.

00:05:03.128 --> 00:05:05.827
somehow separated. you
then can ask yourself.

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:09.309
"Well. okay how is it
that we're different?"

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:12.747
because we are different.

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.270
And I think it's the
explosive development

00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:15.924
of the human intellect.

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:19.710
And so how come the most
intellectual species

00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:24.106
to ever walk the planet is
wiping out the other life forms.

00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:26.413
is destroying ecosystems...

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.849
Because this. in the end.

00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:30.025
is going to lead
to our destruction.

00:05:30.112 --> 00:05:33.768
So. we destroy these
animals at our own peril

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:37.032
without thinking of the
future of our own species.

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:43.691
[plane roaring]

00:06:01.752 --> 00:06:04.146
The real cause of wildlife crime

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:06.496
is corruption. and
corruption. it's greed.

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.458
The real conflict
is powerful people.

00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:14.069
many times government
officials. who are the ones

00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:15.679
in the heart of organized crime.

00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:18.160
that's basically activating
hundreds of poachers.

00:06:18.247 --> 00:06:20.162
across many countries.

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.165
The illegal wildlife trade is
not rooted in poverty at all.

00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:26.255
In fact. poverty has nothing
to do with this issue.

00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:29.171
It is in fact. the
rich and the powerful

00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:31.391
that actually are the
part of this problem.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.307
- These are people that
have made reputations

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.181
and made a very. very. very
strong impact in the world

00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:41.183
and they've made that impact
in a very violent way.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.142
They've killed people. they've
executed entire families.

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.276
they've bribed officials.
they've put people in places

00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:48.669
where they can make decisions

00:06:48.756 --> 00:06:51.236
that impact policies
and governments.

00:06:51.323 --> 00:06:53.935
You're not talking about you
know. your run of the mill.

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:58.505
poor poacher who's running
around with a 1947 rifle.

00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:01.421
You're talking about
extremely powerful.

00:07:01.508 --> 00:07:04.336
extremely influential
people in positions of power

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.296
that simply snap their fingers
and make people disappear.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.387
- [Director] Why are
we not just going

00:07:11.474 --> 00:07:12.867
in there with drones?

00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:14.608
- I thought you wanted
to hear the answer

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:16.087
to the other question which
was a much better question.

00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:17.480
- [Director] Okay.
so the question is.

00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:19.830
are we losing this war?

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.353
- Yes. right now
we certainly are.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.399
And it's not just that
we're losing the war.

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:26.663
the rate at which we are
losing the war is increasing.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.274
There is evidence coming
across my desk every day

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.059
of the gravity of the situation.

00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:34.497
It is more serious than anyone
can express standing here.

00:07:34.584 --> 00:07:36.543
It's certainly easier to
say. well. it isn't that bad.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.935
I'm looking at a small portion.

00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:39.894
My job is to look
at the big scale.

00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.330
I've worked in the
field in parks.

00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:42.331
I've worked in countries.

00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:43.419
I've worked on regions.

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:45.552
Now I look at bigger picture

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.729
and that bigger picture is
really serious right now.

00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:58.739
- My interest in organized
crime came from years

00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:02.264
of being a journalist.
working in conflict areas

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:04.092
and unstable areas of the world.

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:07.574
And what I found was
no matter where I went

00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:11.273
whatever the so-called
problem of the day was.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.971
was predicated on
crime and corruption.

00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:16.626
The U.S. government
could have more impact

00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:19.934
if we go after the networks
that facilitate all sorts

00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.762
of organized crime.
instead of trying

00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:24.895
to fight specific types
of organized crime.

00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:27.898
There are far fewer people
who know how to launder

00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:31.511
and move large amounts
of illicit cash

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:34.514
than there are poachers sneaking
into parks across Africa.

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:40.998
If we can stop the money.
make it harder for them

00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:43.348
to move money through the
global financial system

00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:45.916
we're going to have more
impact in shutting this down.

00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:48.484
And not just the ivory problem.

00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:51.966
but the human trafficking
problem. tax evasion.

00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:55.273
the departure of
revenues from corrupt

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.275
and developing countries.

00:08:57.362 --> 00:09:02.106
There are all sorts of
treaties that already exist

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:05.196
that prohibit the extraction
of natural resources

00:09:05.283 --> 00:09:06.894
illegally from Africa.

00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:09.418
We could be applying those
to the wildlife trade.

00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:12.987
And we need to think about this

00:09:13.074 --> 00:09:15.946
as not just a
ecological disaster

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:17.339
but a national security issues.

00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:19.210
an international security issue.

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:20.995
The people who are moving ivory.

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:22.866
the people who are
moving rhino horn.

00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:25.826
are the same people who
are moving young women

00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:28.655
from Bangkok to
Africa and Europe.

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:31.266
the same people who
are moving drugs up

00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:32.746
into consumer markets.

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.704
It's the people who
have the capacity

00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:36.184
to move illegal products

00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.664
through the global
transport system.

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:39.535
And it's the people
who have the capacity

00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:41.145
to launder illicit money

00:09:41.232 --> 00:09:42.886
through the global
transport system.

00:09:42.973 --> 00:09:44.496
And so what the United States.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.890
and pretty much every
other government does.

00:09:46.977 --> 00:09:50.024
is they stovepipe all of
those different commodities

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.635
and they give different
departments the responsibility

00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:54.332
to deal with those
different commodities.

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:56.857
So. we will have a department
that handles wildlife.

00:09:56.944 --> 00:09:58.859
we'll have a department
that deals with narcotics

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:00.774
and a department that
handles terrorism.

00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:04.691
And the bad guys are
all working together.

00:10:04.778 --> 00:10:06.693
You know. you never
see a drug trafficker

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.608
in Afghanistan who says.

00:10:08.695 --> 00:10:10.958
"I'm not giving that Al Qaeda
guy my heroine to carry.

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:13.525
"He doesn't have the
authorities to carry my dope."

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.354
No. they're all
working together.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.455
- It's a wide range of
different kinds of groups.

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.675
Some are groups that
have been designated

00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:35.547
as terrorist organizations
by the U.S. government.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:40.422
Some are rebel militias. some
are organized crime networks

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:43.425
and some are actually
state actors.

00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:47.298
military or police units
that are taking advantage

00:10:47.385 --> 00:10:52.173
of natural resources in the
region. for their own profits.

00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:18.634
- One of the biggest and
least discussed problems

00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:22.072
in the world today is that
the illicit extraction

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:24.292
of resources from most
developing countries

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:26.947
is about 10 times what
they get in foreign aid.

00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.862
So you're never going to
get ahead of this problem

00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:30.167
until we can stop it.

00:11:30.254 --> 00:11:31.865
If we can stop the money

00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:34.955
we're gonna have more impact
in shutting this down.

00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:37.435
We'll be able to have
much more of an impact

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:40.221
against these violent
networks if we go after them

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:43.311
for their totality of
their activities for drugs.

00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:45.617
for wildlife. for
people. for guns.

00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:50.492
I hear these going in Africa
as cheap as 75 dollars.

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:53.190
A better quality one may
be $100. $150. $200 dollars

00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:54.539
depending on what they are.

00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:56.411
- These are not
hunting guns. right?

00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:59.327
- No. they're the best thing
ever made for shooting people.

00:11:59.414 --> 00:12:00.415
Serious. that's
what they're for.

00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:01.459
They're for shooting people.

00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:05.115
It's not a competition gun.

00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:07.074
It's not really
intended for hunting.

00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:08.684
It's really probably one
of the most efficient guns

00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:10.468
ever made for
shooting bad people.

00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:14.255
That's why they are so
prolific in the world.

00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:24.613
- This rhino horn here
weighs six. seven pounds.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.920
I don't remember if this
is the front or the back.

00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:29.705
I don't know that much
about them. but alls I know

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.534
is this right here
on the retail market

00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:34.971
is worth about 650.000 dollars.

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.975
That amazes me to think
that. because what

00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:44.067
that equivalates to is somewhere
around 35.000 of these.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.549
When you got $650.000 dollars
in that horn right there

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:49.943
and you can buy a bunch
of these. how much terror

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.554
do you think this
whole game drives?

00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:54.643
It's about a weapon
bought to kill an elephant

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.645
and then used to rob a bank.

00:12:56.732 --> 00:13:00.083
It's about entire
local communities.
poor local communities.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.956
getting exploited by
traffickers that arrive

00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:05.306
and offer five.
six years salary.

00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:08.265
Of course. they kill an elephant
for five years of salary

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:10.659
in Africa; they will do
it here in Los Angeles.

00:13:10.746 --> 00:13:14.532
- What we got here is
about a four-foot tusk

00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:16.665
that came off a 20
year old elephant.

00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.493
This thing is worth
about 400.000 dollars.

00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:21.452
You can see how that
drives the problem.

00:13:23.324 --> 00:13:25.543
- So when we're talking
about the extinction

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.633
of those species. I'm
thinking of the cost in terms

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.768
of individual suffering.
to highly intelligent

00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:35.075
and highly emotional beings.

00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:38.774
And to me this is
absolutely terrible.

00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:42.430
The sale of illegally
killed ivory is being used

00:13:42.517 --> 00:13:47.435
to actually enable terrorists
groups to buy the weapons.

00:13:47.522 --> 00:13:50.786
[dramatic music]

00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:54.616
The terrible massacre
in Nairobi was funded

00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:57.358
by the sale of ivory.

00:13:57.445 --> 00:14:01.275
So. the whole
situation has escalated

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:03.494
into something that's
very frightening.

00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:06.280
It's not only impacting
the elephants.

00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:11.328
but it's also impacting
the security of nations.

00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:15.724
It's incredibly important
that people wake up

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:18.074
and understand exactly
what's going on

00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:23.166
and exactly the price in
suffering that's being caused.

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:26.039
[gun firing]

00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:30.130
[dramatic music]

00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:31.261
- The terrorist attack

00:14:31.348 --> 00:14:33.437
on the shopping mall in Nairobi

00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.483
was a big eye opener
for a lot of officials

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.878
in the defense department. in
the intelligence community.

00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:41.228
in the law
enforcement community.

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:43.099
that actually there was
something to this link

00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.972
between wildlife
trafficking and violence.

00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:50.454
Al Shabaab could be defeated.
but I think the United States

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:52.282
and its partners
could be smarter

00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:55.677
about combating the message
that these organizations give.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:58.332
They shouldn't be engaging
in extortion. kidnapping.

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:01.683
all of that is haram.
forbidden by Islam.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.600
Nobody takes them on according
to the precepts of Islam.

00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:07.907
These guys who call
themselves Mullahs.

00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:12.041
who call themselves
Holy Warriors. are
actually just crooks.

00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:14.652
[tense music]

00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.008
- You got Boko Haram.
you got ISIS over there.

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:23.400
you got all these
different people

00:15:23.487 --> 00:15:26.360
that are running
child slavery. drugs.

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:27.535
whatever they're doing.

00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:28.928
I mean you got child soldiers.

00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:30.190
they're just brainwashed
to shoot anybody

00:15:30.277 --> 00:15:31.539
that gets in their path.

00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:33.193
The pictures I've seen is like.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.543
I mean the elephants are.
trust me. that's bad.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.937
but when you see what they
do to children it's like. uh.

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.767
- In the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:15:42.854 --> 00:15:45.292
5.4 million people
were dead as a result

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.164
of war related
causes as of 2007.

00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:51.037
And the fighting has
continued since then.

00:15:51.124 --> 00:15:54.040
Joseph Kony has been
active as the leader

00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:57.391
of the Lord's Resistance
Army for a very long time.

00:15:57.478 --> 00:16:00.089
Hundreds of thousands of
children have been abducted.

00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:05.181
enslaved. forced to
do hard labor. raped.

00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:07.618
kept as sexual slaves.

00:16:07.705 --> 00:16:11.057
And we know that one of
their most lucrative sources

00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:13.015
of income is trading ivory.

00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:17.063
They trade pieces of ivory
for things like. boots.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.806
and bullets. boxes of
bullets for a piece of ivory.

00:16:21.893 --> 00:16:25.985
carried by someone who's
forced to be a porter.

00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:28.378
for hundreds of
miles in some cases.

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:30.946
Some of the products
that come out

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:34.123
of this organized crime
networks are found

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.343
in your cell phones and
your laptop computers.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.040
But this is a personal issue

00:16:38.127 --> 00:16:41.478
because we are buying
products that contain minerals

00:16:41.565 --> 00:16:43.089
that come from this region.

00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:47.310
- Every one of us in
the developed world

00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:51.097
has some kind of mobile.
electronic device in our pocket.

00:16:51.184 --> 00:16:55.101
And our mobile phones and
laptops need tantalum.

00:16:55.188 --> 00:16:57.581
And one of the places on earth
where you can find tantalum

00:16:57.668 --> 00:17:00.976
is underground in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.109
And you have militias
fighting over bits of land

00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:06.068
that they could control the
mining in and use the money

00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:09.593
to buy guns. which has resulted
in millions of people dying.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.163
and the decline in apes.
elephants. and hardwoods.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.645
And in the illegal mines that
are controlled by rebels.

00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:19.473
they feed the
workers on bushmeat.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.041
If you're buying
tantalum from the DRC.

00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:26.132
you are helping to fund armed
militias who are raping women

00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:29.309
and using child labor to dig
the stuff out of the ground.

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:34.227
- Animals belong in the parks.

00:17:34.314 --> 00:17:36.794
We don't have any connection
between us and animals.

00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:39.667
Animals are for tourists;
they're not for us.

00:17:39.754 --> 00:17:41.147
Yes?

00:17:41.234 --> 00:17:42.626
It has been like that
for a very long time.

00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:44.280
But things are changing;
people have started

00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:47.066
to understand we need to
protect these animals.

00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:49.416
The biggest problem we have

00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:54.508
is our local people
don't understand.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.077
They have grown up with
these animals in the past.

00:17:58.164 --> 00:18:01.123
They have lived with them.
they used to kill buffaloes

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.431
and rhinos and leave
some to survive.

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:09.523
But with the exit of the
colonial. when they left.

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:13.962
so they decided let's have
these animals in the parks.

00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:16.051
The communities around
those animals felt

00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:18.271
it is not up to us. it's
not our responsibility

00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:20.360
to take care of these animals.
it's up to the government

00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:21.491
of the day to do it.

00:18:21.578 --> 00:18:23.232
So. even if they get killed.

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:25.016
even if you have poachers
coming in to kill animals.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.061
it's up to them.

00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:27.932
So there's this disconnect.

00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:30.109
People really don't
really understand.

00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:33.895
why there's such big fuss
about killing animals.

00:18:33.982 --> 00:18:36.898
It's not a big deal;
it's not a very big deal.

00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:40.858
Three decades ago we had 24.000
rhinos. now we have 1041.

00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:47.387
That tells you that a child
who is. my four year old son.

00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:50.694
will not have a chance of seeing
these rhino in the next 15.

00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:53.219
20 years if something
is not done.

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:55.960
But most of the killings
that are taking place.

00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:59.834
most of the rhinos that die.
die inside the protected area.

00:19:01.923 --> 00:19:06.928
KWS knows who is killing
rhinos in this country.

00:19:08.364 --> 00:19:10.279
They have admitted in the
past that rhinos are dying

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:13.195
and some of their own
personnel are involved.

00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:18.940
What you can't get your
head around is how poachers

00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:21.247
can manage to get
into national parks.

00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:25.251
Last year for instance. for
instance. January last year.

00:19:25.338 --> 00:19:29.516
we had a family of 12 elephants
killed on the same spot.

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:32.171
[somber music]

00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:36.566
Twelve elephants. among
them a very small calf.

00:19:38.046 --> 00:19:42.398
The poachers managed to walk
away with 22 ivory tusks.

00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:48.448
You can't do it. 10
of you cannot do it.

00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:55.759
22 ivory tusks.
10 armed poachers.

00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:57.370
with their guns on their backs.

00:19:58.719 --> 00:20:01.548
You have aerial surveillance;
you have ground boots.

00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:04.377
boots on the ground
from KWS rangers.

00:20:04.464 --> 00:20:06.988
and reinforcements
from other agencies.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:08.990
And these people get away?

00:20:09.077 --> 00:20:12.167
Something is very wrong.
something extremely wrong

00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:14.082
in this country. yes.

00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:22.046
[fire crackling]

00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:28.705
- It's about tax evasion.
it's about funds to terrorism

00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:31.882
and militias. it's
about money laundering.

00:20:31.969 --> 00:20:34.450
So. the human toll is big.

00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:38.541
So. the responsibility
of China is also that.

00:20:40.804 --> 00:20:45.679
We should start talking to
the Chinese also about that.

00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:50.771
Because behind an ivory
trinket bought in China.

00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:53.121
there is someone. not something.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:55.950
someone on the ground. dead.

00:20:56.907 --> 00:20:59.736
[dramatic music]

00:20:59.823 --> 00:21:01.564
You have basically two fronts.

00:21:01.651 --> 00:21:04.611
you have the African front
and the Chinese front. okay?

00:21:04.698 --> 00:21:07.701
The African front is
complicated. it's complex.

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:11.008
You have a lot of players.
all trafficking with ivory.

00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:13.228
with rhino horn. with
other wildlife products.

00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.883
The second front is China.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.278
Right now. the single
most important factor

00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:23.978
behind elephant poaching is the
legal ivory market in China.

00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:26.285
It's very simple to understand;
it's not rocket science.

00:21:26.372 --> 00:21:28.765
it's not happening on the
moon. it's happening in China.

00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:33.204
So. the legal ivory market
in China is the reason

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:36.120
why you have a
huge illegal trade

00:21:36.207 --> 00:21:39.036
and illegal underground
market in China.

00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:41.909
It's acting like a
giant vacuum cleaner.

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:45.521
sucking up tons and tons of
ivory from all over Africa.

00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:47.088
That's very easy to understand.

00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:50.178
And the solution also is
very easy to understand.

00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:52.746
They have to simply phase out

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.966
the legal ivory
market. that's it.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.362
- In China. Vietnam
some of these rich guys

00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:02.756
grind this stuff up and snort
it and make tea out of it.

00:22:02.843 --> 00:22:04.105
I don't know what
they do. but they seem

00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:05.454
to think it makes
their dick hard.

00:22:05.541 --> 00:22:06.673
You know what I mean?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.414
That's what they
make Viagra for.

00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:10.198
I mean. come on.

00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:11.939
You need to kill a fucking
rhino to get your dick hard?

00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:13.984
You got a bigger
problem than you think.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.343
- When we look at the commercial
exploitation of wildlife.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.781
we always look at
the whole chain.

00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:30.523
from poaching to
trafficking to demand.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:35.397
We focus on all three major
links on that trade chain.

00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:39.793
This legal market is providing
cover for illegal trade

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.709
and it also confuse
the consumers

00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:46.756
and makes them feel
it's okay to buy ivory.

00:22:46.843 --> 00:22:50.151
- [Narrator] In 2007 a
CITES one-off ivory sale

00:22:50.238 --> 00:22:52.414
created an insatiable
Asian demand

00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:55.156
which drove this global
poaching epidemic.

00:22:56.723 --> 00:22:59.334
- We found that
70% of the Chinese

00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:03.382
do not know ivory comes
from dead elephants.

00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:08.169
In Chinese. elephant tusk
is called elephant teeth.

00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:10.780
And so when it's.
teeth people thought

00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:13.522
that you know a person's
teeth can fall off

00:23:13.609 --> 00:23:15.568
and a person
doesn't have to die.

00:23:20.877 --> 00:23:23.489
- You know. I go to
China every year.

00:23:23.576 --> 00:23:25.969
I have been for
many. many years.

00:23:26.056 --> 00:23:29.625
And I didn't realize that
so many of the Chinese

00:23:29.712 --> 00:23:32.062
believe that elephants
shed their tusks

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:34.587
just like stags
shed their antlers.

00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:37.677
The Chinese people are beginning

00:23:37.764 --> 00:23:41.855
to wake up to the
seriousness of the situation.

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:45.902
It's important that
people understand
that the United States

00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:48.644
has been the second
largest importer

00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:51.255
of illegal ivory after China.

00:23:51.342 --> 00:23:53.562
- It's not enough that
we're pointing fingers

00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:55.172
at the Chinese.

00:23:55.259 --> 00:23:56.826
We should look at ourselves.
and what we've done

00:23:56.913 --> 00:24:00.874
to Africa and what we
owe the African continent

00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:03.180
for what we've taken from them.

00:24:03.267 --> 00:24:04.965
It's something that
we as Americans

00:24:05.052 --> 00:24:07.446
have to take
responsibility for. too.

00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:11.406
It's not just Chinese who
are suddenly buying all

00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:12.973
of the ivory.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.192
We have a long history
of doing it ourselves.

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:17.238
starting in the 1800s

00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:20.067
when we imported tusks
for what purpose?

00:24:20.154 --> 00:24:23.549
We had elephants killed in
order to make billiard balls.

00:24:23.636 --> 00:24:27.901
the ivory keys for
pianos. for knick-knacks.

00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:32.166
Millions of elephants
died for our purposes.

00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:35.778
- [Narrator] Every elephant
tusk represents the death

00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:38.912
or enslavement of five Africans.

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:41.262
It is simply incredible
that. because ivory

00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:44.874
is required. the rich heart of
Africa should be laid waste.

00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:47.355
That populations.
tribes and nations

00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:49.052
should be utterly destroyed.

00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:51.838
Whom after all does this
bloody seizure enrich?

00:24:53.187 --> 00:24:54.710
- When firearms came to Africa.

00:24:54.797 --> 00:24:57.104
that's when elephant
numbers started to plummet.

00:24:57.191 --> 00:24:58.584
It was thought that then there

00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:00.107
were probably 10 million
elephants in Africa.

00:25:00.194 --> 00:25:01.978
now there are fewer
than half a million.

00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:06.635
So. we've lost 95% of the
workforce of the forest.

00:25:06.722 --> 00:25:09.116
that recycles nutrients.
disperses seeds

00:25:09.203 --> 00:25:11.466
and creates the
forests of tomorrow.

00:25:13.337 --> 00:25:14.687
- We're running out of time.

00:25:15.862 --> 00:25:17.646
There was room for
experimentation.

00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:21.041
There is no more
margin for error.

00:25:21.128 --> 00:25:23.130
Things are so desperate
in so many places.

00:25:23.217 --> 00:25:26.960
that either we fix the
problem in the coming days.

00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:31.486
weeks and months. and not
even years. or it very likely.

00:25:31.573 --> 00:25:34.097
in many places in
Africa will be too late.

00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:38.928
[dramatic music]

00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.941
- I think a lot of non-profits

00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:55.249
overwhelm their audience
with doom and gloom.

00:25:55.336 --> 00:25:59.035
And so I think collectively
we need to find a better way

00:25:59.122 --> 00:26:01.472
to disseminate this information.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.823
And again get people
inspired and empowered.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.868
That's why I think
you still have

00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:07.609
to look for those gems of hope.

00:26:07.696 --> 00:26:09.916
And that's one of the reasons
why. right now I'm trying

00:26:10.003 --> 00:26:12.919
to focus more on the
survivors of these poaching.

00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:16.487
So. what a lot of people
don't recognize and realize

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:20.013
is that not all
poached animals die.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.058
So. we actually have
a lot of survivors

00:26:22.145 --> 00:26:24.147
on the continent of Africa.

00:26:24.234 --> 00:26:26.062
Orphaned rhinos.
orphaned elephants.

00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:28.064
there's a whole new
generation of animals

00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:30.371
being raised that have
gone through traumas.

00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:34.593
[peaceful music]

00:26:41.164 --> 00:26:43.384
- So. the one in
front is Mashariki.

00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:48.476
followed by Lakipi. Valdo.
Moisha. Emilio. Pundani & Aruba.

00:26:54.264 --> 00:26:56.397
Well. all these babies
have become orphans

00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:58.181
due to different reasons.

00:26:58.268 --> 00:27:01.402
Some of them. their mothers
have been killed by poachers.

00:27:01.489 --> 00:27:03.839
due to increase in
the trade on ivory.

00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:06.625
which is a real. real
problem at the moment.

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:11.064
'Cause normally.
they're not found alone.

00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:12.848
they should be with
their families.

00:27:17.418 --> 00:27:18.680
And some of them some of
them have become orphans

00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:19.942
from human wildlife conflict.

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:21.422
which means they've
been separated

00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:23.250
from their mothers
by human beings.

00:27:27.428 --> 00:27:31.737
- There is an unofficial
high mortality rate

00:27:31.824 --> 00:27:34.478
among orphans in Africa.
elephant orphans.

00:27:34.565 --> 00:27:37.046
They're using these
homemade recipes

00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:40.397
that no one has really properly
researched or documented.

00:27:40.484 --> 00:27:42.356
But I think there's
more to the equation.

00:27:42.443 --> 00:27:44.793
I think it may be
sort of a combination

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.885
of medical. emotional
needs. social needs.

00:27:50.973 --> 00:27:53.628
When you have a
survivor of a poaching.

00:27:53.715 --> 00:27:55.761
whether it's an orphan
who's witnessed his

00:27:55.848 --> 00:27:58.938
or her mother killed or
an attempted poaching.

00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:01.941
Sometimes an animal will
have a traumatic wound

00:28:02.028 --> 00:28:02.942
that they survive.

00:28:05.379 --> 00:28:09.949
What we see is that they
have these emotional.

00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:11.298
behavioral profiles similar

00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:13.474
to post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:16.869
And oftentimes if we don't
immediately intervene

00:28:16.956 --> 00:28:19.959
and sort of act as
their mother figure.

00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:22.091
they give up the will to live.

00:28:22.178 --> 00:28:26.487
So. you don't always lose
orphans due to a medical issue.

00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:29.229
oftentimes it can just
be an emotional issue.

00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:33.189
- There's been an
increase in terms

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:35.017
of the number of orphans

00:28:35.104 --> 00:28:37.628
that are coming to us. which
means poaching is increasing.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.500
but you know poaching
is not the only reason

00:28:39.587 --> 00:28:40.544
that is causing
them to be orphans.

00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:42.372
but it is the main reason.

00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:44.853
Others are orphans from
human-wildlife conflict.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.335
they have been separated from
the families by human beings.

00:28:48.422 --> 00:28:50.250
due to increase in
the population of man.

00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:52.513
compared to the space
or size of land.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.168
And that causes the
fights every now and then.

00:28:57.431 --> 00:28:58.954
[speaking in Swahili]

00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.695
- The poachers want
the big elephants

00:29:00.782 --> 00:29:02.349
with the tusks.

00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:04.438
Usually those are the
eldest animals. the females.

00:29:06.048 --> 00:29:08.529
the matriarchs. the
grandmothers. who
know where to go

00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:11.010
and what to do
and how to behave.

00:29:11.097 --> 00:29:13.099
So. with them gone.
when they're taken out

00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:15.449
of the population.
what do you have left?

00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:16.885
You have teenagers.

00:29:16.972 --> 00:29:19.670
You have. just imagine
if in your town.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.891
if all the adults suddenly
vanished and all you had left

00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:25.894
were the teenagers of the high
school or the junior high.

00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:28.201
How well do you think
society would operate?

00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:38.864
- You know. saving the
world is not a part time job

00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:40.343
and it is not without risk.

00:29:42.084 --> 00:29:43.346
We've been seeing things
going in the wrong direction

00:29:43.433 --> 00:29:45.000
in most places for many years.

00:29:45.087 --> 00:29:47.394
And it's just not an issue
that you can quantify

00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:49.135
with wildlife surveys.

00:29:49.222 --> 00:29:53.487
What we've been seeing is the
collapse of the way of life

00:29:53.574 --> 00:29:56.316
that has served
Africa for millennia.

00:29:56.403 --> 00:29:59.319
the relationship between people
and the natural resources.

00:30:01.538 --> 00:30:02.888
- You've got to save every one

00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:04.367
of these animals
in the rainforest.

00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:06.630
You got to save the
habitat. What we've seen

00:30:06.717 --> 00:30:08.545
in a lot of these places that
saving the habitat itself

00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:12.680
is not enough because poaching
is so strong in some places

00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:15.248
that it just cleans
out whatever species

00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:17.250
are out there in the forest.

00:30:17.337 --> 00:30:19.905
[elephants trumpet]

00:30:19.992 --> 00:30:21.776
And the elephants. of course.

00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:25.519
are a critical element
in these rainforests.

00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:28.304
Elephants are the
bellwether of Africa.

00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:31.133
As elephants go. so
will everything else go.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.048
They're so big.
they're so dominant.

00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.098
they're now so valuable. that
the best way to get a read

00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:41.622
on the natural state of an area.
that should have elephants.

00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:43.232
is to go in and see if
they're there are not.

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:44.843
usually it's not now.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.977
If they like to breathe.

00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:50.370
it's probably a good thing
to save the forest. isn't it?

00:30:50.457 --> 00:30:51.937
But maybe they don't
think about that.

00:30:52.024 --> 00:30:54.461
They want a stable
climate you have to look

00:30:54.548 --> 00:30:56.593
at the integrity
and the function.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.552
it's called ecosystem services.

00:31:00.249 --> 00:31:02.208
- [Jane] The elephants
open up the forests

00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:04.471
so that new life can grow.

00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:06.908
they transport
seeds in their dung.

00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:09.737
Chimpanzees do exactly
the same; they take seeds

00:31:09.824 --> 00:31:11.870
and spread them
around in the forest.

00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:15.743
[peaceful music]

[leaves rustling]

00:31:28.103 --> 00:31:32.194
- Elephants disperse
more seeds individually.

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:35.545
of more species of
trees and other plants.

00:31:35.632 --> 00:31:39.288
further than any other animal.

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:40.855
And they do that
wherever they live.

00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:44.293
So. 50 countries. 37 in Africa.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.863
13 in Asia. have natural
elephant populations.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.821
[mysterious music]

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:54.738
- [Mike] Elephants in particular
are unique in the sense

00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:58.525
that their digestive
process is so intense

00:31:58.612 --> 00:32:00.875
there are seeds
from certain trees

00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:03.356
that will not germinate
unless they've passed

00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:04.748
through an elephant's gut.

00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:10.798
So. the reason that people
kill trees in Africa

00:32:10.885 --> 00:32:12.887
is because they want
the carbon that's stored

00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:14.715
in the tree as a fuel.

00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:17.022
They want to use
it for charcoal.

00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:18.501
[smoke hissing]

00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:21.461
The forest is an
extremely valuable asset

00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:24.029
that the government has to
try and keep its hands off.

00:32:24.116 --> 00:32:26.553
If they don't and that
forest disappears.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.295
we will never keep
climate to two degrees.

00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.081
If you value the forest.

00:32:33.168 --> 00:32:35.040
protect the gardeners
of the forest.

00:32:35.127 --> 00:32:36.998
They are not ornaments.
they are not things

00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:39.131
to go and see on holiday.

00:32:39.218 --> 00:32:43.048
Every gorilla. every
elephant. every howler monkey

00:32:43.135 --> 00:32:46.051
in Latin America. or
tapir. are working for us.

00:32:46.138 --> 00:32:48.662
dispersing seeds for
the trees of tomorrow.

00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:50.664
And if we want
those carbon stores

00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:54.929
and those rainwater-generating
forests to continue

00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:56.757
into the next century.
we have to make sure

00:32:56.844 --> 00:32:59.847
that the seeds are being
sown today to do that job.

00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:03.546
People think there's a forest

00:33:03.633 --> 00:33:05.418
and then you put
some animals in. no.

00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:08.160
The animals and the
trees and the bacteria

00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:10.640
are all part of that
forest ecosystem.

00:33:10.727 --> 00:33:12.077
And one of the
things that gorillas

00:33:12.164 --> 00:33:15.123
do spectacularly well
is produce manure.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.648
A gorilla will eat and
produce something like.

00:33:18.735 --> 00:33:22.000
between 10 and 20 kilos
of dung every day.

00:33:22.087 --> 00:33:23.349
That's about one
hundred kilos a week.

00:33:23.436 --> 00:33:26.395
In 10 weeks that's
a ton of manure

00:33:26.482 --> 00:33:27.788
being spread around the forest.

00:33:27.875 --> 00:33:30.095
And in that manure are seeds.

00:33:30.182 --> 00:33:32.140
Elephants are even
more important

00:33:32.227 --> 00:33:33.620
as gardeners of the forest.

00:33:33.707 --> 00:33:35.491
If gorillas are the
gardeners of the forest.

00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:37.841
elephants are the
mega-gardeners.
because they're so big.

00:33:39.843 --> 00:33:41.845
But we're so taken
aback by how powerful

00:33:41.932 --> 00:33:44.631
they are. we think
they're indestructible.

00:33:44.718 --> 00:33:47.460
[leaves rustling]

00:33:47.547 --> 00:33:50.115
As human development has
grown and elephant habitat

00:33:50.202 --> 00:33:53.509
has shrunk. the elephants
are constantly coming up

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:56.295
against people who
are unfriendly. who
are chasing them out

00:33:56.382 --> 00:33:57.905
of their crops. who are trying

00:33:57.992 --> 00:34:01.126
to defend their livelihood
from the elephants.

00:34:01.213 --> 00:34:03.041
And the elephants
are seen as an enemy.

00:34:03.128 --> 00:34:04.825
And that the latest
manifestation of this.

00:34:04.912 --> 00:34:08.089
that I've experienced
is charcoal.

00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:09.743
Because for most
families in Africa

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.614
they don't have electricity.
they don't have gas.

00:34:11.701 --> 00:34:15.009
If they got to cook. they
need either wood or charcoal.

00:34:15.096 --> 00:34:16.924
In many cities.
the charcoal trade

00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:19.970
is a multi-million dollar
business. which means anyone

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:23.452
who can pay people a pittance
to go and cut down trees.

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:26.890
or even just branches of
trees. build a charcoal kiln

00:34:26.977 --> 00:34:28.544
and bring out a few
bags of charcoal.

00:34:28.631 --> 00:34:30.155
they'll be paid a few
dollars. And that charcoal

00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:32.070
is worth a lot of
money in the city.

00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:36.770
The first day we went out
in the forest reserve.

00:34:36.857 --> 00:34:39.338
we saw three
charcoal operations.

00:34:39.425 --> 00:34:41.209
The elephants were right
next to the charcoal

00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:43.646
and were obviously agitated.

00:34:43.733 --> 00:34:45.822
The matriarch clearly felt

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.650
that we were posing
a threat to them.

00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:49.261
She started running towards us.

00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:50.697
I didn't want to
be hit from behind.

00:34:50.784 --> 00:34:52.525
so I turned around
and I was rumbling.

00:34:52.612 --> 00:34:53.961
sort of a [imitates rumbling].

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.487
as we do when we
approach the elephants.

00:34:58.574 --> 00:35:01.186
She was really moving. [laughs]

00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:05.407
I was still running backwards.
still trying to placate her

00:35:05.494 --> 00:35:09.194
when she hit me and I put
my hands up to her face.

00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:14.286
And when I turned to face
her and then the camera

00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:17.027
hit the elephant's
face against my hand.

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.638
But that turned the camera off.

00:35:19.813 --> 00:35:21.510
And it left me on
my hands and knees

00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:24.078
when I completed the backward
roll. under the elephant.

00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:26.080
And she started playing
football with me.

00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:28.735
After five seconds.
one of the kicks

00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:31.303
happened to knock the
camera and turn it on again.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.309
[camera clicking]

00:35:39.702 --> 00:35:40.747
[elephant trumpets]

00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:41.878
A second later. you hear

00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:44.620
[gun firing]

00:35:44.707 --> 00:35:48.233
which is the rangers who
had fired a shot. in the air

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.625
and the elephant fled.

00:35:49.712 --> 00:35:52.541
She came to chase
the humans away.

00:35:52.628 --> 00:35:54.587
who were hassling her family.

00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:57.459
Now in human society. we
give people like that medals.

00:35:59.331 --> 00:36:02.334
[elephant rumbling]

00:36:17.044 --> 00:36:20.003
- The growth in the human
population and its footprint.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.268
is a major threat. probably
the single biggest threat.

00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:26.184
to wildlife persisting
into the long term.

00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:29.274
Simply because it doesn't
have to take all the land away

00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.059
from wildlife. it fragments it.

00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:35.105
We take the best bits. we leave
the worst bits for wildlife.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:38.239
Now. a population that used
to live in a particular area

00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:39.980
is two populations separated

00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:41.851
by human settlements
in the middle.

00:36:41.938 --> 00:36:45.681
So. they can't literally get
in contact with each other.

00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:48.815
So one of the biggest
challenges out there is the fact

00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:51.296
that the human population.
currently about seven

00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:53.907
and a bit billion people on
this planet. is going to rise

00:36:53.994 --> 00:36:57.302
to eleven billion people
by the end of this century.

00:36:57.389 --> 00:37:00.218
And the question then is.
is there room for wildlife?

00:37:02.394 --> 00:37:06.441
- There is an actual movement
in conservation to focus

00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:10.315
on population reduction in
humans as an indirect way

00:37:10.402 --> 00:37:13.100
to improve wildlife
conservation.

00:37:13.187 --> 00:37:15.668
So. one approach has
been for conservationists

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:20.760
to teach population control and
offer reproductive education

00:37:21.848 --> 00:37:23.676
to the women who
live in the villages.

00:37:23.763 --> 00:37:27.288
So. they've seen the
childbirth. you know.

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:30.030
the growth has flat-lined
in those villages.

00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:39.692
- [Narrator] The
desert elephants of
Namibia's Kunene Region

00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:42.738
are one of only two
populations of desert elephants

00:37:42.825 --> 00:37:46.307
in the world. the other
is in Mali. North Africa.

00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:49.963
approximately 150
individuals remain here.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.357
- Why am I pessimistic?

00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:54.924
Just because of the
numbers of humans on earth.

00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:00.539
And elephants are disappearing

00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:05.239
and I can't just wave
a magic wand or jump

00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:07.633
to action and save them.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.026
That's part of being
wildlife biologists

00:38:10.113 --> 00:38:15.118
is you see a lot of death and
you get to see the rare birth

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.993
that balances out all
the. all the death.

00:38:21.342 --> 00:38:23.518
It was a life changing
experience for me.

00:38:23.605 --> 00:38:25.738
I knew I wanted to
work with elephants.

00:38:25.825 --> 00:38:28.306
We thought originally
we'd go back to Zimbabwe

00:38:28.393 --> 00:38:30.569
and work there.
but then Zimbabwe

00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:33.963
went extremely
downhill. very fast.

00:38:34.877 --> 00:38:36.531
- Yeah.

00:38:36.618 --> 00:38:37.967
- In Zimbabwe. you know when
our friends would go out

00:38:38.054 --> 00:38:41.275
on an anti-poaching
patrol. suddenly this

00:38:41.362 --> 00:38:44.060
was a military operation
in the national park.

00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:45.758
where they would
hand out the weapons

00:38:45.845 --> 00:38:48.108
and their lives were
out there on the line.

00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:51.894
And so it takes that level
of commitment. of individuals

00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:56.986
and a commitment of society.
in order to turn it around.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.817
They're a lot of people that
do value the elephants there.

00:39:01.904 --> 00:39:04.777
And then there are a number of
people. like in any society.

00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:07.562
they won't appreciate
what they have or had.

00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:08.737
until it's gone.

00:39:10.173 --> 00:39:11.784
- The bigger problem
we're dealing with

00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:16.223
with desert elephants is
not so much ivory poaching.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.315
it's attitudes of the people
who live with elephants.

00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:25.188
who pay the price.
through destroyed crops

00:39:25.275 --> 00:39:29.149
or. you know. untimely
death of relatives

00:39:29.236 --> 00:39:32.413
or friends from elephants
or lions. whatever it is.

00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:36.461
[somber music]

00:39:36.548 --> 00:39:39.551
So. we need people
to go to Namibia.

00:39:39.638 --> 00:39:42.423
spend their tourist dollars.
pay the local people

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.948
to tell them about
their lifestyle.

00:39:46.035 --> 00:39:48.734
make the elephants
worthwhile to those people.

00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:51.345
by sharing the wealth
that we have here.

00:39:51.432 --> 00:39:54.696
with those people there and
then elephants will be valued.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:01.181
In 2012. we went to Africa
and we got to a village

00:40:01.268 --> 00:40:03.444
that we know very well.

00:40:03.531 --> 00:40:07.492
Just two days after.
one of our elephants.

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:10.059
one of our known
elephants. had been killed

00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:13.367
by the authorities for
being a problem animal.

00:40:13.454 --> 00:40:15.413
And we didn't know
which elephant it was.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.459
but we arrived there
and all that was left

00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:20.983
of his carcass was an ear.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.596
I looked at my ID book of all
the elephants and who's who.

00:40:24.683 --> 00:40:27.294
based on their ear
patterns and I said

00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:31.907
"Oh. this is M7. Mr. Sneaky".

00:40:33.474 --> 00:40:38.044
The local guy who was
showing us the carcass said.

00:40:38.131 --> 00:40:41.264
"Well. the meat was given
to the local people to eat."

00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:42.614
and he said.

00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:44.267
"Don't you like elephant meat?"

00:40:45.486 --> 00:40:47.706
And I said. "I would
never eat an elephant.

00:40:47.793 --> 00:40:50.099
"it would be like
eating a family member."

00:40:51.274 --> 00:40:53.189
And he thought that was
the strangest thing.

00:40:56.366 --> 00:40:58.368
We were feeling
extremely discouraged

00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:01.807
and decided we're done.

00:41:01.894 --> 00:41:04.549
Let's just go and say
goodbye to the elephants

00:41:04.636 --> 00:41:05.506
and we're done.

00:41:08.988 --> 00:41:12.426
The next day we came upon our
favorite group of elephants.

00:41:12.513 --> 00:41:17.475
the tuskless matriarch.
and the teenage daughter.

00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:22.915
whose name is Dorothy.
was showing some breasts.

00:41:24.133 --> 00:41:26.701
Dorothy starts to
act very strangely

00:41:26.788 --> 00:41:31.010
and all of a sudden out
comes this birth sac

00:41:31.097 --> 00:41:35.014
and poosh on the ground.
a baby elephant is born.

00:41:35.101 --> 00:41:37.756
[elephant rumbles]

00:41:37.843 --> 00:41:41.237
[gentle. peaceful music]

00:42:17.273 --> 00:42:20.102
[elephant rumbles]

00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:45.171
We both said. "This is it".

00:42:45.258 --> 00:42:47.956
"How can we give
up at this point?"

00:42:48.043 --> 00:42:50.089
- We're all in again. all in.

00:42:50.176 --> 00:42:52.744
[laughing]

00:42:52.831 --> 00:42:54.484
We're going for
it. laying it out

00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:58.358
on the line in order to
turn the tide on extinction.

00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:02.275
[upbeat music]

00:43:05.278 --> 00:43:06.584
- [Narrator] Humans and wildlife

00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:08.760
compete for natural resources.

00:43:10.196 --> 00:43:13.199
Male elephants more often
raid crops than do females

00:43:13.286 --> 00:43:16.681
in order to gain size and
reproductive advantage.

00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:20.815
These crop raiders are then
considered problem elephants.

00:43:23.992 --> 00:43:27.039
- In case of human wildlife
conflict. we always follow up.

00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:28.954
If an elephant comes into
a farm and you kill it.

00:43:29.041 --> 00:43:30.738
you can't be charged.

00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:34.350
It's the only income that
farmer might have for that year.

00:43:34.437 --> 00:43:35.961
He's relying on it
to feed his family.

00:43:36.048 --> 00:43:39.399
He's relying on it to
educate his kids. whatever.

00:43:39.486 --> 00:43:41.227
So. in two minutes an
elephant will go in there

00:43:41.314 --> 00:43:43.490
and destroy a whole
year's worth of crops.

00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:47.581
So. you can understand
why you get out of bed

00:43:47.668 --> 00:43:49.757
in the middle of the night and
throw a spear at an elephant.

00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:53.108
So. these are spears that
we've confiscated off poachers.

00:43:54.936 --> 00:43:59.593
Again. they poison the
blade so when it goes in.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.509
it's not only the spear
that does the damage.

00:44:02.596 --> 00:44:04.772
it's the poison that
finishes it off.

00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:07.601
The worst is when you dig
one out of a dead elephant.

00:44:07.688 --> 00:44:09.472
Sometimes it kills
it quite quickly.

00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:12.171
I say quickly. 10. 15 minutes.

00:44:12.258 --> 00:44:16.392
Sometimes it takes
days. sometimes months.

00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:17.655
Poisoning spears is a new thing.

00:44:17.742 --> 00:44:19.265
It never used to happen before.

00:44:19.352 --> 00:44:21.093
It's a new technique.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.617
But also they're
using pesticides now.

00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:25.445
They've ramped it up.

00:44:25.532 --> 00:44:27.273
There's pesticides
available on the market

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.015
and you can just go buy that
from the veterinary shop.

00:44:30.102 --> 00:44:32.147
soak your arrow or
your spear in it.

00:44:32.234 --> 00:44:34.672
and it's more lethal than
the traditional poison.

00:44:37.283 --> 00:44:40.634
[elephant screeching]

00:44:40.721 --> 00:44:43.028
- Human-elephant conflict
is a huge problem

00:44:43.115 --> 00:44:46.945
in Laikipia County
and the levels of
human-elephant conflict

00:44:47.032 --> 00:44:49.469
are probably amongst the worst
in the whole of East Africa.

00:44:49.556 --> 00:44:51.819
We got a call from one of
our scouts in the field.

00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:54.648
who gave us some
information about elephants

00:44:54.735 --> 00:44:57.477
being stuck in a dam.

00:44:57.564 --> 00:44:59.479
You had seven bull
elephants who had crop

00:44:59.566 --> 00:45:00.828
raided the night before.

00:45:03.613 --> 00:45:05.790
And once we closer. it
became clear these elephants

00:45:05.877 --> 00:45:08.140
weren't stuck at all.
but that the community

00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:09.924
was actually holding
them hostage.

00:45:11.143 --> 00:45:12.666
I mean you had 400
people screaming

00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:14.320
and yelling in all
directions and the elephants

00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:16.670
didn't know which way to go.

00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:19.064
[screaming]

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.024
[helicopter whirring]

00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:25.766
And the arrival of this
helicopter sent the population

00:45:25.853 --> 00:45:29.204
into a frenzy because they
wanted to harvest the meat.

00:45:29.291 --> 00:45:31.206
so at least they
would have something.

00:45:32.642 --> 00:45:33.905
People would prevent them
from leaving. you know.

00:45:33.992 --> 00:45:35.428
by shouting or by
throwing stones

00:45:35.515 --> 00:45:37.822
and by driving
fire towards them.

00:45:37.909 --> 00:45:41.086
This elephant made a
desperate attempt to escape.

00:45:43.436 --> 00:45:45.264
And it charged
into the shallows.

00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:49.094
Now you had an elephant
on the run amongst people.

00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:53.272
This act of bravery. I suppose.

00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:55.056
encouraged the other elephants

00:45:55.143 --> 00:45:58.364
so they managed to get out
as well. once the helicopter

00:45:58.451 --> 00:46:00.627
pushed the people and
cleared the way for them.

00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:04.631
It's really tough for
conservationists because people

00:46:04.718 --> 00:46:06.285
look at us and say.

00:46:06.372 --> 00:46:07.590
"Ah. you know we only
care about the elephants.

00:46:07.677 --> 00:46:08.461
"We don't care
about the people."

00:46:08.548 --> 00:46:09.984
This is not true.

00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:12.770
but these are the
perceptions that go around.

00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:15.555
[splashing]

00:46:15.642 --> 00:46:16.948
- You can't ignore
that human need

00:46:17.035 --> 00:46:18.776
in solving the
conservation problems.

00:46:19.994 --> 00:46:22.388
This generation is the
generation that's now

00:46:22.475 --> 00:46:24.607
in conflict for the first time

00:46:24.694 --> 00:46:27.088
in many. many. many generations.

00:46:29.743 --> 00:46:31.049
[splashing]

00:46:31.136 --> 00:46:32.572
It's not a cultural
norm for them to be

00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:34.443
in conflict with wildlife.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.664
They didn't conquer the
wilderness the way the pioneers

00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:39.361
did in North America perhaps.

00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:40.928
where there were dangerous
animals that were killed

00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:43.452
to make the land
safe for families.

00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:46.238
If you can work with
them to see the wildlife

00:46:46.325 --> 00:46:49.328
and the wilderness as an
asset. there is still time.

00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:51.678
This challenge that
wildlife faces now

00:46:51.765 --> 00:46:53.114
is not about changing wildlife.

00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:55.247
The group that has to
change is the humans.

00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:58.250
[crowd chattering]

00:47:01.383 --> 00:47:02.776
- [Narrator]
Human-elephant conflict

00:47:02.863 --> 00:47:05.039
threatens elephant survival.

00:47:05.126 --> 00:47:08.042
Translocating. or moving.
'problem' elephants

00:47:08.129 --> 00:47:10.392
is one conservation strategy.

00:47:10.479 --> 00:47:14.527
But translocation intensifies
human-elephant conflict

00:47:14.614 --> 00:47:16.181
and increases elephant deaths.

00:47:17.922 --> 00:47:21.142
[elephant crying]:

00:47:21.229 --> 00:47:24.754
- Another example of how
we know elephants behave

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.408
when they don't have
their elders around

00:47:26.495 --> 00:47:29.194
is from young elephants
that have been translocated.

00:47:29.281 --> 00:47:31.936
So. they move in
elephants that perhaps

00:47:32.023 --> 00:47:34.677
have seen their
family members culled.

00:47:34.764 --> 00:47:39.073
all of the family members
killed in another park

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.422
in South Africa. where they felt

00:47:40.509 --> 00:47:42.163
there were too many elephants.

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.252
So. they kill all the adults.
they take the youngsters

00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.776
and move them out
to another park.

00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:50.868
[elephants screaming]

00:48:00.703 --> 00:48:02.357
- My name is Barbara Wiseman.

00:48:02.444 --> 00:48:03.837
and I'm the
international president

00:48:03.924 --> 00:48:06.361
of the Lawrence Anthony
Earth organization.

00:48:06.448 --> 00:48:08.668
Lawrence had told me there
was a troublesome herd.

00:48:08.755 --> 00:48:11.976
they hated people. because
people had killed most

00:48:12.063 --> 00:48:13.803
of the herd off.

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:15.762
- If I didn't take them they
were all going to get put down.

00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:18.156
So. I said. "Sure.
absolutely. we'll take them".

00:48:18.243 --> 00:48:19.505
- [Barbara] The
matriarch knew how

00:48:19.592 --> 00:48:21.507
to push over an electric fence

00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:24.075
and short it out and
escape with her herd.

00:48:25.598 --> 00:48:29.123
They had game rangers. the
game rangers all had guns.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.256
some of them were
intending to kill them.

00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:34.999
Finally. the helicopter
pilot got them back.

00:48:35.086 --> 00:48:36.435
[helicopter whirring]

00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:37.915
- [Lawrence] The
authorities just said.

00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:39.394
"Don't have anything to do

00:48:39.481 --> 00:48:41.048
"with the elephant when
they're in the boma.

00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:42.528
"just leave them."

00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:44.704
And last time we did
that. they broke out.

00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:47.011
So. I figured you know
somehow they have to learn

00:48:47.098 --> 00:48:49.839
to trust at least
one human being.

00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:53.539
[dramatic music]

00:48:53.626 --> 00:48:57.195
- [Barbara] So. he decided to
stay with them 24 hours a day.

00:48:57.282 --> 00:48:59.806
for as long as it took.
to get them used to him.

00:49:02.156 --> 00:49:07.161
And every morning the matriarch
would stand at the fence

00:49:08.641 --> 00:49:09.947
looking like she was going
to make a break for it.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.472
If an elephant breaks
through an electric fence

00:49:13.559 --> 00:49:16.736
with their body once.
they realize that they can

00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:20.044
withstand the
charge long enough.

00:49:20.131 --> 00:49:22.133
that you can never
hold them again.

00:49:24.657 --> 00:49:27.703
And Lawrence would stand
just outside of her reach

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:28.704
and talk to her.

00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:34.754
- [Lawrence] Hello. my baby
beautiful. hello. my bubba.

00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:37.322
Hello. my beautiful girl.

00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:42.414
Yes. come on. come
on. come. bubba.

00:49:44.677 --> 00:49:45.939
- [Barbara] Lawrence
was staying with them.

00:49:46.026 --> 00:49:47.723
they were incredibly hostile.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.464
If they could have got him.

00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:50.813
they would have pulled him in

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.990
and stomped him into the ground.

00:49:53.077 --> 00:49:57.168
So. after three weeks of this.
one day Lawrence described it

00:49:57.255 --> 00:50:00.127
as though all of the
hostility turned off.

00:50:00.214 --> 00:50:03.609
like you would turn off a
light switch. just boom.

00:50:03.696 --> 00:50:07.004
- [Lawrence] Everything had
gone calm and the matriarch

00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:08.396
walked up to me.

00:50:08.483 --> 00:50:10.094
And she approached
me and I backed off.

00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:11.704
and she stood there.
very benignly.

00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:15.229
ears down. great
emotion around her.

00:50:15.316 --> 00:50:16.926
Eventually I stepped
forward to the fence.

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.624
and she put her trunk
through and touched me.

00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:20.843
And I thought. "Well. that's
it. I'll let them out."

00:50:22.062 --> 00:50:25.109
[peaceful music]

00:50:25.196 --> 00:50:28.938
[elephant rumbling]

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.202
[shouting]

00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.421
- [Barbara] They could be a
mile away. but if they heard it

00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:37.121
was Lawrence they would come
like puppy dogs to see him.

00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:41.995
- [Lawrence] Whenever I come
back. the day I come back.

00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:44.780
when I drive in. they'll
come up to the house.

00:50:50.525 --> 00:50:53.398
The herd emanates something.
it emanates something

00:50:53.485 --> 00:50:54.790
at a different level.

00:50:54.877 --> 00:50:57.054
Being in proximity
to a herd. apart

00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:59.273
from watching the
physical manifestations

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.408
and their body languages. you
actually get an emanation.

00:51:12.721 --> 00:51:14.419
- The elephants had been
living with Lawrence

00:51:14.506 --> 00:51:16.638
for about 12 years
when he passed away.

00:51:16.725 --> 00:51:18.684
The elephants were
about 12 miles

00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:21.991
from the house. and
they perceived it.

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:27.084
And they walked to the
house. in mourning. very sort

00:51:28.215 --> 00:51:30.261
of sad aspect; and when
they got to the house.

00:51:30.348 --> 00:51:32.393
just very agitated they
were usually very calm.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.353
very peaceful. but they
were very agitated.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.921
And they stayed around the
house for about three hours

00:51:39.008 --> 00:51:40.706
and then they disappeared.

00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:43.970
Interestingly. every year
since then. on the anniversary

00:51:44.057 --> 00:51:46.712
of his death. they've
returned to the house.

00:51:46.799 --> 00:51:49.976
[elephant trumpets. lion roars]

00:51:53.284 --> 00:51:57.505
- You know. lions are not
getting the attention.

00:51:57.592 --> 00:51:59.333
It's up to us people
in the field to try

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.552
and stop the poisoning.

00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:02.554
It's all about the cattle.

00:52:02.641 --> 00:52:07.036
People don't boma. corral
their stock. properly anymore.

00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:08.777
So lions get in.

00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:11.650
There's a lot more cattle.
there's a lot more people.

00:52:13.304 --> 00:52:16.089
- So now we have a
surge in cattle numbers

00:52:16.176 --> 00:52:18.874
and when they start to
invade the wildlife space.

00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:20.485
that's when you get conflict.

00:52:20.572 --> 00:52:22.574
And then of course. people.
if they lose a goat.

00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.576
or a cow. they retaliate.

00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:27.013
And they go after the hyena
or the leopard or the lion.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.103
And there are only
20.000 lions in Africa.

00:52:33.498 --> 00:52:37.284
- Well. I was a surfer at the
coast and my dream of going

00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:39.634
into the bush and playing Tarzan

00:52:39.721 --> 00:52:43.899
and becoming a great game
man. wildlife man in Africa.

00:52:43.986 --> 00:52:47.381
was sort of lost in the
waves and the lifestyle.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.210
When I met Joy. I
had written to her

00:52:50.297 --> 00:52:51.951
and said "Have you got any
openings. and she said.

00:52:52.038 --> 00:52:55.302
"Well. I have nothing
going. but I know my husband

00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:58.610
"is looking for someone.
because his previous assistant

00:52:58.697 --> 00:53:01.874
has just been killed
by one his lions."

00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:03.310
And I thought.
"Great. that sounds

00:53:03.397 --> 00:53:05.269
"like the sort of
thing I want to do."

00:53:06.792 --> 00:53:10.970
When I joined George. his
pride was down from 11 to 3.

00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:14.408
And amongst them were
two females: Lisa.

00:53:14.495 --> 00:53:17.803
who was very affectionate.
Juma. whom you couldn't handle.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.980
because she'd been very
badly treated on capture

00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:24.288
and Christian. the lion
that came from England.

00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:27.073
[dramatic music]

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:50.488
Christian was coming
up to two years old.

00:53:50.575 --> 00:53:52.707
he really didn't know
what he was doing.

00:53:52.794 --> 00:53:54.187
I didn't have a clue.

00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:58.713
Christian and I grew up
together. and got into all sorts

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.759
of scrapes. had
all sorts of fun.

00:54:00.846 --> 00:54:03.065
and we taught each other
everything we knew.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.547
They're very loving and they're.

00:54:06.634 --> 00:54:08.462
you can form a very close
relationship with them.

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:09.855
but you got to watch it.

00:54:09.942 --> 00:54:11.596
It's an occupational hazard.

00:54:11.683 --> 00:54:15.861
You know. racing drivers have
car crashes and you know.

00:54:15.948 --> 00:54:19.212
painters fall off ladders.
and it's no worse than that.

00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:21.475
It makes for a better story.

00:54:21.562 --> 00:54:22.520
- [Director] Is this
one of the lions

00:54:22.607 --> 00:54:23.869
that you guys were raising?

00:54:23.956 --> 00:54:25.305
- No. it was part
of a wild pride

00:54:25.392 --> 00:54:27.046
that we brought up
when their mother died.

00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:29.222
Not a lion we'd ever handled.

00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:30.354
But then eventually he got me.

00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:32.051
All I could do was go fetal.

00:54:32.138 --> 00:54:34.445
I could hardly...I kept
sort of coming and going.

00:54:36.882 --> 00:54:39.885
And then he got me through
the neck and strangled.

00:54:39.972 --> 00:54:42.540
George did the most
wonderful things

00:54:42.627 --> 00:54:45.804
because what he did with the
respect and the understanding

00:54:45.891 --> 00:54:47.284
that he had for
these wild animals

00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:48.894
and the way he carried it out

00:54:48.981 --> 00:54:51.244
and just the whole
toughness of it.

00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:54.247
I mean. there he
was day and night.

00:54:54.334 --> 00:54:57.119
you know. 365 days a
year out in the bush

00:54:57.206 --> 00:54:58.512
with a pride of lions.

00:55:03.169 --> 00:55:04.953
And they're lovely.

00:55:18.663 --> 00:55:21.013
[flamingos honking]

00:55:28.368 --> 00:55:30.631
So. I feel very
sad. I never thought

00:55:30.718 --> 00:55:33.460
that in the short period
of time. nearly 50 years.

00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:38.073
that I've been in Africa. I
would see wild animals go down.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.120
you know. to such low
levels and be regarded

00:55:41.207 --> 00:55:43.340
in such a low light.

00:55:48.301 --> 00:55:51.043
[tires on pavement]

00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:56.265
It's just horrific how
things can change so fast.

00:55:57.441 --> 00:55:58.920
You know. it's just
people against wildlife

00:55:59.007 --> 00:56:01.706
and looking after
wildlife isn't difficult.

00:56:01.793 --> 00:56:05.144
It's not rocket science. but
you just got to make sure

00:56:05.231 --> 00:56:08.103
that if there's crime.
there's punishment.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:11.716
And none of the big boys ever
go down that are behind this.

00:56:11.803 --> 00:56:14.371
and you don't see
any middlemen caught.

00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:17.025
Certain tribes punch
way above their weight

00:56:17.112 --> 00:56:18.766
and just ignore the laws.

00:56:18.853 --> 00:56:21.508
The attractively dressed
people that the Western world

00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:25.251
loves so much are the worst
offenders in all of this.

00:56:27.601 --> 00:56:29.342
Lions used to be poisoned

00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:32.824
with a very readily available
cattle dip called Kopertox.

00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:35.783
Now they're use an insecticide.
which is even more virulent.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:38.830
called Furadan. which
comes from America.

00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:40.658
It's meant to be banned.
of course it isn't.

00:56:40.745 --> 00:56:41.963
you can buy it anywhere.

00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:46.490
And that's what comes with
the increase in stock numbers.

00:56:47.926 --> 00:56:50.885
- It starts with some lions
going into an enclosure.

00:56:50.972 --> 00:56:53.932
the residue carcass getting
spliced with this poison.

00:56:54.019 --> 00:56:57.501
The lions coming back. they
get killed. hyenas come in.

00:56:57.588 --> 00:56:59.851
they get killed. the
vultures come in.

00:56:59.938 --> 00:57:01.635
they get killed. it's horrific.

00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:07.162
Lions and leopards in
particular are very capable

00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:10.209
of jumping over and climbing
into these enclosures.

00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:14.996
Leopard in particular. they
go on kind of killing phase.

00:57:15.083 --> 00:57:17.129
It's like kill
everything that moves.

00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:20.567
The owner of that livestock
is not best pleased.

00:57:20.654 --> 00:57:22.090
to put it mildly.

00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:25.137
Many of them will kill
the offending leopard

00:57:25.224 --> 00:57:27.095
or kill the offending lion.

00:57:27.182 --> 00:57:29.533
Almost all these predators
don't like people.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.056
Elephants don't like people.

00:57:31.143 --> 00:57:33.275
Fully understandable.
we're the big baddies.

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:38.237
Okay. Light for Life.
it's the deployment

00:57:38.324 --> 00:57:42.154
of a LED lighting system.
a flashing lighting system

00:57:42.241 --> 00:57:45.244
around the periphery of
livestock enclosures.

00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:50.031
[calf mooing]

00:57:50.118 --> 00:57:51.903
These flashing lights actually
represent human movement.

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.166
activity within the enclosures.

00:57:55.646 --> 00:57:57.082
If you stop the predator

00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:59.650
going into the boma.
then there is no need

00:57:59.737 --> 00:58:01.565
for retaliatory killing.

00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:03.262
Then they don't need
to go out with a spear.

00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:04.742
They don't need to lay poison.

00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:06.395
They are prepared
to accept living

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:10.748
in proximity...as they
have done for generations.

00:58:10.835 --> 00:58:13.490
[lion grunting]

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:58.491
- For the last fifteen years.

00:58:58.578 --> 00:59:01.625
I've run my own safari
hunting company.

00:59:01.712 --> 00:59:03.714
which is basically
trophy hunting.

00:59:06.586 --> 00:59:08.153
I believe in hunting.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.243
I don't see anything wrong
in shooting an animal.

00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:16.204
I don't necessarily say you
should shoot a trophy animal.

00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:20.078
- [Director] Why are
animals trophies?

00:59:21.253 --> 00:59:25.518
- It's a memento of the
experience of the hunt.

00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:28.173
So you keep something
from your experience.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.959
Because the trophy hunting
fraternity likes to say

00:59:32.046 --> 00:59:34.396
that we're not just
there to kill something.

00:59:34.483 --> 00:59:35.528
it's about the experience.

00:59:35.615 --> 00:59:36.921
It's not about the trophy.

00:59:37.008 --> 00:59:38.705
It's all about being
in the wilderness

00:59:38.792 --> 00:59:40.141
and pursuing something.

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:47.584
In many cases underage animals
will get shot. even females.

00:59:48.715 --> 00:59:50.456
Females are not
allowed to be shot.

00:59:52.284 --> 00:59:56.375
If you do shoot a female. it's
a transgression of the law.

00:59:56.462 --> 01:00:00.248
Certain species are very
susceptible to this. like lion.

01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:02.511
Because in the field.
it's incredibly easy

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.817
to change the rules.

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:09.649
There's no one around for
miles except the game scout.

01:00:09.736 --> 01:00:11.259
who works for me. I pay him.

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:18.266
You'll do a hunt of 10 days.
that's 2.500 dollars you earn.

01:00:20.094 --> 01:00:24.708
$2.500 is a reasonable amount.
I believe. for 10 days.

01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:26.710
Some people don't
think so. so they rely

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:29.147
on a gratuity at the
end of the safari.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:34.979
And so. the client would be.
"Well. why can't I shoot that?"

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:40.593
So. then the professional
hunter starts thinking.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.900
well if I let him shoot it.

01:00:42.987 --> 01:00:44.815
maybe he'll give me
a better gratuity.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:50.516
You've got to weigh up
your ethics and your morals

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:52.344
within an instant in the field.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:56.740
Everyone brands the term.
hunters are conservationists.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:01.527
They are in that sense.
but there's lots of hunters

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:03.398
who don't stick to that.

01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:07.098
And look. mistakes happen.

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:08.839
Lots of mistakes
have happened to me.

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:11.145
If someone tells me. as
a professional hunter.

01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:14.496
they've never made a
mistake. they're lying.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.455
I'd call them a
liar to their face.

01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:18.587
You know things do happen.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.285
[tense music]

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:25.377
Taking a photograph is.
you're just viewing.

01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:27.858
you're not
participating in action.

01:01:27.945 --> 01:01:32.427
And. the act of hunting
is not about killing.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:36.388
It's about that
participation in nature

01:01:36.475 --> 01:01:38.433
and with each individual animal.

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:43.395
We as hunters tout. you know.

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:45.223
"Hunting is conservation.

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:48.705
"It's the best form
of conservation."

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.532
What I've seen in my lifetime

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:54.232
is that our wilderness areas
have just been depleted.

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:00.673
- [Director] So when
you kill an animal.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.283
you don't think it's murder.
you don't think it's--

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:06.026
- I cry. I've hunted
lion. every lion that one

01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:07.854
of my clients has taken. I cry.

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:11.684
Because I. I feel
that it's not right

01:02:13.164 --> 01:02:17.821
to take that animal's life. he
has lived a life like I have.

01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:22.303
[dramatic music]

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.828
When you're hunting antelope.
there's thousands of them.

01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:27.265
So. it's not a big event.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:34.185
The work and effort that goes
into the hunting of a lion

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:37.623
is worthy of the
respect to the animal.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:39.059
For me. it's their life.

01:02:39.146 --> 01:02:40.757
Especially a male lion.

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:44.238
they go through hardships.
they're survivors.

01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:46.893
Because they get
kicked out of the pride

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.983
when they're two or three
years old and they have

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:52.203
to make it on their own.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.946
When you find a male lion
that is past his prime.

01:02:56.033 --> 01:03:00.733
when he is nine. 10 years
old. he has been through

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.782
so much in that span of time.
it's worthy of adoration.

01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:12.310
It sounds stupid
to now go kill him.

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:15.139
but you know. that's
what we have to do.

01:03:15.226 --> 01:03:17.619
That's part of the system.

01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:24.409
The very first elephant
hunt I went on was

01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:28.239
with my stepfather and the
number of elephants he killed

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:31.068
is insignificant to what
other people have done.

01:03:32.243 --> 01:03:34.288
We didn't boast about
shooting elephants.

01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:38.031
Before that. you know.
the great white hunters.

01:03:38.118 --> 01:03:40.773
they were shooting
thousands of elephants.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.428
They'd cut out the tusks
and cut out the heart

01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:45.778
and eat that and move on.

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:52.002
- [Director] Why do people
want to eat the heart?

01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:56.528
- I would not personally
shoot an elephant

01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:57.834
just for its heart.

01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:02.360
But it. you know that's
the best tasting part

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:03.927
of an elephant is the heart.

01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:07.800
But to go and kill an
elephant just to have that.

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:11.630
no. you don't do that. [laughs]

01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:17.810
With an elephant once
it's dead. it's a process.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:19.290
You start butchering
the elephant.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:21.466
Now to cut through
the skin takes.

01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:23.555
maybe two hours to
get the skin off.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.908
When you reach the heart.
it's considered a delicacy.

01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:31.432
so you make a fire.
you cut it open.

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:34.131
and you start cooking
it on the fire.

01:04:34.218 --> 01:04:35.610
And you put a bit of salt on it.

01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:38.962
and you start cutting
little bits off of it

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:42.748
as you're working.
throughout the day.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.322
I wouldn't say I despise

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.019
the trophy hunting
movement entirely.

01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:55.674
because it does
serve some function

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:57.850
to bringing clients to Africa.

01:04:57.937 --> 01:05:01.985
Hunting is not about collecting
as many animals as you can.

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:04.988
getting a gold Super
Bowl-style ring.

01:05:05.075 --> 01:05:07.207
And that is what the
largest hunting club

01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:09.166
in America promotes.

01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:14.867
They want you to shoot as
many animals as you can

01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:17.174
and then you become part
of the inner circle.

01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:18.218
and you get a ring.

01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:23.180
You get numerous
awards before that.

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:29.447
But that is not what
hunting is about.

01:05:32.363 --> 01:05:36.497
The American hunter
thinks my 100.000 dollars

01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:38.978
that I've paid. all of that goes

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:40.806
back into conservation.
it doesn't.

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:44.636
Wow. look at that.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.425
- Oh yeah. we have
boxes and boxes.

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:52.774
- [Director] What are those?

01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:54.080
- These are elephant
hair bracelets.

01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:55.821
- [Director] And
where are they from?

01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:58.302
- They're the hair that comes
from an elephant's tail.

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:02.610
So they used to be very
popular. but I guess nowadays

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:06.179
they're would be a social
issue with wearing them.

01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:11.576
You get about twenty
bracelets from a tail.

01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:15.232
- Just this one bag would
be five or six. right?

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:20.324
Because there's a hundred.
there's 179 bracelets in here.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:22.848
- That's what we see
the most common thing

01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:24.719
on the elephant is
they chop the tusks out

01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:27.679
and take the tail. those
are the two parts they take.

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:31.030
- [Director] How old
is that elephant?

01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:36.993
- An adolescent. maybe
twelve. twelve years.

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:39.517
It's still a baby.

01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:43.434
It's not right.
that they end up.

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:48.091
an elephant ends up for
this. to satisfy some.

01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:51.094
you know. put on
someone's mantelpiece.

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:53.444
That's not what they're.
they're too majestic

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:55.750
and special to end up here.

01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.538
[sighs]

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:04.368
[dramatic music]

01:07:13.986 --> 01:07:16.554
[gun clicking]

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.951
[wings fluttering]

01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:29.784
In terms of trophy hunting.
I don't do that anymore.

01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:31.482
- [Director] But you'll
take people to Africa.

01:07:31.569 --> 01:07:33.745
so. you're like a
middleman for murder.

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:36.313
- Middleman for murder?

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.749
I guess you could
look at it that way.

01:07:37.836 --> 01:07:40.447
that's an extreme
view. though. [laughs]

01:07:40.534 --> 01:07:41.970
Because. what do you call it?

01:07:43.842 --> 01:07:47.976
The. what do you call
it? The abattoir.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.153
murderous chain is
already set up there.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.156
So. rather have a
good guy doing it

01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.723
than a bad guy abusing it.

01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:02.382
In Africa. it's a
different situation

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:06.343
with the trophy hunting because
the animals are utilized.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.301
The finances. the
money that comes in

01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:11.043
from the utilization
of those animals.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.872
gets put back into
conservation...theoretically.

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:17.310
- [Director] But it doesn't.

01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:19.138
Who takes the money?

01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:22.272
- The majority of the money
that is made from trophy hunting

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:27.103
remains within the
government circles.

01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:29.757
I would say. 70% remains

01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:31.933
within the circles
of administration.

01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:41.117
Game numbers are
often fabricated.

01:08:41.204 --> 01:08:44.555
because if you have
high game numbers

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:48.515
it means you can
harvest more. you know.

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:52.215
So. the utilization of the money

01:08:52.302 --> 01:08:57.263
that comes from hunting.
very little filters through

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:02.573
to what it's intended for.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.272
It's intended to make
the communities living

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:11.321
within those hunting areas
benefit: education. medical.

01:09:15.499 --> 01:09:19.590
an upliftment of their lives.
for not utilizing that land.

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:24.377
And secondly. the
conservation of the animals.

01:09:24.464 --> 01:09:26.684
that money is meant to conserve.

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:31.776
- People have become much more
environmentally conscious.

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:33.517
much more green.

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.562
And in particular when
it comes to something

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:39.653
like African wildlife where you
read the shocking statistics

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.178
and people want to do
something about it.

01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:46.269
So. when you're talking
about 75.000 dollars.

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:49.359
for instance to hunt an
elephant. or to hunt a lion.

01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:52.100
or something like that.
most of that money

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.146
is actually going to
the professional hunter.

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:56.540
You've got the person
from the United States.

01:09:56.627 --> 01:09:59.847
often as not. who comes
here to hunt an animal.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:04.287
And he engages a hunting
safari operator here.

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:07.638
a professional hunter. and
the bulk of that money goes

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:11.946
to that individual: the
50. 60. 70.000 dollars.

01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:14.558
And only a small portion
of that actually goes

01:10:14.645 --> 01:10:17.909
to the government in
the form of the license

01:10:17.996 --> 01:10:21.565
that they pay for the
right to kill an animal.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:23.828
So. 4.500 dollars and they share

01:10:23.915 --> 01:10:26.178
that between the
communities in the area

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:30.138
of the hunting concession.
So. it's peanuts.

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:34.665
You're not going to get
hundreds of thousands

01:10:34.752 --> 01:10:36.101
of people coming to hunt.

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.450
You're going to get
hundreds of thousands

01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:40.584
of people coming to
take photographs.

01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:43.848
Two things actually seem
obvious. to me anyway.

01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:45.806
One is that there should
be more of an emphasis

01:10:45.893 --> 01:10:49.854
on photographic safari
tourism and the second

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:52.509
is that they ought
to raise the fee

01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:55.338
that they charge these
hunters to come in

01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:56.817
and hunt an animal.

01:10:58.036 --> 01:10:59.646
So. over the span
of its lifetime.

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:01.866
a lion would generate three
and half million dollars

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:05.348
in photographic safari
tourism revenue.

01:11:05.435 --> 01:11:07.350
An elephant is something
over a million.

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:10.222
But the professional hunters
have to come to terms

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:13.921
with the effects of
poaching on their industry.

01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:16.489
There just aren't that
many animals left anymore.

01:11:18.883 --> 01:11:22.060
- [Director] What was the
impetus to take hunting out

01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:23.627
of the safari business?

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:26.064
- I have to go back
many. many years.

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:28.196
Really. it almost goes
back to my childhood.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.764
I grew up in Africa.
we all hunted.

01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:32.418
it was a thing we just did.

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:35.595
We hunted the Maasai Mara.

01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:38.163
where the Masaai Mara
game reserve is today.

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.992
The climax of the whole safari
was to shoot an elephant.

01:11:42.167 --> 01:11:43.821
I shot the elephant.
the elephant charged.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.563
and the elephant died. literally
within a few feet of me.

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:49.566
When I saw this elephant dead.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:53.091
it was like this horrendous
feeling came over me.

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.527
- [Director] Did you cry?

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:55.659
- I said. "How could
I have done this?"

01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.356
No. I didn't cry. I just felt.

01:11:57.443 --> 01:11:59.489
I just felt shocked. "How
could I have done this?"

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:00.664
Beautiful animal. dead.

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:03.928
There's something about a hunt.

01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:06.409
if you've done it. which
is very. very thrilling.

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:08.367
You can't take the
higher ground here.

01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:10.456
oh. it's just terrible
to hunt. you know?

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:11.762
Why do people hunt?

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:13.111
Why?

01:12:13.198 --> 01:12:14.765
Because it's thrilling.
it's exciting.

01:12:14.852 --> 01:12:17.594
So. I said. "Well how can
I have an exciting feeling

01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:20.074
"about my safaris.
like when I was young?"

01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:22.425
So. I built the first
camp in the world.

01:12:22.512 --> 01:12:24.296
you see all these tented
camps all over the world?

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.819
Mine was the first camp ever.

01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:27.038
- [Director] In Kenya?

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:28.909
- No. in the world.

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:33.349
And so I hit America. in about
1966. or '67. with a slogan:

01:12:34.219 --> 01:12:36.090
Hunt with a camera. not a gun.

01:12:36.177 --> 01:12:38.919
[plane roaring]

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:42.532
[soaring. uplifting music]

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:44.882
I felt like a missionary.

01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:46.971
I came all over saying
"No. don't hunt!"

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:49.974
Have all the thrill of the
hunt. but at the last minute

01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:53.151
instead of going
bang. you'd go pop.

01:12:53.238 --> 01:12:55.022
and you'd have a
lovely picture forever.

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.069
And I used to go and stay
with all the people in Texas

01:12:58.156 --> 01:13:00.463
and they had these huge
trophy rooms and I would say.

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:04.162
"No. this over!" "No. we're
going on our next hunt. Geoff.

01:13:04.249 --> 01:13:05.642
"we're gonna do this.
why don't you come with?"

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:07.644
And I said "No. no. no.
I've got this idea."

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:09.297
And they go. "What the?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.474
"That sounds so pathetic.
that's a girl's thing.

01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:13.998
"Girls do photographs.
men hunt."

01:13:14.085 --> 01:13:16.087
And I said. "No. no
you have it wrong."

01:13:16.174 --> 01:13:17.480
So. what was better?

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.438
To hunt. or to go
into photography?

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:21.571
Everybody ridiculed
it. the answer was.

01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:24.269
"Of course. photography!"

01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:25.966
It was the best thing ever.

01:13:26.053 --> 01:13:27.490
- [Narrator] For
every $1.00 invested

01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:29.796
in protecting elephants
in East Africa.

01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:33.365
they get back $1.78
in tourism revenue.

01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:36.977
- Where are all the guys
who used to go hunting?

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:38.283
Still running around
in their Toyotas.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:40.459
shooting a few
elephant. you know?

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.330
[chain breaking]

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.158
People who hunt always claim

01:13:44.245 --> 01:13:47.248
they're the most knowledgeable
conservationists on earth.

01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:49.381
They say that if
they weren't there.

01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:50.643
what would happen to the land?

01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:52.428
It would just go back to cattle.

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:54.604
They say. "If we weren't
there policing our concession.

01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:58.085
"the poachers would come in
and eradicate all the animals."

01:13:58.172 --> 01:13:59.435
When I was born.

01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:01.480
there were 500.000
lions in Africa.

01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:03.308
I don't know how many there are.

01:14:03.395 --> 01:14:06.006
but we know 36.000 elephants
are being killed every year.

01:14:06.093 --> 01:14:07.225
We know that.

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:08.879
- [Narrator] Just 20.000 lions

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:12.404
remain on the entire
African continent.

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:16.060
The continent of Africa
is as big as China. India.

01:14:16.147 --> 01:14:19.890
the United States and
most of Europe combined.

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:23.328
- So. it's clearly
not sustainable.

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:24.764
if you're gonna be
shooting an animal.

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:27.419
So. how can anybody
look at me and say.

01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:29.377
"I'm a professional hunter

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.249
"and I'm the world's
greatest conservationist."

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:33.556
There's something
missing in their brain.

01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:35.079
And they gotta
wake up. actually.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:37.473
because this is not sustainable.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.344
[birds tweeting]

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:42.260
- Fifty percent of the trophies
go to the United States.

01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:44.349
So. we play a role in this also.

01:14:45.742 --> 01:14:49.920
I guess. I'm. you know.
loathe to put all the blame

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:53.750
on any one country. but
something's got to be done.

01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.931
Our role should be supporting

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.020
what African governments
themselves are doing.

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:08.112
Because if the African people.
and the African governments

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.854
don't want to
preserve the wildlife.

01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:12.769
there's really nothing that
we can do from the outside.

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:15.554
Our job actually is to
convince them that it's

01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:18.688
in their best interest
to preserve these animals

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:19.602
for the future.

01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:25.129
- We cannot tell
local communities.

01:15:25.216 --> 01:15:29.002
"Oh. we feel that in
America or in England.

01:15:29.089 --> 01:15:32.223
"that it's really bad
for them to hunt lions."

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.138
They'll say "Why is it
bad for us to hunt lions?

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:35.792
"They destroy. they destroy.

01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:38.316
"They eat our cattle.
they're a nuisance to us."

01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:40.536
But if you can convince
them. "No. that lion

01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:42.625
"is no longer a nuisance
to you. it's going

01:15:42.712 --> 01:15:44.627
"to bring these
amount of people.

01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:47.630
"Even if it kills a cow
now and again. so what?

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:49.153
"This is what it brings in."

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:53.070
But it has to go to the people.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:55.812
the people have
to get the money.

01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:58.510
[upbeat music]

[Baka women sing]

01:16:19.139 --> 01:16:21.185
[tense music]

01:16:21.272 --> 01:16:24.841
- They did a study of the use
of the forest by Baka people.

01:16:24.928 --> 01:16:29.280
The areas that were most
important to the Baka people

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:32.892
are the areas where the
ape density was greatest.

01:16:32.979 --> 01:16:36.026
So. when traditional
dwelling humans in forests

01:16:36.113 --> 01:16:38.898
share their forests with
apes. even if sometimes apes

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:43.033
are killed. for some special
occasion. the apes do great

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.818
and the forest is healthy
and the people live there.

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:48.212
- [Narrator] The
Baka people have

01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:50.475
over 15 words for elephant.

01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:54.566
- If the argument is
that. we need the wealth

01:16:54.653 --> 01:16:57.264
under the land. the
diamonds. minerals.

01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:59.005
petroleum. and so forth.

01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.833
If you look at the countries.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:04.402
which have the most valuable
of these resources in Africa.

01:17:04.489 --> 01:17:06.447
say. where they've
been exploited already

01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:08.319
for a hundred years or more.

01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:11.235
These are still amongst the
poorest countries in the world.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:14.020
So. it hasn't benefited
the local people.

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.895
It is colonialism to remove
people from their land.

01:17:18.982 --> 01:17:22.855
and it's also racist.
and it's also illegal.

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:27.294
And it's time to respect
the people who have lived

01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:30.515
in these places for.
for essentially forever

01:17:30.602 --> 01:17:32.996
and to accept the fact
that they have rights.

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:36.216
just like we claim
for ourselves.

01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:40.177
In Cameroon there's
still parks being created

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:41.918
and other protected zones.

01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:43.746
Some of them are
for trophy hunting.

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:45.530
So if you pay a lot
of money you can go

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:49.099
and hunt a forest
elephant. for example.

01:17:49.186 --> 01:17:51.971
Although that's actually
an endangered species.

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:55.366
There are areas. which
are adjacent to the parks.

01:17:55.453 --> 01:17:58.282
which are so-called protected.
some are for logging.

01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:00.414
some are for trophy hunting.

01:18:01.589 --> 01:18:05.768
The Baka are evicted
and pushed to the edge

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:07.204
and outside the park.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:10.033
where their society
is entirely smashed.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:14.211
They turn to drink.
there are no jobs.

01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:18.084
It's not as if we're offering
these people an alternative.

01:18:18.171 --> 01:18:19.433
Tribal peoples have lived

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.305
on these lands
essentially forever.

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:26.049
The Baka. so-called pygmies.
they are stewards of the land.

01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:29.661
They know how to look
after it and how to look

01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:31.228
after the animals.
which they use.

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:32.751
including the ones they hunt.

01:18:34.579 --> 01:18:38.496
[speaking in Baka language]

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:03.434
We're stealing their land
in order to set up parks

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:08.482
and to satisfy conservationists
and for tourism.

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:12.051
Lodges are built.
roads are built.

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:15.228
There is often harassment
of the animals.

01:19:19.015 --> 01:19:19.842
And that is actually
extremely dangerous

01:19:21.539 --> 01:19:22.758
because it makes them more
likely to attack people

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:22.932
if people are
outside the vehicles.

01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:30.243
Whereas formerly they
would have just run away

01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:32.028
and avoided people all together.

01:19:32.115 --> 01:19:34.726
so it changes animal behavior.

01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:42.734
There's several layers of this
con trick in conservation.

01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:46.346
One is that these lands are
empty of peoples when in fact.

01:19:46.433 --> 01:19:48.827
they've been emptied
of peoples. forcibly.

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:51.264
often to make the
conservation zones.

01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:56.313
[speaking in Baka language]

01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:05.295
Another is that the outside
conservationists are somehow

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:08.951
or other better at
preserving the environment.

01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:11.257
preserving the eco-diversity.

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:13.129
than the people who live there.

01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:16.784
And actually there's almost
no scientific evidence

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.048
to support that and
the scientific evidence

01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:21.964
is in actually completely
the other direction.

01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:24.792
[dramatic music]

[splashing]
[elephant trumpeting

01:21:29.058 --> 01:21:31.756
- What we need to do is
make sure that businesses

01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:34.324
are doing what people
want and what people want

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:38.458
is to have a world. which is
looking after their interests.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:39.851
is looking after
nature's interests.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:41.679
is looking after
society's interests.

01:21:42.854 --> 01:21:44.508
One of the solutions
that we can bring

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:48.077
into this complex problem
is around natural capital.

01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:52.342
And this model that we used
to have. of cutting it off.

01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:54.910
fencing it off. making
sure that it was protected.

01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:58.348
Conserving. that
word conservation is
about protecting it.

01:21:58.435 --> 01:21:59.610
and making sure
no one goes there.

01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:01.177
That isn't conservation.

01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:03.266
Conservation is making
sure we're understanding

01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:06.922
how dependent we are on it.
the benefits it gives us.

01:22:08.793 --> 01:22:13.537
So. the idea that we should
have control over it.

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:16.540
we should fence it off.
means that we have to keep on

01:22:16.627 --> 01:22:18.237
paying to protect it.

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:20.022
So. we work with the
local people. we work

01:22:20.109 --> 01:22:22.763
with the local animals.
the local species.

01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:24.374
If we can work with them.

01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:27.116
then it ends up becoming
self-sustaining.

01:22:27.203 --> 01:22:30.554
Otherwise we end up having to
pay all the time to protect.

01:22:30.641 --> 01:22:31.990
We have to pay for rangers.

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.818
we have to pay for
protections systems.

01:22:33.905 --> 01:22:36.952
But we can only do that if
we can understand the value

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:38.692
that it's delivering to us.

01:22:38.779 --> 01:22:41.739
Otherwise what is the
cost of doing that?

01:22:41.826 --> 01:22:44.524
How do we fit that
in our conversation?

01:22:45.656 --> 01:22:48.528
[chimp screeching]

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:02.325
- The chimpanzees were really
very helpful in helping me

01:23:03.848 --> 01:23:06.851
to convince. particularly
the scientific community.

01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:09.680
but other people as well.
that we humans are part

01:23:09.767 --> 01:23:12.248
of the animal kingdom.
Because chimpanzees

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:14.163
are our closest
living relatives.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:18.428
And so when you then see
similarities in behavior

01:23:18.515 --> 01:23:20.082
it's pretty easy
for people to say.

01:23:20.169 --> 01:23:23.259
"Well yes. when chimpanzees
kiss and embrace

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:26.479
"and hold hands and
pat one another.

01:23:26.566 --> 01:23:30.614
"they're probably feeling
similar emotions to us."

01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:33.486
When you see a chimpanzee
mother grieving the loss

01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:36.098
of her child. it's
pretty easy to say.

01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:39.536
"Well. the way they feel grief
must be similar to ours."

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.713
- Jane Goodall
described a phenomenon

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.410
that's found in Western
and Central Africa

01:23:44.497 --> 01:23:46.151
called Empty Forest Syndrome.

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:48.588
And it's where the
forest is standing.

01:23:48.675 --> 01:23:51.113
but the wildlife has
largely disappeared.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.853
Why?

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:56.161
And the answer to that is.
through the indiscriminate.

01:23:56.248 --> 01:23:59.773
commercial-scale hunting
of wildlife for bush meat.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:03.081
Wire snares are set to catch.
maybe they're set to catch

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:06.911
small antelopes. but wire
snares will catch anything.

01:24:06.998 --> 01:24:09.653
Any animal that goes in
that will kill itself

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:10.567
in its struggle to escape.

01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:15.050
[gorilla breathing]

01:24:17.748 --> 01:24:19.750
- They've already
got two snares here

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:24.102
where they set their traps
on the routes of the animals

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:25.625
when the animals
are going this way.

01:24:25.712 --> 01:24:27.845
They are going to the water.

01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:30.761
So they merely
locate their snares

01:24:32.023 --> 01:24:33.590
where specifically on
the route of the animals

01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:35.592
where they usually go to water.

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:41.163
- What the poacher will
do. they have a game trail.

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.121
and they set it across
trail like that.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.950
With this end
attached to a tree.

01:24:46.037 --> 01:24:47.691
So the animal will come through.

01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:49.867
they'll be foliage put on
each side to disguise it.

01:24:49.954 --> 01:24:53.436
it puts its head through
and it's just a slipknot.

01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:57.527
And as it goes forward
it just tightens.

01:24:58.789 --> 01:25:00.617
and as it pulls it
just strangles it.

01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:04.838
Sometimes they can take
hours and hours to die.

01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:10.235
- And why are they set?

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:11.889
They're set for bush meat.

01:25:11.976 --> 01:25:14.283
The bush meat is then
sold in commercial centers

01:25:15.719 --> 01:25:18.461
and the people who do the
poaching are making a killing.

01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:20.158
A killing because
they kill the animals.

01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:22.552
But also. they didn't
raise the animal.

01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:25.381
they didn't have it
inoculated. they didn't feed it

01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:26.512
when there was a drought.

01:25:26.599 --> 01:25:28.906
Their cost is simply the piece

01:25:28.993 --> 01:25:32.257
of wire that they probably
stole off someone else's fence

01:25:32.344 --> 01:25:34.825
to kill this particular animal.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.567
And the other thing
is that bush meat

01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:40.700
represents a potential
risk to human populations.

01:25:40.787 --> 01:25:42.702
It could be riddled
with anthrax.

01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:46.053
So. bush meat is a killer.
whichever way you look at it.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.751
[tense music]

01:25:47.838 --> 01:25:50.275
- If the hunting can be
controlled to some extent.

01:25:50.362 --> 01:25:53.148
a lot of these
primate populations

01:25:53.235 --> 01:25:55.106
have a good chance of surviving.

01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:56.716
The big problem now

01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:59.066
is this largely uncontrolled
bush meat hunting.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.112
And it's not a
subsistence issue.

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:06.161
It's really. it's a luxury
trade. where chimp meat

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.381
or gorilla meat or monkey
meat in the capital city

01:26:09.468 --> 01:26:12.428
sells for more than beef or
chicken or fish. in many cases.

01:26:12.515 --> 01:26:16.997
So. it's really.
really hard to control.

01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:20.262
Within remaining forest
areas. the poaching.

01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:22.568
whether it's for hunting
or for wildlife trade.

01:26:22.655 --> 01:26:25.354
it's just eliminating
the vast majority

01:26:25.441 --> 01:26:27.051
of species larger than a rat.

01:26:30.489 --> 01:26:32.274
So. you can go into the
forests in the Amazon

01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:34.101
and you can go into forests.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:36.278
certainly in Central and West
Africa where there's nothing.

01:26:36.365 --> 01:26:38.323
Nice forest. but nothing.

01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:42.849
- [Ian] This is an animated
weather map of rainfall

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:45.504
around the world. the
white is water vapor.

01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:48.115
the orange-y bits are storms.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:50.292
And every day it rains
in the Congo basin.

01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:52.511
so that big pulsing in
the middle of Africa

01:26:52.598 --> 01:26:54.296
is the daily rainfall.

01:26:54.383 --> 01:26:57.342
We're all benefiting from
the ecosystem services

01:26:57.429 --> 01:26:59.866
provided by these
forests in the tropics.

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:03.000
And the animals that
play a keystone role

01:27:03.087 --> 01:27:05.220
in those forests
need our protection

01:27:05.307 --> 01:27:06.917
because we want to continue

01:27:07.004 --> 01:27:10.573
to have this global water
distribution system acting

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:12.183
as sort of a biotic pump.

01:27:14.316 --> 01:27:16.840
- When we started. I was
basically a journalist

01:27:16.927 --> 01:27:18.929
trying to start about
extinction of apes.

01:27:20.583 --> 01:27:23.629
It was very easy to
see the consequences

01:27:23.716 --> 01:27:28.721
of this illegal trade in body
parts of chimps and gorillas

01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:35.119
being sold to the rich and the
powerful in Central Africa.

01:27:36.425 --> 01:27:38.688
It was also very easy
to see that the law

01:27:38.775 --> 01:27:41.343
was never enforced because
those that were actually

01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:43.823
behind those trades are
the same police officers

01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:45.477
and wildlife officers
that were in charge

01:27:45.564 --> 01:27:46.957
of applying the law.

01:27:47.044 --> 01:27:49.873
In fact. it was zero
wildlife prosecutions

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.918
for all the time the
law was in place.

01:27:53.746 --> 01:27:57.010
And I went on research
outside of the capital.

01:27:57.097 --> 01:27:59.012
where people were
telling me straight:

01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:02.538
"Hey. we have chimp meat being
sold here and gorilla's meat

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:05.889
"being sold here. and we
also have two live ones."

01:28:05.976 --> 01:28:07.847
And I said. "What
is this live ones?"

01:28:07.934 --> 01:28:09.632
And these are
basically the survivors

01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.895
of the bush meat trade. the
survivors of the killing

01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:13.157
of their entire family.

01:28:14.811 --> 01:28:17.901
So. a poacher can kill
different family of apes.

01:28:17.988 --> 01:28:19.642
family of chimps. let's say.

01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:22.209
Then he would have a baby chimp.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:25.038
A baby chimp stays on
the back of its mother

01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:27.084
for the first three
years of his life.

01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:31.393
So if the mother falls from
the tree dead. the baby.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.917
dependent. doesn't run
away. he just clings

01:28:34.004 --> 01:28:37.616
to the mother's body
and starts crying.

01:28:37.703 --> 01:28:39.488
Poachers will hold in his hand.

01:28:40.619 --> 01:28:42.491
Maybe he could kill
it for the meat on it.

01:28:42.578 --> 01:28:45.102
and sell the meat.
or maybe he can sell.

01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:47.191
or let's try my luck
in the pet trade.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.414
So. here I was in front of
traffickers who were trying

01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:57.114
to sell me a baby
chimp. abused. tiny.

01:28:57.201 --> 01:29:00.509
one and half years old
baby. about to die.

01:29:01.684 --> 01:29:03.642
I went to the wildlife
station and I said.

01:29:03.729 --> 01:29:05.905
"Listen. apply the law.
there is a baby chimp here

01:29:05.992 --> 01:29:09.344
that can be saved. this
baby chimp can outlive me.

01:29:10.693 --> 01:29:13.957
"So. please let's do something.
let's get the law applied."

01:29:14.044 --> 01:29:16.089
All they wanted was bribes.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.354
I knew I had to do something.

01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:23.227
Because all of this anger
I had against corruption.

01:29:23.314 --> 01:29:26.143
lack of application of
the law. was right now

01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:29.364
in the face of this baby chimp.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.629
The following morning
I took a book of law.

01:29:33.716 --> 01:29:36.240
I went to the big house
of these traffickers.

01:29:36.327 --> 01:29:38.895
and I showed them. three
years imprisonment.

01:29:40.157 --> 01:29:41.854
And they were
totally unimpressed.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:46.119
And I said. "Well. you know I
know this is nothing for you.

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:49.688
because with three dollars
bribe you can get away with it."

01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:52.865
Then I started bluffing them.

01:29:52.952 --> 01:29:55.085
And I said. "I am part of this
huge. big international NGO.

01:29:55.172 --> 01:29:57.696
and we are here to
fight corruption.

01:29:57.783 --> 01:29:59.829
to get the law applied.
that's my new job."

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:01.265
And at that point
they just wanted

01:30:01.352 --> 01:30:03.267
to get rid of the baby chimp.

01:30:03.354 --> 01:30:07.489
I untied him from his ropes.
and I stretched my arms out.

01:30:07.576 --> 01:30:11.144
and he just climbed my body
and gave me one big hug.

01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:17.150
Once I gave him a hug.
he was again transformed.

01:30:18.369 --> 01:30:19.892
back to a baby. a baby
with emotional needs.

01:30:21.981 --> 01:30:25.420
And that hug became
a permanent hug.

01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:28.423
because this baby chimp
basically adopted me.

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.122
[chimp laughing]

01:30:42.828 --> 01:30:45.004
[metal clinking]

01:30:45.091 --> 01:30:47.442
So. I called this
baby chimp 'Future'.

01:30:47.529 --> 01:30:49.226
And I realized at that point.

01:30:49.313 --> 01:30:50.880
that I can actually fight

01:30:50.967 --> 01:30:54.231
not just for a future of
a small. one baby chimp.

01:30:54.318 --> 01:30:55.928
but for the future
of his species.

01:30:56.015 --> 01:30:58.278
We are in the middle of
a fight. a serious fight.

01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:01.412
But I can get a
good night's sleep

01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:04.981
if I know that we got one more
major trafficker behind bars.

01:31:05.068 --> 01:31:06.939
one more official.
corrupt official

01:31:07.026 --> 01:31:08.724
that actually paid
for his crimes.

01:31:15.818 --> 01:31:20.083
- It's commercial gangs.
organized commercial gangs

01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:22.477
of meat poachers.
doing it for profit.

01:31:22.564 --> 01:31:24.479
'cause it's something
for nothing.

01:31:24.566 --> 01:31:26.045
And it's the big cattle barons.

01:31:26.132 --> 01:31:28.526
What you have to remember
about East Africa

01:31:28.613 --> 01:31:30.963
is that it's the Wild West.

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.009
You know. you ever
seen a cowboy movie?

01:31:33.096 --> 01:31:34.793
What's it all about?

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.927
You know. move west. young
man. there's gold down there.

01:31:38.014 --> 01:31:39.972
And in the cowboy
movies you see them.

01:31:40.059 --> 01:31:42.409
With these huge herds of
cattle moving. And in front

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:46.196
of that stock everything had
to go. Native American tribes.

01:31:46.283 --> 01:31:49.765
wild animals. forests. rivers.
whatever. it was destroyed.

01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:51.549
And that's what's
happening to us.

01:31:54.204 --> 01:31:55.292
- So we're protecting gorillas.

01:31:55.379 --> 01:31:56.598
we're protecting elephants.

01:31:56.685 --> 01:31:57.599
we're trying to
protect orangutans.

01:31:57.686 --> 01:31:59.339
But we're losing.

01:31:59.426 --> 01:32:01.516
Because when we raise money
for NGOs. for organizations

01:32:01.603 --> 01:32:03.953
to support the efforts
of government agencies

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.651
that are trying to
protect these forests.

01:32:06.738 --> 01:32:09.436
We're thinking in terms of
tens. or hundreds of thousands.

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:11.656
bigger NGOs maybe low millions.

01:32:11.743 --> 01:32:15.442
At the same time corporations
are spending billions

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:19.316
of dollars to develop
those same lands.

01:32:19.403 --> 01:32:21.623
And the Ministers that
come to our UN meetings

01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:24.887
and sign agreements to protect
apes. are often trumped

01:32:24.974 --> 01:32:27.629
by the more powerful
Ministers of Agriculture

01:32:27.716 --> 01:32:30.153
and Land Development. who
want the mines to develop

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.981
or want the roads to be
put through the forest.

01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:34.940
Even though opening the
forest begins the degradation

01:32:35.027 --> 01:32:37.247
that results in extinction.

01:32:37.334 --> 01:32:40.076
[dramatic music]

01:32:44.428 --> 01:32:46.996
- [Eric] With elephant
tusks and with rhino horns.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:50.869
it's a more complicated issue.
it really is. it's a war.

01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:56.527
A place like Kafue is kind
of ground zero in that war.

01:32:56.614 --> 01:32:59.312
And the only way that
the Zambian government

01:32:59.399 --> 01:33:02.359
is going to win that war
is with help from outside

01:33:02.446 --> 01:33:05.362
and with devoting
more resources itself.

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:10.759
I think it's very positive
that the government

01:33:10.846 --> 01:33:13.762
understands that it has a
crisis and that it needs

01:33:13.849 --> 01:33:15.677
to take drastic
measures to address it.

01:33:15.764 --> 01:33:17.940
And certainly deploying
the Zambian military

01:33:18.027 --> 01:33:21.465
to deal with poaching
would be a drastic measure.

01:33:21.552 --> 01:33:23.772
But it could be that the
situation merits that.

01:33:23.859 --> 01:33:27.776
That it needs to take
such as drastic step.

01:33:28.733 --> 01:33:31.475
[peaceful music]

01:33:45.141 --> 01:33:48.187
- I don't think it's a
question of them not caring

01:33:48.274 --> 01:33:50.189
about the wildlife. I
think it's a question

01:33:50.276 --> 01:33:54.498
of them not knowing what is
going on with their wildlife.

01:33:56.152 --> 01:33:59.634
I'd like to think that as proud
Africans and proud Zambians.

01:33:59.721 --> 01:34:02.158
our life is more
important than money.

01:34:03.942 --> 01:34:06.336
How can we get the
community to be involved

01:34:06.423 --> 01:34:09.992
to benefit from safari hunting?

01:34:10.079 --> 01:34:12.516
So. that they're not
tempted to poach?

01:34:23.048 --> 01:34:28.053
[splashing]
[birds squawking]

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:34.103
We were sitting at the
camp and I was sitting

01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:38.934
near the radio. and a game
scout radioed in to say

01:34:39.021 --> 01:34:44.026
that he heard four shots. and
of course. the game scouts

01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:50.946
were told to go and
investigate what was happening.

01:34:51.033 --> 01:34:53.470
And the game scouts went
and they spent a night

01:34:53.557 --> 01:34:55.124
in the bush and the
following morning

01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:57.300
they found the elephants.

01:34:57.387 --> 01:34:59.824
And it was a long
weekend. so I think

01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:01.826
that was a Sunday when
the shots were heard.

01:35:01.913 --> 01:35:03.523
the four shots were heard.

01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:06.788
And the Monday morning.
the game scouts reported.

01:35:06.875 --> 01:35:09.312
and we heard over the
radio that it was reported

01:35:09.399 --> 01:35:11.967
that they found
three elephant down.

01:35:12.054 --> 01:35:14.317
And so I jumped into my car

01:35:14.404 --> 01:35:16.972
and I followed the
game scouts to go

01:35:17.059 --> 01:35:18.538
and see what was happening.

01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:21.498
And I took the pictures.
and I was so devastated.

01:35:21.585 --> 01:35:22.847
- [Ranger] So this poor thing

01:35:22.934 --> 01:35:25.241
has been suffering
the whole time?

01:35:28.157 --> 01:35:30.812
[flies buzzing]

01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:37.644
[elephant groaning]

01:35:43.825 --> 01:35:45.565
- I was weeping openly.

01:35:45.652 --> 01:35:47.742
The game scouts were horrified.

01:35:47.829 --> 01:35:50.179
I don't think there was not
one person who stood there.

01:35:50.266 --> 01:35:53.530
including the game scouts.
that didn't drop a tear.

01:35:53.617 --> 01:35:55.662
It was beyond everybody.

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.839
It was so. so sad.

01:35:57.926 --> 01:36:00.363
Especially that she
was a lactating mother.

01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:03.192
She was a lactating mother
with two small babies.

01:36:03.279 --> 01:36:05.020
The tusks were barely that size.

01:36:05.107 --> 01:36:08.066
They killed an elephant
that takes a gestation

01:36:08.153 --> 01:36:11.722
of 18 months and in
another eighteen months

01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:13.942
to make a tusk that size.

01:36:14.029 --> 01:36:16.814
Even the game scouts
were devastated.

01:36:16.901 --> 01:36:19.643
[dramatic music]

01:36:22.951 --> 01:36:26.868
- That is actual slaughter of
an elephant that is put down.

01:36:26.955 --> 01:36:30.175
still alive as the tusk
is carved out of its face.

01:36:30.262 --> 01:36:34.136
Purely so that you can
have a trinket. right?

01:36:34.223 --> 01:36:36.355
It's beautiful artwork.

01:36:36.442 --> 01:36:38.749
This craftsmanship is exquisite.

01:36:38.836 --> 01:36:41.665
but they used a critically
endangered species to do it.

01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:49.455
Wildlife crime is a crime
that is very low risk

01:36:50.326 --> 01:36:51.806
and very high monetary value.

01:36:51.893 --> 01:36:53.459
It's currently estimated

01:36:53.546 --> 01:36:56.027
at a nineteen billion
dollar industry. annually.

01:36:56.114 --> 01:36:59.639
And the fact that the
sentence really is just a slap

01:36:59.726 --> 01:37:01.598
on the wrist for people
that are making millions

01:37:01.685 --> 01:37:04.253
and millions of dollars off
of everybody's wildlife.

01:37:07.691 --> 01:37:10.346
- Well. you know. the sad
thing is they will shoot them

01:37:10.433 --> 01:37:13.044
in the knees to slow
them down or to try

01:37:13.131 --> 01:37:14.785
to stop them from charging.

01:37:14.872 --> 01:37:16.831
You know because this. it's
not likely they're gonna

01:37:16.918 --> 01:37:18.658
get this into the brain. but
they can get it into the legs

01:37:18.745 --> 01:37:20.356
to maybe make them stumble.

01:37:20.443 --> 01:37:22.793
fall and not be able to
charge them or trample them.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.316
Because it doesn't take much to.

01:37:24.403 --> 01:37:27.798
you know. what does an
elephant weigh. a ton?

01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:29.147
- Eight.
- Eight tons.

01:37:29.234 --> 01:37:30.801
That thing steps on
you. you're dead.

01:37:30.888 --> 01:37:33.717
So. I would imagine
that's probably with an AK

01:37:33.804 --> 01:37:35.545
that's probably their
best effort is to just try

01:37:35.632 --> 01:37:37.852
to shoot the legs
to get 'em to stop.

01:37:37.939 --> 01:37:41.159
And then I don't. from
what I've heard they

01:37:41.246 --> 01:37:43.640
just go up and they just
basically take a machete

01:37:43.727 --> 01:37:46.295
or chainsaw and it's
like. man. I don't.

01:37:46.382 --> 01:37:47.905
How somebody could do something

01:37:47.992 --> 01:37:50.386
like that I just don't know.

01:37:51.953 --> 01:37:53.389
- [Azad] The
animals being driven

01:37:53.476 --> 01:37:55.826
to extinction
affects everything.

01:37:55.913 --> 01:37:57.654
This is a not an
African problem.

01:37:57.741 --> 01:37:59.874
But everyone says" "Poaching
is a problem for Africa."

01:37:59.961 --> 01:38:01.136
No. it's not.

01:38:01.223 --> 01:38:02.137
No. it's not.

01:38:02.224 --> 01:38:03.312
This affects you.

01:38:06.576 --> 01:38:10.928
- [Jane] The current rate
of killing of elephants

01:38:11.015 --> 01:38:14.627
is actually worse
than in the 1980s.

01:38:14.714 --> 01:38:17.456
because the price
of ivory has soared.

01:38:17.543 --> 01:38:18.849
You know so many elephants.

01:38:18.936 --> 01:38:20.372
they're reckoning one elephant

01:38:20.459 --> 01:38:22.679
every 15 minutes across Africa.

01:38:22.766 --> 01:38:25.464
And this is completely
unsustainable.

01:38:25.551 --> 01:38:27.510
So. that some
populations are already

01:38:27.597 --> 01:38:29.512
on the road to extinction.

01:38:29.599 --> 01:38:34.604
And if we don't stop this
terrible poaching soon.

01:38:35.735 --> 01:38:38.869
we may actually lose
this most extraordinary

01:38:38.956 --> 01:38:41.437
and amazing of land mammals.

01:38:47.095 --> 01:38:50.707
- I think we are coming
to a cultural change here.

01:38:50.794 --> 01:38:54.145
One of those changes
is collaboration.

01:38:54.232 --> 01:38:56.408
What we now need to do
is have a Renaissance

01:38:56.495 --> 01:38:59.237
of bringing people
back together.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:13.251
[laughs]
[speaking Sangho language]

01:39:13.338 --> 01:39:18.169
We are part of a system
here and not just some being

01:39:18.256 --> 01:39:19.866
that can control nature.

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:21.520
We can't control nature.

01:39:21.607 --> 01:39:23.305
We're part of nature.

01:40:35.768 --> 01:40:39.381
[somber. mysterious music]
